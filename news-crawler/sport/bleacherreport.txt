The NBA rookie ladder puts long-term potential aside to determine the best players right now. These rankings are ultimately standings that reflect the Rookie of the Year race.
Markelle Fultz would still go No. 1 in a redraft, but others from his class outperformed him during summer league.
Those who didn't play, specifically Ben Simmons, Frank Ntilikina and Malik Monk, were not deemed eligible.
The rankings took into account production, efficiency, defense and overall impact.

Jonathan Isaac (Orlando Magic, SF/PF)
Isaac would have likely finished top 10 if he didn't hurt his hip in his third game. He went for 15 points and 13 rebounds against the Heat, flashing his unique perimeter skills and defensive versatility. He is a good bet to climb the ladder, assuming he's given a shot to play through mistakes for the weak Orlando Magic.
           
Caleb Swanigan (Portland Trail Blazers, PF/C)
A double-double machine at Purdue, Swanigan averaged one in summer league. At the least, his rebounding and low-post offense should carry over to the regular season.
           
Jordan Bell (Golden State Warriors, PF/C)
Bell created buzz with his 11-rebound, five-assist, five-steal, six-block game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He won't score much this season, but that's not what the Golden State Warriors will ask of him. Bell could give them a defensive specialist and energizer to make reaction plays off the ball.
              
Justin Jackson (Sacramento Kings, SF)
Jackson totaled 54 points between his last two games and gave fans a glimpse of his scoring improvisation and shooting. Like Klay Thompson, he doesn't need many dribbles to put up points.
             
Dwayne Bacon (Charlotte Hornets, SG/SF)
Bacon finished summer league with 29 points against the Orlando Magic. He made an interesting case as a scoring specialist for his ability to create and make shots from all three levels.

Stats (four games): 11.8 points, 3.0 assists, 2.2 steals, 44.4 percent FG, 12.5 percent 3PT
An ankle twist cut De'Aaron Fox's summer league short, but the Sacramento Kings should have seen enough to feel good about their No. 5 overall pick.
Fox's strengths and weaknesses were both evident, with his speed and explosiveness showing on fast breaks and drives, and his jumper missing on 7-of-8 three-point attempts.
Still, flashes of mid-range scoring and shooting were encouraging. And the defensive quickness and playmaking we saw at Kentucky carried over into Las Vegas, where he racked up five steals against the Phoenix Suns and three against the Memphis Grizzlies.
The question moving forward concerns Fox's role following the addition of George Hill, who'll take pressure off the 19-year-old point guard but will likely limit his chances of rising into the rookie ladder's top five.

Stats (five games): 17.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, 42.5 percent FG, 18.8 percent 3PT
After shooting 12-of-35 through two games, Josh Jackson rebounded to shoot 48.8 percent over his final three, looking more confident with his dribble and shot-making. 
He finished summer league averaging 17.4 points, which he generated mostly by attacking off drives and transition, where his athleticism takes over. Jackson also showed he can create off ball screens and separate into pull-up, step-back and fallaway jumpers, though it could take years to become a consistent perimeter scorer.
Jackson shot 3-of-16 from behind the arc and isn't always smooth with his shot-creating or shooting. He'll earn minutes right away in Phoenix for his defensive energy and the versatility to guard multiple positions. And he'll give the Suns an additional offensive weapon to put pressure on the rim. 

Stats (five games): 17.2 points, 2.4 assists, 46.5 percent FG, 47.8 percent 3PT
Luke Kennard only played in the Orlando league, but he was nonetheless impressive, looking just as comfortable scoring as he did at Duke.
He saved his best for last with a 24-point game against the Dallas Mavericks, making 9-of-15 shots and all three of his triples.
Throughout the week, Kennard showcased his crafty offensive skills with tight ball-handling, passing, footwork and difficult shot-making ability. He also canned 47.8 percent of his 23 three-point attempts, drawing attention to his pure stroke and quick release.
Proving he can play adequate defense against NBA wings will be the key to earning consistent rookie minutes, but Kennard looks ready to come off the bench, knock down jumpers and move the ball.

Stats (six games): 20.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 48.4 percent FG, 45 percent 3PT
Kyle Kuzma may have earned himself regular-season minutes by emerging as one of the summer league's top performers.
The momentum he built up at the NBA combine carried over to Las Vegas. Kuzma, who only hit 27 threes (career high) as a junior at Utah, hit 18 through six games for the Los Angeles Lakers. 
Along with a surprising shooting stroke, Kuzma consistently flashed his versatility off transition finishes, post buckets, face-up moves and passes. 
His 7.4 rebounds per 40 minutes were strangely low, but otherwise, Kuzma's offense was as impressive as any big man's in July. He could be the stretch 4 the Lakers have been missing since the start of their rebuild.
Stats (five games): 15.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, 59.3 percent FG
The nation's leader in player efficiency rating at Wake Forest, John Collins finished second among all summer-league participants with a monster 32.5 PER.
Playing just 23.1 minutes per game in Las Vegas, he averaged 15.4 points and 9.2 rebounds on 59.3 percent shooting. Collins had a number of show-stealing dunks that highlighted his Amar'e Stoudemire-like finishing mix of power, explosiveness and coordination.
His athleticism and motor consistently showed around the basket. He also looked confident with his jumper, having knocked down shots around the foul line and even a three after taking just one in two years at Wake Forest.
With plenty of minutes to go around in Atlanta, Collins jumps out as a solid bet to outproduce his draft position as a rookie.

Stats (five games): 20.4 points, 2.6 assists, 4.4 steals, 39.6 percent FG, 31.4 percent 3PT
One of summer league's breakout stars, Donovan Mitchell climbed the rookie ladder with explosive offense and defensive playmaking.
His 37-point outburst against the Memphis Grizzlies was an eye-opener. Athletic, strong and shifty, he demonstrated high-level shot-creating skills with an advanced handle, both as a driver and step-back shooter.
Though erratic from behind the arc, he still sunk three triples in three different games, leaving little question about his shot-making ability.
It was ultimately the 4.4 steals per game that helped him leapfrog Josh Jackson and De'Aaron Fox on the board. Mitchell applied pressure and forced turnovers with his signature aggression and competitiveness. 

Stats (three games): 16.0 points, 2.3 assists, 40.9 percent FG, 37.5 percent 3PT
Markelle Fultz gave Philadelphia 76ers fans a taste of his smooth, effortless scoring before suffering a summer league-ending ankle injury in his third game.
He flashed the handles and footwork behind his advanced shot-creation highlighted by step-backs, pull-ups and fallaways. We saw his razor-sharp skill level on soft floaters and off-hand finishes, as well as his shooting range with six combined threes against the Utah Jazz and Boston Celtics. 
Fultz went for 17 points in the opener and followed with 23 points and five assists.
He took too many tough shots, resulting in a disappointing field-goal percentage. But the sample size of action was too small to nitpick. Fultz appears on track toward becoming the Sixers' next cornerstone and All-Star guard.

Stats (six games): 18.2 points, 8.8 rebounds, 44.6 percent FG, 33.3 percent 3PT
Jayson Tatum looked as ready for the regular season as any rookie in summer league.
It wasn't just the consistent production, though he did finish in double figures every game and hit the 20-point mark in three of them. Tatum's skills and polish stood out most. He put on a shot-creating and shot-making clinic and established himself as a go-to isolation option. 
Tatum hit off-balance, contested jumpers throughout his time in Orlando and Las Vegas. He also converted a number of tough finishes off drives that showcased his handle and body control. 
He only totaled nine assists in 194 minutes, and given the Boston Celtics' loaded roster and limited available minutes, he'll likely slip down the ladder once the regular season starts. But Tatum's scoring ability is ahead of every other rookie forward's.

Stats (six games): 17.3 points, 4.2 assists, 2.2 steals, 45.7 percent FG, 34.6 percent 3PT
The uptempo summer-league setting appeared better suited for Dennis Smith Jr., who was up and down at North Carolina State without ideal spacing or support.
He looked comfortable in Las Vegas, getting to any spot he wanted by changing speeds and direction.
His explosiveness showed on exciting finishes at the rim, both above and below it. Smith was also proficient around the perimeter with his off-the-dribble shooting. Once his confidence started pumping, he showed he can make jumper after jumper and score in bunches.
We didn't see many signs of hero ball or over-dribbling, and if there was a takeaway about his playmaking, it was that Smith seemed more than willing to pass and prioritize his teammates.
Expected to run the show in Dallas right away, Smith has emerged as a dark-horse Rookie of the Year pick.

Stats (six games): 16.3 points, 9.3 assists, 38.2 percent FG, 23.8 percent 3PT
Lonzo Ball's signature floor game and vision were on display throughout the Los Angeles Lakers' run in Las Vegas.
He consistently got teammates quality looks in transition with deep, on-the-money assists, a number of which traveled the length of the floor. His unselfishness was contagious and inspired others to move the ball and make the extra pass.
The highlight of Ball's summer league came against Philadelphia 76ers, when he carried the Lakers back and led them to a win with 36 points. He also triple-doubled twice and still managed to average 16.3 points despite converting just 10-of-42 three-point attempts.
He may not score as much as Dennis Smith Jr. or Markelle Fultz, but all signs point to Ball's leadership and basketball IQ immediately enhancing L.A.'s offense and shot selection.

LeBron may not be long for The Land. According to various reports, James is frustrated with how the Cleveland Cavaliers have handled the offseason. James apparently expected the Cavs to be aggressive and acquire players who would help his team overcome the Golden State Warriors, their foe in an NBA Finals rivalry that looks destined to repeat for a fourth straight summer. Instead, Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert tore apart his team’s front office and presumably began penning his next Comic Sans communique.
When James left for Miami in 2010, Cleveland fans took to the streets and burned his jersey in effigy. When he returned to Cleveland in 2014, many of those same fans rejoiced. When he ended the city’s pitiful 52-year pro sports championship drought in 2016, they all celebrated.
To some Cavaliers fans, James has fulfilled his duty and can leave again as a free agent next summer. But, of course, some people just want to watch the jerseys burn. Below, we assess (on a scale from one to five Burning James Jerseys) how angry Cavs fans would be based on possible new courts for the King.

The Process has left Philadelphia with two important potential factors in luring LeBron: Ben Simmons and a ton of cap space in 2018. James and Simmons have a photographically proven friendship, and they're both represented by Klutch Sports. Moving to Philadelphia could give James the opportunity to take Simmons under his wing and declare a future megastar his protege.
But more importantly, the 76ers again opted to build through the draft this offseason and declined to sign any large multiyear contracts for free agents. They will have plenty of money to throw at James next summer, and the rumor mill is already running rampant.
The only thing unclear in this hypothetical world is how Sam Hinkie truthers would be able to credit their savior for signing LeBron two years after being fired, but smart money says they’d find a way.

There is a spirited competition among NBA franchises for the title of "most dysfunctional," but Cleveland and New York are among the front-runners. If the root of James’ discontent is truly Cleveland’s lackluster offseason, then it would be beyond bizarre for Cavs fans to watch him depart for James Dolan’s franchise. It's also unclear if the current Knicks front office has carried over the same "no posse" rules from Phil Jackson's tenure.
If Carmelo Anthony is already on another team (like, say, the Houston Rockets) by that time, the move makes even less sense. Then again, nothing in Knickland ever makes sense. Sure, Cavs fans would burn LeBron’s jerseys if he went to New York, but not out of hatred; it would be out of a resigned realization that life is random and meaningless.

One thing left unsaid so far is that it would clearly be worse for Cavs fans to watch James leave for another team in the East than the West (with one notable exception). And although divisions don’t really matter in the NBA, it would be weird for James to move to another Central team.
It would be especially painful for longtime Cleveland fans to see him in Chicago, which, with the help of a guy named Michael Jordan, eliminated the Cavs from the playoffs four times from 1988 to 1993.
Going to Jordan’s city would possibly reunite James and Dwyane Wade (who is an unrestricted free agent next summer but would presumably stay to play with his close friend), but it would also be an unbelievably bold move for James. The King has struggled to escape the shadow of His Airness, and here he would have to change his jersey number—the Bulls have already retired Jordan's No. 23. Would guiding the Bulls to an NBA title for the first time since Jordan help James' legacy?

Can you imagine James announcing on television that he is taking his talents back to Miami? Sitting in the same director’s chair, in that same button-up shirt, using the Heat to burn Cleveland once again? The internet would break.
It would also cause Cavaliers fans some serious PTDSD (post-The Decision stress disorder). Wade is an unrestricted free agent in 2018, and the two could decide to go back to where they won a pair of championships together.
It seems unlikely they would return given the erosion in their relationships with Heat boss Pat Riley, but maybe he could convince them—and a third star—to revisit the good vibes of South Beach. Of course, only one other move on this list would be as detrimental to LeBron’s legacy, so it seems highly unlikely right now.

The Adrian Wojnarowski report that initially ignited these James rumors specifically cited the Lakers as one of the superstar’s desired destinations. And through some creative—nay, Magic—maneuvering during this year’s NBA draft, the Lakers have plenty of cap room to bring in a superstar like LeBron James or Paul George.
James already has a home in Los Angeles, and he appears to be interested in Hollywood as a post-basketball career path. This earns extra burning jerseys because it seems like the most realistic landing spot for LeBron, and he would probably be able to do something in L.A. that he hasn’t been able to do in Cleveland—attract other big-name free agents.

LeBron James joining the Celtics seems like way more than just a long shot.
First of all, there's no way James—who has gone to great lengths to preserve his hairline—would want to be compared to Gordon Hayward's salon-quality 'do on a nightly basis.
More importantly, leaving Cleveland for Boston would be at least as bad as—if not worse than—leaving for Miami in 2010. James would immediately make the Cavs’ main Eastern Conference rival a championship contender.
Seeing what the brilliant basketball mind of Brad Stevens would do with the greatest player in the universe would be fun to watch, but does the world really need more Boston sports titles? Regardless, this hypothetical move gets four burning jerseys because it would lead to the most righteous outrage among Cavaliers fans—with one exception...

Forget the logistics for now and just for a moment imagine James joining the Warriors.
Among the many ramifications, the entire NBA season—not just the regular season, but also the playoffs and even the Finals—would be meaningless.
There’d be no reason to watch other than to see how many points the Warriors were crushing their opponents by each night. The columns written in print and online and the arguments shouted on television would make the "Kevin Durant is a sellout" takes look like polite discourse by comparison.
And then add the logistical element: Essentially, the only way for the Warriors to sign James would be for him to agree to play for the veteran’s minimum. Imagine watching your hometown hero leave for your fiercest rival and then dominate the NBA for years to come. 
There would be no LeBron James Cavaliers jerseys left in the world.

O.J. Simpson is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the College Football Hall of Fame and the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame. He's one of seven NFL players to break 2,000 rushing yards in a season and was the first to reach that milestone (in 1973). That year, he averaged 143.1 rushing yards per game, the highest single-season average in NFL history.
But when you visit the Buffalo Bills online shop, you can't buy an O.J. Simpson jersey despite the fact he achieved these feats while playing for the Bills—who drafted him No. 1 overall and with whom he spent nine of his 11 pro seasons.
Simpson, who was acquitted of double murder in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, is now up for parole nine years into a 33-year sentence for a Las Vegas-area robbery and kidnapping. Simpson's fame outside of football, and more importantly his exhaustively documented murder trial, mean that for most people born after he stopped playing in 1979, his record-setting career is reduced to "retired football player" (and the way the Kardashians first got famous).

In Buffalo, though, shades of Simpson's stardom remain. "He's forever tied to this city," says Paul Peck, who's been a sportscaster in Buffalo for almost 30 years, including 24 as the Bills reporter for the city's WIVB-TV. "The team didn't have a huge amount of success, and then suddenly the biggest star in the NFL and, you could argue, in all of sports was a Buffalo Bills player—he put us on the map."
When Simpson was arrested in 1994, it had been 17 years since he'd left Buffalo, but the coverage still felt personal. "He was certainly one of the icons of Buffalo sports history, but all that's been tarnished based on what's happened since," says Chuck Frawley, the treasurer of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.
"The association with O.J. started to feel like a black mark on the city—people were angry," Peck adds regarding the reaction to Simpson's murder trial. "When someone makes a comment about the team, people perceive that as a comment about Buffalo. It shouldn't be that way, but it is."

A reminder of how fraught the O.J.-Buffalo relationship became arrived via the most unlikely of means—Bills second-round draft pick Zay Jones wore a shirt on draft night that riffed on Simpson's infamous 1994 police chase (the shirt has since sold out), and, unsurprisingly, the image of him getting a call from the Bills went viral.
"I actually just found it in a local store here. I thought it was pretty cool." Jones told The John Murphy Show a few days after the draft. "It was probably not the best thing to do. ... In no way was I trying to mock or to mimic that event. ... People attacked me for it, but that's OK."
"It got a lot of play here," Peck says of Jones' draft night attire. "People were like, 'What the hell was he wearing that for? What's he trying to say?'"
For his part, Jones told Murphy that he had no indication he would be draft by Buffalo.
The question of how exactly to approach Simpson's legacy on an institutional level still comes up in Buffalo.
"From time to time, people will ask, 'Have you thought about taking him out?' and, to be honest, it is something we've talked about," Frawley said of Simpson's place in the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.
Simpson was in the organization's inaugural class in 1991.

"We're not going to take him out, but we do tend to downplay the fact that he's in our Hall of Fame," Frawley says. "Would we take [his criminal record] into consideration if he were somebody that were up for induction now? Probably, but he wasn't convicted...it's a tough call."
"Should he still be on the Wall of Fame at the Bills stadium?" Peck adds. "That's been a topic of discussion—'He embarrassed our city; his name should come off.' It never did, and I think that's fair. He's on there for what he accomplished as a football player."
Instead, the team functionally ignores Simpson's history in Buffalo except when absolutely necessary in citing team statistics.
"If they want to talk about Bills history, it usually starts with the Super Bowl run (1990 to 1993) and the fact that there are six or seven Hall of Famers from those teams," Peck says. "It's very easy to spin the narrative a little bit away from O.J., to sort of brush it under the rug."

"It's not something that they highlight in games or when talking about their past," says Frawley, a season ticket holder. "That's why it was interesting to see some of those highlights from the 30 for 30.
"I hadn't seen much of him running the ball in a very long time."

#FireGarPax Billboard is up! https://t.co/KjLIrZlnBD
Chicago Bulls fans don't waste much time.
After the team dealt Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Bulls subreddit users decided to protest the front office with a billboard.
Less than a month ago, user bshendy wrote the post that got this thing rolling (warning: link contains NSFW language). They created a GoFundMe page that allowed users to donate money toward a message against executives John Paxson and Gar Forman (aka GarPax) in Chicago.
The page lists $8,327 in donations, and the billboard went up on Wednesday.
It uses the hashtag #FireGarPax and notes that Bulls fans are "no longer seeing red." It also points out that the message was made possible by Bulls fans worldwide.

Ben Simmons took a page out of Joel Embiid’s book on Tuesday.
Out of nowhere, the Philadelphia 76ers rookie guard tweeted the notorious eyes emoji at LeBron James’ Twitter account as speculation mounts that he could leave the Cleveland Cavaliers next summer.

Someone in Philly is trying to get rid of a 'life sized Joel Embiid balloon animal' on Craigslist 😂😂 https://t.co/Gwf6AyjM0M
Before seeing this image, it'd be hard to imagine a balloon sculpture looking anything like Philadelphia 76ers big man Joel Embiid.
But it's actually pretty good.
The "life-sized" balloon creation was listed on Craigslist a month ago in the Philly area; the "prodigy" behind it is looking to make a trade for tools, not money.
Giant Embiid replicas aren't the person's only specialty. In the listing, they wrote that they once left a five-foot tall T-Rex sculpture "in the first unlocked car I could find and I still laugh about it every day."
Sounds reasonable.

No one has created more buzz in the Las Vegas Summer League than Lonzo Ball of the Los Angeles Lakers and Dennis Smith Jr. of the Dallas Mavericks.
They squared off on Sunday night with a spot in the championship on the line.
Ball's been talked-about for months. His father, LaVar, his younger brothers dominating high school hoops for Chino Hills, the growth of the controversial Big Baller Brand and its even more controversial sneakers—you've heard most of it by now. But the 19-year-old's play has backed up all the talk.
Triple-Doubles at Las Vegas Summer League over the last decade
-- Lakers' Lonzo Ball: 2
-- All other players combined: 0 https://t.co/Mi8sEWfpfz
A pair of triple-doubles after a rough start has turned heads, with L.A.'s ball movement humming as Ball spreads it around. Heading into Sunday, he averaged 16.4 points, 9.2 assists and 8.4 rebounds while struggling to find his shot, converting 35.4 percent of his attempts from the field and 20.5 percent from deep.
Team president Magic Johnson has raved about him, telling Lakers fans they're "in for a treat":

Smith has been more of a breakout star, having slipped to ninth in the draft due to concerns over his "intangibles." This summer has silenced the naysayers. Before facing off against Lonzo, Smith averaged 16.6 points, 4.3 assists, 5.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists on 43.9 percent shooting.
He's also shown off Slam Dunk Contest-worthy bounce:

His latest aerial feat came against the Lakers:

#NBASummer https://t.co/79yfkceOry
On Sunday, Lonzo got the better of DSJ for most of the night, dropping 16 points, 10 assists and no turnovers while sitting on a 22-point halftime lead. A calf injury sidelined him for most of the second half, though. Despite a ferocious fourth-quarter push from Dallas, the Lakers won 108-98.
Los Angeles moves on to face the Portland Trail Blazers, who defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 87-82, for the LVSL crown on Monday. You can find viewing information and a game preview below.

Preview

Heading into Sunday, there was some concern Ball and breakout forward Kyle Kuzma would get pulled due to fatigue. Coach Jud Buechler shut that down, per Harrison Faigen of Silver Screen and Roll:
"They're young kids. The coaches keep telling me to take them out and I just go 'no, they're going to stay in, they're 20 years old. They're fine. Are you kidding me? They're going all the way. Those are our guys. Absolutely they're going to play. They're young. I think they're enjoying the winning."
Ball and Kuzma certainly didn't look fatigued on Sunday, combining for 25 points 9-of-14 shooting while carrying Los Angeles to a 62-40 halftime lead. But the injury bug reared its ugly head.
Things went downhill when Ball exited the contest in the third quarter with a calf injury. He returned but wasn't himself, finishing with 16 points and 10 dimes.
Lonzo Ball headed toward locker room with Lakers training staff, getting his right calf checked.
Portland presents a unique challenge for L.A., especially down low. Caleb Swanigan, drafted 26th overall out of Purdue, is a load on the block. Lakers center Ivica Zubac hasn't shown much ability to slow opposing bigs, so Swanigan should have one of his stronger statistical games. He put up 15 points on 7-of-19 shooting to go along with 11 rebounds against Memphis.

Before running into the Blazers, the Grizzlies had an ideal summer league. Experienced players like Wayne Selden and Wade Baldwin IV carried the team, averaging a respective 24.6 and 15.8 points ahead of Sunday. Baldwin, an explosive second-year guard out of Vanderbilt, chipped in 7.4 boards, a monumental improvement from his regular-season average of 1.4. His lanky frame should allow him to hit the glass harder than he did, and he's proving capable of doing so.
Baldwin and Selden both came up small in the loss, but second-round rookie guard Dillon Brooks continued flashing potential. He led Memphis with 16 points on 7-of-12 shooting in the semifinals loss.

The Blazers had five players reach double figures against Memphis, but so did Los Angeles. And the Lakers' output was more impressive, being that Ball, the catalyst of the run-and-gun offense, was banged up.
The versatile Kuzma went for 24, including five triples, for his third straight 20-point effort. The No. 27 pick out of Utah has been basically unstoppable in Las Vegas, leading Ball to question the teams who passed on him Saturday night:
Lonzo on Kuzma getting drafted 27th: "What were they thinking? Trippin."

Rare LaVar-type moment (at least w/media) for No. 2. #Lakers https://t.co/I8eSzqeRxK
For what it's worth, Ball told reporters he will "hopefully" be able to suit up tomorrow, per Sports Illustrated's Ben Golliver:
Lakers' Lonzo Ball, w/ ice packs on both legs, said right calf is "tight still" but "hopefully I'm ready to go" in Monday final vs. Blazers https://t.co/k3RCJVKixI
If Lonzo does play, expect the Lakers to take home the trophy. The team is just too dynamic with him running the show. Portland's goal should be to slow the game to a crawl, but even then, the Lakers might just outgun the Blazers.
Oh, and brace for "this isn't the only championship we're winning" talk from LaVar. You know that's coming.
Marcell Ozuna is no stranger to robbing home runs at Marlins Park.
On Sunday, the Miami left fielder climbed the wall after Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Enrique Hernandez belted one deep in the top of the sixth inning.
Ozuna's impressive poise on the fence kept Miami from falling further behind, as the Dodgers led 3-1.

In the top of the fourth inning against the Seattle Mariners on Sunday, Chicago White Sox pitcher Derek Holland caught a bullet off the bat of Robinson Cano.
The second baseman slowed to a jog after Holland snared the chopper behind his back, but the 30-year-old couldn't cleanly get the ball out of his glove.
So, he just threw the glove.
First baseman Jose Abreu was baffled by the move, but the ball was jammed in there, so Holland's unconventional toss was necessary. He asked for another glove after the play.

CJ McCollum apparently wants Carmelo Anthony on the Portland Trail Blazers.
On Sunday, the Portland shooting guard posted a Photoshopped image of Melo rocking a Trail Blazers jersey.
Earlier in the day, ESPN.com's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Rip City was only interested in acquiring Melo and did not want to help him move to the Houston Rockets or elsewhere by taking part in a three-way trade.
Here's Woj:
"Portland believes the addition of a player such as Anthony would furnish it with talent and depth comparable to those of the top Western Conference contenders, except for the Golden State Warriors, league sources said. Because of that, the Blazers have little, if any, inclination to facilitate an Anthony deal that would land him with a Western Conference rival such as Houston, league sources said."
Per Wojnarowski, Anthony is willing to waive his no-trade clause if the Knicks can land him in Houston or alongside LeBron James on the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The 10-time All-Star is expecting to be traded to Houston to play with James Harden and Chris Paul, according to Wojnarowski.

Alex Smith's clutch rating just went up.
At the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship on Friday, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback noticed a couple of Oakland Raiders fans having a hard time. He stepped in to help, with the gentleman in the wheelchair unaware he was being assisted by a Pro Bowl quarterback.
@TanyaMurrayInLA @ACChampionship Yeah, he came out of no where. My dad didn't even know who was pushing him till they made it to the top   Very cool
Smith is likely to begin the 2017 NFL season as the Chiefs' starter, though Kansas City traded up to select Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes with the No. 10 pick in April's draft.

LaVar Ball responds to Joel Embiid's fine from the NBA: "When you working for somebody, shut your mouth." https://t.co/HrsD0RKXxn
LaVar Ball is ready to extend his verbal war with Joel Embiid.
After the Philadelphia 76ers big man got fined for saying "f--k LaVar Ball" on Instagram Live, Lonzo's father celebrated the fact that he can't get fined.
"He gets fined every time he says a cuss word," the Big Baller told ESPN.com's Jovan Buha. "Like I said, his vocabulary is limited. I bet you he can't say 'F you' more than I can say it to him—'cause his ass will be broke. When you're working for somebody, shut your mouth."
Embiid was fined $10,000 but didn't seem to mind a whole lot, telling Variety he was glad he said it.

Zac Alsop is an evil genius.
On Friday, the YouTuber and sports fan documented his journey at the final leg of Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s worldwide press tour in London.
Alsop created two fake credentials—one media, one promoter—with Photoshop and tagged along with various crews to sneak past Wembley Stadium security. He eventually rubbed shoulders with UFC President Dana White and other bigwigs.
In fact, Alsop got so far in that he actually walked out with McGregor's crew.
Alsop has been known to pull these stunts. Last summer, he crashed a Team Great Britain Olympics parade disguised as an athlete.

Chicago Cubs fans apparently value memorabilia over dollar signs.
According to ESPN.com’s David Purdum, over 30 percent of bets placed on the Chicago Cubs to win last year’s World Series were not cashed in by the May deadline. While most of the bets were small, Las Vegas ended up saving more than $100,000 in payouts.
Many fans are believed to be keeping the tickets as a souvenir, though a manager at the Golden Nugget said they’d "be happy to make a copy of it."
Per Purdum, one fan explained why he was hanging onto his $10 bet.
"Between ticket stubs, W towels, a lucky penny I picked up when I landed in Cleveland for Game 6 and the winning bet from Vegas, I'm gonna do something really cool with all the mementos," 32-year-old Brian Glickman said. "I'm not cashing it."

During an episode of Jeopardy! this week, one contestant guessed that Chicago Cubs Hall of Fame center fielder Hack Wilson belted 191 home runs in 1930.

TNT analyst Charles Barkley has been rough on the Golden State Warriors.
After winning two NBA titles in three years, Warriors star Stephen Curry revealed Thursday how he'd like to get payback on the 54-year-old.
It all started when Steph was asked a peculiar question involving Aaron Rodgers, Justin Timberlake and Sir Charles ahead of the American Century Championship, which begins Friday.
When asked to pick one to caddie, one to play with and one to do the Carlton with, Curry said, per ASAP Sports (via For The Win): "I would put Chuck on the bag. He's talked a lot of smack about me and the Warriors in years. So I would load up my bag with some bricks pre-round and definitely put him through that torture for four hours."
Curry added that there is no bad blood between the two:
"No, it's all TV. He's a great personality and knows how to get a headline. And sometimes you don't know if he's being real or not.
But every time I seen him off the grid, he's been great to my family, to me as well. So I take everything he says, literally everything he says, with a grain of salt. But he's a legend. And it's great for the game, obviously, with how much basketball is talked about and the hot takes that are flying around from day to day."

Here's the $1 million penalty that will haunt Karen forever. #Argos #Bombers #CFL https://t.co/Djwxg0Acht
On Thursday night in the Canadian Football League, Martese Jackson of the Toronto Argonauts took a kickoff to the house for the game's second return touchdown, effectively putting $1,000,000 into Karen Kuldys' pockets.
And then came the flag.
A blocking penalty 25 yards from the end zone negated what would've netted Kuldys' family a huge prize in the Safeway/Sobeys $1,000,000 Touchdown To Win contest.
According to Devin Heroux of CBC Sports, Kuldys didn’t realize what was at stake; she initially thought the touchdown served as an entry into the contest.
"My heart just sank and I thought, 'Oh my God, how close could I get to one million dollars,'" she said. "You got to be kidding me. My stomach is in knots just thinking about it right now."

The Oklahoma City Thunder are already starting their recruiting pitch to the newly acquired Paul George.
Two years after denying Dion Waiters' request to wear James Harden's old number, the Thunder awarded it to PG-13. It was almost a necessity due to that very nickname.

Harden was traded to Houston in 2012. Waiters was acquired by Oklahoma City in 2015.
George, who can opt out of his contract after this upcoming season, has reportedly expressed interest in joining the Los Angeles Lakers next summer. 
However, the team's doing its best to prevent that. OKC fans are getting in on the recruiting effort, too:

Got 43 minutes to spare? Here's a LaMelo Ball highlight package for the ages.
The guard from Chino Hills, California, has become arguably the most widely known high school player in the country—and his family's theatrics aren't the sole reason.
As a sophomore, the baby of the Ball family dropped 92 points in a single game and casually buried bombs from midcourt. This highlight reel includes other aspects of Melo's game, including a smooth floater and underrated handle.
It's only scoring, though. Per BallerVisions, a passing mix is coming soon.
LaMelo is already committed to the UCLA Bruins. ESPN ranks him No. 8 in the class of 2019, while Scout.com has him 23rd.

Nothing is ever truly hidden on the internet.
Last weekend, Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman direct-messaged a fan who was lamenting the missed chance to trade the 23-year-old to the Chicago White Sox in the offseason for ace Chris Sale.
Bregman wasn't tagged in any of the posts—meaning he sought them out on his own—and, for as dark as many fans can get online, these tweets were downright cordial:
@BenOndaTop @iBrand0n300 Bregman being centerpiece saves you Tucker or Fisher or both. Compared to both being in a deal possibly. With Marwin getting more ABs
But good thing we have Bregman. Jesus https://t.co/3qo6WTdnXo
The fan, user @AllenH83, tweeted the screenshots, which featured Bregman questioning his baseball knowledge and calling him a flea "on the nutsack of society."
Well, to say I received some odd DMs tonight is an understatement haha. At least I know I have a no trade clause now. https://t.co/qeUeKMogsd
Bregman has since deleted his entire account.

Kodak moment 📸 #ASG https://t.co/3qoNZQ5hzp
Sometimes, you just need to capture the moment.
In the top of the sixth inning of Tuesday night's MLB All-Star Game, Seattle Mariners designated hitter Nelson Cruz whipped out his phone and asked catcher Yadier Molina to snap a photo of him and umpire Joe West.
The ump was understandably confused, but it made for an amusing moment in the midst of a pitchers' duel.
"Ay Joe, what's your Insta handle? Wanna be sure I tag you."

@ncboomstick23 just wanted a quick picture. 📸 https://t.co/DI5hzeRZx3
Molina belted a home run to center field in the bottom half of the inning to tie things at 1:
Every time a player has taken an in-game picture of an opponent and an umpire, he's homered the next time up. That's just science.

Dak Prescott gets it.
This weekend, the Dallas Cowboys' star quarterback took some time to meet with the family of William Durr, a Mississippi police offer killed in a May shooting. 
It was a surprise for 10-year-old Nash Durr, William's son, who was told they were going to a botanical garden. The family supports Mississippi State, Dak's alma mater, so they're fans of the 23-year-old quarterback, who became a star in Dallas following Tony Romo's injury last year. 
Therese Apel of the Clarion-Ledger wrote about Prescott's encounter with the family: 
Nash and his family posed for pictures with his sports hero. The family said that while their hearts are still broken over the loss of William Durr, Prescott's kindness to take some time out for them brought them a little happiness.
Prescott, who lost his mother during his career at MSU, seemed to reflect a little of Durr's personality as well—the deputy was known for taking his time to interact with young people.

Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians is a quarterback guru.
The 64-year-old has worked with Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger, Andrew Luck, Carson Palmer and others during his NFL career, so he's as qualified as anyone to talk about coaching QBs.
In his new book, The Quarterback Whisperer: How to Build an Elite NFL Quarterback, which was written with B/R's Lars Anderson and hits shelves July 11, Arians recalls a young Manning asking out of a blowout.
With the Indianapolis Colts well behind the New England Patriots, Arians, who was then the Colts' quarterbacks coach, called out the franchise player—and it worked (h/t Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk).
"Midway through the fourth quarter of the game, with the outcome already decided, Peyton was so frustrated that he asked for mercy. He wanted to be pulled from the game."
"'F--k no, get back in there,' I told him. 'We'll go no-huddle and maybe you'll learn something. You can never ask to come out. You're our leader. Act like it.'"
Arians then describes what happened next as a "sight to behold," with Manning leading a late drive that ended in a touchdown pass. Arians saw the drive give Manning a "shot of confidence."
Anyone who saw Arians on Amazon's All or Nothing series last summer knows he often uses, uh, colorful language. But it's always about the football player, not the person.
It seems like that approach worked with Manning, who went on to become an all-time great.

New York Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius went around the Big Apple doing good deeds in a campaign for All-Star votes.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old swiped New Yorkers onto the subway, handed out umbrellas, took pictures, made a burrito bowl and hopped on a tour, all with the Midsummer Classic in mind.

As part of the MLB's Final Vote system, any tweet that featured #SirDidi4Sure counted as a vote. The Yankees team account got in on the action, too, but Kansas City Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas beat out Gregorius and others.
.@DidiG18 - you're an All-Star to us. Thank you again to all the fans &amp; friends from around the globe that voted these last few days! https://t.co/u198g3gudO
According to James Miller of the New York Daily News, the Final Vote "allows fans to cast ballots online at MLB.com or team websites, text-message entry and—on the final day of voting—social media voting via Twitter, to elect one player from each league to the season’s annual All-Star game."
If he got in, Sir Didi would've joined Bombers teammates Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, Dellin Betances, Luis Severino and Starlin Castro.

Good Morning, everyone https://t.co/KBnmhxBdTe
On Thursday night, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski and Ian Begley reported the New York Knicks agreed to a four-year, $71 million offer sheet with Atlanta Hawks restricted free-agent guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
The Knicks drafted THJ in 2013 before trading him for the No. 19 pick, Jerian Grant, two years later. That didn’t work out. 
On Friday, the New York Daily News was ready to roast.
The tabloid—known for clever wordplay, like "Karma's a witch" when Phil Jackson got fired—went with "Holy sheet!"
Well put.
offering Tim Hardaway Jr. $71 million is one hell of an encore to giving Joakim Noah $72.6 million
[Twitter]

Oklahoma City Thunder forward Andre Roberson agreed to a new three-year, $30 million deal Wednesday night, as reported by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Hours later, per TMZ, he got called out for leaving a $14 tip on a bill close to $500 at the Chupacabra Cantina in Austin, Texas.
Roberson defended himself, responding to the Twitter user who posted the receipt and telling him he'd understand the gripes if it were a club: 
@FlyDre21 get paid 30 million for 3 years and tips this!!! Your trash!!! https://t.co/OSONPSBSUA
@DavidRo74294058 Shouldn't have had to tip you it was just a bottle at a bar ...there was no service ..now I can see if it was a club! You Reaching bro
The 25-year-old lockdown defender actually tipped more than he intended to, as the total he put down was $500 even:  
@FlyDre21 @DavidRo74294058 Ayy @FlyDre21 you actually overpaid him $1.10 go get your money back bro 😂😂😂 https://t.co/aKe8cAZ1mU
Roberson eventually moved on and tweeted to Thunder teammates Steven Adams and Enes Kanter:  
In other news! Where is @Enes_Kanter &amp; @RealStevenAdams these days hope your doing good brodies!!!
Update: Adams and Kanter both responded on Thursday night, and it's possible Roberson now regrets his earlier tweet: 
@FlyDre21 @Enes_Kanter We just out here tipping more than $13 
😂🤙🤙🤙
@RealStevenAdams @FlyDre21 Hahaha oh no!! Don't do that to him like that plz 😂😂

First player to hit 2 HR off Madison Bumgarner in same inning? 

That would be @Dodgers prospect @8Peters: https://t.co/nZIxdstXRj https://t.co/PPuu0LqW5C
Los Angeles Dodgers Class A Advanced prospect DJ Peters had Madison Bumgarner's number Wednesday night. 
In the fourth inning of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes' 14-1 beatdown of the San Jose Giants, the outfielder went yard twice against one of MLB's top pitchers, who's rehabbing from a dirt bike accident in April. No one had ever taken MadBum deep twice in the same inning before. 
Peters embraced the moment but didn't let it get to his head, as he told Michael Leboff of MiLB.com (h/t MLB.com's Mike Rosenbaum): 
"First off, it's Madison Bumgarner and he's one of the best pitchers of the game. He's a three-time World Series champion and basically single-handedly won the Giants the World Series in 2014. Whenever you face a guy like that, you want to enjoy the moment and gauge the situation you're in and the atmosphere. My whole mindset was to just have fun because I got to face one of the best pitchers in the game of baseball."
According to Henry Schulman and John Shea of the San Francisco Chronicle, Bumgarner is on pace to return by July 15.

Even at 4'9", four-time Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles can dunk a basketball.
Sort of. 
On Wednesday, the 20-year-old joined Hammer Harrison as an honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters. She worked on some fancy ball-handling in a custom uniform before dunking off a springboard.
Then Biles turned the tables. 
After playing along as a Globetrotter, she put Harrison to the test with a series of gymnastics. He held his own. 

"I would give him a 10," Biles said. "I was actually really impressed. I think he could be on an Olympic team."
When spinning a ball gets added to the games as a sport, count the Globetrotters in.

Over the weekend, Sergio Roque reeled in a 964-pound tiger shark during a Texas City fishing tournament.
According to ABC 13, the gigantic catch took three hours and several people to wrangle on a nearly sinking boat.
"It's the hardest fight I've ever had in my life, the strongest one," Roque said. "When I first set the hook, and it pulled me straight across the back of the boat, pulled me straight to the corner and slammed my knees onto it."
The state record for a tiger shark is 1,129 pounds, but Roque’s catch placed first in the 55th Annual Tackle Time Fishing Tournament, which provides scholarships in the Independent School District.

Alligators seem to be the most common animal sightings when it comes to golf courses. Last week, a Swedish golfer had a different experience, as seen in this video posted by Tony Swahn.
He not only saw a moose; he was chased by one.
The gangly animal looked thrown off by the bag of clubs and then turned its attention toward the player. The golfer seemed amused until the moose started booking.
He got away, thankfully, and the moose wandered off, possibly to chase other golfers.

DeMar DeRozan repping the North with the first-ever NBA 2K Canadian cover https://t.co/3c1lGPGOe7
Kyrie Irving is the cover athlete for NBA 2K18, but not in Canada. That honor belongs to Toronto Raptors shooting guard DeMar DeRozan.
The 27-year-old All-Star found out about the Canadian cover in the middle of the regular season and was blown away.
"I remember being a kid, creating a player in the video game, and being excited just doing that," DeRozan told theScore's Joseph Casciaro. "The next thing was being in the college basketball game, and then the next thing, being in the NBA game. Seeing your face, seeing yourself evolve in the game, and looking even more real, to hearing your voice in the game, to now, being on the cover. It's something that's extremely awesome and definitely mind-blowing."
DeRozan averaged a career-high 27.3 points in 2016-17, leading Toronto to the playoffs for the fourth straight season.
The game will hit stores September 19.

The Utah Jazz Twitter account posted what appeared to be a peculiar response to Gordon Hayward's decision to join the Boston Celtics. 
Hayward's tweet went live at 8:48 p.m. ET, and Utah's post—an uncaptioned picture of big man Rudy Gobert—was published almost simultaneously. The time stamp listed on the Gobert picture was actually one minute prior to Hayward's announcement via the Players' Tribune.
Thank You, Utah. https://t.co/ICfocNeZfW
Here's the Gobert one:

Most fans took the photo as a way of saying, "This is our franchise player now." Utah deleted the picture in minutes and followed up with a message from team ownership:

Big Baller Brand celebrated July 4 by releasing three new colorways of Lonzo Ball’s first signature shoe, the ZO2.
The red, white and blue kicks all sell for $495—and $695 for sizes 14 and 15—and will ship on Nov. 24, per the Big Baller Brand website.
According to BBB, the Independence Day collection is available for a "very limited time," which makes sense given the holiday theme.
The original ZO2s are no longer listed for preorder, but the Los Angeles Lakers-themed Sho'Time! kicks, released on draft night, still are.
Update: Tuesday, July 4 at 8:40 p.m. ET
LaVar and Lonzo took to social media after the announcement. The head of the Ball household encouraged true Ballers to get all three colors:

The beef with Nathan's is still fresh.
Takeru Kobayashi—arguably the greatest professional eater of all time, a man whose records include eating 62 slices of pizza in 12 minutes and 13 grilled cheese sandwiches in one minute, a man whose uniquely positioned stomach and innovative nature allowed him to double the previous Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest record of 25 in his first try—is again not involved in America's most famous eating competition.
A six-time champion of the event, Kobayashi, now 39, is still embroiled in contract disputes with Major League Eating, and he subsequently hasn't competed in the Coney Island Independence Day tradition since 2009. And while there are many other high-profile contests for competitive eaters in countries with much more interest in the sport than the United States, Kobi's perpetual absence from the Nathan's stage continues to be felt.

After all, Kobayashi wasn't just competitive eating's Michael Jordan. As Major League Eating president Rich Shea said to ESPN's Darren Rovell in 2007, "To associate Michael Jordan with Kobayashi is a slight against Kobayashi."
Today, Kobayashi lives in New York, so we decided to have "The Tsunami" swing by our Bleacher Report offices to dish on what he's eating these days, if retirement is on the horizon and whether he—a man whose authority in this matter surpasses almost anyone's—thinks a hot dog is a sandwich.
A photo posted by Takeru Kobayashi 小林尊 (@kobayashitakeru)
Bleacher Report: What eating records that you hold are you most proud of?
Takeru Kobayashi: This is a difficult question. It's really personal opinion, but I'd like to say it's cow brains. Because I hate cow brains! [Ed. Note: Kobayashi ate 57 cow brains in 15 minutes.] That tasted awful and it looked, you know, gross. [Laughs.] The smell is so bad! It had been so long from when they prepared it for the competition. The more time that goes by, it gets stinky.
And actually, it's not my opinion, but many people say the most important record is 50 hot dogs. Because I doubled the record and I changed their market. I agree with that idea, too.
A photo posted by Takeru Kobayashi 小林尊 (@kobayashitakeru)
B/R: You've discussed the process of rethinking how eating was done, thinking of it more as a sport. How do you think that applies to your life overall? Do you look at everything as a problem that can be solved differently?
Kobayashi: I'm always like that about everything. When I try to do something, I always think, "What is the best way to do this?" Instead of taking what everyone else says and how it has been forever, it's faster for me to try myself. Of course I listen to what everybody says, and at first I'll try what people say, but I always come back to [trying it my way.]
  
B/R: Do you still watch the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest?
Kobayashi: [Laughs.] Not at all.

B/R: Have you ever had any contact with Joey Chestnut since then?
Kobayashi: No, because I don't have his phone number or email address. About four years ago, I was working with a hot dog company, and the CEO [said] something to Joey Chestnut and Joey Chestnut got angry and he said something back about me on Twitter, so I blocked him. [Laughs.]
I didn't want to talk with him that way. People may think, "Competitive eaters are so childish!"
B/R: What did you think of people playing into the USA vs. Japan stuff with you and Chestnut?
Kobayashi: [I've been] living in New York City almost seven years, and my mentality has changed a lot. Just from being in New York this long and going across America, I realize that in New York, nobody really cares. They are just like, "We're New Yorkers." I feel like that is really the way it should be.
I don't like competing in front of people saying "U-S-A! U-S-A!" to me—I live here!
B/R: You told Sports Illustrated last year you cared less about beating Joey Chestnut's record because he was beaten by Matt Stonie. With Chestnut winning last year, do you want to beat him again, or are you satisfied?
Kobayashi: I'm not really interested in anyone's record or anyone—I'm always fighting with myself. I always try to do my best. I'm not really interested in Nathan's. Last year, ESPN 30 for 30 wanted to have us rematch, but I asked them to make MLE get out of the competition. "If you can do that, I'm happy to compete with him." But they couldn't, because Nathan's has a three-year contract with MLE. So I said no.

B/R: Things like esports and drone racing are growing. How does competitive eating grow again?
Kobayashi: If we have big sponsors and if they have huge prize money, many great eaters would come. Maybe they should make teams.
B/R: That's really clever, because the sports I mentioned are both team-based. Drone racing and esports both have teams.
Kobayashi: Each of the eaters has their own speciality. Someone has huge stomach capacity, someone can eat fast, someone is good at eating meat, someone loves sweets. [Laughs.]
B/R: Do you still work out?
Kobayashi: I used to work out really hard. But I quit. [Laughs.] I was about 200 pounds. Now I'm 135 pounds. I lost a lot of muscles. I got arthritis from the bars. I actually have jaw arthritis.
A photo posted by Takeru Kobayashi 小林尊 (@kobayashitakeru)
B/R: When you aren't eating, what are you doing? What are your hobbies?
Kobayashi: I like dogs. I really love dogs. I used to have a beagle and a miniature [wiener] dog. [Laughs.] 
B/R: Obviously style is one, too.
Kobayashi: I think many people think competitive eating is a really disgusting sport, so people think they look bad normally. But I care about what I'm wearing. I don't want to be someone who is doing something that is considered gross and then also look like a slob.
If we did have a competitive eating league or teams like we talked about, they would need to look good for it to be [marketable]. Think about basketball, they all wear nice sneakers. Packaging has everything to do with the market.
B/R: If you weren't eating, what other sport would you be playing?
Kobayashi: Baseball. I used to play baseball in high school. I [once] threw a first pitch 87 mph.

B/R: Is a hot dog a sandwich?
Kobayashi: No! No. You have to have a lot of respect for hot dogs. It's completely different.
First of all, the hot dog is American. Sandwiches are not American. They're different. Second of all, a hot dog is like a pop idol. Hot dogs are cute. It's a pop image—everyone knows what a hot dog is.
B/R: Have you given any thought to retirement?
Kobayashi: Not really soon, but I'm thinking about it. With my talent for being able to eat as an athlete, I'm just looking to use that talent in other fields now. What can I do with that talent besides just competing?
Just a taste of what is to come.

Fireworks ensued.
In the midst of a 30-point performance, the Toronto Raptors star put the pride of Sierra Canyon School on the floor with a series of fakes and crossovers, scored, then threw the ball to him as he returned to his feet.
Bagley didn't get showed up, though. The 6'11" forward dropped 32 points against grown-man competition.
At one point, he blew past DeRozan on the wing and hammered a vicious two-handed dunk over the help defender.

.@kobebryant has the PERFECT philosophy on participation trophies https://t.co/JQNab5im1U
Kobe Bryant isn't big on participation trophies.
Shocker, huh?
During a Facebook Live session with Al Michaels and Janet Evans to announce his involvement in Los Angeles' 2024 Olympics bid, the Black Mamba told a story about his daughters receiving fourth-place trophies in a basketball tournament.
Welcome to the team!

#LA2024 is excited to add @kobebryant to the Board of Directors, and as the 100th Athletes' Advisory Commission member https://t.co/6o39U16CAj
The Lakers legend said they were disappointed and didn’t want the token awards. Bryant went into #MambaMentality dad-mode and told them how to use the trophies as motivation.
"I said, 'Well, listen, get the fourth-place trophy, go home. You take the fourth-place trophy, you put it up right where you can see it. And when you wake up in the morning, you look at the trophy and you remind yourself of what you'll never win again.'"
Kobe chimed in on Twitter, preaching the value of losing:

In April, Odell Beckham Jr. showed off a leg tattoo of late pop icon Michael Jackson. He’s since added to it.
After getting some still-undisclosed ink on (or at least near) his rear end, the New York Giants superstar wide receiver showed off new tats of rapper Lil Wayne and late reggae singer Bob Marley along with Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield this weekend. The boxers appear to be framed by a Sports Illustrated cover.
This combination on music and the sweet science seems to be a theme. Beckham also has tattoos that feature the late Tupac and Muhammad Ali (look closely):

Manny Pacquiao lost his WBO welterweight title to Jeff Horn in controversial fashion Saturday.
By the numbers, the 38-year-old appeared to dominate the fight, via ESPN Stats & Info:
Final punch statistics favored Manny Pacquiao, but Jeff Horn won WBO welterweight championship #PacquiaoHorn https://t.co/ZxMIeH88hU

Retired NFL cornerback Deion Sanders praised Pacquiao for his composure following the loss:

In perhaps the biggest indictment of the unanimous-decision outcome, three-time world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis said he couldn't see how the Pac-Man was defeated "by any stretch:"

My brother just came back from a mission trip to Nicaragua from Miami to Boston and Hayward was on the flight! Here's a picture with them! https://t.co/rvyvFMED9f
Late Saturday night, Twitter user John Habershaw shared a photo of his brother, who had just gotten off a flight from Miami to Boston. Joining him was Celtics head coach Brad Stevens and free-agent forward Gordon Hayward.
Cue the eyes emojis.
Hayward was scheduled to meet with Boston on Sunday after he heard—and looked at—the Miami Heat's recruiting pitch Saturday, so seeing the ex-Butler Bulldogs together wasn't shocking.
Meeting Hayward at the airport was a shrewd move by Stevens, though, as it gave him more time with his former player.
Update: Sunday, July 2, at 11:05 a.m. ET
The Celtics are taking Hayward and his family on a tour of Boston.
Of course, that includes a stop at Fenway Park:
Gordon Hayward's tour of Boston sounds like it has begun. Celtics brass and Isaiah Thomas spotted at Fenway Park.

Iron sharpens iron.
On Thursday, Denver Broncos star linebacker Von Miller hosted a "Pass Rush Summit" at Stanford with fellow quarterback hunters Shane Ray, DeMarcus Ware, Khalil Mack, Vic Beasley, Malik Jackson, Solomon Thomas, Cassius Marsh, Cliff Avril and others. 
Miller has been planning this event for a while. He told ESPN's Vaughn McClure in January that he planned on bringing in Beasley, the Atlanta Falcons breakout star who led the NFL in sacks, and the NFL's best.
"A sack is a sack. I'm going to get sacks, they're going to get sacks," Miller told Nicki Jhabvala of the Denver Post. "You really can't stop that. You really benefit more from really just sharing that knowledge and just trying to be the best players that you can possibly be." 
Here's a look at the event:

😂😂😂 bust potential goes automatically up 50% when you're from Europe. https://t.co/TWUUJeMY54
Players drafted from overseas are often viewed as more volatile than players coming out of college in the United States.
New York Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina is the latest example.
Before getting selected with the No. 8 overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft on Thursday night at the Barclays Center, the 18-year-old was given a 59 percent chance to bust, according to ESPN's metrics. That was the highest of any player projected in the lottery.       
Utah Jazz big man Rudy Gobert—who is also French—wasn't a fan. The center joked that "bust potential goes automatically up 50% when you're from Europe."

The 2017 NBA offseason has been wilder than most, and this past week had everything: Phil Jackson looked to trade away all the New York Knicks with talent, Danny Ainge gobbled up first-round picks like mini M&M's, the Cavs went rogue and hit the NBA draft GM-free, and so much more.
In this rapid-paced world of the modern NBA, it can be hard to keep up with everything at once. Here's what all went down this week, from the things that don't really matter to the ones that absolutely do.

Much like the generation of kids who only know Adam Sandler as the leading characters from Jack and Jill, there's an entire crop of NBA fans who only think of Dwight Howard as that dude who makes poop jokes at the dinner table and is a nonfactor on the court despite being built like an 18-wheeler.
How soon we forget, or choose to ignore, Howard's initial tenure with the Orlando Magic—specifically his 2009 Eastern Conference Finals performance against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The dude averaged 25.8 points, 13.0 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game in that series while shooting 65 percent from the field and 70 percent—yes, 70—from the free-throw line. That's outrageous.
Howard's career has plummeted since he awkwardly forced his way out of Orlando in the summer of 2012, so much so that his unexpected trade from the Atlanta Hawks to the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday was met with a collective "uh, OK?"
NBA reporters cared so little about the move that one of them referred to Charlotte as the Bobcats and didn't even delete the tweet.
Howard isn't as bad as you think he is, despite the Hornets' being his fourth team in six seasons, but he’s having another rough summer. My man went on The Jump during the NBA Finals to announce he'd been honing his three-point shot, and the Atlanta Hawks were seemingly like, "Oh God! We've got to get rid of him immediately."
What once would have been considered a blockbuster is nothing more than a ripple in the news cycle.

Setting: conference room, near midnight. Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey leans back in a large leather chair with the phrase "Live By the 3 or Die" engraved into the back. The phone rings. It's the Los Angeles Clippers on the other line.
"Hello? Yeah, you've got Daryl. Yes, I'd like your entire team. OK. Call me back and let me know."
Of all the rumors flying around NBA Twitter this week, the Houston Rockets' interest in seemingly every single free agent available is the most fun. The Rockets reportedly want Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Kyle Lowry, Paul Millsap, both of Nikola Jokic's brothers, LeBron James Jr. and a lifetime supply of Laffy Taffy.
They will inevitably end up with none of these things, a la their pursuit of Chris Bosh a few years ago, and they will instead sign JJ Redick to a 10-year contract.

Boston Celtics general manager Danny Ainge has more first-round picks than artwork in his home. Boston currently owns seven first-rounders between now and 2019 after Ainge traded away the No. 1 pick in this year's draft to Philadelphia earlier this week.
Ainge has developed a bit of a reputation as a pick hoarder in recent years, refusing to part with any of them when the Celtics had a chance to trade for Paul George near the trade deadline last season. Philly turned the Celtics' No. 1 pick into Washington's Markelle Fultz, who most experts agree is the real deal.
If Fultz turns out to be a stud and the Celtics whiff on securing a superstar to push them into the stratosphere with the Cavs, Ainge's hoarding will be all for naught, and he would have handed a division rival the final piece to its superstar puzzle.

Joel Embiid has only been in the United States since he was 16, and he's already better at Twitter than 95 percent of its users. The 76ers big man strengthened his grip on the social media Hall of Fame when he used his Twitter fingers to both flame Phil Jackson and recruit Kristaps Porzingis to Philly in 140 characters:
"We don't care about Exit meetings in Philly... you're welcome to join"
If that wasn't enough, he went after the most famous basketball family of 2017 during their biggest moment. Responding to 76ers teammate Ben Simmons' writing "Crazy pills" while Lonzo and LaVar Ball were on screen during the NBA draft, Embiid wrote:
"Please dunk on him so hard that his daddy runs on the court to save him.."
Embiid should be allowed to tweet from the bench next season.

In 2017, you can measure the importance of any single event in LeBron James' life by the pristineness of his ever-evolving hairline. If it's a Tuesday night during the regular season and the Cavs are taking on the Brooklyn Nets, LeBron's hairline usually looks like the middle of high tide, when you can still see slivers of the beach but most of it's gone.
LeBron doesn't care about that game. It's not on national television, and, well, it's the Nets.
But when LeBron deeply cares about something, like he did his acting debut in 2015's Trainwreck, his hairline is immaculate, as if we should be laughed at for thinking it was receding in the first place.
That's an exhausting balance to maintain, and a few days after losing to the Golden State Warriors in five games in the 2017 NBA Finals, LeBron finally said "enough" and shaved his head. In a video posted to his Instagram account, one of the first after lifting his "Zero Dark Thirty-23" social media blackout, LeBron can be found rocking out to Tee Grizzley in the weight room, his almost-bald noggin shining front and center.
LeBron hasn't joined the Bald Brotherhood quite yet—there are still some hair follicles kicking it up there—but he's closer to embracing it than ever before.

The man called his shot forever ago. His son is on the Los Angeles Lakers, and after the team traded D'Angelo Russell to the opposite end of the country, Lonzo Ball doesn't even have to worry about competition for the lead guard spot.
LaVar Ball went counter to every major sneaker company, created his own company and got possibly millions of dollars worth of free advertising this week. He made himself a household name, and his family name a brand name. He told his son to not work out for any team but the Lakers—shunning all 29 other teams—and guess what? Lonzo's on the Lakers.
Is LaVar Ball a genius? With the streak he's on, who among us is in a position to say he's not?

Things were all good just a week ago. Sure, the Cavs couldn't repeat as champs as Kevin Durant tore them limb from limb in the Finals, but it seemed like general manager David Griffin had a plan. Rumors started flying that Griffin was going to find a way to flip Kevin Love into Paul George or Jimmy Butler as the Cavs prepared to hit the Golden State Warriors with the ultimate countermove.
But Griffin's contract was set to expire in two weeks, and the architect behind the Cavs' championship roster in 2016 was being paid an embarrassingly low $2 million per year. Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, who apparently decided that squashing his beef with LeBron was the last good thing he ever wanted to do, didn't feel like spending any more coin on Griffin (the dude probably dreams of the luxury tax every night, he's so far up in it), so he let him walk, two days before the 2017 NBA draft.
Gilbert has reportedly offered the job to Chauncey Billups, but the former Detroit Pistons star has yet to accept the offer. That means the Cavs went without a general manager during the NBA draft.
LeBron is media subtweeting Gilbert over it, there are rumors that he'll bounce to L.A., Kyrie Irving is possibly eyeing an exit and our pets' heads are falling off! Who knew a team with such a talented roster and one year removed from a 'ship could still be in such disrepair?

Phil Jackson's reign as president of the New York Knicks has gone about as well as Theon Greyjoy's sacking of Winterfell. He won't let go of the triangle offense like some sort of jilted ex-lover. He's openly feuding with Carmelo Anthony. And now he seems hell-bent on shipping off the only good thing left in Madison Square Garden: Kristaps Porzingis.
Jackson lucked into the 7-foot Latvian in the 2015 NBA draft (Jackson told the New York Post a scout convinced him to draft Porzingis) and has been doing his best to alienate the future of the franchise ever since. With the Knicks in disarray after another, uh, "lackluster" season, Porzingis skipped his exit interview with Jackson, which Jackson apparently equates to someone slapping his mother. Now he's calmly and callously admitting the team could possibly trade what should be the cornerstone of the franchise.
"As much as we love this guy, we have to do what's best for our club," Jackson told MSG Networks this week with a straight face.
Knicks fans gotta take Jackson to an indoor zen garden and lock him in there forever before the Knicks are nothing but smoldering ash.

For all the rumors about Jimmy Butler ending up in Cleveland to play with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, the Minnesota Timberwolves were always a dark horse for the star shooting guard's services. In the middle of the first round of the 2017 NBA draft, the dark horse won.
The Wolves sent Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and the rights to Lauri Markkanen, who the Wolves took at No. 7, to Chicago for Butler and the 16th overall pick. Dunn struggled as a rookie, and LaVine is coming off ACL surgery. Meanwhile, Minnesota gets to pair a top-15 player with Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Ricky Rubio.
While we don't know how thrilled Butler is to reunite with Tom Thibodeau, who will almost certainly play him 47 minutes a night, we do know the Bulls got their lunch money taken. That's all you're getting for Jimmy Buckets? Woof.

NEW YORK — There was much adjusting of bowties during the first-ever NBA draft red carpet, as the next generation of star hoopers flooded the suddenly glamorous Barclays Center lobby on Thursday. For most of the young players, it was their first red carpet and thus first time dressing for public consumption, and overall, they did an outstanding job.
Just about everyone sported well-fitting suits in festive colors accessorized with I’m-about-to-get-paid smiles—but some had a little more swag than others. Go-to NBA outfitters Jhoanna Alba, Clarence Jones and, yes, J.C. Penney had a presence on the carpet, but it was the wild cards that kept things interesting.
So who looked the best? Check out B/R’s re-draft of the top 20 by style talent to find out which rookie literally looked like a No. 1 pick. Only 14 made the cut, making this B/R's style talent lottery picks. 

The Louboutin high tops and checked suit are both OK individually, but together they are a little confusing. Taking risks is good, but risks don’t always pay off.

The night’s only knit tie is an instructive addition. An underutilized red-carpet asset.

A little color, straightforward fit—Jackson looks great, but it’s missing that attention-grabbing oomph. Yes, we see the blinding Rolex.

Leather tie + sunglasses + Las Vegas-themed shoes and jacket lining = valiant fashion risk that comes across as mid-aughts indie band member. But the creativity shows promise!

A classic, well-fitted three-piece look. Not going to set the roof on fire, but Adebayo looks quite dapper.

“Not impressed by the bowtie, but I do give him kudos for trying,” says NFL and NBA stylist Dex Robinson (Kam Chancellor, Kyle Lowry, DeMarcus Cousins) of Fultz’s eclectic outfit—the bowtie is of a wicker-esque material, and his shoes are literally made of basketball leather. “The color palette and fit of this look doesn't work for me."
But literal basketball shoes! Bonus points for effort.

Another suit by CJ, another example of fun colors in Patton’s two favorites—orange and navy blue. “Gotta look pretty,” says Patton, who styled himself. A Cartier watch rounds out the look.

It’s a night to celebrate and have fun, and no player embodies that more than Mitchell—he integrated his school, Louisville, into his tie color, his shirt (which bore an embroidered logo) and his socks. Mitchell was dressed by CJ Custom Clothiers and says his grey pinstripe helps “bring out the inner baseball player.” The NBA is about personality, and Mitchell’s look shows that he has it in spades.

"I wish I could redo prom, because this would be my jacket—I love it!” Robinson says. It’s all about Smith’s bold, textured, double-breasted(!) coat, designed by Jhoanna Alba. “It was just super comfortable and fit my personality,” Smith adds. Can’t argue with that—plus, he says he could even play in it.

Monk was also dressed by J.C. Penney, but in blue—”I didn't want to go all Kentucky blue, but I had to represent a little bit here,” Monk says. “I tried to be different.” Louboutins complete the look (though he admits, there’s no way he could hit the hardwood in them). “This is most definitely in my top five tonight,” Robinson adds. “Not a lot of noise, but you can still hear what he is trying to say style-wise.”

TJ puts a colorful twist on a classic silhouette with his all-blue three-piece suit from Elevee. “It’s a little bold; I like it,” Leaf says. The perfect way for the UCLA player to step out of Lonzo’s shadow.

Red tartan is not a look for the faint of heart, but the NBA’s latest French import pulls it off with style—custom-made, naturally, in his native Strasbourg. “We tried to get something where the color was right for me,” Ntilikina says. The bowtie is patterned too, because go big or go home.

Dressed by J.C. Penney, Fox could have easily had a forgettable look. But the night’s only purple jacket and some flashy loafers keep him on the fashion forward side. "De’Aaron’s look is extremely balanced and well-executed,” Robinson says. “Kept it clean at top and added some excitement with the shoes!"

Yes, it’s a Big Baller Brand suit (spot the three Bs on the bowtie), and yes it’s all-black and shiny and three pieces on the first day of summer. But it fits like a glove, and Ball’s Versace loafers add the perfect amount of texture. “I keep it subtle, keep it simple,” Ball says. “My dad had no input—if he did, there would probably be Bs all over this, you know?”

Houston Rockets guards Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams have been named as trade pieces as the team looks to land a star, according to ESPN's Marc Stein:
Free Agency Scuttle: Houston is making Ryan Anderson/Lou Williams/Patrick Beverley available via trade to create summer spending flexibility
Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap and Kyle Lowry ... four free agents Houston, according to league sources, plans to pursue in July,
Shortly after Stein tweeted about Houston's plans, Sweet Lou took to his Twitter account:
Uh Oh lol
Beverley did the same, reacting to Williams' tweet with what came across as sarcastic amusement (note the period; he means business):
Lol. https://t.co/XzO6Os0w0W
It must be strange for players to read about their futures at the same time fans do. Dwight Howard experienced that sensation Tuesday night as he was traded to Charlotte.

Ohio State Buckeyes fan Ty Higgins lives next to a big Michigan Wolverines fan who asked the OSU grad to watch over his place while he's away this week.
Higgins decided to "spruce it up a bit" by mowing a giant "Ohio" into the guy's lawn.
As noted by Evan Jankens of CBS Detroit, it's the same style that the Buckeyes band forms during games.
Here's hoping Higgins' neighbor is a good sport...and that he records his revenge.

KD takes out a full page ad in the SF Chronicle to say Thank You. https://t.co/6MJse6vuCk
Just over a week after winning his first NBA title, Kevin Durant took out a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle to thank the Golden State Warriors and their fans.
KD praised his Dubs teammates, coaches, ownership, staff, front office and fans "for making my initial season with the Warriors an incredible and exhilarating championship experience."
The 2017 Finals MVP plans to decline his player option for next season but will re-sign with Golden State, according to ESPN.com's Chris Haynes.

De'Aaron Fox's nickname, "@swipathefox," is inspired by his basketball skills...and Dora the Explorer. #NBADraft https://t.co/29RjMClOk8
De'Aaron Fox's nickname is "Swipa."
The connection—a nod to Swiper the Fox from the popular children's show Dora the Explorer—seemed too good to be true.
You know, this guy:
On Monday night, the NBA lottery-bound guard confirmed to Jeff Eisenband of ThePostGame that the origin of the moniker is, in fact, Nickelodeon.
Fox began by saying that when he was in fourth or fifth grade, he used to get a lot of on-ball steals (shocking, right?): "One of my friend's dad just started calling me Swipa—you know, Swiper the Fox from Dora," Fox continued. "It just kind of stuck. And I liked it, everybody likes the tag, so I just ran with it. And Swiper is probably trademarked, so I can't use that. ... Swipa's good for me."

There's a reason they call him the People's Champ.
On Tuesday, one fan was so excited to see Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson stopped next to him at a red light that he hopped out of his truck to snap a selfie with the former WWE star-turned-actor.
It was a dangerous move, as the guy was standing next to oncoming traffic. The Rock appeared more than accommodating—and impressed with the dedication—but also seemed concerned for the fan's safety.
The man got back to his unmanned truck with (hopefully) the selfie of a lifetime.

RIP Kawhi Leonard braids 1991-2017 https://t.co/VQ1jrWOAuQ
First, LeBron James shaved his head. Now, Kawhi Leonard's signature braids are gone.
This summer is weird.
On Tuesday, Comedy Central's Legends tweeted out a photo of the San Antonio Spurs superstar without his trademark hairstyle. It's unclear when the Claw donned the new 'do.

Perhaps it's an offseason look.
Leonard is basically a ghost on social media—he has four, count 'em, four tweets to his name—so he could've been doing this every summer all along.
Update: Wednesday, June 21 at 1 p.m. ET
According to the San Antonio Express-News' Jabari Young, the photo is fake.
"Just received a call from people close to Kawhi," Young tweeted. "Told me this photo is fake. So there's that."
Long live the braids.

Apparently Dwight Howard doesn't follow Adrian Wojnarowski on Twitter. 
Minutes after The Vertical editor dropped a #WojBomb about D12 getting dealt to the Charlotte Hornets, the 7-footer posted his thoughts on the rampant Paul George trade rumors:
He has so many great options, tough 2 Call https://t.co/fnC87lmFSS
Sources: Charlotte is sending Miles Plumlee, Marco Belenelli and 41st pick to Atlanta for Dwight Howard and 31st pick.
Several Twitter users notified Howard he was on the move:
@DwightHoward What r ur thoughts on the Dwight Howard trade?
@DwightHoward You just got traded, dude. Thoughts?
@DwightHoward YOU JUST BEEN TRATED TO THE HORNETS LOL
@DwightHoward please tell me they informed you. And you didn't just find out right now

LeBron James' shaved head sent NBA fans into a frenzy on Thursday. Perhaps no one was affected more than Green Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett.
The former New England Patriot compared LBJ's baldness to a Pokemon evolution:
Lebron going bald is like Charmeleon evolving into Charizard.
Pikachu is still pikachu. When we know it should have been evolved to Raichu. https://t.co/aHvlRZVEt1
Pretty wild to think that the past three years haven't been LeBron's final form, at least in Bennett's mind.
After that analogy, though, the 30-year-old pass-catcher took a serious turn:
I feel like it's accepting oneself for who they are. Fighting it for so long holds you back. Letting it go and becoming is a huge step
Self acceptance is a sure way for elevation in ones life. When you can truly be yourself. that freedom allows you to go wherever you please
Not that Lebron didn't accept himself, just using this moment as a teaching opportunity. Lol
Anyways.... Charizard I choose you!!
Bennett finished his stream of consciousness by addressing his own hairline:
I see my hairline running away from my forehead everyday. It's only a matter of time before I will have to face the results of the race.

Lillard added an important qualifier: "If [the] Blazers said they didn't want me."

UPDATE (6/19/17): In the nine days since he released a video about his choice between keeping his athletic scholarship at UCF or continuing his YouTube channel, Donald De La Haye has heard from hundreds of supporters on social media. But the most meaningful message came from Oakland Raiders punter Marquette King. De La Haye says King called him "funny as hell" and told him not to let the NCAA hold him back.The message, De La Haye says, was one of several signs that prompted him to post a follow-up Sunday announcing his decision to continue making videos. Because he won't demonetize his channel, he will potentially be in violation of NCAA rules that disallow student-athletes from profiting from their names or athletic reputations."I'm just at peace right now," De La Haye says. "I've been struggling in making my decision, but I know where I stand now personally. I don't know where I stand with the NCAA, but that's okay. I'm happy with where I am."De La Haye says he hasn't spoken with anyone in UCF's compliance office about his decision, but he will continue producing videos two to three times a week until he is instructed to stop. And if he is eventually given an ultimatum, De La Haye says he would leave college football and train for the NFL while continuing to make YouTube videos. He hasn't considered taking any kind of legal action against the NCAA, but he says he won't be afraid to speak out publicly against the organization."If the NCAA goes against what I believe in, I will tell people how I feel," he says. "I'm not going to do it just to do it; I'll wait for my verdict. But if I need to state my opinion, I won't be afraid."
For most of his life, Donald De La Haye has found the most joy in two places: on the field and in front of a camera. And for most of his life, those two passions have lived in perfect harmony. But now he may be forced to make a choice.
On Friday, in a meeting with a UCF compliance officer, De La Haye learned that continuing to earn money off his popular YouTube channel could cost him his athletic scholarship and his place as a kicker on UCF's football team. According to NCAA bylaw 12.4.4, a student-athlete "may establish his or her own business, provided the student-athlete's name, photograph, appearance or athletics reputation are not used to promote the business." And more than half of De La Haye's "Deestroying" channel videos touch on the topics of kicking or campus life.
"It was surprising," De La Haye says. "I feel like I'm owned by the NCAA. They can use my name and my likeness to make money off of me, but I can't. I'm not out here selling autographs. I'm not boasting that I'm a UCF player. Any other YouTuber with the same amount of subscribers would make the same amount of money as me. It's a senseless rule, in my opinion, especially in the age of social media."

A native of Costa Rica, De La Haye traces his passion for creating videos to his father, with whom he shares a name. De La Haye Sr. was always armed with a video camera at every major family function, including all of his son's soccer games. And when the younger De La Haye turned 13, he decided to start making videos himself, at first recording and editing Call of Duty gameplay. In middle school, he and his best friends, Troy and Malik, would make sketches about life at school and in their neighborhoods.
When he arrived at UCF in 2015, he decided he wanted to create a library of his videos and watched as his number of subscribers—now more than 55,000—skyrocketed. When he realized he could earn extra income for his family back home through his channel, he started applying lessons he'd learn at school as a marketing major. Even after his marketing classes end each semester, he keeps his favorite textbooks to reference regularly.

"If anything, I feel like I should be rewarded for what I'm doing, not punished," he says. "I don't want to toot my own horn, but I feel like I have a talent. I try to inspire people and to bring smiles to their faces."
Although De La Haye declined to say how much money he had earned from his channel, a similarly sized YouTube channel could earn between a few hundred and a couple thousand dollars a month. De La Haye, who likely relies on per-stream royalties and appears to have no sponsors, may earn something in the neighborhood of $1 per 1,000 views. "I'm a child who cares about his family," he says. "I want to help out. I want to make things easier for them. This is how I have been able to do that. That's the most difficult part."
On Saturday, De La Haye posted an emotional plea on his channel after receiving the news. Since then, he says, he has barely slept and has had trouble focusing on his schoolwork as he wrestles with deciding what to do next.
On one hand, he feels he owes it to his family to complete his college degree. On the other hand, he believes he has more long-term potential to earn money from making videos than from playing football. (Last fall he appeared in every game, but solely as a kickoff specialist.) For now, he is hoping the school will help him apply for a waiver and that the NCAA will allow him to keep his scholarship—and his earnings. An NCAA spokeswoman told B/R on Tuesday that the organization hadn't received a waiver yet and wasn't currently reviewing the situation.
The NCAA is facing increasing legal and public perception pressure to allow student-athletes to earn income, particularly from their names and likenesses—a restriction that isn't applied to any other college students, even those on scholarships. On Friday, former UNLV basketball players Dylan and Dakota Gonzalez told Slam their decision to forgo their final year of eligibility to focus on their music careers was "90-95 percent" due to NCAA rules.
A photo posted by Donald De La Haye (@deestroying)
"Times are changing," De La Haye says. "If any other college kid wants to be an entrepreneur and take the things he's taught in the classroom and use them, they'd be praised for it. Why can't we? If all of us student-athletes come together and try for change, it will at least get looked at. It seems like the NCAA wins a lot of battles, but we have to at least try to create change."
De La Haye says he has received nothing but support from UCF staffers, coaches and teammates, but the school must tread carefully given that it only recently was taken off probation from a series of NCAA football and basketball sanctions issued in 2012.
"I love UCF," he says. "I'm blessed, and I know that. I just feel like it's unfair that I'm being treated differently as a student-athlete. For me to have to choose between two things that I love, for this to be happening to me—it's heartbreaking," he says. "I don't want anyone else to have to suffer through something like this."

Whenever he played the Oklahoma City Thunder during his time on the Los Angeles Clippers, forward Matt Barnes got in Kevin Durant's ear.
Here’s what Sports Illustrated’s Lee Jenkins wrote about Barnes and his eventual Golden State Warriors teammate:
"'The only person in the world who can stop you,' Barnes crowed, 'is your teammate.' The most effective trash talk, Barnes has discovered in more than a decade of NBA rabble-rousing, is the kind spiked with the smallest shred of truth."
Barnes, of course, was referring to OKC star Russell Westbrook.

Could the constant prodding about his shot-happy point guard have pushed KD over the top last summer? Perhaps it played a role. But winning a title seemed to be more at the forefront of Durant's mind.

After hammering a two-run home run to center field against the Cleveland Indians on Tuesday night at Progressive Field, Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig didn't flip his bat.
He flipped the bird.
While jogging back into the Dodgers dugout, the 26-year-old taunted some heckler near the on-deck circle with a pair of middle fingers. He didn't even break stride. You can watch the home run here.
Somewhere, under that mask, Mr. Met is smiling.
Update: Tuesday, June 13, at 11:15 p.m. ET
Puig seemed unbothered about the incident after the game. He told reporters he reacted with the gesture after getting heckled:
Yasiel Puig said he was getting heckled. "I reacted that way," he said. "I stooped to their level."
He added that his teammates got a kick out of the move:
Yasiel Puig said he'll pay a fine if he has to. His teammates found this whole thing hilarious.

The 2016-17 #ShaqtinMVP is... Russell Westbrook!!! 🏆 https://t.co/VDPj7dBNDK
Russell Westbrook could make history with two MVPs in the same season: the real one and the not-so-coveted Shaqtin' A Fool award.
The Oklahoma City Thunder star beat out Dwight Howard, Marcus Smart and Zaza Pachulia in a fan vote for the title.
Shaqtin' star Shaquille O'Neal gives out the "honor" each year for the player with the most—or funniest—blunders. And despite a historic 2016-17 campaign from Russ, there was no shortage of hilarious moments.
His marathon travel against the Golden State Warriors made the lowlight reel:
The All-Star point guard joins past recipients JaVale McGee (the only two-time winner), Kendrick Perkins, Otto Porter Jr. and James Harden.

A day after losing to the Golden State Warriors in the 2017 NBA Finals, Cleveland Cavaliers guard JR Smith is looking for reinforcements.
The enigmatic 31-year-old liked an Instagram picture that featured Carmelo Anthony, his friend and former teammate, edited into a Cavs jersey alongside LeBron James.                
Anthony, who's under contract with the New York Knicks through 2018-19, is one of three NBA players with no-trade clauses.
Smith was electric in Game 5 at Oracle Arena on Monday night, netting 25 points and going 7-of-8 from beyond the arc.

On Tuesday afternoon, Oklahoma City Thunder superstar Russell Westbrook gave his fans a first look at his nearly one-month-old son, Noah, and the little guy bears a striking resemblance to his father, mean mug and all.
 Westbrook had previously announced Noah's birth May 16:

Kenneth Udjus, a goalkeeper for Norwegian soccer team Asker, was devastated after a slide tackle gone wrong broke the left leg of KFUM's Yassin Rfiffi.
"It's as bad as it gets. It was painful to watch," Udjus told Norwegian TV (via Deadspin). "I have not seen the video of the incident, but it was a shock. I'm very, very sorry now. … Of course I had no bad intentions."
Intentional or not, the crushing tackle resulted in a fibula broken in two places for Rfiffi, who suffered more pain than a guilty conscience.

Sunday marked the conclusion of the Greek Basket League as Panathinaikos defeated Olympiacos, 66-51, in Game 5 of the best-of-five league finals to win the series.
Panathinaikos held a comfortable lead near the two-minute mark in the fourth quarter when Olympiacos fans starting throwing flares and firecrackers. 
One hit the Panathinaikos bench, according to the Associated Press (via the Washington Post), and the game was delayed for 25 minutes.

Nose tackle Dontari Poe's one-year contract with his new team, the Atlanta Falcons, contains weight incentives. Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio reported March 18 that the 26-year-old could make an additional $500,000 if he consistently meets his goals.
On Monday, ESPN.com's Field Yates reported that if the scale reads 340 on Tuesday, Poe will get a $125,000 boost:
Another notable weigh-in this week: if Falcons NT Dontari Poe weighs 340 pounds or less tomorrow, he earns $125,000. https://t.co/58AkLzWM4H
This isn't an uncommon practice. Yates' report came in response to a similar note from Adam Schefter on Seattle Seahawks running back Eddie Lacy.
Seahawks' RB Eddie Lacy has his second Seattle weigh-in today. If he weighs 250 pounds or less - cha-ching: $55,000. That's a lot of pizza.
Poe, who is listed at 346 pounds, told ESPN.com's Vaughn McClure on June 1 that he isn't sweating the weigh-ins.
"Oh, it's pretty smooth," Poe said. "I'm pretty much where I need to be. So as long as I keep doing that, I'll be all right.''

The Boston Celtics want Gordon Hayward.
Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical reported May 18 that Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and Co. are "really focused on trying to get" the Utah Jazz free agent this summer. Chris Mannix, Woj's colleague at The Vertical, later reported that he believes the All-Star forward is Boston's "No. 1 target."
On Sunday, Hayward's wife, Robyn, posted a picture of their young daughter wearing a shirt featuring a four-leaf clover and the words "Go Green." She deleted the picture.
It might be a stretch to take this as a sign that Hayward is heading for Boston. But Robyn also hashtagged, "She's a fireball."

We’ve all seen, been in or heard of barbershop debates. But getting a fly-on-the-wall view of NBA rivals in this environment is a new sensation.
On Friday, Uninterrupted published "The Shop," which featured LeBron James, Draymond Green, Charles Oakley, Maverick Carter, Rich Paul and rapper 2 Chainz.
They got fresh buzzes, and many, including James, sipped wine while the barbers worked.

The group talked about last year’s NBA Finals, football players not playing defense, Mike Krzyzewski and LBJ’s 2014 return to Cleveland.
Spoiler alert: The King’s mom, Gloria James, was not in favor of it due to owner Dan Gilbert’s controversial letter and the fanbase's reaction.
"My mom was like, 'F--k that, we ain’t going back,'" James told everyone. "… 'You go back, I’m not going back with you. I’m staying in Miami.'"

When asked about the evergreen trend on Friday, coach Steve Kerr got sarcastic.
"They're all right, they would all kill us," Kerr deadpanned. "The game gets worse as time goes on. Players are less talented than they used to be. The guys in the '50s would've destroyed everybody."
The Warriors are leading the Cleveland Cavaliers 3-0 in the NBA Finals ahead of Friday night's Game 4.

While free-agent running back DeAngelo Williams searches for a new team, he's reportedly going to dabble in another contact sport: pro wrestling.
On Monday, the former Pittsburgh Steelers rusher teased a return to Impact Wrestling, formerly known as TNA.
According to Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t CBSSports.com's Brian Campbell), Williams is going to compete in a tag team match at the Slammiversary XV pay-per-view event on July 2.
Meltzer reported the 34-year-old will wrestle alongside Moose, a former NFL offensive lineman who was rescued by Williams and NFL tight end Gary Barnidge in a previous storyline.

Call James Comey the "Ultimate" insider.
The man who may hold the fate of President Donald Trump in his hands also played Ultimate Frisbee, along with intramural basketball and football, while in college at William and Mary.
Once the former FBI Director is through testifying before Congress about potential Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, Comey could choose to pursue a second career on the Ultimate pitch.

At 56, he's too old to strut his stuff in college (where the USA Ultimate Division 1 finals were recently shown on ESPNU) or professional Ultimate (where ESPN regularly puts plays from the American Ultimate Disc League on its Top 10). But there is a division in which Comey could showcase his Frisbee skills: USA Ultimate now features a Great Grand Masters division for players over 50.
"He's tall," says Matt Jefferson, who won several national championships with the New York, New York, Ultimate dynasty in the late 1980s and early '90s and helped co-found the Great Grand Masters division.
"All I'm thinking is, at 6'8" we'd put out the welcome mat for him. We'd have to have an initiation. He'd have to drink a disc of beer and swear an oath of loyalty to us."
Ultimate, which combines elements of football, basketball and soccer, was recognized by the International Olympics Committee in 2015. There's hope the sport could debut in the Olympics as early as 2024.
If there's ever a Great Grand Masters division in the Olympics, who knows? Comey could have a second act competing on the international sports stage.
"He would be our end-zone weapon," Jefferson says. "We would just loft passes up to James, who would be able to rise above the others and score point after point.
"On defense he could go into stealth mode, luring our opponent to throw passes to the end zone where James would be lurking to swat away, towering over most players. In addition, with his espionage and investigative expertise, he could uncover our opponent's strategies no matter how they encrypt them."

"In fact, our playbook is tailor-made for him, as we have three end-zone plays that we call FBI, CIA and KGB. He'll have no problem keeping them straight."
Jefferson adds, "In order to make the team, however, Mr. Comey would have to agree to a set of rules and would have to take an oath of loyalty to the team."
Those rules include:
1. Apologize to the great Fairfield/Westchester icon Martha Stewart for locking her up not for insider trading but for a simple little lie.
2. Now that he is no longer a registered Republican, he must remain apolitical as politics and Frisbee don't mix.
3. Sportsmanship and honor are far greater than winning. The spirit of the game must remain intact and you must play fair.
4. No leaking of information outside of the team.
5. Remember, love trumps hate.
Whether Comey D-blocks Trump in his testimony remains to be seen, but the Ultimate insider may have a second act ahead.
Across an Ultimate career that has spanned 30 years, Adam Zagoria has competed in College, Open, Mixed, Masters and Grandmasters Nationals. In 2013, he captained the Westchester Ultimate Summer League championship Gold team. His team also won the WSL title in 2011. Zagoria is the co-author, along with Tony Leonardo, of “ULTIMATE – The First Four Decades.” You can follow him on Twitter at @adamzagoria

It's unlikely Steph Curry will be hitting any fast food joints during the NBA Finals. But if he does, Wendy's is off the list.

Buffalo Bills cornerback Shareece Wright went to great lengths to make it to an optional workout with his new team Tuesday.
According to a late-night tweet from his agent, Tamerat Berhe, Wright took an eight-hour Uber ride from Chicago to Buffalo, New York, for the voluntary practice:
Who takes an 8 hour @Uber from Chicago to Buffalo to make a voluntary @buffalobills practice? @ShareeceWright did, wild story. 🙌🏾
SB Nation's Jeanna Thomas obtained the receipt from the 542.9-mile voyage, and it cost $632.08.
Again, this was a voluntary practice.
Wright spent the last two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens before being cut in March. It's safe to say he set the tone for his new team.
UPDATE: Thursday, June 8 at 1 p.m. ET
According to the Washington Post's Marissa Payne (h/t ESPN.com), Uber driver Hadi Abdollahian had a different destination in mind when picking up Wright.  
“He told me Buffalo and I thought he meant Buffalo [Wild Wings] grill,” Abdollahian said “So I said, ‘Yeah, for sure.’”
Nevertheless, the 26-year-old—a refugee who came to Chicago from Turkey four years ago—agreed to the longer journey.
“I promised him on the phone," Abdollahian told Payne, "so I said, ‘let’s hit the road.’ ”
Payne added that BlueRock Energy, sponsored by the Bills, matched Wright's $932.08 fare to thank Abdollahian.

Hawks center Dwight Howard says he's "working hard" on his 3-point game to extend career. He's 5-of-56 from 3-point range in his career. https://t.co/FzJx9BOcsJ
For 13 seasons, Dwight Howard has been an old-school big man.
During a Tuesday afternoon appearance on ESPN's The Jump, though, the Atlanta Hawks center made it clear he wants to join unicorns like Kristaps Porzingis, Brook Lopez and Karl-Anthony Towns as a 7-footer who can stroke it from deep.
"This summer, I've been working a lot," Howard said. "... I have this guy in Atlanta I've been working with. I've been working on my threes, really trying to add some range to my game, which is gonna be weird for people to see. They're used to seeing me in the paint, battling. But in order for me to play longer, I have to expand my game."
As noted by Sporting News' Jordan Heck, the longball has always eluded D-12. He's 5-of-56 from beyond the arc in his career and hasn't made a triple since 2014-15. Since then, Howard is 0-of-8.
Per NBA.com, the 31-year-old took 506 of his 613 field-goal attempts in 2016-17 from within five feet of the cup. Adding a three-ball would be a drastic change.

Before Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday, Shady placed a $200,000 bet on the Golden State Warriors to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the series. The 28-year-old rusher will take home $62,500 if the Dubs win.
According to David Payne Purdum of ESPN Chalk, it was the largest bet Planet Hollywood received on the Finals. Purdum also noted McCoy didn't break any league rules with the wager:
NFL players are permitted to bet on other team sports, per league gambling policy.
The Dubs blew out Cleveland 113-91 in Game 1. Game 2 is Sunday at 8 p.m. ET.

Gronk with the INT and the spike at the wedding tonight @barstoolsports https://t.co/NHft5FbUNz
The Gronk Spike knows no offseason.
While attending a wedding Saturday, New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski intercepted a bouquet and slammed the flowers on the dance floor as if he just scored a game-winning touchdown.
Nobody seemed to mind. Classic Gronk.

After defeating Jose Aldo to become the UFC's undisputed featherweight champion Saturday night, Max Holloway addressed Conor McGregor, the division's former champion.
The 25-year-old lost to the Irishman by unanimous decision in August 2013. McGregor later won the featherweight and lightweight straps, becoming the first UFC fighter to hold two belts simultaneously.
"That guy was the 2015 champ," Holloway said. "He can go run around wherever he's at with the belt and celebrate, because guess what—you can't take it away from him. This is called the year 2017 right now ... and I'm the champ. If he wants to come back down, he can come and get it."
As Holloway alluded to, McGregor called himself the "champ champ" before he was stripped of the featherweight belt two weeks after he knocked out Eddie Alvarez in November.
The champ champ https://t.co/iprUKL0Ldx
Now, McGregor is reportedly working on a deal to box Floyd Mayweather Jr.
"I ain't gonna chase someone around. I ain't gonna talk about someone who's not talking about me," Holloway said of McGregor. "He gets to choose his fights. Why am I gonna cry and beg him to fight me? Get the hell out of here with that s--t. You can beg to fight me now."
Though UFC media and fans would surely love to see a rematch between Holloway and McGregor, it's unclear if The Notorious will ever fight at 145 pounds again:
Can't help but feel like UFC brass are happy. Yes, Holloway lost to McGregor moons ago, but this freshens things up in a big way @ 145.
Max Holloway is a serious problem for anybody at 145 pounds. The McGregor rematch is so so good! Max vs Frankie in NYC???
I'd give anything to watch Conor McGregor vs. Max Holloway 2. Since losing to McGregor, Holloway has been on a tear. Gone through everyone.
The amount of people who actually think Conor McGregor gives a shit about fighting Holloway is startling. Not happening.
So McGregor has wins over Aldo and Holloway...if you actually thought he was ever dropping back to 145, put those thoughts to bed #UFC212
Regardless, Holloway has made his stance clear.
"Come try to take over my village; off with your head," he said, perhaps referencing McGregor's comments to Aldo in 2015. "... I got my throne. If you want it, come see me."

What is happening to Klay 😂 https://t.co/DpNel9JzvA
Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson wasn't satisfied with the connection during a media call Friday.
"Hello?" the shooting guard asked as he banged the microphone. "Anybody there?"
The reporter's voice on the other line came in and out, but the question wasn't transferred cleanly enough for the 27-year-old to answer. 
Thompson, who struggled with his shot in the Warriors' Game 1 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers—six points on 3-of-16 shooting—praised teammate Kevin Durant during the conference call:

On Friday, Phillips clarified he's still a Los Angeles Lakers fan, and ball is still life:

Comedian Kevin Hart has become a fixture at NBA games and events. 
He's constantly courtside, especially for his hometown Philadelphia 76ers, and is an NBA All-Star Weekend legend—four-time Celebrity Game MVP, people. On Thursday, the 37-year-old talked to Jimmy Kimmel about why he goes to so many games.
"I talk a lot of trash. That's why I go," Hart said. "I go there to sit courtside to mess with the players. That's literally all I go for."
Hart said sometimes he throws back one too many drinks and starts slurring his words. He also told Kimmel about a time he heckled Houston Rockets superstar James Harden into an offensive eruption against his Sixers. 

Apparently the Beard went back at Hart verbally—and then with his play.
"Tell your team what you did to 'em," Hart, who was there with rapper Meek Mill, recalled Harden telling him as the clock wound down.
The Rockets won 123-118 as Harden dropped 51 points to go with 13 rebounds and 13 assists. Hart crashed his interview afterward:

As the Golden State Warriors poured it on the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night, pop star Rihanna become the story.
As noted by Twitter users like Cycle's Rob Perez, the 29-year-old singer appeared to be heckling Kevin Durant. He, in turn, started staring in her direction after scoring: 
Listen: Rihanna yells "BRIIIIIICK!!!" at Durant during free throw, he stares her down twice 😂 (h/t @tshent) https://t.co/XYdFOv9mc3
When asked about the incident postgame, KD played the "I don't even remember" card.
"Don't fall into that trap, bro," Stephen Curry chimed in. 
After the 113-91 loss by the Cavaliers, Rihanna maintained that no matter what, LeBron James is still the King (Warning: NSFW language):

"Pretty sure Joel Embiid has the IQ of a squirrel."
Those words came out of the Philadelphia 76ers star center's mouth Thursday night in the latest round of Jimmy Kimmel Live's NBA-centric "Mean Tweets" skit.
James Harden, Karl-Anthony Towns, Devin Booker and other current pro hoopers participated, as well as legends Walt "Clyde" Frazier, Shaquille O'Neal and Karl Malone.
Props to all the participants for being good sports—well, except for the Mailman.

Atlanta Falcons defensive end Takkarist McKinley—who turned heads last month with a wild post-draft interview—threw himself a little Snapchat dance party on Thursday.
The No. 26 pick out of UCLA busted a move, writing, "When you see them two commas in yo bank account," and, "When you go from having nothing to a millionaire overnight."
McKinley likely has even more money than anticipated, given that the NFL chose not to fine him for dropping the F-bomb on live TV at the draft in Philadelphia.

Milwaukee Brewers first baseman and outfielder Eric Thames has been getting drug-tested with great frequency this year.
"Randomly."
After the 30-year-old, who spent the last three years in South Korea, blasted his 14th home run of the season in a 7-1 win over the New York Mets on Wednesday, he was given his fifth drug test of the year, per Tom Hardicourt of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:
So, Eric Thames hits first HR in three weeks and is randomly drug tested after the game. He thinks it’s funny but doesn’t think it’s random.
Here's the shot:
POW! WHAM! 

@EricThames smash! https://t.co/qwl5UF7GiI
During a red-hot April, which featured 11 dingers, Thames was tested three times in 10 days. He told reporters that he has "lots of blood and urine" to test:
Eric Thames was drug tested again tonight. "If people keep thinking I'm on stuff, I'll be here every day. I have a lot of blood and urine." https://t.co/De1smFWVj7
Ken Rosenthal detailed why the frequent testing is the result of the MLB's Joint Drug Agreement, which mandates "extensive mandatory follow-up" tests for players "who reach agreement to return to a major-league club after being out of affiliated baseball (majors or minors) for one calendar year or longer."
Thames isn't being singled-out; his resurgence at the dish just makes it look that way.

LaMelo Ball is now on NBA2K.
On Wednesday, YouTuber King Shawnn showed off an impressively accurate MyCareer starring the Chino Hills (California) sophomore point guard, whose older brother, Lonzo, is bound for the 2017 NBA draft lottery.
The narrative is loaded with spot-on features like LaMelo's father, Big Baller Brand CEO LaVar Ball, calling him about going to the Los Angeles Lakers (sound familiar?). LaMelo does take a meeting with other shoe companies in MyCareer, though.
On the court, the animated character plays just like the 5-star UCLA commit—breaking ankles and launching moonshot threes.
Pro hoops is still a long way away for the baby of the Ball family, but this provided a look at what life could be like.

Dwyane Wade isn't worried about being "cool."
On Wednesday, the Chicago Bulls shooting guard responded to a Twitter user who poked fun at his outfit by telling him he listened to country music before both 40-point efforts in the 2006 NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks.
What if I told you in 06 I listened to country music b4 every game that I score 40 in?Would that not be cool? I'm different you wanna fit in https://t.co/JU3jX1glqy

Then 24 years old, Wade averaged 34.7 points in the six-game series and won Finals MVP.
After falling down 0-2, D-Wade carried Miami to four straight wins while averaging 39.3 points on 50.5 percent shooting.

Only two men—er, action figures—were left standing after a wild melee in B/R's summary of the NBA playoffs.
LeBron James and Kevin Durant.
The all-time great forwards withstood attacks from contenders like Isaiah Thomas, while MVP candidates Russell Westbrook and James Harden wailed on one another.
On Thursday night, the battle continues as the Cleveland Cavaliers visit the Golden State Warriors in Game 1 of the 2017 NBA Finals.

The 24-year-old didn't get surgery for the "fractures and tendon damage" this offseason, though. He showed off his mangled finger during a media session Tuesday.

Paul Pierce compares Kevin Durant joining Warriors to a kid becoming friends with his bullies to avoid getting beat up. https://t.co/00U8c5sTW0
During a Tuesday afternoon segment on ESPN's The Jump, retired NBA veteran Paul Pierce took a shot at Kevin Durant's decision to join the Golden State Warriors in free agency last summer.
"I'm just not built like that," the Truth said. "I'm not a guy who goes into the neighborhood, gets beat up by the bully's gang and then now I want to join your gang."
Rachel Nichols, Amin Elhassan and Scottie Pippen laughed at the analogy.
Pierce was likely referring to the Warriors' elimination of Durant's Oklahoma City Thunder in last year's Western Conference Finals. OKC was up 3-1 before Golden State stormed back and advanced to the NBA Finals.

Well that didn't take long👀 @RAIDERS @ESPNNFL https://t.co/BNQrp8vAOg
Charles Woodson spent 11 years—his first eight and last three—wearing No. 24 for the Oakland Raiders.
The 40-year-old retired after the team's 2015 campaign, and the franchise wasted little time in finding a new owner for his old number. Running back Marshawn Lynch, who came out of retirement this offseason to sign a two-year deal with Oakland, will be rocking Woodson's former number in 2017.
Woodson stumbled across a Beast Mode jersey Monday and commented, "Well, that didn't take long" with a pair of eye emojis on his Twitter account.

The former shutdown corner isn't actually mad about Lynch getting his old number, though. On Friday, he told ESPN.com's Paul Gutierrez that Beast Mode, who wore No. 24 with the Seattle Seahawks, deserves it.
"That number 24, that's something special with the Raiders," Woodson said. "I don't think there's anybody more worthy than Marshawn to wear that number."
Update: Monday, May 29 at 2:45 p.m. ET
Lynch caught wind of Woodson’s tweet and asked if the future Hall of Famer wanted to have the number back:

Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue apparently owes acting Golden State Warriors coach Mike Brown some money.
Over the weekend, the former Los Angeles Laker said he lost a shooting contest to Brown during his rookie year. That was in 1998-99.
"I tried to pay him and he wouldn't take the money, so he says I always owe him," Lue told reporters while laughing, per Cleveland.com's Chris Fedor. "He's always been a great guy."
Lue didn't remember much about the contest, but he knew for sure Brown didn't out-shoot him: "I just missed some shots."

CLEVELAND THANK YOU!!!! WE DID IT!!!! KYLE MET LEBRON JAMES LAST NIGHT!!!! #KylesWish https://t.co/NNgQ02kKQD
Earlier this month, the hashtag #KylesWish took off on social media with one end goal in mind: getting 19-year-old Kyle Osborne, who has a rare form of cancer, to meet LeBron James.
It was a seemingly impossible task, according to the Albuquerque Journal’s Joline Gutierrez Kruger, especially during the NBA playoffs.
In early May, "the LeBron James Family Foundation sent Kyle a gift box filled with [Cleveland] Cavaliers jerseys, posters, coffee mug, I Promise gel bands, a pair of James' practice-worn shoes, a set of Beats headphones and other goodies."
Laura Onorato, a physician's assistant who helped jump-start the #KylesWish campaign, wanted more for Osborne.
This is Kyle. He is 19 w/terminal cancer. His wish is to meet @KingJames before he dies. Please help us reach him by retweeting #KylesWish https://t.co/8JY94b21Fe
"Kyle's been dealt a (expletive) hand," she said. "He doesn't deserve to be given just a box."
The nonprofit organization A Special Wish Foundation got involved, setting up a trip to Cleveland for Kyle's family, who live in New Mexico, that included box seats for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, a hotel room, limousine and other luxuries. 
Onorato joined, as well.
Already getting closer to @KingJames! Love that smile, Kyle ❤☄#KylesWish https://t.co/sbMjymai9t
"It was amazing," Kyle told Kruger. "We felt like celebrities."
In the end, Kyle shook hands with James and shared a smile with the King. He credited Onorato with turning his dream into reality.
"She's amazing. She's just amazing," he said, per Kruger. "She keeps trying and trying, and doesn't give up."

During the top of the sixth inning against the Oakland Athletics on Saturday, the 6'7" slugger retired third baseman Trevor Plouffe after a pop-up bounced off second baseman Starlin Castro's mitt. Judge smoothly snagged the ball on the rebound.

Warriors and Cavaliers Scuffle
Bleacher Report debuted a new animated series Friday called Delete Your Account, hosted by "King of the Comment Section" Deon Buggs and "The Dark Lord from the Dark Web" Kenny Mac.
In the inaugural episode, the most infamous commenters on the internet call for an 82-game series between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors and run into a robotic Gregg Popovich—who wasn't feeling talkative.
"Man, even the robot version of this guy is impossible to interview."
After an 11-inning battle, @UCLASoftball topped Ole Miss in dramatic fashion with a walk off in game one of Supers! https://t.co/iWo6UzQuWs
UCLA Bruins softball ace Rachel Garcia threw 232 pitches in an 11-inning, complete-game victory against the Ole Miss Rebels in the NCAA Division I Super Regional opener on Thursday in Los Angeles.
The No. 5-seeded Bruins fended off the No. 12 Rebels after the visitors took a 7-5 lead in the 10th.
Catcher Madeline Jelenicki hit a two-strike pitch to right field, sealing the 11-10 win.
While Garcia's pitch count certainly catches the eye, espnW.com's Graham Hays noted that it's not an unusual occurrence in softball:
"Softball pitching is different from baseball pitching, mechanically. College softball pitchers routinely throw multiple days in a row, even multiple games in a day (and often throw even more frequently in travel ball). ... But as head-turning as Garcia's pitch count will be to sports fans who find softball only at this time of year, and while it blew away her own career high, it isn't wildly out of the norm for the sport."
Game 2 of the best-of-three series is Friday night at 9 p.m. ET.

Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver John Ross isn't impressed with DeSean Jackson's speed.
On Friday, Ross, who broke Chris Johnson's 40-yard-dash record at the NFL Scouting Combine with a time of 4.22 seconds in April, responded to a tweet from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers about their newest deep threat.
😱😱😱

Oh my, @DeSeanJackson11 is FAST! https://t.co/sNF22gUVLi
Ross' response?
"Child please," a callback to another famous Bengals trash-talker, Chad Johnson (warning: link contains NSFW language):
For the record, Jackson's 40 time at the 2008 combine was 4.35.
It's not the first time the former Washington Huskies stud has flaunted his quickness. Last month, he challenged Usain Bolt to a race.
Update: Friday, May 26, at 2:45 p.m. ET
Ross later indicated that he was using the phrase from DJax's perspective as he burned the defender, not as a taunt:
Lol they will try to make a story out of anything to get views. I was speaking as if i was Desean saying child please that was too easy 😂 https://t.co/sa2auMXtwE
He said he was saying child please in reference to the dude trying and failing to cover DeSean, which actually makes more sense https://t.co/ezy12UIqiF
Ross also deleted his original tweet.

Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera defended Kelvin Benjamin this week after the fourth-year wide receiver caught heat from fans and media due to an unflattering photo.
On Thursday, Rivera said the 6'5" pass-catcher has been "outstanding" in OTAs and noted that the concern over his weight has been unfair.
"A lot was made out of it that was unfair to be made out of it," Rivera told media members, per Jourdan Rodrigue of the Charlotte Observer. "Especially in a voluntary situation. But he's worked very hard. He's focused in on what he needs to do and he's done that."
Benjamin has downplayed the issue, too. Last week, the 26-year-old told Max Henson of Panthers.com that although he was disappointed with his first weigh-in, he plans on being in the "best shape of [his] life" come training camp.
Per Henson, Benjamin plans on playing at 245 pounds.

A year ago, Mike Senatore just wanted to be in the Ardrey Kell High School talent show. He couldn't sing. He couldn't dance. He couldn't play an instrument. But none of this stopped his desire to participate.
The original idea was to chug a bottle of water before flipping it, but Mom quickly nixed that one. Instead, Senatore decided to set up "awkward tension" with music before flipping a bottle onto a table. He put together the music clip from Jorge Quintero's 300 Violin Orchestra and called it a night.
"A lot of it was just BS'ing," Senatore tells Bleacher Report. "I didn't have any real talent." 
In a flash, a video of the event exploded (now over 7.5 million views on YouTube) and it quickly had 20,000 retweets on Twitter, making Senatore an overnight sensation. The next day, his phone rang endlessly, and he talked to everyone from the New York Times to Teen Vogue. By the end of the week, Senatore appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, showing the comedian his bottle-flipping skill. His flight to New York was the first time he'd ever been on an airplane.
"Every single viral person is thinking the same thing when they're in that moment of viral fame," Senatore says. "People who make it to that tier, when they make it to a show, it's just like, 'How is this happening? Why am I in New York?'
"A whole year later, it doesn't make sense to me."
Senatore embraced his 15 minutes of fame, but the bottle-flipping craze continued through the year as one of 2016's biggest trends. Students around the country started flipping bottles in class, which led to teachers banning bottle flips. Bottle-flip iPhone apps were developed. Think pieces were written. LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers even flipped bottles during a blowout win over the New York Knicks. And every time someone notable flips a bottle, Senatore hears about it from his friends.
"The first day that I went viral, it was like I saved the world or something. People I hadn't talked to in years are texting me," Senatore says. "A manager I had for two weeks at one of my jobs texted me. It was super surreal [to see] who comes out of nowhere because they think it's so freaking funny that this happened." 
A photo posted by Michael Senatore (@michael_senatore)
Along with the fame, Senatore is proud the video led Deer Park, the bottled water brand he flipped, to donate $10,000 to the American Cancer Society, especially since he lost his father to cancer some years prior. Senatore says the donation day was the happiest day of his life, and soon he saw people around the world raising money through bottle flipping.
"That something so stupid that I did in my talent show could have such a great cause to it, in my eyes, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen," he says.
Even a year later, people around town know Senatore as the kid who flipped a bottle. And even if his national fame isn't what it was for those two weeks last May, the local fame remains.
"I work at a car wash, and it's funny because they all know me there from forever and they make fun of me," he says. "I've had the same manager for three years, and they call me water boy now. These kids are obsessed with me. They want to go to work meetings just to meet me. It's funny because kids look at me like I'm some hero, and I don't know how to react to it. In my eyes, I'm just a stupid college kid doing his own thing." 
Senatore acknowledges he probably won't ever create anything as widely seen as his bottle-flip video, but that doesn't stop him from reaching.
"I peaked. That's what people tell me," Senatore says. "I use it as motivation. It motivates me every day in a way. I don't want [the bottle flip] to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I can't expect to go on Stephen Colbert again, but maybe I could be on Stephen Colbert again."
Senatore says he wanted to be a politician before the video went viral, but the notoriety and the past election changed his mind. Now, after seeing the behind-the-scene machinations of the entertainment industry, he's found an interest in production and is an incoming sophomore studying business at the University of South Carolina. Regardless of what the future holds, Senatore understands that bottle flipping will always have a place in his story.
"[Bottle flipping]'s still a daily part of my life. Ten years from now, it'll still be big in my life," Senatore says.
"I think kids will still be doing it. Planking died out, but planking was also planking."

Jimmy Butler and DeAndre Jordan developed something of a bromance with the United States Olympic team last summer, and the teasing has continued throughout the season.
On Wednesday, the Chicago Bulls shooting guard posted a headshot on Instagram captioned “haircut needed.” Jordan agreed.
“Badly,” the Los Angeles Clippers big fella commented. “I’ll even pay for it.”
That was it. Jimmy Buckets went right for the heart with his retort, jokingly telling Jordan “I never liked you anyway[,] I was acting the whole time.”

The trailer!! I AM MARBURY the movie MY OTHER HOME ready for the next move. #loveislove #starburymovement #china #museum #starbury https://t.co/1gCGLeYYTp
Last June, The Wrap’s Beatrice Verhoeven reported that former NBA player Stephon Marbury would be playing himself in a biopic about his rise to superstardom in the Chinese Basketball Association.
On Wednesday, Starbury released the trailer for My Other Home. It looks big-time.
This is no ordinary documentary. It’s a full-fledged movie that features legitimate acting as well as Baron Davis in a potentially adversarial role. According to IMDb, Allen Iverson is also in the film.
The 40-year-old has taken the Beijing Ducks to three championships since 2012. Marbury has been honored with a statue, a musical and The House of Marbury Museum in China, according to Kiki Zhao of the New York Times.
My Other Home seems a must-see.

Siri doesn't roll with the Buckeyes.
On Tuesday, former Michigan Wolverines lineman and current NFL free agent Mike Martin instructed his Twitter followers to ask the Apple digital assistant a simple question: When did Michael Jordan retire?
Hey @UMichFootball fans go ask siri "When did Michael Jordan retire" and you'll very pleased by her response. Trust me! JUST DO IT!
The answers—for the legendary NBA superstar—would be 1993, 1998 and 2003.
But Siri takes the question to be about a Buckeyes sophomore offensive lineman with the same name.
Her response, via Maizen Brew's David Noe, referenced a low-point for Ohio State:

Look at Dlo's latest like... https://t.co/Skiv8GalNq
It seems Los Angeles Lakers point guard D’Angelo Russell is not in favor of Lonzo Ball joining the team.
On Tuesday night, the 21-year-old liked a tweet from Twitter user @Beck_Jordan11, who said that, after watching Russell’s 2016-17 highlights, "there is no way in hell they should draft Lonzo."
Watching D'Angelo Russell highlights from this year makes me think there is no way in hell they should draft Lonzo. They stupid if they do
If drafted at No. 2, Ball, a star point guard out of UCLA, would take over Russell's duties running the offense and slide the southpaw to shooting guard or force the Lakers to trade him.
After others began noticing Russell's interaction with the tweet, he un-liked it.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers hit the NFC South rival Atlanta Falcons where it hurt Tuesday.

The Falcons chimed in with a GIF of cornerback Desmond Trufant and asked if Tampa Bay was "nervous about something."
@TBBuccaneers Are you nervous about something? https://t.co/i6S4ExDCLF
It was not.
The Buccaneers answered with a crushing blow of a picture that featured cornerback Vernon Hargreaves celebrating with quarterback Jameis Winston. Their jersey numbers formed the Super Bowl score prior to the New England Patriots' comeback:

Pittsburgh Penguins right winger Phil Kessel just earned some teammate brownie points.
Before Sunday's 7-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators in Game 5 of the NHL's Eastern Conference Final, center Nick Bonino experienced some car trouble. He called Kessel, who saved the day.
"It was weird," Bonino said, per Scott Allen of the Washington Post. "All of a sudden the gas didn't work and the power steering went out. I was on the highway, so I was able to get it to the side and great teammate Phil Kessel came and picked me up, so I owe a lot to Phil for being here tonight. Great guy."
It was a big night for Kessel, who added a goal and an assist in the blowout.

"The parade appeared to begin at Oakland Tech High School and meander down College Avenue through Berkeley. There were smiles aplenty —on the faces of both the riders and spectators, many of whom were armed with cellphones to snap photos. One man apparently drove up from Stockton just to participate."
The 31-year-old bruising back seemed thrilled with the turnout:

Aaron Judge is a giant, but he sure can move.
In the bottom of the sixth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays on Sunday, the 6'7" New York Yankees slugger chased down a would-be extra-base hit from Evan Longoria in the gap. Judge sprawled out, using every bit of his length to snag the fly ball.
The 25-year-old then doubled up Corey Dickerson, who, thinking Judge had no shot at the ball, bolted to third from first base.
People were impressed—including Judge's teammates:

Accuracy has always haunted Tim Tebow.
Earlier this week, the Columbia Fireflies outfielder—and former NFL quarterback—accidentally drilled an unsuspecting fan in the last place he would’ve chosen to be hit, per Kirsten Fleming of the New York Post.
"I hear this guy behind me yell, 'Watch out,'" Doug Brustman told Fleming. "And as he’s yelling, the ball comes right through the railing and hits me right in the nuts. It was a direct hit."
Brustman went on:
"It was literally like a Seinfeld episode. The guy behind me shouts, 'It was TEBOW.' It reminded me of his days with the Jets when he couldn’t complete a pass. This guy is so inaccurate, even with a baseball."

Still, it was thrown by Timmy Terrific—the very reason Brustman brought his 13-year-old basketball-playing daughter, Morgan, to the game. Tebow later signed the ball, along with two books Morgan brought.
"He didn’t have to come over," Brustman said. "How can you hate him? He’s almost too good to be true."

If Isaiah Thomas were 6'4", he'd be the best player ever—according to himself.
The Boston Celtics star point guard, who stands at a towering 5'9" (and that's being generous), was asked by Good Morning America's T.J. Holmes how his career would be different with an extra seven inches.
"I'd be the best player ever," I.T. said with a smile. "And everybody would think that."
Thomas went on to say that he's been the shortest player on every team he's ever been on. The All-Star also discussed his frustration with being defined by his stature.
"It's always, 'He's good…and he's 5'9"," Thomas said. "I'm trying to look past it, but I guess it's never going to go away. It's always gonna be, 'Well, he's 5'9".' And, I mean, I'm never gonna be OK with it."

On Thursday, she tweeted that she hopes the Philadelphia 76ers rookie point guard dunks on NBA lottery-bound guard Lonzo Ball so forcefully that the Big Baller himself, LaVar, rushes the court.
She eventually deleted the post, but theScore captured a screenshot (above).
Olivia Simmons later got on LaVar Ball for his interaction with Fox Sports 1’s Kristine Leahy on Wednesday:
Hey @Lavarbigballer can I get some women's leggi..... oh wait u don't cater to everyone. You're a marketing genius.
@Lavarbigballer listen u idiot. If you want to expand your brand you do need to market toward women. CAUSE WE HOOP TOO. She was helping you
@Lavarbigballer and u were so disrespectful its her job to ask things as a reporter. You're gonna mess things up for your sons

Scotty Jr., who played with the South Beach all-stars, impressed with his jumper and his ability to get a shot for himself off the bounce.   
"I like what I'm seeing," his six-time champion dad wrote while tweeting out the video Wednesday.
According to Hudl, Scotty Jr. is a sophomore at Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

LaVar Ball told us it would happen.
The Los Angeles Lakers came out of Tuesday night's NBA draft lottery with the No. 2 overall pick, putting them in position to select former Chino Hills (California) and UCLA star guard Lonzo Ball.
CBS Los Angeles captured footage of the family's celebration at their Chino Hills home. Lonzo danced in the kitchen next to his brother (and future Bruin) LiAngelo.
"I told him he was going to go to the Lakers. I'm gonna speak it into existence," LaVar boomed. "Boston's going to take their Markelle Fultz; he's a good player. I think he fits best with Boston. But you can't bring him to L.A., he ain't ready for this. Only one person's ready for this: It's that Ball boy."
"I know I must be a genius to plan it this way," LaVar continued. "[Lonzo's] number has always been No. 2, and guess what he's going. No. 2…to the Lakers, baby! Here we come."
LaVar told Lakers Nation's Ryan Ward that Lonzo will only work out for the Lakers.

Oh my god you guys the wedding proposal actually happened https://t.co/pMWsMJ0Bgd
"TTP" now stands for "Trust the Proposal."
Prior to Tuesday night’s NBA draft lottery, the Rights To Ricky Sanchez podcast and jeweler LL Pavorsky teamed up on a contest for Philadelphia 76ers fans: Get engaged at the RTRS lottery party and get a free ring worth $7,500.
The official announcement came in February:
We will pick a winner at random at [6 p.m.] at the Lottery Party, and send you a text. You have five minutes to text us back and meet with us. We will then set you up with the ring, and give you instructions for the proposal. If you do not respond within five minutes, or are not at the party, we will move on to the next.
About an hour before the Sixers' fate was determined by pingpong balls, two fans got engaged. Fans chanted "She said yes!"

Former NFL receivers Chad Johnson and Terrell Owens had a debate over a simple question on Friday.
Who was better?
T.O. tops Ochocinco in every statistical receiving category and played in 53 more games. Here’s how their careers match up, per Pro-Football-Reference.com:
The numbers don’t lie. Statistically, it’s Owens.
Johnson argued that T.O.’s numbers are partly due to his surroundings, though.
"Don’t let the numbers fool you," Ocho said. "It just so happened he was put in situations that were great for him. I’m the better receiver."
T.O. was blunt in response: "Turn the film on."
The debate seemed lighthearted and in good fun. A better discussion might be who was better at celebrating touchdowns.

Hamidou Diallo posted a 44.5" vertical, 2nd highest in #NBACombine history! 👀
https://t.co/LgJmBAWyZT
Hamidou Diallo could be one of the first players ever to go "none"-and-done.
The Kentucky Wildcats freshman guard didn't see a minute of action under John Calipari this season, but DraftExpress projects him as an early second-round pick. Bleacher Report's Jonathan Wasserman had him No. 23 on his big board before his jump at the NBA Draft Combine.
This is why.
On Thursday, the 18-year-old posted a 44.5-inch vertical leap, second-highest in combine history, according to FanDuel.
On his first attempt, the 6'5" Diallo nearly cleared the measuring mechanism entirely:
Hamidou Diallo nearly cleared the vertical on his first try so they brought in stuff to make it go higher. Ridiculous leaping ability. https://t.co/BstSRKAobx
Kay Felder, now with the Cleveland Cavaliers, "unofficially" reached the second-highest vertical last year after former University of Memphis star D.J. Stephens flew 46 inches in 2013.

Cleveland Browns rookie tight end David Njoku, drafted 29th overall out of Miami, made a big-time blunder Thursday night.
While attending a dinner for rookies, Njoku asked one of the speakers if he was a coach.
He was not.
That speaker was offensive tackle Joe Thomas, one of the best Browns in recent memory.
Both players laughed it off:

So, when Kenny "The Jet" Smith took out a couple of champagne bottles, the 54-year-old Barkley braced himself.
Smith gave one to his co-star and poured another all over him. Shaquille O’Neal joined in, curiously slapping Barkley on top of the head as The Jet emptied the bottle.
It was Chuck's second time winning the award.
"You never won a championship, but you won some Emmys, brother!" Smith teased.

Former Washington Huskies guard Markelle Fultz is a staunch protector of the rim—just ask these kids.

Sunday’s Triple-A matchup between the Reno Aces and Sacramento River Cats at Raley Field was delayed due to a snake on the diamond.
Yes, a snake.
Jack Reinheimer—a prospect for the Arizona Diamondbacks, appropriately enough—spotted the serpent in the bottom of the third inning and alerted the umpires.
"I asked the umpire, 'Do we just keep playing?'” Reinheimer told MiLB.com’s Gerard Gilberto. “I don't know if we're supposed to try and pick it up and get it off the field, but I'm not laying out for a ball if it's right there.”
Dunno, looks like a diamondback to us. @Aces @Dbacks #SnakeGate2017 https://t.co/r025fTKLqu
It turned out to be a harmless garden snake, so the grounds crew shoveled it into a bucket and removed it from the field.
"I was glad I didn't have to like go and grab it or something," Reinheimer said.
The Aces won, 6-5.

In the top of the first inning Sunday, Arizona Wildcats freshman softball player Jessie Harper smashed a grand slam against the UCLA Bruins. It was Harper's 19th blast of the season and, according to the team site, her second grand slam of the week.
Harper’s home run ball soared over the left-field fence and smashed into a car windshield.
That was either bittersweet for an Arizona fan—as the team won the Pac-12 championship, 7-2—or compounded matters for a UCLA supporter.

Meanwhile at UCMMA https://t.co/cnoqswYpX4
MMA fights typically end in three different ways: submission, knockout or stoppage.
The first two are self-explanatory, but Saturday’s UCMMA 51 event in London put a peculiar spin on the third.
In what was the opening round of the WCMMA Light Heavyweight Title, per Twitter user @Jolassanda, Yu-Joe Lewis Lai (red and white trunks) kept running from his opponent, Beau West.
Clearly injured and trying to buy himself time, Lai went unconventional when presented with a fight-or-flight dilemma, doing everything he could to extend the match.
In the end, the unusual strategy worked, as Lai defeated West via referee stoppage after West was unable to continue after Round 2.
Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said Lai lost the bout at the end of Round 1. We regret the error.

But in Saturday night’s Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals versus the Utah Jazz, the bruising big man scored seven points to Thompson’s six—and he made sure to let the world know.
First, Pachulia closed his postgame press conference by ensuring reporters were aware of the point totals, per FiveThirtyEight’s Chris Herring:
Zaza, as he finishes his press conference: "I finished w more points than Klay did."
Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant laughed when told about the stat, via Def Pen Hoops:
Later, Zaza posted a selfie with Thompson, clearly being a good sport, along with the caption “Historical night.”

After getting swept by the Golden State Warriors in Round 1 of the NBA playoffs, Damian Lillard ensured that all postseason bonus money went to Portland Trail Blazers staff members.
According to Jason Quick of CSNNW.com, the star point guard went "from player to player" to ensure that the $16,000 each player received instead went to trainers, massage therapists and others involved with the team.
Quick also reported that veteran free-agent big man Chris Kaman was the one who inspired this back in 2014-15:
With some Blazers teams, the locker room leadership was not always as generous. Three seasons ago, when veteran Chris Kaman joined the team, he became appalled that the Blazers were keeping their playoff checks. Kaman, who became close with Lillard, told him if he ever led a team he should insist on getting the guys to donate to underscore the importance of unity and having one's back.
Props to Lillard for following through and also to his teammates, who should be commended for their generosity.

According to NFL Network’s Nate Burleson, Marshawn Lynch’s day begins with a workout at the same time every morning: 6:24.
Here’s the former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver on Good Morning Football:
"Yesterday I had lunch with a good friend of mine, Mitch [Grossbach], who actually runs his Beast Mode brand. So we’re just having a conversation about Marshawn Lynch, and he says Marshawn Lynch wakes up every morning at 6:24 a.m.—6:24 a.m.—and does a couple hundred pushups, a couple hundred situps and then gets back in the bed. Every single morning. So, for people who think he’s not in shape, this man has been doing it since he retired."
Burleson confirmed that the peculiar wake-up time is a nod to Lynch’s jersey number.
This anecdote will bring a smile to any Oakland Raiders fan’s face.

Adam Jones getting a standing ovation at Fenway Park on Tuesday was a moment. We love moments. Sports, after all, is a collection of them more so than games, seasons, or even careers. You remember Jordan’s jumper over Craig Ehlo like it happened 20 seconds ago, but how much of that actual game can you recall from memory? A moment can be a shorthand for an emotion or a symbol for something greater, which Colin Kaepernick understood when he sat for the playing of the national anthem. It can be more powerful than any word spoken, at least that was the hope Tuesday as the Red Sox faithful stood to shower Jones with affection the day after a single word made him national news.
The thing we often forget about moments, though, is what has led up to them. What was the score of that Bulls/Cavs game? Why was Jordan’s shot so important and why was it so devastating to Cleveland? Why is someone calling a baseball player the N-word in Fenway Park so shocking and reprehensible, so full of gravity, that CC Sabathia would say he’s never been called that in any ballpark except Fenway?

The Red Sox were the last team to integrate, adding their first black player in 1959. Sox owner Tom Yawkey famously tried out Jackie Robinson in 1945, then allowed him and two other Negro Leagues players to be subjected to racist taunts from the stands. Yawkey’s reluctance to sign African-American players would, for years, be associated with the infamous Red Sox curse, eventually lifted in one of those grand “moments” in 2004. But racial animosity persisted at Fenway. In 2013, during the ALCS, a Red Sox fan allegedly screamed “Bye, Trayvon” at a Detroit Tigers fan. (Barry Bonds also refused to play there, telling the Boston Globe that the town was “too racist for me” and that “it ain’t changing.”)
Outside of sports, Boston has a checkered history when it comes to race. In 1965, the state of Massachusetts passed legislation requiring public schools in the state to integrate. After schools in Boston defied the law for nearly a decade, the NAACP sued the Boston School Committee and won. The subsequent busing plan led to flare-ups of violence and racial tension in the mid-1970s, just as the Red Sox, still owned by Yawkey, were on the rise in the American League. In 1975, they went to the World Series but lost to the Cincinnati Reds in seven games. That season, the Sox didn’t start a single African-American position player on Opening Day, though their Cuban pitcher, Luis Tiant, had a father who played in the Negro Leagues.

In 2017, there were only 62 African-American players on Opening Day rosters in Major League Baseball. That’s essentially two African-American players per team, if you divided it equally (and rounded down).
It’s tempting to see this as a moment, a controversy that can simply be clapped away. Even Jones himself felt that the problem could be mitigated by leveling fines. But moments are brief and life goes on. We want to cast this as a symptom of Boston’s segregated culture and geography, or worse, to wave it off as the actions of a few “bad apples.” What so many of us fail to recognize is the world outside the moment, and the inequality that exists outside Boston.

It would feel nice to throw my own, metaphorical peanuts at the city of Boston. After all, here I am in the multicultural paradise of Los Angeles. Every other face you see at Dodger Stadium is brown. The Mexican community here is the heart of our sports fandom, and yet the stadium is an enduring reminder of the Chicano community that was ripped out by former Dodgers owner Walter O’Malley and the city government to make way for baseball in Chavez Ravine. Families were displaced, and a planned public housing development in the area was scrapped.
If we say that Boston is unique, we forget that school busing controversies occurred in places like Los Angeles and Las Vegas, too, and that racist chants can happen anywhere, even a high school basketball game in New Jersey in the year 2017. It’s more comforting to say either “it could never happen here” or “it could only happen there.” It’s dangerous to say that just because you’ve never personally witnessed racism, that there’s no possible way it exists. The Boston crowd cheering for Adam Jones was a hell of a moment, one that wraps a tidy bow on an ugly story—but it was just a moment. We all have to live with the rest of it.

Atlanta Falcons first-round pick Takkarist McKinley turned heads at the NFL draft by letting a few curse words fly on stage while holding a picture of his deceased grandmother.
"Fine me later, man!" he said.
On Monday, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that, despite his willingness to pay up, the former UCLA defensive end will not be fined:
New #Falcons LB Takk McKinley famously said on stage “fine me later” after cursing post-pick. No worries. Source said he won’t be fined 💯💯💯
The night before, though, McKinley sparred on Twitter with Fox Sports' Clay Travis, who commented extensively on the decision to carry the picture around. 
It's important to note that Travis didn't seem to be poking fun at McKinley's grandmother. His point was about the picture itself. 
Is taking a life size picture of your dead grandma to the NFL Draft weird or cool?

I can’t stop thinking about the Grandma picture. This might be the entire first hour of @outkick tomorrow. Did he buy the picture a seat?
McKinley caught wind of Travis' tweets and fired back, writing that "the devil is alive and well...to straight disrespect someone['s] dead grandmother and think it's funny is crazy to me."

You'd think retired NBA legend Kobe Bryant would be a good resource for his oldest daughters, who play youth hoops.
Apparently, they don't care for the Mamba's wisdom.
Last week, Bryant told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show that two of his three daughters, 14-year-old Natalia and 10-year-old Gianna, have no use for his help when on the floor.
The 38-year-old five-time champion laughed it off, though.
Perhaps Bryant's youngest daughter, four-month-old Bianka Bella, will value her father's basketball credentials a bit more.

There's no denying Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver John Ross is a total blur. In March, the former Washington Huskies star broke Chris Johnson's 40-yard dash record with a 4.22 at the NFL Scouting Combine.

Prior to getting picked ninth overall by the Bengals, Ross extended a challenge to Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt.

Cupcakes have played a crucial role in the beef between former Oklahoma City Thunder teammates Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.
On Thursday night, Durant seemed to add fuel to this fire.
While posing for a picture with San Francisco Giants mascot Lou Seal, No. 35 proudly held a plate of the small desserts, a reference that goes all the way back to the day he joined the Golden State Warriors.
Hours after Durant's announcement, Westbrook posted an Instagram picture of a Fourth of July-themed cupcake display.
Sports Illustrated's Lee Jenkins confirmed in October that it was Westbrook's way of calling Durant's decision "soft":

@DeshaunWatson4 is brought to tears as he reads a letter from his mom. #NFLDraft https://t.co/8Z0QMTfuxT
The NFL draft can be emotional—especially for players who were "not supposed to be here."
After being selected 12th overall by the Houston Texans on Thursday night, former Clemson Tigers star quarterback Deshaun Watson read a letter from his mother. It talked about "love, happiness and longtime success," drawing tears from the 21-year-old.
The letter closed with a 2013 rap line: "In the words of Drake, we made it. Love, Mom."
Watson, the hero of the 2017 NCAA championship game against Alabama, was clearly touched.

It's the most wonderful time of the year, at least if your idea of wonderful is in-depth analysis of college football prospects. Looking to get a slightly clearer (but still extremely inaccurate) picture of which NFL teams will select which players, and in which round of the draft they will select said players? You have options.
Given how many variables go into NFL front office decisions, mock drafts are a futile exercise, yet we all read them anyway—and, as the folks over at Twitter noticed, tweet about them.
Hot draft takes have flooded even the most mock-agnostic timelines for the past few weeks, and since the draft starts Thursday, the timing was perfect to crunch the numbers for a consensus Twitter mock: Which teams and players were mentioned together by the 328 million or so Twitter users the most?
The Twitter data team took a sample size of one week's worth of tweets (April 13-20) and now delivers the definitive Twitter NFL mock draft. If a player was mentioned the same number of times with multiple teams, Twitter deferred to the organization with the higher draft pick. Of the top 10, four match up with Bleacher Report's latest mock—so either our takes are hot or Twitter is more is more realistic than we thought.

On the night of the draft, Twitter will also be tracking which players get the most buzz based on the number of tweets/mentions-per-minute they get, which will help predict the draft's most popular stories.
Do your #takes match up with those of the Twitterverse? Check out the results of the mock draft below, exclusive to Bleacher Report:

“[W]hen @bensimmons ask you why you had him sittiin out in the hallway so long & you tell him shouldn't you be useta sittin out by now? (don't think he like the joke tho)”
Simmons fired back, writing on his own page that he wished Future performed instead:

Scottish soccer fan Lewis Elliott struck gold over the weekend.
On Saturday, he played a three-game parlay under a specific stipulation: Every team had to score at least once in each half.
Elliott wasn't picking winners—he simply bet the rough equivalent of $4 U.S. that a surplus of balls would find the net. It turned into over $26,000.
The reality of what was at play seemed to set in before Chelsea and Tottenham played:

This is what efficiency looks like.
On April 5, New York bowler Ben Ketola used 10 lanes to complete a perfect game in 86.9 seconds, which is believed to be a world record, per M.F. Piraino for Syracuse.com.
The two-handed bowler rolled and ran—there was no time for standing and watching. After going 12-for-12, though, he celebrated.
Ketola, who works at 281 Bowl, said he was inspired by a 2015 video of professional bowler Tom Daugherty, who performed the feat in one minute, 50.99 seconds. Ketola said he bowls at least 50 games a week, and his average is 225.
"It was fun to do. I honestly wasn't expecting to do it," he told Piraino. "I just wanted to see how quickly I could get across the house and get strikes."

Remember, Waka and Gronkowski have history—he performed on the infamous Gronk's Party Ship last summer.
According to DJ Whoo Kid, though, he and Waka were banned from the cruise for what TMZ called a "poop prank."

Jordan Spieth played a Masters practice round with Tom Brady: https://t.co/vqGNxiLzDE https://t.co/l34dxr5MeU
Reigning Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady hit the links with 2015 Masters winner Jordan Spieth on Monday.
He posted a picture alongside his 23-year-old fellow Under Armour athlete from Hogan Bridge at Augusta National Golf Club.
TB-12 said in the caption that trying to beat Spieth in golf "is like trying to arm wrestle [Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson]."
Translation: It's impossible.
T.J. Auclair of PGA.com pointed out that "No. 12, as you remember, is the hole that did in Spieth at last year's Masters when he took a five-shot lead into the back nine."
The Masters begin April 6.

Over the weekend, an alligator at Florida's Long Marsh golf course in Rotonda West chomped down on a player's ball before slowly returning to the water.
This was a normal-sized gator—not one of those CGI-looking ones—but it was certainly intimidating. Was its decision to snack on the ball all that surprising, though?
Daniel McNamara told WPTV Channel 5 he was on the third hole when his ball hit the reptile. Interesting that the camera was already out.
Pro tip: If you don't want an alligator to eat your ball, don't hit said alligator with said ball.

.@10TV sooooo who the hell won the basketball game? https://t.co/qXP9tkOMrV
This is the stuff of nightmares.
Instead of watching the Kentucky Wildcats and North Carolina Tar Heels duke it out in an exhilarating Elite Eight finish Sunday night, college basketball fans in Ohio were forced to look at a black screen.
As noted by SB Nation's Morgan Moriarty, "the CBS local news station in the area cut into the game's feed for a breaking news alert for severe weather in the area." The channel was blank aside from a strip across the top that read "weather alert."
Here are some examples:

Video games are often the best tool for fans to see how opposing superstars would look in their favorite team's laundry, but as it turns out, the pros do it too.
Safety Tony Jefferson told NFL.com's Brooke Cersosimo he checked out Madden NFL to see how he looked in the uniforms of his free-agent suitors, landing on the Baltimore Ravens and favoring the team's black-on-black alternate combo.
"I am a guy of swagger, so I gotta check the swag at all points before I make a decision," Jefferson said. "I put myself in different uniforms on Madden to see what will look better. Ravens did look good, though."
Jefferson didn't just pick the Ravens because of their uniforms, as he explained to The MMQB's Andy Benoit, but Ben Haumiller, a producer for Madden, tells Bleacher Report the EA Sports team regularly interacts with players, mostly fielding complaints over their in-game ratings.

"Everyone has an opinion, especially about themselves," Haumiller says. "We're not going to bend over backwards for anybody and make everyone a 99 just to make people feel happy. It's got to be grounded in reality and comparative to the rest of the league. People's 40 times go a long way to dictating their speed rating. Their three-cone drill does a lot for their agility."
One player complaint, however, sticks out.
New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was not happy with his speed rating his rookie season. Beckham reached out to Madden to complain, and the producers wanted definitive proof. So after practice one day, Beckham filmed a hand-held video where he raced against teammates with higher speed ratings in the game. Along with the video came a note.
"I'm faster than you guys give me credit for," Beckham wrote.
It was enough for the Madden team to boost up the rating. Beckham started his rookie season in the 70s but ended the year in the low 90s.
Trying to get my @EAMaddenNFL receiving rating up! https://t.co/PSjrVX7z8B
"That happens a lot," Haumiller says. "If they can show us some sort of proof, if they can prove what they did or if they didn't lift at the combine because of a shoulder injury, if they can prove what they did bench back when they were healthy, we can use that to inform ratings."
Often players will take their complaints about their attributes directly to Twitter or vocalize their displeasure in the media.
Raiders punter Marquette King complained about his throwing power on a podcast and wanted a boost. After discussions with some Madden producers, King's throwing power was upgraded, but—as the Beckham case showed—it's not always easy to get a higher rating in the game.

In terms of Tony Jefferson, though, Haumiller was surprised to hear about the video game's role in the San Diego native's life-changing decision.
"We've heard a lot of players over the years talk about their affinity for Madden and their love for Madden," Haumiller says. "This is a first for us, though. I don't think I've ever heard of any player who said he cycled through uniform options to help decide where they were going to go."
Haumiller says the team at Madden previously had a dialogue with Jefferson when the Ravens safety realized his face wasn't scanned into the game. Jefferson, however, said he remembered going through the process before he stepped foot onto an NFL field.
"He started tweeting at us," Haumiller says. "We found his scan, and it's going through the pipes right now, so he's got a face in the game this year from the scan he did with us previously." Most players get their face scanned into the game during the NFL combine.

Haumiller says the game still holds a lot of utility for players in other ways as well. Often, it can serve as the benchmark for players to finally process that they've made the NFL.
For foreign players, such as Bjoern Werner and Moritz Boehringer, it can serve as a training tool to understand the game. Former NFL running back Ahman Green uses Madden to help teach concepts to the teams he coaches.
But first and foremost, it serves as a barometer for many players to stack themselves against one another.
"Historically, Emmitt Smith was the only guy who said he was too fast in Madden," Haumiller says. "Every year, players complain about their speed. Now they know everything about the game and they've got a direct pipeline. If they don't like it, they're going to let us know."

Big Blue Nation fans at a bar in Lexington experienced a roller coaster of emotions in the final seconds of the Kentucky Wildcats' loss Sunday night.
First, freshman Malik Monk sent them into a frenzy with a clutch three-pointer that evened the score at 73 against the North Carolina Tar Heels with 7.2 seconds left.
UNC countered on its next possession, though. Sophomore Luke Maye buried a game-winner with 0.3 seconds left, and those poor bar patrons collapsed into a puddle of devastation.

LaVar Ball has made it clear he thinks that in his prime, he could've overpowered NBA icon Michael Jordan in a one-on-one game.
To the tape we go.
Over the weekend, video emerged of Lonzo Ball's dad playing in a 2002 men's league contest in Chino, California, according to YouTube user David Lee, who played in the game. The video picked up steam when re-posted by The Hoops Column page. Lee also posted footage on his Twitter account.
The video is edited, so it should be taken with a grain of salt. Ball has a couple of highs and several lows:
If Lee's timeline is correct, the 48-year-old Ball would be 33 in this video.
[Twitter, YouTube, h/t Charlotte Observer]

Years before LaVar Ball and his sons—including NBA-bound UCLA Bruins guard Lonzo Ball—became a national story, he was a professional football player.
As uncovered by ESPN.com's Rich Cimini, Ball was at the bottom of the New York Jets depth charts in the mid-1990s. He was a defensive end in his rookie year under Pete Carroll but changed to a tight end a year later once Rich Kotite took over.
LaVar Ball was a member of the #Jets training camp in 94 &amp; 95 😳

(📸 Via @RichCimini) https://t.co/V2dYkOHShl
Ball never appeared in an NFL game, but Cimini reported it's possible he checked in during the preseason.
Former linebacker Marvin Jones told Cimini that he remembers Ball "very well."
"He was a very athletic guy and raw," Jones said. "I remember him very well because he played only one year of college football. I remember a very confident guy and, yes, he voiced his opinion and was cocky, but overall seemed like a great guy."
On March 13, USA Today's Josh Peter passed along Ball's take on trying out for the Washington State football team as a tight end in the basketball offseason:
[Head coach Dennis] Erickson said, "Oh, you're awesome, you're good to go. But LaVar, they're going to know it's a different play if we don't have you blocking." I go, "Well, you got these big dudes, let them block. And I'll tell you this, out of four downs, I need the ball twice. If I don't have it twice, I'm gone."
He seemed like the same guy back then.

This play embodies how things have been going for the Atlanta Hawks.
During the team's seventh straight loss Sunday afternoon, Brooklyn Nets second-year forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson climbed the ladder on Hawks rookie Taurean Prince.
It looked like RHJ exaggerated the contact in hopes of drawing a whistle that never came, but it was still a huge dunk.
Brooklyn's bench went wild, and the Nets won, 107-92.

With former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick still unsigned, Cleveland Browns offensive tackle Joe Thomas offered his opinion on Twitter:
My thoughts re: @Kaepernick7? Teams don't currently view him as a starting QB, and NFL teams accept ZERO distractions from their backup QBs.
The six-time All-Pro seemed particularly focused on the nebulous term "distraction," which is one of the knocks against Kaepernick:
Great point! It'll be interesting to see if the NFL has changed at all from that standpoint, or if they are more averse to distractions now https://t.co/QaFNg9XWZY
It's come to my attention that many ppl have different ideas of what a "distraction" is in regards to an NFL plyr. I need a poll for this https://t.co/MgfAEFtAGj
Was @Kaepernick7 a distraction for the 49ers last year?
I think mine would be; anytime a player does something that forces his teammates to answer questions from media unrelated to football.
Last comment on this topic, I think "distractions" are one of the more highly overrated intangible things in football. Like "camaraderie".
Good teams don't LET themselves be distracted.
The distraction Thomas alluded to, of course, involves Kap's decision to kneel during the national anthem last year, and the firestorm that surrounded the protest. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported in early March that Kaepernick will stand next season.
While it might be true that the team that signs Kaepernick will invite an onslaught of media coverage and backlash from some fans or even personnel, the 29-year-old nearly won a Super Bowl in 2013.
He might be a better option than Cody Kessler or Brock Osweiler, at least in 2017.

Air Max 1 “Red”—Tinker Hatfield’s Air Max 1 changed everything. Technology became smarter and looked better. The original Air Max 1 didn’t simply fall into place, it helped send Nike into the MTV generation with savvy, timeless design elements. —Giancarlo King


Air Max 95 Stash—The Air Max 95 Stash marked the first time speckled paint was used on any 95 model. Released in 2006, this helped reinvigorate the line. A gradient effect covering the upper turned the Air Max 95 Stash into a must-own pair. —Giancarlo King


Air Max Safari—The Nike Air Safari debuted in 1987 and was one of the first luxury sneakers in a market obsessed with performance. Without the safari, there might not be a Yeezy boost. It moved the conversation toward that of the casual consumer. —Ishaan Mishra


Air Max 97 “Silver”—Ten years after the Air Max 1, Nike gave us the Air Max 97 “Silver.” This shoe ushered the AM line into the next decade. Developed to look like a high-speed train, the “Silver” 97 marks a zenith period for Nike’s creativity. —Giancarlo King


Air Max 1 “Liquid Gold”—Considering how important it is, the Air Max 1 should be enshrined forever. The “Liquid Gold” version was a step in the right direction, stylizing the best of Tinker’s initial design without compromising on quality. —Giancarlo King



Nike Air Max 98 Supreme—Timeless silhouette meets a risky snakeskin. The "hypebeasts" needed this and so did the casual "sneakerheads." Supreme delivered on a one of a kind pair. Now we wait on the next one. —Dimetri Francis



Air Max 90 “Infrared”—Tinker Hatfield’s third design, the Air Max 90 “Infrared,” remains classic. The “Infrared” colorway will always remind us of the Air Max 90. No sneaker since has looked better with those tones splashed across their canvas. —Giancarlo King


Air Max 1 "Atmos"—In 2016, Nike asked the world which Air Max model should come back to life. Sneaker fans made their choice clear, yelling for the “Atmos” Air Max 1. The people spoke and we listened. The “Atmos” 1 is now a legacy shoe. —Giancarlo King



Air Max Moon Landing—This sneaker harkens to a time of innovation. Whether it is the Lunarlon, the reflective 3M, the flag back panels or Tinker's beloved air bubble, every segment of this shoe is about changing the game and remembering those who did. —Ishaan Mishra



Nike Vapormax—The latest Air Max tech breakthrough by Nike has led to one of the more polarizing sneakers in recent memory. But the sheer sense of awe from this shoe has outweighed everything, making the Vapormax instantly impactful. —Maurice Peebles

It's easy to think about a team's fanbase following a devastating loss.
But what about those who police said fans?
After the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks lost to the third-seeded Oregon Ducks, 74-60, in the Elite Eight on Saturday night in Kansas City, Missouri, the Lawrence, Kansas, police department started cracking jokes:
Well, at least we have a lot of experience dealing with fans after an #Elite8 loss. Get home safely Jayhawk fans. #DriveSober
Things seemed quiet after a second straight regional final loss for the Jayhawks:
Only 1 disturbance reported so far. Pretty somber mood downtown. No streakers. #GrieveSafely #DriveSober
Officers arrived on a disturbance downtown before it could escalate. Guys, we're all sad but the cops downtown didn't disappear. Stay classy
Still no issues to report downtown. kstate, mizzou and wich st fans @'ing us about "choking" in the elite 8. Your trolling is subpar.
Then, it got weird:
An intoxicated guy tried to pull a tree out of the ground. His friend carried him off before he could succeed. It's not the trees fault man
Earlier in the day, the department prepared for what it hoped would be a celebration (pictured above).
It also warned against streaking:

Never seen a team do this before. Warriors are having Stop "Ticket" Fraud Night on Sunday https://t.co/PI2sqTh16U
The Golden State Warriors are cracking down on ticket scams.
According to a press release, the Dubs are going to host a "Stop Fraud Night" at Oracle Arena when the Memphis Grizzlies come to town Sunday. ESPN's Darren Rovell passed along the image of a shirt that will be given to attending fans.
The release detailed how widespread rip-off tickets have become. Before the Warriors' 99-86 loss to the Boston Celtics on March 8, 58 fans were denied access since they unknowingly bought counterfeit tickets. Those fans will be in attendance Sunday.
This is dope @warriors https://t.co/4L4M2b9IvM
Over 1,000 fans in total have been turned away from Oracle this season.
The Warriors have become one of the hottest tickets in sports, so it's understandable this has become a growing problem. While there's not a ton Golden State can do—the team has no control over third-party sites—it deserves props for spreading awareness.

New York Mets shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera was ejected from Thursday's 1-0 spring training loss to the Washington Nationals.
He took his sweet time leaving the field.
The 31-year-old was displeased about not being granted a timeout early in his fourth-inning plate appearance. After singling to right-center field, he let umpire Angel Hernandez hear about it on his way to first base.
Hernandez tossed Cabrera, who strolled toward the outfield gate in outrageously slow fashion.

When wondering how I might die one day, the image typically involves my body being swallowed up by a mountain of empty pizza boxes or fast-food wrappers. Now, I'm forced to consider the notion of a 1,500-pound Shaquille O'Neal falling on my head.
On Friday, the Los Angeles Lakers and AEG will officially christen a statue commemorating the legacy of the Hall of Fame center in a ceremony in front of the Staples Center. The bronze recreation of O'Neal, designed by Omri Amrany and Julie Rotblatt-Amrany, joins statues of Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West, Oscar de la Hoya and Lakers announcer Chick Hearn in the arena courtyard across from the L.A. Live entertainment complex.
What sets the Shaq statue apart from the rest is its placement. Technically, it's not even in said courtyard. It's high above it, affixed to a ceiling and next to a window, with the Big Aristotle hanging post-dunk and wearing a grimace that Twitter has likened to the face of WWE Hall of Famer "Stone Cold" Steve Austin.
So you can understand my trepidation about walking underneath a massive bronze Shaquille O'Neal in earthquake-prone Los Angeles.
Thank You Buss Family! #speechless https://t.co/vkcKtKB7i6
Omri Amrany came up with the idea for suspending a statue above arenagoers 25 years ago, and Shaq ended up being the perfect person to make his vision come to life.
"When I talked to the Lakers management, the discussion was ... people want to touch Shaquille," Amrany told Bleacher Report over the phone from his home in Illinois. "I said, 'Yes, people want to touch Shaquille—but wouldn't it be stronger to have the quest to touch instead of (actually) touching?'"
Amrany also designed all the other statues at Staples, plus the Wilt Chamberlain piece in Philadelphia, and, most famously, the iconic Michael Jordan statue in front of the United Center. His aim in all of these projects was to capture the essence of the player and to preserve it for all time.
"Kareem is known for the hook shot, Jerry [West] is known for the moves and Magic was known for the coordination and capability. Michael Jordan was known for the spread eagle," he said. "When we did Wilt Chamberlain in Philadelphia, we emphasized the dunking. Everybody had their niche. Shaquille is very well known for the slam and hanging by the rim. How do you do it without touching the ground? That was the question from the beginning."

The bronze Shaq is nine feet tall, and according to Amrany, 1,500 pounds, though the official Lakers press release lists it as 1,200. But what's 300 pounds? To me, that says that if the bronze Diesel fell on me, I might die a little slower.
It will sit 10 feet off the ground, which means unless you are as tall as Shaq, or at least have something resembling an NBA vertical leap, you'll never be able to touch it. This is a drastic departure from the Chick Hearn piece—a recreation of the play-by-play man at the announcer's table calling a game. There's even a second seat for you to sit down and pose for photos.
"Julie and I worked to create Chick Hearn, knowing that the Lakers would have to routinely maintain the table and the chair. It's like the nose of Lincoln or some pieces of bronze of a sculpture in Europe, because people always touch it for luck. So here, the chair and the table and part of the shoulders are always abused by people—and I would say 'abused' in a positive way—who want to take photographs."
For Amrany, Shaq had to be different. He had to be unattainable.
"I feel [with the Shaq statue] that instead of the touching and hugging, it's the desire," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if people spent their time jumping, trying to touch it, which is OK, you know? It's part of how people use contemporary art today—the interaction with the public."

But, quite frankly, I'm more concerned with it interacting with my head. I have to ask him, is it safe?
"We worked with three different engineers to engineer this piece that will be safe and sound and strong. Second, we're working with a group of very good California welders from Burbank, who are working with AEG behind the scenes to make sure everything is strong."
I'm not aware of Burbank welders having an international reputation for craftsmanship, but I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.
"I requested a payload of 10,000 pounds strength. That's 10 times more than other pieces," he continued.
That's better. Nothing calms me down like math.
The Shaq statue is Amrany's most ambitious, most nerve-racking piece yet, but he's hard at work on his next project—a 50-foot tall likeness of Johnny Cash to be erected in Folsom, California.
"We did Napoleon Dynamite for 20th Century Fox [in 2014]," he said. "We're working with cities like Folsom. We're working with memorial organizations, tributes for different cases, and, of course, with the sport."

Part of why Amrany is so in demand is the vaunted place statues hold in the cultural psyche. Sure, the dangling Shaq statue is terrifying to me, but for most fans, these works of art inspire awe and respect. It's, as Amrany suggested, an opportunity for average people to reach out and interact with something they deem greater than themselves. Sure, it's also a bit of idol worship, but that's just part of the human condition. We crave heroes, figures of esteem responsible for feats beyond our wildest dreams.
Some people might disagree, but the sports statue is an intrinsic part of a franchise's identity and means something to the average fan who throws down hundreds of dollars to be a part of the action. When the real people are gone, like Chick Hearn, these statues give us the chance to remember what we loved about them.
In a way, my own nervous feelings about Shaq squashing me are how I will choose to remember his playing days. He was a fearsome, unstoppable scoring machine whose size and speed were unmatched. Amrany's job is to sort out how to make a statue as memorable as the subject it's based on.
"I think that what makes something memorable is if in 200 years," he said, "people look back and say it was the right thing to do for its time."
If you're reading this 200 years in the future, shoot us a tweet and let us know.
THAT HURT
https://t.co/4onXQp8Tsa
Big man Pero Antic played two seasons with the Atlanta Hawks before heading to Fenerbahce of the Turkish Basketball Super League in 2015.
On Thursday, Antic punched teammate Nikola Kalinic—by accident.
Following a block in the fourth quarter of a tight game, the 34-year-old swung his fist in blind celebration. Unfortunately for Kalinic, Antic's punch clocked him in the face.
Clearly not thrilled initially, Kalinic was able to laugh it off. Adding to the pain, though, was an 80-77 loss to Anadolu Efes.

BREAKING: Hungarian player invents new free throw rule on the fly, seems pleased with results 🤔 https://t.co/cSqt6hgb41
Andrija Bojic is not your conventional free-throw shooter.
During a game in the Hungary A Division league earlier this week, the Serbian forward, playing for Jaszbereny, went through his normal routine at the charity stripe.
Then he took one dribble and dunked.
The violation was obvious, but Bojic's reasoning was not. The slam appears to have happened late in a March 19 blowout loss in which the 23-year-old struggled from the line, shooting 4-of-13.
He finished with 28 points in an 88-73 loss to KTE-Duna Aszfalt, and perhaps the dunk was his way of blowing off steam.

High schooler Robert Bobroczky stands 7'7" and has some nice touch on his shot. Watch the video above to learn more about him.

Our inaugural B/R Kicks Madness tournament has already seen the first round come and go and with it 32 pairs of kicks that couldn't best their competition. Now it's time to cut the field in half again. It's Sweet 16 time, folks. See below for the results and be sure to let us know how you feel via Twitter, Instagram and/or Facebook.
 

THREE STRIPES REGION
The Three-Stripe Region’s Sweet 16 was all about upsets.
First up on the docket was the No. 8-seeded Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 "Pirate Black" prevailing against the No. 1-seeded Adidas Yeezy 750 Boost "Chocolate." This Yeezy on Yeezy crime was a match-up everybody debated over. When the final buzzer rang, the "Pirate Black" won based on the fact it has become synonymous with West’s mainstream sneaker appeal.
Continuing its rise toward the Final Four, Pharrell’s NMD x Human Race—slotted into the No. 12 position—was able to advance past the super-popular Adidas NMD "OG." This wasn’t easy, but based on exclusivity, a series of dynamic colorways and Pharrell’s towering influence, the ingredients for an upset were all there.
On the same grounds, No. 10 seed NMD x Bape took down the No. 2-seeded Yeezy Boost 350 V2 "Beluga." We went from complete Yeezy madness to having one pair left vying for a championship.
The only contest that didn’t produce a shocking result was the Ultra Boost "Triple Black" cruising past the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 "Zebra." Considering the entire Ultra Boost lineup produces sell-outs—despite being delivered in large quantities—what the "Triple Black" did was more impressive than what the hyper-limited "Zebra" Yeezy release did in early 2017.


SWOOSH REGION
Fans were left running out of the building when the No. 8 Nike Special Field Air Force One beat down the No. 1-seeded Air Mag. When you start a conversation about why the result makes sense.
Let’s be clear: The Nike SF-1 helped redefine the Air Force One product. For years it remained stagnant—minus John Geiger’s "Misplaced Checks" series. With the SF-1, the shoe is now back to shifting the culture. The Air Mag’s limited release schedule—through raffle entries—doesn’t compare to what the SF-1 has done for Nike this year.
Other than that dramatic downing of a No. 1 seed, the rest of the bracket fell into place. The Nike x Acronym Air Presto, Kobe 11 "Fade to Black" and HyperAdapt 1.0 all went about their business and advanced.
 

JUMPMAN REGION
The closer we edge toward the Jumpman Region’s Elite 8, the more we begin to see classics take control. There wasn’t a genuine surprise in the Sweet 16. Based on seeding alone, you could say the "Space Jam" XI beating out the "Black Toe" I qualifies. But who really thought the "Space Jam" XI was going down this early?
As expected, the Air Jordan I "Bred" and "OVO" XII managed to keep venturing forward. Both sneakers—seeded No. 1 and 2, respectively—are in the running to win the whole thing.
From upset city to legit contender, the Air Jordan III "True Blue" continued to soar as the No. 11 seed. The shoe conquered its predecessor, the Air Jordan IV "Cement," in what turned out to be a thrilling duel.
 

MEGA MIX REGION
The Mega Mix Region is shaping up to be the most exciting portion of the bracket. Conflicting matchups pitting various companies against each other has made for serious debates and full email inboxes.
In the Sweet 16, two prominent Reebok Questions faced off. The winner turned out to be the No. 5-seeded Reebok Question "OG"—the defining sneaker of Allen Iverson’s professional career.
There weren’t too many upsets to be had this time around. In fact, all of the higher seeds moved on. What we now have is two Reeboks and two Asics left. Which company will emerge from the highly decorated Mega Mix Region? You'll just have to follow along and see.
 
Stay tuned for the Elite 8!

The Brooklyn Nets won (for a change) Tuesday night, and they did so in walk-off fashion.
With 2.4 seconds remaining and the Nets deadlocked at 96 against the Detroit Pistons, Brook Lopez peeled toward the sideline and caught an inbounds pass from Randy Foye. The big fella took one dribble, faded back and offered a one-handed floater as he neared the baseline at the horn.
Lopez nailed it and proceeded to strut along the sideline. He finished with a game-high 29 points on 13-of-24 shooting to go along with seven boards.
The Nets are still a league-worst 14-56 with the victory. Detroit slid into ninth place in the Eastern Conference at 34-37.

Pittsburgh Penguins star forward Sidney Crosby had an eventful first period Tuesday night.
First, he cup-checked Buffalo Sabres center Ryan O'Reilly, who either failed the inspection or was trying to draw a call. Either way, he crumbled to the ice.
Later, Crosby scored an absolutely dazzling one-handed goal:
Yoooooooo Sidney Crosby https://t.co/kS8uUvIW21

Drake's sports fandom is as prolific as his catalog, but luckily for him, it's a two-way lovefest as athletes of all stripes have made him ubiquitous from the practice field to the locker room to the after-party. With the release of his latest album (OK, "playlist") More Life last Saturday (March 18), the Toronto MC/singer/monolith has already inspired record-breaking streaming numbers and praise from athletes across the board.
Cincinnati Bengals running back Giovani Bernard is one of the album's early fans, and he told B/R why he'll be bumping More Life into next season.

 
"I'm a Drake fan, definitely. I mean that's what's being played in the locker rooms just about every day. He's on top of his game, and so his music's everywhere: the locker rooms, but also in people's cars, in the club—wherever you go, you hear his voice.
"I was actually just playing it on my Beats Pill in the locker room, here in Cincinnati. Drake's already here! In general, I'm very low-key. I don't like hardcore rap—the, 'Oh I'm about to kill you,' kind of thing? I don't need any of that. It’s more about just sitting back in my car, chilling, listening. Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book was amazing. I'm a big Frank Ocean guy—[Blonde] was pretty sweet. Also old-school music—my Marvin Gaye, my Sade...I know that's really random, but it kind of tells you my favorite type of music. I’m a super vibe-y kind of guy.

"So for that, 'Do Not Disturb' is a good one, and the one with PartyNextDoor ['Since Way Back']. I'm a big PartyNextDoor fan. He's another guy that's really incorporated that island feel. 'Passionfruit' is great; I like the vibe. Granted, before a game I'm not going to listen to it—that’s when I need my heavy dosage rap. But right now, those kinds of songs are what I lean toward. I'm not playing a football game, so I don't need to get super-hyped up.
"The biggest thing was that he actually committed and did [the dancehall thing]. We haven't really heard much of that in the rap game recently, or at least in the American rap game. He adds this island feel. It's one thing that Drake does really well: He's able to cater to what everybody likes. I think that's why him and his voice are so popular throughout the world, not just in America. That's like in life in general: The more you can do, the better.
"Being Haitian [in the U.S.], listening to Caribbean music is more about the vibe—less about "Oh, I can relate to that lyric" and more about the energy that that music brings and the camaraderie that comes from it. It brings everybody together. That's the main thing about Caribbean music: It's just a big ol' party. Other cultures have those kinds of musics, but I think the Caribbean sound is particularly prominent in that atmosphere.

"To me, the patois is just his way of trying to talk to everybody. It shows his diversity. Whether he does it well or not, I think it's just the fact that he's actually trying it. You don't hear many other rappers trying to do that. He's going outside of the box, and it's working for him thus far. Also, [Rihanna] probably told him a little something about Caribbean music when they had their thing. I'm sure she had some influence [laughs]. That whole group with him, Rihanna and Party, they actually successfully bring that island feel to rap.
"You're not gonna typically hear [dancehall] in the Bengals locker room, but with this album, three or four of those songs have that Caribbean feel to them. Hopefully it will help [dancehall] creep into the locker room. We'll see."

Someone at Starbucks loves Michael Phelps.
On Monday, the most decorated Olympian in history grabbed some coffee with his wife and a friend. Phelps' cup had "The GOAT" (greatest of all time) written on it, which is funny.
But his wife's cup said "Wife of GOAT," and his friend's said "Friend of GOAT." That's hilarious.
Phelps seemed to enjoy the gesture.

Oklahoma City Thunder big men Steven Adams and Enes Kanter have produced another hilarious video in their campaign for Russell Westbrook to win MVP.
This time, they were joined by teammate Andre Roberson.
Roberson said he'd rather wrestle a snake and an alligator than guard Westbrook. While he was clearly joking, at least one fan pointed out a potential subtle shot at Kevin Durant:
@Enes_Kanter obviously Andre chose to fight a snake, he already did the last time https://t.co/DcTLDw8LUo
Westbrook's averaging a triple-double is probably his best argument, but hearing from Adams and Kanter can't hurt Russ' case.
Here's their first video:

Mike Purvis, a 3'8" high school senior, is a vital part of the Notre Dame High School basketball team. On senior night, Mike was given an opportunity to join his team on the court.
Watch the video above.
During Sunday's 4-0 victory over the Florida Panthers, Pittsburgh Penguins Patric Hornqvist and Phil Kessel converted a rare alley-oop goal.
In the first period, Kessel scooped the puck over the net and Hornqvist batted it in out of midair.
Panthers goalie James Reimer had no chance. He must've felt like Brandon Knight:
Probably the most talked about poster dunk in recent times, from DeAndre Jordan. Brandon Knight will never be forgotten. 😢 https://t.co/HIPvc49eol

After winning the NCAA title at 133, Cory Clark's celebration continued with a THROW of Iowa coach Terry Brands! #NCAAWrestling https://t.co/cWxYdl22eY
"Throw me."
That's what Iowa wrestling coach Terry Brands told Cory Clark after the latter beat South Dakota State's Seth Gross 4-3 for the 133-pound national championship on Saturday.
Clark obliged.
"I freaked out," Clark told reporters. "I didn't know what to do; [I was] kind of out of it out there. [Brands] said, 'Throw me.' I go, 'No.' He goes, 'Throw me.' I said, 'All right.' I grabbed him and threw him. So that's what happened.
"I don't know if he wants you—he probably wants it to seem like I tossed him for some reason. I didn't want to throw him; he wanted [to be] thrown. He was fired up."
Upon video review, Brands definitely called for the takedown:
Why not?! #ncaawrestling https://t.co/6CPrqey7G2

Arizona Coyotes forward Anthony Duclair is a good sport.
While meeting a family of fans after Thursday's practice, the 21-year-old read a note from four-year-old Gracie Hernandez, who practices her writing skills by penning messages to her favorite team.
Duclair, who was recently recalled from the AHL, was clearly amused by the note. According to Cristina Ledra of NHL.com, it read:
"Dear Duke, I'm Gracie, and I'm four. I love you! Are you happy to be back? Will you marry me?"
Duclair accepted her offer and hugged the young fan, as her family captured the sweet moment on video.

LeBron James and Drake go way back.
They've done concerts together—at least, Drake brought him on stage. They've exchanged words on the court—well, when LBJ was on the court. After Saturday night's release of Drizzy's More Life, it seems James and Drizzy are as tight as ever.
Remember this tweet from January?
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that i didn't lose you. Did I?!?! Did I?!?! Did I Lose You
We all thought it was a sub-shot at Charles Barkley. The King posted it in the middle of the night, and later that day, ESPN.com's Dave McMenamin passed along James' scathing rebuke of the TNT analyst.
It turns out those were just lyrics from Drake's "Lose You," the 16th track on More Life.
You did lose us for a minute there, King. Well played.

Whoever sent me this POTATO!!!! Much appreciated.... https://t.co/fVaqRvvgTn
Nothing goes together quite like basketball and potatoes.
This week, Dallas Mavericks veteran Dirk Nowitzki tweeted about a personalized potato he received in the mail. The 38-year-old loved it, though he didn't seem entirely clear on where it came from.
Golden State Warriors superstar Kevin Durant was next. He felt inspired:
Treatment and inspirational potatoes. Thanks, whoever you are. https://t.co/10IzZPmrFo
Miami Heat big man Hassan Whiteside got a spud that also featured his South Beach pal DJ Khaled:
Shoutout !!!!  To whoever sent me this Potato and tell my brother @djkhaled Another ☝🏾 https://t.co/Hl8dowjKQ9
Charlotte Hornets forward Frank Kaminsky got a picture of himself on his tater:
My actual reaction when this potato showed up #FrankThePotato https://t.co/2Ihxc4sk72
As discovered by Charles Curtis of For The Win, there's no mysterious potato bandit behind these gifts; it was a company, Potato Parcel, which got a deal with Kevin O'Leary on Shark Tank.
The potato fairy strikes again. #potato https://t.co/p82I4PAof8
Owner Riad Bekhit told Curtis that almost every player in each starting five got a potato, so about 150 were sent out. Obviously, this was a marketing campaign—and a successful one at that.
"It's just really cool," Bekhit said. "To see it in the public eye with these players, that's the beauty of the digital age."

From a 3'8" baller to a fifth grader who started on varsity, these basketball players are definitely worth watching.
Check out the video above for more!

Pittsburgh Steelers star Le'Veon Bell has been banned from attending a Wisconsin high school's prom with a student, according to Annysa Johnson of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
The do-it-all running back agreed to attend the dance with 17-year-old Steelers fan Ava Tarantino after a Twitter bet:
welllll, a deal is a deal @avatarantino26 ......see youu at your prom 😊
@L_Bell26 500 rts and you'll go to prom w me
600 &amp; it's a deal https://t.co/nUo76cmH8e
According to Johnson, though, the Waukesha School District is shutting this down.
Bell is "barred from the dance itself, according to district policy, because he is too old and was once busted for possession of marijuana and driving under the influence."
"You can Google Mr. Bell," spokeswoman Terry Schuster told Johnson, likely alluding to his history of suspensions.
Undeterred, the 25-year-old plans on bringing his mother and girlfriend to help with Tarantino's makeup. Bell is also allowed to take part in all pre-prom festivities, such as photo sessions.

This is vintage Derek Carr.
Earlier this week, the Oakland Raiders quarterback noticed someone who had ran out of gas on the side of a road in Dublin, California. The man, a music producer named Ron Reeser, hopped in with Carr, who drove to the nearest station.
"He says 'I play football' and is heavily into God and wants to become a pastor some day when he retires," Reeser told All 22 (h/t Anthony Galaviz of the Fresno Bee).
Reeser asked a few more questions while filling up his can:
He said he was a quarterback. I thought he was a college quarterback. I asked him what string he was. He said 'first string.'
I asked him his favorite team. He said, 'I may be biased, but the Raiders because I play for them.' I looked at him and said, 'Wait.' And I asked him his name. He said, 'Derek Carr.'"
The two prayed together before going their separate ways. Reeser told All 22 that Carr helped "restore my faith in people."
They exchanged messages via Twitter later on:
thank u for the help &amp; prayer today @derekcarrqb you've restored my faith in humanity &amp; appreciate u taking the time #godbless #payitforward
God bless you too! Anytime!!!! But hopefully not on the side of the road again haha https://t.co/A3ntQoUHw2

Cody Gribble has clearly never seen Happy Gilmore.
At the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Thursday, the 26-year-old golfer noticed an alligator perched near the lake. Gribble went full Steve Irwin and pushed the beast back into the water before strolling along the course.
According to the Associated Press, this is common for the Dallas native. Apparently, he does it all the time.
"They're not going to catch you a couple of steps down," Gribble told the AP. "They're going to get you really quick early, but if I'm not in its way—I'm right behind him—it's not going to happen."
Gribble also said he thought this particular gator "needed some exercise."
Despite delivering the highlight of the day, Gribble shot five over par.

Nothing says St. Patrick's Day quite like a jump shot.
To celebrate the March 17 holiday, Bleacher Report transformed Boston Celtics superstar Isaiah Thomas' smooth jumper into a coin finding a pot of gold.
It's also set to an Irish music version of Future's recent hit "Mask Off."

David Sanders unearthed the DVD and popped it into the player on Tuesday evening. Earlier that day, he received a surprise visit from a Seattle Times reporter asking about a former teammate. His 16-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son sat down with him, and they watched as his Washington State Cougars took on Bobby Knight's Indiana Hoosiers in Assembly Hall on Dec. 12, 1987.
Sanders, who averaged 12.9 points a game that season, pointed to a player pulling down a rebound and asked his children a question.
"Do you think that guy could have beaten Michael Jordan one-on-one?" 
The player, of course, was LaVar Ball, who recently told USA Today's Josh Peters that in his heyday, he could have killed Jordan in one-on-one. Although he's better known now as the boisterous father of some of the best young players in America—Lonzo is a starting guard for UCLA and a projected top-five pick in this June's NBA draft; LiAngelo is a 3-star 2017 UCLA commit; LaMelo is a 5-star 2019 UCLA commit—he was just a backup at Washington State.

Ball's only season was Kelvin Sampson's first as the Cougars' head coach; he served as an assistant for the two seasons prior. That year, Sampson remembers scrambling to put together a roster that could compete in a tough Pac-10 Conference.
"When we took over the program, we were devoid of bigs," Sampson said. "Washington State was a tough recruiting spot. But my plan was to get as many tough, hard-nosed overachievers as we could. We saw LaVar, and I just said he's the kind of kid we can start with."
Sampson was just 32 years old at the time, and he felt his proximity in age to his players gave him a special bond with them. He believes Ball acted around him the way he did around his teammates—and Ball was a character, even then.
"He was a personality, but in a good way," Sampson said. "Those were tough days for Washington State, but LaVar was someone that was always fun to be around. Everyone on the team enjoyed him."
Sanders, the team's second-leading scorer, suggests Ball was a necessary balance for an otherwise serious squad.
"There were a lot of melancholy existentialists on the team," Sanders said. "LaVar was more of a free spirit, as you can probably imagine now. His personality outshined and overwhelmed his basketball ability, but it was life-giving in the locker room."

He also provided the lowly team with some outsized confidence. Before that game against powerhouse Indiana, Sanders remembers Ball telling his teammates that the Hoosiers weren't ready for them. The Cougars kept the game surprisingly close before eventually losing by seven.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that he's a personal trainer now, Ball was in terrific shape in Pullman. Sanders jokes that Ball's body fat was 2 percent, and Todd Anderson, the fourth-leading scorer on that '88 squad, said Ball was "built like a house." At the time, though, Sampson ran a plodding and methodical offense that wasn't a great fit for Ball's skills. Ball abruptly left the team after his lone season.
"He was kind of one-and-done," Anderson said. "But not in the good way."
When Ball transferred to Division II Cal State-Los Angeles, he led the Golden Eagles in scoring (15.8 points per game) and rebounding (8.9 rebounds) and was selected as first-team All-CCAA. His head coach at Cal State, Henry Dyer, even compared him and a fellow frontcourt player, Bruce Turner, to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, respectively.
"I always thought he could play," Sampson said. "Sometimes players just take a little while to develop. Obviously, though, if I'd known he would have had those three boys, I would have started him right away and played him 40 minutes."

But what about Ball's claim that he could have taken down the greatest player ever?
"He said what?" Sampson said, hearing the quote for the first time. "I have no reaction to that. That's not worth reacting to."
"Him beating Michael Jordan?" Anderson said. "I'd like to see that. I really don't think that would have been the case. I think he's been watching the Kardashians a little bit too much."
"It's laughable," said Brian Quinnett, Washington State's leading scorer from the 1987-88 season, to TMZ on Tuesday. "The stats speak for themselves."
When Sanders asked his daughter that question, she replied, "Do you think he really means it?"
"I just told her and my son, I'm not sure," Sanders said. "But I can't wait to watch UCLA in the NCAA tournament now."

Javy Baez knew.
In Tuesday's second round of the World Baseball Classic, the Dominican Republic had a man on with two outs in the eighth inning when Puerto Rico catcher Yadier Molina caught Nelson Cruz stealing. It wasn't close. In fact, the Chicago Cubs second baseman celebrated before he even put down a no-look tag.
Baez pointed to Molina, giving him props for a spot-on throw that ended the inning.

Forward John Collins is the Wake Forest Demon Deacons' star.
In the second half of Tuesday's First Four game against the Kansas State Wildcats, he played like it.
With 5:28 to go and his team trailing 72-68, Collins flew over KSU's D.J. Johnson to catch a lob from sophomore guard Bryant Crawford, and the big man slammed the ball home over the helpless defender.
The Wildcats won the game, though, 95-88, and will face the No. 6-seeded Cincinnati Bearcats on Friday.

Much is made about the caliber of teammate LeBron James is.
This is why.
During Tuesday night's 128-96 win over the Detroit Pistons, the King bowled over Kyrie Irving, his point guard and Cleveland Cavaliers sidekick. With Uncle Drew down, James forgot all about pushing the rock.
Actually, he forgot the ball altogether.
James helped his fellow All-Star back to his feet before regaining his dribble and initiating the attack.
Priorities.

With about 16 minutes to go in Tuesday's First Four contest between New Orleans and Mount St. Mary's, Privateers forward Travin Thibodeaux got violent with the rim.
The 6'9" junior hammered a viscous dunk in traffic to cut the Mountaineers' lead to 40-37.
Thibodeaux's team failed to secure a Thursday date with top NCAA tournament seed Villanova, though. The Mount won, 67-66.

When told by a heckling Boston Celtics fan on Sunday that Avery Bradley has his number, Chicago Bulls shooting guard Dwyane Wade wasted no time.
"What's my number, three?" Wade responded from the bench. "That's how many rings I got."
It was a clever response by Father Prime, who actually wears No. 3. The 35-year-old also has three NBA titles to his name from his days with the Miami Heat.
Despite the quick wit, Wade scored just eight points on 4-of-11 shooting, and the Bulls fell, 100-80.

During a particularly heated exchange in the second half of Tuesday's First Four contest against the Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers, New Orleans Privateers forward Travin Thibodeaux appeared to choke teammate Christavious Gill.
Thibodeaux appeared to be yelling about being open and was presumably upset with the guard for not feeding him the rock. Head coach Mark Slessinger reprimanded Thibodeaux, a starter, and placed him on the bench.
This is New Orleans' first NCAA tournament appearance since 1996, so tensions were running high. But with a shot at the No. 1-seeded Villanova Wildcats on the line, composure was crucial.

"Everyone was looking at us—even taking pictures, like we were weird," says Egyptian volleyball player Nada Meawad, 18, who made waves alongside partner Doaa Elghobashy at the 2016 Olympics in Rio as the first athletes to represent the country in beach volleyball.
Meawad doesn't cover her hair, but Elghobashy wears a hijab, and both women compete in long-sleeved shirts and leggings, which stands out in a sport where, for women, the typical uniform is a bikini. (For men, loose-fitting tank tops and shorts are the norm.) A photo of Elghobashy going head-to-head with Germany's (bikini-clad) Kira Walkenhorst even went viral with captions like "This is why we do the Olympics" and "When cultures collide." Meawad kept her head up. In retrospect, she says simply, "We were proud."
Nike sparked similarly breathless coverage recently after it announced the Nike Pro Hijab, the brand's first hijab for athletes and the first ever available on a mass-market scale, set to be released in early 2018. Accompanied by photos of the product's spokespeople—figure skater Zahra Lari, triathlete Manal Rostom and Olympic weightlifter Amna Al Haddad, all from the United Arab Emirates—the announcement garnered coverage everywhere from Us Weekly to the New York Times. "It shows all the world that hijabs don't stop you from playing sports," says Meawad. "Here in Egypt, it's normal."
"My reaction was, 'Oh, that's nothing new, the sports hijab has been around for decades,'" says triathlete Shirin Gerami, who made headlines last fall as the first Iranian woman to compete in the infamous Ironman World Championship. The press release bills the design as "groundbreaking," and cites how Al Haddad "had only one competition-worthy covering, so she had to hand wash it every night."
That story is reflective of the product's lack of international distribution, but it also ignores the fact that athletes have been competing in hijabs at the Olympics since 2004, when Bahrain's Ruqaya Al Ghasara competed in the 100-meter dash (she even earned a deal with Nike). "It's interesting that it's being presented as though Nike invented it, which of course is not true," adds Mara Gubuan, co-founder of the nonprofit Shirzanan, a U.S.-based group that advocates for Muslim women and girls in sports.

To pinpoint the inventor of the athletic hijab is as impossible as trying to identify the first woman ever to play a sport while wearing one, but the first person to design and market a performance-oriented hijab internationally was Dutch designer Cindy van den Bremen. Van den Bremen first designed hijabs for athletes in 1999 as a student at Design Academy Eindhoven after hearing about a Muslim girl who had been kicked out of gym class for wearing one. A court had determined that girls should wear a turtleneck and a swim cap instead, which they deemed to be functionally the same. "At the time, I thought it's not about the covering itself, it's about the way girls are covered," says van den Bremen. "I'm a designer, and I can bridge this gap."
The enthusiastic response to her designs prompted her to start Capsters in 2001. Today, the company sells eight styles internationally via its site, with resellers in 15 different countries.
Since then, companies all over the globe have offered options to Muslim women who want hijabs specifically designed for athletes, though the road has been far from easy.
"We stopped selling sportswear last year, because it was difficult for a small brand like ours to do global business," wrote Fatima Fakier, founder of Botswana-based Friniggi Sportswear, in an email to Bleacher Report. She founded the company in 2009 "because through sports, Muslim women can bring down barriers they face—such as hijab bans—and be represented in the wider community." Even beyond sports, Muslim veiling practices are still controversial. For instance, students in French public schools are not allowed to wear hijabs, an issue reignited by the country's controversial "burkini ban" in 2016.
Though Nike isn't the first, it is without question the biggest company to offer the garment and take on the inevitable political blowback. In a world where the legality of veiling is still debated and the United States is in the midst of a travel ban that many believe singles out Muslims, Nike surely understood its product would receive at least some level of scrutiny.
"Why now? Why did it take them this long? It's 2017—kind of sad that it took them so long to acknowledge us," says marathoner Rahaf Khatib, a 33-year-old from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who became the first hijabi woman to cover a U.S. fitness magazine last fall. "Some of my friends are angry, because they feel like Nike is trying to capitalize on this demographic and the political atmosphere." (It's accountable for 11 percent of global apparel sales in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters.) "They feel like it's really cool right now to have advertising about equality and diversity.
"Part of me thinks they're just trying to cash in."
In fact, van den Bremen says she brought her prototypes to Nike and other international brands after the initial buzz around her designs in the late '90s. "I had designed the hijabs to fit in the collections of leading brands in the first place, so I thought with all the publicity I got when I first started that I should go to them," she says. "But they told me to do it myself—they never gave me a reason, but I assume it was the sensitivity of the topic."

Now that Nike has joined the market, though, Muslim athletes hope the power of their money forces innovations in the world of what's called "modest activewear."
"Nike has the potential to use really high-tech fabrics, which could make a big difference," says Gerami. Meanwhile, Khatib wants more choices, both in hijabs and in conservative, performance-oriented clothing in general. "I mean, I don't wear the same hijab everyday, just like I don't wear the same underwear every day," she says. "I want to walk into a store and find selection of athletic hijabs in front of me, to have the option of trying them on, instead of just buying them online."
Currently, Gerami custom-designs her gear, and Khatib supplements the available athletic hijabs with makeshift alternatives: "I'll run in hoodies or anything that has some coverage...in winter, I run in balaclavas."
More broadly, the announcement could (and already has, to some extent) lend Muslim women exponentially more visibility as athletes. "The thing that Nike brings is huge marketing that the smaller companies already tackling this problem don't have," adds Gerami. Van den Bremen tries to negotiate de facto endorsements, but capital is an issue. "We've been talking to all the athletes that are involved with Nike now," she says, "but the only thing we can offer them is free hijabs—we can't offer them contracts."
Spokesmodels and glossy advertising can help to create a more nuanced understanding of Muslim culture as a whole, something that, even though it's inevitably about money, has rarely felt more timely. "If they sell their hijab properly, we should be seeing Muslim females splashed all over mainstream media," says Gubuan, who cites Nike's recent viral "What will they say about you?" ad as an example of how effectively the brand showed the diversity among Muslim women. (Nike confirmed to Ismaeel Naar of Al Arabiya that the clip was a preliminary part of the Pro Hijab campaign.)
"The hijab makes people visibly Muslim, so it's easy. But it's also wrong," Gubuan adds. "People need to understand that not all Muslim women cover. Nike's recent ad showed that, and it's important." Fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad garnered significant attention at the Rio Olympics as the first woman to compete for the United States in a hijab, while fellow Muslim-American Dalilah Muhammad's gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles (the first ever for a U.S. woman) got next to no press. Dalilah doesn't wear a hijab. "It disturbs me," says Gubuan. "I believe there was too much of a focus on [Ibtihaj's] hijab, and not on her athleticism."
Nike's most concrete impact, though, could come via the most mundane of means: The brand can't offer endorsement deals to athletes who have no place to play, which is still a reality for many Muslim women who compete in sports in which hijabs are banned. FIFA lifted its ban in 2014, and now Gubuan and her colleagues at Shirzanan are campaigning FIBA (the International Basketball Federation) to lift its ban on what it terms "headgear."
"I don't think these were deliberately discriminatory rules—many of them are decades old," says Gubuan. "They may have thought that women would never be weightlifting or playing basketball, period." Most recently, Shirzanan and Athlete's Ally published an open letter to FIBA demanding the ban be lifted, signed by everyone from Breanna Stewart to Billie Jean King.
Interestingly, Nike announced a partnership with FIBA in late February, including becoming "the official FIBA product partner spanning apparel, footwear and equipment."
"The fact that Nike and FIBA are in partnership is a signal to us that FIBA is very serious about including Muslim female athletes, that they're going to be opening up the game to include Muslim women," says Gubuan. The federation is slated to present a proposal from its Technical Commission about lifting the ban in May, though a vote on the same subject has already been postponed twice. The next Women's Basketball World Cup will be held in September 2018—a few months after the Pro Hijab is slated to hit stores.

Ironically, the mainstreaming of Muslim women in sports has taken a leap forward in the same moment when many of those very women face threats to their travel and traditional way of life.
"With the new administration, people are looking at this as a signal of inclusion, and that's what we need," says Gubuan. Van den Bremen adds, "Muslim women in sports still face barriers, but ultimately they're role models. Eventually, the hijab will not be as remarkable as it is right now."
For young Muslim athletes like Nada Meawad, though, the most important thing isn't what they're wearing, but what they're doing while they're wearing it. "I'm young now, so I'm probably going to continue playing until I'm like 60," she says, laughing. "It's very hard to get to the Olympics, but I hope I'll be back." 

Paul Pierce's relationship with the Boston Celtics continues to warm hearts everywhere.
After playing his last game against his former franchise Monday in Los Angeles, the Clippers veteran had an autographed jersey delivered to every current Celtic's locker back in Boston, per ESPN.com's Chris Forsberg:
Looks like Paul Pierce left autographed jerseys for every player in Celtics locker room.
This barely a month after the 39-year-old took the floor (and kissed the midcourt logo) at TD Garden for the final time. The C's honored an emotional Pierce, who plans to retire as a Celtic, with a video tribute.

Arkansas with the dirtiest display of basketball I've seen in quite some time. https://t.co/A07bAjTkKQ
The ending of Sunday's SEC tournament title game got heated.
With about a minute left and Kentucky leading the Arkansas Razorbacks 77-64, Wildcats point guard De'Aaron Fox floated a pass to Bam Adebayo. As the potential lottery pick elevated, he was met with a two-handed shot to the dome from Razorbacks big man Moses Kingsley.
It was a dirty play, and the senior was ejected with a flagrant-2 foul.
Here's WWE legend Jim Ross on the call, via Austin Kellerman:
WATCH: Moses Kingsley goes #WWE on #Kentucky in final minutes of #SECChampionship. Here's the call from @JRsBBQ 👀🐗 https://t.co/NE3Jkxr6iQ
 
The Razborbacks Twitter page and head football coach Bret Bielema seemed to make light of the foul:
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
#WoooPig also love the smiles and hugs the officials give Kentucky players when talking to them about the game and ending https://t.co/yQpvWEpUjp
Fox, who was named tournament MVP, seemed just fine:

Apparently New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis does not like when you swipe things from his home.
On Thursday, Instagram comedians @danrue and @nicknpattiwhack_ teamed up with the Brow for one of their "yeah, baby" skits. One of the funnymen, @nicknpattiwhack_, joked that the personal court they invaded—which was emblazoned with a No. 23—was Michael Jordan's. It was really Davis'.
AD gave the guys a brief tour—they saw "the little award thing [he] just won"—after one of them knocked down a do-or-die shot. It ended with Davis chasing @danrue out the door.
The whole skit is a riot, especially if you're unfamiliar with the narrator's voice.

DeSean Jackson will wear #11! 
Chris Baker... #90! https://t.co/imBUVyyqls
After signing a three-year, $35 million deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this week, veteran wide receiver DeSean Jackson had some business to take care off. He wanted his No. 11.
Fellow receiver Adam Humphries wore the number in his first two seasons with Tampa, but he agreed to give it to D-Jax on one condition, according to Greg Auman of the Tampa Bay Times.
Money.

Not for himself, though. Humphries gave up the number after "Jackson pledged to make a donation to a children's charity in Tampa," his new home. Per Auman, Humphries plans to make a similar donation in his hometown, Spartanburg, South Carolina.
"For him to be a new member of the Tampa Bay area, it's good for him to get involved like that," Humphries said. "The money wasn't really that big a deal, so we wanted to help out. It's just something good to come out of a little fun between two teammates."
Props to both receivers. Everybody wins.

The Los Angeles Lakers introduced Rob Pelinka as their general manager Friday, and the former NBA agent had some gushing words for Kobe Bryant.
"Kobe, what Michelangelo is the art, what Beethoven is to music, what Shakespeare is to words, you are to me as a friend," he said. "And you are to the Lakers."
The 47-year-old also hinted at potential involvement from the retired legend:
Rob Pelinka said he has "absolutely" talked to Kobe about having possible involvement. Pelinka: "He's 100% behind everything Laker"
This echoed president of basketball operations Magic Johnson, who said in early February he wanted Kobe involved with running the team, per Des Bieler of the Washington Post:
"Kobe understands winning. He understands, also, these players. And so, I would call [and say], 'What role you want, bro? If you've got a day, just give me that day."
Bryant showed his support for his longtime friend earlier this week:
No one knows the business of basketball more than @robpelinka. I wish him &amp; the Lakers much success as they bring winning bball back to LA.

Russell Westbrook and James Harden are the clear-cut top two candidates for this year’s MVP.
But let's not forget about LeBron James.
As B/R's The Hype series detailed, the King is on pace to join Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the only players to average 25 points, eight assists and eight rebounds while shooting over 50 percent from the field.
It's widely accepted that James is still the best player in basketball regardless of the MVP. But perhaps he deserves a bit more credit when it comes to this year's chase for the Maurice Podoloff Trophy.

On Wednesday, March 8, German soccer club Borussia Dortmund faced Portuguese club Benfica in the second leg of a Champions League tie that very well could have defined the club's season, one way or another.
The first leg had seen the Germans batter their opponents' goal for 90 minutes yet still leave Lisbon with a one-goal deficit. As fans of the Bundesliga side had seen so often this season, luck just wasn't on their side.
The problems didn't stop there for Dortmund head coach Thomas Tuchel. In the preceding two weeks, midfielders Marco Reus and Mario Gotze had been ruled out due to injury and illness, respectively. Dortmund needed goals but were in short supply of talent to fetch them. So the 43-year-old did what he has increasingly begun to do when in need of inspiration: He turned to Christian Pulisic.
Fortunately for him and the ravenous Westfalenstadion crowd, the breakthrough took just four minutes, when the 18-year-old American reached a corner at the front post and flicked it towards the back post for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to calmly knock home.

The Pennsylvania-born talent then doubled Dortmund's lead with another quick intervention, this time 14 minutes into the second half, when Lukasz Piszczek played the forward through, allowing him to carefully dink the ball over the oncoming goalkeeper.
With a goal and an assist, Pulisic had almost single-handedly saved Dortmund's Champions League campaign. 
Aubameyang would later bag two more goals and leave the pitch with a hat trick and a man-of-the-match award, but the evening belonged to someone else. Pulisic had once again performed at the highest level, showing just why he's considered one of the most exciting talents in the sport right now. 
Although the winger has enjoyed most of his goals and assists in demolition jobs, such as the 6-2 win over Bayer Leverkusen last week and the 6-0 win over Darmstadt at the start of the season, he's also stepped up with crucial breakthroughs when it mattered.
His goal and assist to let Dortmund take a point at Ingolstadt in October, his setup for the late equaliser against Real Madrid and an assist in last month's DFB Pokal clash against Hertha Berlin were all vital to keeping Dortmund's season on track. 
Despite only making his debut for the first team a little over a year ago, the U.S. international has already become a vital cog in Tuchel's ever-growing machine of young brilliance. Within 13 months, Pulisic has gone from being in awe of the likes of Reus and Aubameyang to standing shoulder to shoulder with them and often winning games just as they do.
Of course, the young prodigy is well-versed in emulating those who inspire him. Christian's mother and father both played the sport at George Mason University. His father, Mark, earned the title of top goalscorer three out of the four years he played there before moving on to play for the Harrisburg Heat in the National Professional Soccer League. 
"The fact that he grew up in a soccer family is certainly a factor," former U.S. national team coach Bob Bradley told Bleacher Report when asked about the rise of the young Dortmund player. 

"I remember his mom and dad when they were playing at George Mason University, and I know that Mark played with some guys that I coached. What it means is that Christian grew up with soccer around him all the time."
He added: "Being around good examples is where you start to get an idea of what the game is all about."
Bradley first learned of Pulisic's talent when a former player, Richie Williams, told him about a kid he was coaching at the U.S. under-17 program in Bradenton, Florida.
"Everyone knew that Christian was a really talented young player who was coming through our program," he notes. "Obviously when I was then in Egypt, Norway and France and before he came through at Dortmund, I was very aware of what he was doing but I had not seen him play that often."
Yet you'd be hard-pressed to avoid clips of Pulisic's exploits on the pitch now. Every well-tuned football fan across the world is fully aware of the young American's talent and the waves he's been making at Dortmund this season. Although tightly edited into short Vines or elaborate YouTube videos, there's no denying that Pulisic's talent seems to have already transcended the initial, unjustified buzz most young players have thrust upon them after the slightest note of success.
"There's already pressure on Christian, and that extra burden doesn't make sense," Bradley said, referring to the euphoria on both sides of the Atlantic whenever the 18-year-old plays for Dortmund. "But you continue to see his progress. I love the way he plays, his movement, when he has the ball at his feet, and I think he's at a really excellent situation at Dortmund."
Yet it isn't just Dortmund that offers a bright future for the former PA Classics talent. 
At the international level, Pulisic now faces a United States team under new management in Bruce Arena, a coach tasked with taking the nation in a new direction from the varied yet somewhat ineffectual years of Jurgen Klinsmann. Therein lies a perfect opportunity to make himself indispensable to any new-look team for the future. 

"He's certainly going to be an important part of the national team," Bradley added when asked if U.S. Soccer can build a new team around the Dortmund talent. "He can play on either side, he can come inside a little bit—the final answer is how you put your team together."
When asked where Pulisic would play in his team, if he were still the manager, Bradley paused for a moment before answering: "Tactically, Tuchel is very clever. So even when they end up in something like a 4-3-3, where the wide players come inside and play off Aubameyang a little bit, [Pulisic] shows the ability to play from the outside in and put himself in good positions to create." 
He added: "I think the answer for every manager—whether it's club or country—is how you put your team together, knowing that you have a very talented player and you want to take advantage of all of his ability.
"Bruce [Arena] will be interested in utilising all his talents to build a really good team. I think he recognises Christian is going to be a really big part of that and the rest will take care of itself."
From a timid, 16-year-old boy arriving in western Germany to a Champions League and Bundesliga match-winner, Pulisic has enjoyed a truly meteoric rise in an astonishingly short period of time. Where he'll find himself in the next year or two is anyone's guess, but few would bet against him playing an even larger role for the German side and eventually for the United States national team for years to come. 
 
Note: The stats regarding Christian's parents at university were taken directly from a member of staff at the university upon request.
It looked good all the way.

And it was.

Purdue Boilermakers guard P.J. Thompson doesn't care about his shooting percentage.
With time about to expire in the first half against the Michigan Wolverines in Friday's Big Ten tournament, the junior bombed a shot with room to spare before the midcourt line.

Thompson's long-range triple slimmed Michigan's lead to 38-37 heading into halftime, but it wasn't enough. The eighth-seeded Wolverines dethroned the top-seeded Boilermakers 74-70.

With Selection Sunday just days away, we at Bleacher Report decided to form our own selection committee. But instead of examining strength of schedule and wins and losses, we're seeding schools based on their most famous alumni.
From our initial field of more than 50 likely NCAA tournament teams, we've narrowed the list down to an Elite Eight of schools with five stunning celebrity alums. These rosters are chock full of former presidents, pop stars and tech entrepreneurs. And although each of these squads is probably lacking in on-court talent, it has its own ways of capturing our attention. 

This is perhaps the most eclectic roster among the top eight. There’s a league commissioner (Adam Silver), a CEO (Tim Cook), an actor (Ken Jeong), a pop star (Mike Posner) and a president (Richard Nixon). If nothing else, it would be fascinating to be a fly on the wall during their pregame dinner conversations. —David Gardner

You could run a national special with the political debate hypothetically happening on the Orange sideline: Post-White House Joe Biden (hopefully with ice cream in hand), faux White House creator Aaron Sorkin and White House-targeting pundit Megyn Kelly all studied at Syracuse. Bob Costas could moderate (as long as he doesn't have conjunctivitis), while Vanessa Williams could soothe the political tensions with some of her too-often-forgotten songs. —Natalie Weiner

Although Michigan is the No. 6 seed, it could be the best actual basketball team of the lot. Tom Brady, Michael Phelps (who took a few classes while volunteering as an assistant swimming coach) and Derek Jeter (who dropped out after one semester to pursue his Yankees career) may no longer be in the prime of their athletic lives, but they still seem like a pretty formidable three-man roster. Add in James Earl Jones doing play-by-play and Madonna as the halftime performer, and I'm buying tickets. —D.G.

What do these five Wildcats have in common? Not much, as it turns out. While Kourtney Kardashian and Nicole Richie attended together in the late '90s, they probably didn't cross paths with superstar Saturday Night Live alum Kristen Wiig or notoriously shirtless Fox pundit Geraldo Rivera. Rivera could chop it up politically with former presidential candidate Bob Dole, though, and who knows? They might even help come up with a fair and balanced game plan. —N.W.

The wealthiest roster—Jeff Bezos is worth north of $70 billion—checks in as our No. 4 seed. And although Brooke Shields, David Duchovny and Ralph Nader are all plenty famous, let's face it: This list is all about Bezos and our beloved former first lady, Michelle Obama. —D.G.

The Wildcats certainly don't lack for emcees on their alumni roster, with Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Jerry Springer all earning a spot in the starting lineup. Julia Louis-Dreyfus gets bonus points because her son, Charlie Hall, is actually on the basketball team (he's a freshman). Pharrell also gets bonus points because, well, even if he dropped out after two years, he still produced "Grindin'." —N.W.

It should be no surprise that the L.A.-area schools have produced the most famous alumni squads. Although Spielberg did not actually attend USC—he was rejected three times—he did earn an honorary degree in 1994 because of his fondness for the school. Spielberg and Lucas are two of the most acclaimed directors in the world, Forest Whitaker is an Academy Award winner, and Will Ferrell is a national treasure. He even has some hoops experience. O.J. Simpson rounds out the roster as perhaps the most infamous man in America. —D.G.

With Hollywood just a hop, skip and a jump away from campus, UCLA's celebrity bench is enviably deep—one might even say the school's starting five is filled with National Treasures (sorry). Although Kunis and Franco both had shortened stays at UCLA, they round out an impressive roster with versatile actor Nicolas Cage, Trekkie-turned-Facebook pundit George Takei and socially active basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (back when he was Lew Alcindor). The Bruins easily take the top spot. —N.W.
Holy smokes, how did George Mason manager Bryson Johnson spot this contact lens from across the floor!? https://t.co/QNvNdr3amk
This George Mason Patriots team manager has impeccable court vision.
Early in the first half of Thursday's 82-71 overtime win against the Fordham Rams in the Atlantic 10 tournament, graduate manager Bryson Johnson spotted a contact lens all the way across the floor. It belonged to George Mason point guard Otis Livingston II.
Anyone with contacts knows how impressive this is. It's hard enough to spot a dropped lens inches away. Homing in on one from that distance is almost unfathomable.
Johnson's keen eye paid off big-time. Livingston was crucial in sending the game to overtime:
THREEEE for Otis Livingston!

Wade gushed over PG-13, calling him one of his favorite players and "one of those guys that you wish your game was as smooth as his."
According to Wade, that's the first signed signature shoe he's received from another NBA player.

Marshall put up his Porsche, and Brown put up his Rolls-Royce.
The contest wasn't close.
AB racked up 1,284 yards, fifth-most in the NFL, while Marshall caught for 788 on the struggling Jets.
After Marshall agreed to a two-year deal with the New York Giants on Wednesday, the 32-year-old posted a picture of his contract. Brown quickly chimed in, reminding Marshall that he stills owes him a Porsche:

We went in and the whole time he couldn't stop smiling. Once we got to our seats it was time for the National Anthem. Rob took off his hat and sang the whole time. Once the puck dropped he cheered the whole game. During intermission we got chicken tenders. At the end of the game he told me that I made his life.

Seahawks’ Earl Thomas has a message for Tom Brady. https://t.co/XyLiudamkc
Hours after the Seattle Seahawks succumbed to the high-scoring Atlanta Falcons 36-20 on Saturday, injured safety Earl Thomas lashed out about Tom Brady on Twitter.
Thomas, who broke his leg against the Carolina Panthers on Dec. 4, was set off by the New England Patriots' 34-16 win against the Houston Texans.
Tom Brady has the easiest route... put his ass in our division and see what he does!!! #salty!!
Specifically, Thomas took issue with the Pats' road to the playoffs. Colin Cowherd of Fox Sports talked about the list of quarterbacks New England saw this year on his Friday show:
"New England's the most overvalued team in the playoffs... Kansas City's easily the most undervalued team." — @ColinCowherd https://t.co/eTOs9L0CF7
When fans called Thomas out for losing to Brady in Super Bowl 49, he gave a reminder about his separated shoulder:
@Earl_Thomas who's the safety in coverage here? https://t.co/j1DFY25FgW
Did you watch the game this year I owned Tom Brady!! That BS you showing I was hurt trying to help my team. https://t.co/ZB6ts0ObuQ
How much of a beast is #Seahawks S Earl Thomas? Played in Super Bowl with a separated shoulder &amp; torn labrum. Having surgery, out 6-8 months
Seattle defeated the Patriots 31-24 in Foxborough this season, back on Nov. 13.
Thomas, who seemed to contemplate retirement immediately after his injury, can't wait for his next crack at New England:
Brain washed ! I expect that! See you next year!
Ok I'm done venting now. Everyone knows I'm a competitor...hate to see my brothers come up short  &amp; our biggest rivals win.

Long before he was an NBA champion and LeBron James' superstar sidekick, the Cleveland Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving attended St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
Uncle Drew hasn't forgotten his roots. On Friday, ZagsBlog's Adam Zagoria reported that Irving is covering the tuition for 12-year-old Spencer Joyner, who was diagnosed with "pseudotumor cerebri, a debilitating condition that results in migraine headaches and can cause vision loss" in November.
St. Pat's closed in 2012 and was replaced by the nondenominational Patrick School, which Joyner attends.
"It made me feel really good and lucky to have one of my favorite players do that," Spencer told Zagoria.
Irving also paid for the funeral of 14-year-old Nixon Geraldo, another Patrick School student who collapsed during basketball practice and later died. Kyrie donates money to the school regularly and provides athletic gear for the basketball team.
Spencer has yet to meet the 24-year-old All-Star. The Patrick School team visited Spencer and his family after Christmas, and that's when head coach Chris Chavannes told the Joyner family about Irving's gesture.
"I'm just thankful that I have a great support system and great financial team that allows to give back to our community and support those kids," Irving said, "not only just the athletes but the students that we have at the school."

During the second quarter of Thursday's 113-108 loss to the Dallas Mavericks in Mexico, Phoenix Suns forward TJ Warren toppled over Deron Williams on the baseline.
Warren went down near photographers and first-row fans, which is common for NBA games.
But things got weird when a fan latched onto Warren and tried to take a selfie.
The 23-year-old looked peeved as he ripped his arm away, and rightfully so. Nobody was hurt, but fans grabbing players is a recipe for disaster.

Retired boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. loves his cash.
On Thursday, the man who last season made over $280,000 on bets in just six quarters of basketball strolled around ESPN studios with what he said was $80,000 in a backpack.
Mayweather wasn’t carrying the backpack himself, though. He said there's also a "trick bag" to throw off potential robbers.
The 39-year-old was at ESPN to support Saturday’s fight involving Badou Jack, who’s represented by Mayweather Promotions.
He also took the opportunity to call out UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor. The two have been trading jabs over a potential bout for months.

In a very cozy and private ceremony, today we retired @MattBonner_SAS 's flannel shirt. #ThankYou15 https://t.co/BXW8NyZC0R
How do you say goodbye to a legend?
The San Antonio Spurs have figured it out.
On Thursday night, they honored newly retired forward Matt Bonner, who was with the team from 2006 through 2016. Manu Ginobili tweeted a picture of a makeshift jersey—a flannel shirt with Bonner's name and No. 15 on the back—saying the team retired his number.
"In a very cozy and private ceremony," Ginobili wrote.
Here's a closer look, provided by Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News:
Without ceremony, the Spurs have retired Matt Bonner's jersey https://t.co/TUD20tXOZi
Bonner, always a character, loved it:
@manuginobili Wicked hilarious guys... you got me good! Whose shirt was that? 😂😂😂😂
What do you think? Next year's NBA Christmas jerseys?  https://t.co/66rLB1SS1V
The 36-year-old, redheaded sniper has since joined the Spurs broadcast team.

Steve Smith Sr. quit his sports job by sending a brief, witty letter to the NFL commissioner. Kobe Bryant went out by turning back the clock and putting up 60 points in his final game.
Sure, athletes could retire via a stuffy news conference after a lackluster season. Or, they could make a hilarious video. They could—if they're lucky—end their career with a jaw-dropping performance or even a championship.
There are meh ways to go out, and there are great ways to go out. No one in sports has quite hit the peak this video producer did, but if current trends continue, that's where things could be headed. Sports folks have retired spectacularly in the recent past. Here are the 10 best ways to go out.
    
Via Ominous Social Media Post
Former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch tweeted this during Super Bowl 50:
✌🏿 https://t.co/wesip4IhOR
The photo of cleats hanging up led For the Win's Nate Scott to wonder, "Did Marshawn Lynch announce his retirement with this cryptic tweet?"
In short, yes. Who said retirement announcements had to be clear and direct? Leave it to Beast Mode to put his own unique spin on his NFL departure.
    
Retire 'On the Peak'
Look, it's not that sports fans want to see talented stars retire in their primes. Then again, folks spend plenty of time criticizing the ones who "waited too long," too. So, good for Nico Rosberg for getting out at the top and, more importantly, for doing it his way.
Just five days after winning the Formula One world championship, the 31-year-old German driver announced he was done:
"We're all taken aback"

Our F1 commentator @jack_nicholls with the latest on Nico Rosberg's retirement https://t.co/ERT3b4UqqX
Per Ben Curtis and Oliver Brown of the Telegraph, he said: "For 25 years in racing, it has been my dream, my 'one thing' to become Formula One world champion. Through the hard work, the pain, this has been my target. And now I have made it. I am on the peak, so this feels right."
    
With a Witty Letter to the Commish
Former Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith Sr. confirmed his retirement this month after 16 years in the league. Famously outgoing (and unafraid to talk trash), Smith penned a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that was so...him:
It's official my letter to the @NFL 
#agent89 out ✌
#stevesmithsr #RavensFlock 
#SSmithWPMOYchallenge https://t.co/CMW2PXDPkd
   
With a Killer Last Game 
Bryant retired in 2016 after a legendary 20-year NBA career with the Los Angeles Lakers. He did make fans endure all the retirement-tour hoopla, but he also went out giving them one final gift. In his last game, a regular-season win over the Utah Jazz, the Mamba dropped 60 points:
That’s just Kobe being Kobe https://t.co/hMndWMcjQa
Not every athlete leaves the game with a dominant performance. Like David Robinson did with his NBA Finals double-double, Bryant gave fans a glimpse of his former self in his final game. And it was boss.
     
By Walking into a Better One
Real talk. Alex Rodriguez had a far better 2016 as a sports broadcaster than as an athlete. He batted just .200/.247/.351 in 65 games and retired in August, not even finishing out the regular season.
Rodriguez will surely go down as one of the game's all-time great talents, but his baseball career was tumultuous, to say the least.
The New York Yankees retained him as a special adviser, but A-Rod also joined Fox Sports as an analyst for MLB's postseason coverage, and guess what? People loved him:
.@AROD &amp; @PeteRose_14 shirtless?! 

Oh yeah, it's the final from the vault featuring two legendary photos.  https://t.co/Ka4lewFMYP
A-Rod, likable? That's what a sports career change can do for a guy.
    
With a Heartfelt Letter
Los Angeles Dodgers broadcasting legend Vin Scully retired in 2016. It was a memorable final season and for Scully, but one of the best things about his retirement was this touching letter he wrote to the fans during his final homestand in September:  
To you, from #VIN.🎙 https://t.co/DNlwUKUmMc
The letter (which can be read here, per Mark Townsend of Big League Stew) was warm, personal and of course included a trademark anecdote from the master storyteller. If you are going to quit your sports job, injecting a little authenticity into the process is a nice way to go.
    
You Know, Don't
One way to quit your sports job is to not actually quit, as weird as that might sound.
For instance, you could always go the Conor McGregor route and feign retirement when things aren't going great at work:
I have decided to retire young.
Thanks for the cheese. 
Catch ya's later.
Or, consider the Ray Allen approach: Don't play, but don't announce your retirement either. Allen quit playing but left his door open for a possible comeback for two seasons before officially hanging it up in November.
    
Fade Quietly into the Night
Drama is overrated. San Antonio Spurs great Tim Duncan also retired in 2016, but to far less fanfare than fellow NBA legend Bryant. In fact, the end of the season came and went, and no one had heard a peep from the Big Fundamental on the subject.
When Duncan did officially retire in July, he did it ultra-chill via "press release (with no direct quotes from Duncan or anyone else)," per Jack McCallum of Sports Illustrated:
After 19 seasons, Tim Duncan announces retirement » https://t.co/kQimgv8oIB

#ThankYouTD https://t.co/aLua8MRZtS
Sometimes, the best way to retire is to just Irish goodbye everybody. Tim Duncan style.
    
With a Hilarious Video
Clearly, a hilarious retirement video is in the top here. In February, defensive end Jared Allen rode off into the sunset (literally) with this cheeky video:
Riding off into the sunset https://t.co/wZXovseGKS
More recently, former San Antonio Spurs forward Matt Bonner, aka the "Red Mamba," announced his retirement in a slightly quirky yet charming, self-deprecating (in a funny way) video:
Creativity is key, folks.
    
With a Championship Title
Yes, former Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning announced his retirement via the old standby, the news conference. And no, he didn't put up gaudy numbers in his final game (a paltry 141 yards and no touchdown passes, actually). He did, however, go out the way most athletes likely hope to—with a title:
Peyton Manning is a legend. #MakeHistory https://t.co/pJ0NoGOGd9
All the hilarious retirement videos in the world don't equal a championship.
I'll just leave this here @BleacherReport @SportsCenter @tatefrazier @houseofhighligh https://t.co/tX1UXiD35H
Duke Blue Devils guard Grayson Allen found himself on the wrong side of another "did he do it?" controversy during the team's 88-72 loss to the Florida State Seminoles on Tuesday night.
While pursuing a loose ball near the FSU bench with Duke trailing 75-61 in the second half, it looked like Allen shoved a coach.
Could it have been incidental? Absolutely. Most players would be given the benefit of the doubt—after all, there's no smooth way to topple over a bench.
Allen's past—which includes a laundry list of tripping incidents—forces us to look at this encounter under a stronger microscope, though.
Update from Wednesday, Jan. 11
Florida State assistant coach Dennis Gates, the person on the other side of the play, came to Allen's defense, calling it "a great hustle play": 
I want to make this very clear! #givegraysonabreak @ESPN @TDOnline @Warchant @Noles247 @GraysonJAllen @DukeMBB https://t.co/3gKBNWfUIC

"He paused in mid-air...and dunked it with his ears."

- @dandakich, on @OAnunoby's highlight @IndianaMBB dunk https://t.co/Y2rIgII8uw
Indiana Hoosiers sophomore forward OG Anunoby has old-school hops.
With 10 seconds to go and his team trailing the Maryland Terrapins 73-70 on Tuesday, the Sporting News preseason All-American unloaded an angry one-handed mega-poster dunk on Terps big man Damonte Dodd.
Here's another look:
Melo Trimble buried a pair of free throws after Indiana fouled to stop the clock, and Robert Johnson missed a last-second three-pointer.
Despite the 75-72 loss, Anunoby has reason to smile after that slam.

Stephen Curry tried to take a charge against Miami Heat forward James Johnson with time winding down in the opening quarter Tuesday night.
It didn't work.
The two-time reigning MVP beat Johnson to the spot, but the 29-year-old journeyman took off before making contact with the Golden State Warriors point guard. When he did touch Curry, Johnson was well on his way to flushing a mammoth two-handed jam.
Curry fell to the floor as Miami ended the first quarter with a 29-27 lead.

MANU, FTW!

You knew the San Antonio Spurs were going to get a good look.
Coming out of a timeout with the game on the line? That's when Gregg Popovich butters his bread.
Sure enough, as the clock ticked down from 6.7 seconds with the Spurs trailing the Milwaukee Bucks 109-107, veteran Manu Ginobili found himself wide open in the corner for a triple.
He put the shot up with a second to go. The buzzer sounded. The ball...hit the top of the backboard?
Yup. Thud.

Luke Walton and Lamar Odom were Los Angeles Lakers teammates from 2004 through 2011.
Could they one day become coaching colleagues?
On Tuesday, Odom told TMZ he has talked with the 36-year-old head coach about a potential role on the sideline. Walton confirmed the news before L.A. hosted the Portland Trail Blazers that night, per Mark Medina of the Los Angeles Daily News:
Luke Walton confirmed Lamar Odom reached out to him about helping staff. Luke sounded interested but understandably mindful of his recovery
Here is a transcript of Walton's comments, per Serena Winters of Lakers Nation:
Below is the full transcription of Luke Walton’s answers about Lamar Odom today.

[Here is the video to accompany: https://t.co/GT5emzf06d] https://t.co/zu5znxLOih
Though nothing is imminent, if Odom's substance-abuse issues are a thing of the past, he could help Walton with the development of a young, well-rounded stud like Julius Randle.

Gerald Green has never been kind to rims.
Tuesday night against the Toronto Raptors, the Boston Celtics' high-flying forward was especially mean to the iron when All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas floated a lob from the top of the key.
Green rocketed in and unloaded a downright nasty two-handed jam, extending Boston's lead to 95-87 with about eight minutes to go in the fourth quarter.
Al Horford's reaction said it all.

During the second quarter of Tuesday's Atlanta Hawks-Brooklyn Nets game, Hawks big man Dwight Howard duped his old pal Jeremy Lin. During a stop in the action, the 7-footer offered a hand to his former Houston Rockets teammate.

It was all in good fun, as both players laughed afterward. It sounded like the Barclays Center crowd was amused, too.

Creative: The @sixers are sending the media ingredients to make Shirley Temples, @JoelEmbiid's favorite drink, in All-Star vote campaign https://t.co/sru7HWnEzG
The Philadelphia 76ers want to get rookie big man Joel Embiid into the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.
Badly.
Embiid, whose proficiency on Twitter has helped him garner a gargantuan number of fan votes, will also need the help of media members and his peers to get into the game. On Tuesday, the Sixers sent media members a Shirley Temple kit.
Of course, Brian Geltzeiler reported in 2015 that while recovering from foot surgery, Embiid was putting on weight thanks to pitchers of his favorite drink.
Embiid's since made jokes about the claim (warning: NSFW language):
The Sixers did, too:

In addition to sending out the kits, the Sixers will be selling Shirley Temples at Wells Fargo Center during Wednesday's game against the New York Knicks:

OBJ, Victor Cruz, Sterling Shepard and other receivers took the field before Sunday's Wild Card Weekend game against the Green Bay Packers dressed like they were going on another boat trip.
Just to be clear, it's cold, as Gary Myers of the New York Daily News noted:
Temperature in Green Bay right now is 1 lonely degree. Supposed to be 13 degrees by kickoff. Wind chill now is minus 12. Ice Bowl III.
Running back Rashad Jennings joined the party, too:

Less than three minutes into Sunday's Wild Card Weekend game, the Pittsburgh Steelers star receiver busted loose for a 50-yard touchdown on a screen pass from Ben Roethlisberger. It was the first postseason touchdown of Brown's career.
He didn't have to wait long for No. 2.
On Pittsburgh's next possession, Brown took a pass over the middle 62 yards to the house.
Decent start.

The reigning Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos failed to make the playoffs this season.
At 9-7, Denver finished behind two AFC West rivals in the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders, who were both 12-4.
With the second-seeded Chiefs on a bye, the Silver and Black, sans quarterback Derek Carr, fell to the Houston Texans in the first game of Wild Card Weekend on Saturday.
Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall loved it.

Bubba Bolden is not a kicker.
So when the USC commit booted the ball during a field-goal attempt in Saturday's U.S. Army All-American Bowl, it was a big deal. The 4-star defensive back from Las Vegas' Bishop Gorman High School leaped over the offensive line and beat the opposing kicker to the ball.
He then picked it up and returned it for a touchdown.
Previously committed to the Trojans, Bolden re-opened his recruitment over the summer. But he donned a USC cap once again Saturday:

Jadeveon Clowney looked like a No. 1 pick to begin Saturday's Wild Card Weekend game against the Oakland Raiders.
After nearly picking off rookie Connor Cook on Oakland's opening drive, the third-year Houston Texans defensive end got him on the second.
Clowney got inside the 10-yard line after his tipped interception, setting up Texans running back Lamar Miller for an easy four-yard score.
Houston led 10-0 after Nick Novak's extra point with 6:16 to go in the opening quarter.

Scary moment as a car flipped in front of our bus en route to LSU. Glad we were able to help this lady get out of her car. #HailState https://t.co/YanATdwrJe
On Friday, head coach Ben Howland and the Mississippi State basketball team helped a woman, Carolyn Ashley, whose car flipped on a highway.
The team, which was traveling to Baton Rouge for a matchup against LSU, saw the woman's SUV slide before it slipped off the road.
"She just spun out and went flying off the road," Howland told ESPN.com's Myron Medcalf. "There were multiple tumbles and turns."
Bulldogs players got off the bus to help, but fearing another accident, Howland told them to stay put and worked to free Ashley from the car along with director of operations Michael Moynihan and strength coach David Deets.
Once they got Ashley out, team trainer Ryan Dotson examined her and determined Ashley escaped without major injuries. Players and staffers then helped her onto the bus, where she waited for medical personnel before the team continued its journey.
"It's really a blessing she walked away from that," Howland said. "The car was totaled. I'm really thankful we weren't seeing something that was more of a disaster. Wearing her seatbelt saved her life."

Indianapolis Colts fans are fed up.
After missing the playoffs in 2015 and 2016 with back-to-back 8-8 seasons that featured impressive play by quarterback Andrew Luck (when healthy) but a sieve of an offensive line and poor defense, fans are taking action.
On Friday, a cardboard sign bearing the words "Stop wasting Luck" popped up in front of a team facility.
It's likely a response to a report by the Indy Star's Zak Keefer that owner Jim Irsay is likely to retain head coach Chuck Pagano and general manager Ryan Grigson.
Keep an eye out for more signs.

Late in the fourth quarter of the Golden State Warriors' collapse against the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday, Kevin Durant called his own number.
He asked Steph Curry for the ball at midcourt, held it and misfired on an attempt from distance.
Draymond Green was not pleased.
It's unclear exactly what set Green off, but he was noticeably irritated when KD took the ball from Curry. Following a Grizzlies timeout, Green seemed to lay into his new teammate, but there was no bad blood, as they ended the exchange with a high-five.
Golden State blew a 24-point second-half lead and fell to Memphis in overtime, 128-119.

Retired NFL running back Edgerrin James didn't make the cut for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's 2017 class.
He's got a way to fix that.
On Friday, the former Indianapolis Colts star reposted an image from fellow retired back Clinton Portis that showed James leads the NFL in all-time success rate, an advanced stat that accounts for a rusher's consistency based on down and distance, per Football Outsiders.
While that's certainly an impressive stat, it was James' caption that drew the most eyes:
"And they don't wanna let me in the 'HOF'.... but 'IDGAF'... But when they do, I'm gonna have the Biggest Party with the most Skkrrippers Canton has ever seen and pay for every Voters lap dances all nite long... (Heart Attack alert)...compliments of The Edge." Lol #ONE

Note: Skip ahead to 4:40 for the exchange between the two legendary big men.
During Thursday night’s Inside the NBA broadcast, Charles Barkley jabbed Kevin Garnett over being a "borderline" Hall of Famer.
KG, who retired in September, is obviously not eligible. When he is, in 2021, there's zero doubt he'll get in.
Still, Garnett had to respond to Sir Charles' teasing. The Big Ticket immediately snapped into the trash-talking persona that defined much of his playing career, repeating the word "champion" over and over.
Of course, Barkley never won a title—so Garnett called him a "borderline champion."
That's a knockout shot.

Harrison kept a straight face before mentioning Aaron Rodgers, whose life he will aim to complicate this weekend.
"I was using Rodgers pretty good on Madden, so hopefully I know some of his weaknesses, because, you know, Madden doesn't lie," Harrison said while laughing.
When asked if real-life or digital Rodgers was better, Snacks kept joking.
"Depends on who—you see these thumbs right here, man?" he said, showing off his dexterity. "I can make anybody great on Madden."

Pau Gasol is a dedicated flopper—so much so that he's now exaggerating contact from his teammates.
During Thursday's 127-99 win over the Denver Nuggets, San Antonio Spurs star Kawhi Leonard stole the rock from the big man near the top of the key. Gasol, assuming Leonard was a defender, threw his arms up in hopes of drawing a whistle.
It never came.
Leonard drove to the hole and scored on Danilo Gallinari. He finished with 24 points, six boards and five assists.

Over the course of a basketball game, uniforms can take a beating or come undone. It's common.
What isn't common is when a player drops his shorts to the hardwood to adjust...during a game.
That's what Toronto Raptors center Lucas Nogueira did as Utah Jazz forward Derrick Favors attempted a free throw in the third quarter Thursday night. Dropped 'em right down.
The Raptors won 101-93. Nogueira, clearly comfortable, totaled four points and six boards in 26 minutes.
During the Belmont Bruins' 71-66 win over the UT Martin Skyhawks on Thursday night, one fan ate a scoop of mayonnaise from a giant jar behind the broadcast crew.
It appeared to be the real thing too (not a similar-looking product such as ice cream). The woman sitting next to him recoiled in disgust.
That wasn't the only time he consumed the condiment, either:
@SportsCenter @vine I really eat mayonnaise. It's quite tasty. Kinda like that @Belmontwbb win over UT Martin. #itsMAYOtime https://t.co/QpfkFC3Uk0
One has to wonder how he managed to enter the arena with a jug of mayo.
Anyhow, he got on TV and went viral. Mission accomplished.

Nick Young celebrated a deep three-pointer before it went in Tuesday night.
This time, though, it actually found the bottom of the net.
Swaggy P's thrusting was warranted, as his Los Angeles Lakers held a 57-48 lead on the Memphis Grizzlies after two quarters. Young was 6-of-10 from long distance with 20 points heading into the fourth, and the Lakers had stretched their advantage to 91-77.
[Vine]
Talk about a walk-off.
With 5.6 seconds to go and the score tied at 88 on Tuesday night against the Kansas State Wildcats, Kansas Jayhawks guard Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk came up clutch. The Ukrainian junior went nearly coast-to-coast and laid in a smooth game-winning layup.
While Jayhawks fans celebrated, KSU seemed to have a serious gripe with the officials—it looked like Mykhailiuk took three steps.
Or four.
Of course Kansas gets three steps for he win and it not be a walk. Did anyone expects @KU refs to call this? Wow. @Big12Conference https://t.co/O3gmTwwpQi
Kansas came out on top, though, extending its home winning streak to 50 games—the longest in the nation.

This is what "the process" is all about.
After blowing a 26-point lead against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night, the Philadelphia 76ers won in dramatic fashion. With 1.6 seconds to go, rookie Dario Saric lofted an inbounds pass to Robert Covington, who laid the ball in while falling to the floor.
Down 93-91, the Wolves couldn't score with 0.2 seconds remaining.
Philly improved to 9-24, while Minnesota slid to 11-24.

During the San Antonio Spurs' game against the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, the Spurs mascot trolled pop star Mariah Carey over her disastrous performance on New Year's Eve.
Unfamiliar? Her lip-syncing was anything but synchronized, and for most of the show, she held the microphone away from her face.
The Spurs spoofed Carey's can't-look-away-it's-so-bad performance with the same song, "Emotions," and similar visuals.
After apparent microphone trouble, the Coyote stormed off the floor.

Clark Atlanta Panthers guard Derek Harper treated one LeMoyne-Owen Magicians defender like a step-up ladder Monday night.
With 3:05 to go in the second half and his team up 71-69, the senior drove into the paint and launched himself off a defender, who was trying to draw a charge.
Harper channeled his inner Allen Iverson and stepped over the fallen defender, too.
He scored a team-high 20 points in the 76-73 victory.

Anyone who's ever been to a high school basketball game will tell you parents can get a tad wild.
This was a different level.
After the Wooster Generals defeated the Cardinal Conference rival Lexington Minutemen 63-41 on Friday, adults brawled in the stands.
Per Connor Casey of the Mansfield News Journal (via Courtney Day of the News Journal), students from Wooster were also involved in the scuffle. Day reported that no charges had been filed, though police were investigating.
The teams were held in their locker rooms until the officers gained control of the situation.
Above is a report by Dave Nethers of Fox 8 in Cleveland that features comments by conference commissioner Ron Dessecker, who said he was "embarrassed" and blamed the adults involved.
Here are some uncut videos of the melee (warning: NSFW language):

Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett is one of the NFL's most quotable players.
He continued his soundbite dominance when speaking about the Detroit Lions, his team's first-round playoff opponents, on Tuesday.
First, the 31-year-old talked about Zach Zenner, Detroit's 25-year-old second-year running back out of South Dakota State. Zenner has three rushing touchdowns in the Lions' past two games.
Here's Bennett on Zenner, per Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press:
I think the running back, man, he's—there's not many white running backs in the NFL but he has to be the best right now. He's doing such a great job of cutbacks and hitting the hole. He's a really good back. I know all the stuff he did in college, three straight seasons of 2,000 yards. I don't care where you're at, if you can do that you have got amazing talent.
Next, Bennett took a playful jab at Lions wide receiver Golden Tate, who spent his first four pro seasons with the Seahawks:
Golden Tate is just one of those players he can do so much. He can catch the ball, run the ball. His YAC [yards after catch] is just outstanding. And sometimes, he got the weirdest looking body but he can always make plays. I always think he looks like a bird, but I can never understand how that body does what it does.
Seattle hosts Detroit at 8:15 p.m. ET Saturday.

After getting flagged following his rowdy sack dance against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 15, Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett reached deep in to his endless bag of soundbites:
Michael Bennett on being flagged for sack dance: "I’m never clear on the NFL rules.” “Two pumps get you a baby. Three pumps get you a fine."
Here's the dance in question:
three pumps: the video

Those words resurfaced Tuesday, when the 31-year-old donned a sweatshirt with an image of himself uttering the quote.
This isn't the first time Bennett has put the "pump rule" celebration on clothing. He did so last week with an ugly Christmas sweater:

With time winding down in the first half of Friday's Hyundai Sun Bowl, North Carolina Tar Heels quarterback Mitch Trubisky fumbled.
It was a clean strip…by the referee. Here's another look:
Just great defense, folks.
If there are no consequences for a ref forcing a fumble, what's stopping a ref from straight up intercepting a pass?
Sophomore defensive end Dylan Jackson pounced on the loose ball for Stanford. The Cardinal converted the turnover into a field goal and went into halftime with a 13-7 lead.

With 2:08 left in the third quarter of Friday's Liberty Bowl, TCU wide receiver John Diarse hauled in an unreal nine-yard touchdown to give his team a 23-21 lead.
The junior LSU transfer kept control of the rock despite swarming defense from Georgia Bulldogs cornerback Deandre Baker. As Baker got physical, Diarse protected the ball with his left hand while falling to the ground.
There's nothing you can do as a defender here:

This was Diarse's second score of the afternoon. He previously caught a 10-yard touchdown to give the Horned Frogs a 16-7 lead in the second quarter.

New Jersey Devils winger Miles Wood, even as an 11-year-old, meant business.
Before Thursday's game against the Washington Capitals, reporter Julie Robenhymer passed along a challenge Wood made to Alex Ovechkin 10 years earlier:
Ten years ago @MilesWood28 sent Ovechkin a hockey card to sign w/ a note: If you don't, I'll check you 1st chance I get when I make the NHL.
Ten years ago, @MilesWood28 vowed to fulfill a promise to @ovi8 if they ever met in the @NHL. Tonight they will. https://t.co/GEctDnVuOz
Word must have passed along to Ovi, who made good on the request with a signed photo that said, "Take it easy tonight."
.@NJDevils We good now, @MilesWood28? @NHL @ovi8 https://t.co/Tgubvz630u
The two met after the Devils won 2-1. Ovechkin wore a red robe while apologizing for leaving Wood hanging, per NHL.com's Tom Gulitti:

An Auburn player invaded Georgia's huddle, and Georgia didn't even notice

(Video via @EdwardsMichaelG)
https://t.co/3ZG7BSSMvw
We've seen players sneak into enemy huddles before. Chicago Bulls point guard Rajon Rondo is a fan of this tactic.
But have we ever seen the huddle welcome an opponent into the group?
That's what the Georgia Bulldogs did at the 1:39 mark of the second half in Thursday's game against the Auburn Tigers. When Tigers senior guard T.J. Dunans infiltrated Mark Fox's huddle, Bulldogs Juwan Parker and Derek Ogbeide wrapped their arms around him.
The infiltration was successful until a Georgia assistant pointed Dunans out to officials.
It didn't matter in the end, though. Georgia won, 96-84.

This Uber driver had the one-star review coming to him.
On Tuesday, ESPN’s Adam Amin tweeted about an awkward encounter he and former Texas coach—and current broadcasting colleague—Mack Brown had with a San Antonio driver:
Mack &amp; I get in an Uber in San Antonio.

Uber driver: "What do you think about the new Texas coach? Cause Mack sure couldn't coach."

Me: 😐
Mack: "He sure couldn't."

Uber driver: *turns around....YOU'RE MACK BROWN."

Mack: "Hey there."
Props to Brown, who won a national championship with the Longhorns at the conclusion of the 2005 season, for being a good sport. He retired in 2013.
Oh, and about the rating? It wasn't a joke:

Phil Jackson and Los Angeles Lakers president and co-owner Jeanie Buss have called off their engagement, the 71-year-old New York Knicks president announced Tuesday night.
The pair got engaged in December 2012. According to ESPN.com’s Darren Rovell and Ramona Shelburne, they had been dating since 1999, when Jackson began coaching the Lakers.
Jackson tweeted out the joint statement just before 11 p.m. ET as the Lakers battled the Utah Jazz in a showdown of young Western Conference squads.
Buss, the 55-year-old daughter of late Lakers owner Jerry Buss, responded with messages bearing similarly positive tones:
Nothing but love and respect for this man. @PhilJackson11 https://t.co/jlgNhnZvOA

For Taylor Deckard, a 10yo boy battling a severe heart condition, his Christmas wish was to meet @CameronNewton. Today his wish came true. https://t.co/1MNmpdNLk4
Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton played Santa Claus on Tuesday for one young fan.
Per Sports Illustrated, 10-year-old Austin Deckard, a huge Auburn Tigers fan with a severe heart condition called pulmonary hypertension, wanted to meet the reigning NFL MVP.
He got his wish.
When Newton walked into the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston hospital room, the young fella was in awe and smiled at his family. Then he and the star quarterback shared a lengthy, powerful embrace.
Courtney Cooper, Austin’s teacher, posted a Facebook message Dec. 20 about his situation and his desire to meet Newton:
It gained over 3,000 shares and clearly caught the attention of someone close to Newton. She also shared some of Austin's story with WRBL News 3:
According to Larry Gierer of the Charlotte Observer, Austin will have a procedure Wednesday.

Steven Adams and Russell Westbrook are a deadly pick-and-roll duo.
That was on display Tuesday night against the Miami Heat. With 6:15 to go in the second quarter, the Oklahoma City Thunder took a 47-29 lead when Westbrook tossed a lob to Adams, who hammered a one-handed slam over a helpless Hassan Whiteside.
Adams hung on the rim a bit for good measure.

Sevilla midfielder Samir Nasri was accused of cheating on his ex-girlfriend in a string of now-deleted messages that came from his own Twitter account.
It all started here:

Here’s a look at some of the NSFW posts that followed:

I admire that Samir Nasri is refusing to shut his account down, rather attempting to wrestle it back like a TV remote.
Anara Atanes, Nasri's ex-girlfriend, commented on Drip Doctors' Instagram page, leaving fans to connect the dots and suspect it was her behind the Twitter posts:

Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey is a numbers guy. His time with the Rockets has been marked by the use of analytics.
Apparently, he’s a theater guy, too.
According to Hunter Atkins of the Houston Chronicle, the veteran GM is combining two of his passions into a musical appropriately titled Small Ball. Morey is collaborating with playwright Mickle Maher.
Here's Atkins:
The premise: The people of Lilliput, a fictional island nation that appears in the 1726 novel "Gulliver's Travels," want to join an international basketball league. But to be competitive enough for that, they import "Michael Jordan," a man who turns out not to be the NBA Hall-of-Famer but happens to have the same name.
While amusing, Morey remains steadfast Small Ball is the real deal. Per Atkins, Morey said the show will debut in Houston within an 18-month timeframe.
"It's definitely happening," he said.

North Dakota, down 11, tried to beat the buzzer. 

Fran McCaffery wasn't a fan, so he had Iowa walk off the court. https://t.co/PLkItzgxq0
During an 84-73 loss to the Iowa Hawkeyes on Tuesday night, the North Dakota Fighting Hawks played until the final buzzer. With time winding down, they stole the ball in the backcourt and tried to score.
Iowa head coach Fran McCaffery didn't like that.
The 57-year-old refused to shake hands with opposing head coach Brian Jones or any of the Fighting Hawks. He instructed his team to do the same as he stormed into the locker room.
Pat Harty of AllHawkeyes.com provided some context:
Fran said he was concerned about what might happen in the handshake line because of how the game ended.
Fran apparently was not pleased with how North Dakota played in the closing seconds, I guess. Probably still should have done the handshake.
Here's McCaffery:
On BTN, Fran McCaffery explains why he left without shaking hands and signaled his team to follow. https://t.co/5CdUBw0jQW

"I feel bad about it. I have a lot of respect for Brian Jones," McCaffery told ESPN. "I wish it didn't happen. I wish I shook hands."

Miami Heat shooting guard Tyler Johnson got paid over the summer.
This is why.
Early in the fourth quarter against the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night, the 24-year-old went backdoor on Elfrid Payton and sprung to the rim for a massive left-handed throwdown.
Midway through a second overtime period, Johnson had 25 points on 10-of-16 shooting.

Carmelo Anthony had himself a monster third quarter Tuesday night against the Indiana Pacers.
The New York Knicks forward finished the period with 15 points, and arguably his best highlight came on a step-back jumper after he dropped Thaddeus Young with a crossover.
Four-and-a-half minutes later, with 1.7 seconds to go, Anthony drilled a contested three-pointer over Young to cut the Pacers' lead to 87-84 heading into the fourth.

Anthony finished with 35 points on 13-of-25 shooting, including 7-of-11 from downtown, and the Knicks won, 118-111.
Malcolm Brogdon got buckets on Uncle Drew on Tuesday night.
With less than 2:00 to play in the first quarter, the Milwaukee Bucks rookie guard drove hard to the hoop with Cleveland Cavaliers star Kyrie Irving on his hip.
The Virginia product shielded the ball as he flew to the rim before finishing the one-handed slam over Irving. Brogdon cut Cleveland's lead to 30-21.
Update: 10:05 p.m. ET Tuesday, Dec. 20
Two quarters later, Brogdon dunked all over another superstar.
This time, it was...wait for it...LeBron James.

Add another nickname to Shaquille O'Neal's catalog: The Big Statue.
Before the Los Angeles Lakers host the Minnesota Timberwolves on March 24, the team will unveil a nine-foot, 1,200-pound bronze statue of the legendary center throwing down a two-handed dunk.
Best of all, it'll be suspended 10 feet above the ground.
The unveiling ceremony will feature a speech from O'Neal and some former teammates. It will be free for the public to attend.

Philadelphia Eagles fan @YungYle is gaming the system.
As noted by Rich Hofmann of Philly Voice, the Eagles run a contest for free tickets prior to every home game. The goal is to find Swoop, the team's mascot, and be the first to high-five him.
Since the 2014 playoffs, @YungYle has won 12 times. Per Steven Ruiz of For The Win, @YungYle has won five of seven contests in 2016.
This week, in a shocking turn of events, he won. Again.

On Thursday, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady hid three pairs of signed Uggs around Boston.
One fan went all-out to find 'em, but he came up empty-handed and, even worse, empty-mouthed. The poor guy lost a tooth and commented on Brady’s post:
The quarterback caught wind of the fan's experience and offered a free pair. All the guy had to do was email a picture of himself to "uggs4toothlessluke@gmail.com."
He did:

Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley was a consensus first-round pick in fantasy football drafts this summer.
He's been a bust.
After finishing as last year's No. 5 rusher, despite only getting serious action four weeks in, the 22-year-old former Georgia Bulldog ranks 19th in fantasy production, per FF Today.
That's fine for an RB2, but Gurley was drafted to be a superstar.
In Thursday night's 24-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, which marked the semifinals in most fantasy leagues, Gurley rushed 14 times for 38 yards. One Twitter user was so frustrated that he challenged Gurley to a fight:
@TG3II if I ever see you in public we're fist fighting over your fantasy football performance this year
The running back countered:
Pull up then. https://t.co/EmZBhVvZk0

Well said, Shaq. Well said. #SagerStrong https://t.co/1fY84T6vlZ
Following the death of Turner Sports broadcaster Craig Sager on Thursday, the NBA on TNT crew took some time to reflect on the beloved sideline reporter.
Kenny "The Jet" Smith talked about how Sager put his profession on the map.
"Craig gave it a name," Smith said. "He really did almost like what Dennis Rodman did for rebounding."
Chris Webber shared a story from his playing days, and TNT played a video of Sager's interaction with a young Shaquille O'Neal.
Shaq, after comparing Sager's relationship with NBA stars to Howard Cosell's bond with Muhammad Ali, talked about his legacy.
"I will say this for the rest of my life about Craig Sager: There will never be another one," Shaq said.

In the third quarter of Tuesday's matchup against the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks big man Kristaps Porzingis got into an altercation with Marquese Chriss.
A quarter later, KP soared past the rookie for a one-handed slam off a lob from Justin Holiday.
The 7'3" forward's dunk gave the Knicks a 90-89 lead with 6:29 to go.

Porzingis wasn't having it 😳 https://t.co/icZGq081O8
Early in the third quarter against the New York Knicks on Tuesday night, Phoenix Suns rookie Marquese Chriss threw Kristaps Porzingis to the floor.
KP was not having it.
The 7'3" Latvian big man popped up and shoved Chriss before players from both sides separated the two. Joakim Noah restrained Porzingis with a bear hug.
Chriss was given a flagrant-1, while Porzingis, Brandon Jennings and Eric Bledsoe were all given technicals.

With less than 40 seconds to play and the Golden State Warriors leading his New Orleans Pelicans 111-108 on Tuesday night, Anthony Davis rolled to the hoop and caught a pass in stride from Jrue Holiday.
The Brow appeared poised to cut the lead to one.
Kevin Durant had other plans.
Golden State's newest superstar soared in to swat Davis' shot before hitting the deck. Golden State won 113-109.

Here's a list of NBA players who could make this two-handed, no-look bounce pass from the midcourt logo:
1. LeBron James.
List over.
The King zipped the impressive dime to Kevin Love in the fourth quarter of the Cleveland Cavaliers' victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night.
Love posted 29 points and 13 boards in the 103-86 victory, and James added 23 points and eight assists.

Davis finished with a game-high 26 points.

Aim high, Alex Martins.
Over the weekend, the 52-year-old Orlando Magic CEO promised fans the team will hoist some hardware in the next 14 years. Here's what he told Brian Schmitz of the Orlando Sentinel:
"I certainly believe by 2030 we will have won at least one championship. And I say 'at least.' I firmly believe we're going to get there, and once you get there, you got the kind of team that hopefully can come back."
Kidding aside, the Sentinel has covered other 2030-themed topics, so Martins' comments didn't come out of thin air.
It's still a peculiar quote, though.
[h/t Yahoo Sports]
Carolina Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart often runs like a bowling ball.
On Sunday, that description became literal.
Midway through the second quarter, the 29-year-old took a 1st-and-10 handoff from Cam Newton. As he rumbled toward the first-down marker, J-Stew did a full-fledged somersault over San Diego Chargers safety Jahleel Addae.
Stewart popped right up and chugged for another 10 yards.   
The Tennessee Titans and Denver Broncos brawled during the second quarter of Sunday's game.
It started when Titans wide receiver Harry Douglas dove at Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr.'s leg. Harris went down in pain, and Aqib Talib went after Douglas.
The Broncos and Titans are fighting for their playoff lives! # https://t.co/HhNPLbgPe5
Once the dust settled, Harris returned to the game. Douglas wasn't flagged for the hit, but Talib was called for a personal foul. Cameron Wolfe of the Denver Post thinks a fine is coming Douglas' way, though:
Harry Douglas should expect a healthy fine on that low hit on Chris Harris. Every look at the replay it's more dirty.
Tennessee led 13-0 at halftime.
Update: 5:10 p.m. ET Sunday, Dec. 11
Harris addressed the hit after the game:
Chris Harris Jr. on Harry Douglas: "That was so illegal. I've never had someone try to end my career like that."

You almost had him, Ryan Tannehill.
In the second quarter of Sunday's home contest against the Arizona Cardinals, the Miami Dolphins quarterback attempted to throw a screen pass to Jarvis Landry. The ball squirted away from Tannehill as he threw it, resulting in a dreadful backward pass that became a fumble.
Three Arizona defenders swarmed to the ball but were unable to recover it. The Dolphins lost 21 yards on the play.

The Cleveland Browns, while terrible, are fun.
During the second quarter of Sunday's clash with the Cincinnati Bengals, Browns head coach Hue Jackson called a flea-flicker with his team backed up near its own end zone.
After receiving the pitch from running back Duke Johnson Jr., Robert Griffin III dialed up a pass for wide receiver Terrelle Pryor—who was in triple coverage. The ball was picked off by George Iloka.
That led to a five-yard touchdown pass from Andy Dalton to tight end Tyler Eifert—their second hookup of the afternoon.
[Twitter]
J.J. Nelson is kind of fast.
During the first quarter against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, the Arizona Cardinals wide receiver took a handoff from Carson Palmer 56 yards to the house.
The slender second-year man blazed right through the Miami defense, which bought a fake to running back David Johnson.
Here's the full play:
Around the corner... and he's GONE!  https://t.co/BuDRvbtKHc
Chandler Catanzaro missed the ensuing extra point, so the Dolphins maintained a 7-6 lead.

Opposing players love paying homage to the Cleveland Cavaliers after scoring against the Cleveland Browns.
Two weeks ago, New York Giants star Odell Beckham Jr. mimicked LeBron James' "The Silencer." On Sunday, Cincinnati Bengals running back Jeremy Hill copied J.R. Smith's three-point celebration.
Hill gave the Bengals a 13-0 lead with the one-yard plunge.
Update: 3:20 p.m. ET Sunday, Dec. 11
Smith took notice of Hill's celebration and posted a comparison of the two. He captioned the photo "Respect!"

WWE superstar John Cena hosted this week's episode of Saturday Night Live, and one of his best bits was a Rob Gronkowski impression.
Cena spoofed the New England Patriots tight end's dude-like mannerisms and party habits (including his infamous cruise) in a skit about an athlete game show titled Where'd Your Money Go?
Kenan Thompson portrayed Charles Barkley as the host of the show, which also featured Alex Moffat as Conor McGregor and Bobby Moynihan as John Daly.
But Cena stole the show as Gronk.

Oklahoma Sooners stars Baker Mayfield and Dede Westbrook are both finalists for the 2016 Heisman Trophy, which will be awarded Saturday night.
But above all else, they're just teammates.
During one of Westbrook's interviews Friday, his quarterback gave him a wet willy. The wide receiver finished his answer before wiping his ear and laughing.

After dropping 26 points in Thursday's 106-99 win over the Utah Jazz, Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry signed a pair of sneakers for a young fan.
The two-time reigning MVP handed the kicks to a security guard to pass along, but two grown men tried to swipe them from the kid.
More security intervened, and the young fan—who was, of course, wearing a No. 30 jersey—got them back. The little guy, once he finally received the Under Armours, was pumped.
Meanwhile, according to sideline reporter Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, Curry walked to the locker room barefoot.

Draymond Green on his late laugh with KD:"We was laughing that Quin Snyder kept calling timeouts. Like bro, you down 10 with 6 seconds left" https://t.co/U4rOqFjKIz
With less than 10 seconds left in the Golden State Warriors' 106-99 victory over the Utah Jazz on Thursday night, Kevin Durant was slapped with a technical foul.
While Joe Ingles knocked down the ensuing free throw, cutting the score to 105-98, KD shared a laugh with Draymond Green.
Warriors up 8 with 9.3 seconds remaining, and Draymond is enjoying a laugh with Durant https://t.co/wk5ZYja1BM
The reason? Jazz coach Quin Snyder's late timeout.
"It's kind of over, my man," Green told reporters. "Let's go to the restaurant, have a good dinner and just chill. That's what we were laughing at."
Snyder called a timeout following the free throws, but that was after Green and KD were laughing. Before that, he requested a timeout with 49.4 seconds left and Utah down 104-94.
Durant told the media that the technical was "stupid" on his end:

Gregg Popovich has mastered the art of the subtle tirade.
After his San Antonio Spurs fell to the Chicago Bulls 95-91 on Thursday night, the 67-year-old head coach went on a rant about being ready to play.
Here's what Pop told reporters when asked if his team's lack of readiness fell on him:
Guys get a lot of money to be ready to play. No Knute Rockne speeches. It's your job. If you're a plumber and you don't do your job, you don't get any work. I don't think the plumber needs a pep talk. If a doctor botches operations, he's not a doctor anymore. If you're a basketball player, you come ready. It's called maturity. It's your job.
Thursday marked the 18-5 Spurs' first road loss of the season. They entered the contest 13-0.
San Antonio gets the Brooklyn Nets at home Saturday.

Then, Gortat went down again.
The big fella smiled as he jogged back to the defensive end of the floor.
In the opening minutes of Tuesday's game against the Purdue Boilermakers, Arizona State Sun Devils forward Obinna Oleka threw down a punishing one-handed slam.

You know it's a superteam when Brian Cashman says so.

Cashman on Chris Sale trade: "that's a wow...Boston's like the Golden State Warriors now of baseball."
Full Cashman quote: "Boston’s like the Golden State Warriors now in baseball. They got their Durant and their Green and Thompson and Curry."

Instead, Chiefs safety Eric Berry gave his team the lead.
Berry picked off Matt Ryan and visited the end zone for the second time, giving his team a 29-28 lead. He returned an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter:

Jeff Fisher just tried to challenge a play but literally couldn't find his challenge flag. Had to verbally ask the official.
Could the flag have been stolen?
Jeff Fisher. Trying to challenge. Can't find his red flag. Maybe Danny Woodhead has it. Maybe Eric Dickerson has it.

Update: Per ESPN's Alden Gonzalez, even Fisher found humor in the incident: 
"So when I walked up to the official, I said, 'I want to review the catch. I think it's a catch.' And he goes, 'Well, where's your flag?' I said, 'It's right here. I can feel it, but I can't find it.' And he goes, 'Well, you need the flag.'"
"It was hilarious," Fisher said. "It was just one of those funny moments on the sideline."

Sunday’s contest between the Green Bay Packers and Houston Texans featured a fair amount of snow, so Randall Cobb did the right thing after snagging a touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers.
He made a snow angel.
Cobb’s score came from nine yards out with 8:10 to go in the second quarter:
Rodgers to @rcobb18 for 6! #GoPackGo https://t.co/nJAqlklGgD
After an extra point from Mason Crosby, the Packers took a 7-0 lead.

Baltimore Ravens free safety Lardarius Webb put his body on the line Sunday to make this second-quarter interception against the Miami Dolphins.
Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill lofted a would-be touchdown pass for DeVante Parker, but the 31-year-old defensive back flew in to pick it off.
Here’s another angle. Webb came out of nowhere:
Nice interception. #Ravens https://t.co/uvBrqFDXV3

When you make catches like this, you can be as cocky as you want.
On 2nd-and-2 early in the second quarter against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford floated up a bomb down the sideline for wide receiver Golden Tate.
With cornerback Delvin Breaux draped all over him, the 28-year-old somehow corralled the pass and picked up 35 yards.
Then, in classic Tate fashion, he strutted his stuff.
Golden Tate just looks outrageously pleased with himself after every catch.

Dorial Green-Beckham is wearing Yeezy cleats today for, in his words, the "Yeezy Foundation." Talk about #CleatsForACause https://t.co/iRYxysJavT
On Sunday, players across the NFL will honor a cause of their choice with their cleats.
Arizona Cardinals running back David Johnson is fighting against bullying, for example. Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown is supporting a youth-mentoring program. Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan will honor Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.
Matt Ryan's 🔥 cleats for today's game in honor of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta #MyCauseMyCleats https://t.co/hs1flRZmaf
The entire #MyCauseMyCleats campaign is all positive stuff.
Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham, however, took a more questionable approach.
According to Eliot Shorr-Parks of NJ.com, DGB will be wearing Yeezy cleats for the "Yeezy Foundation."

Philadelphia 76ers rookie Dario Saric hit Boston Celtics forward Jonas Jerebko with a lethal behind-the-back crossover Saturday night.
Jerebko wound up on the floor, and Saric buried the jumper for good measure.
Joel Embiid provided his analysis on Instagram:
JOJO STRIKES AGAIN https://t.co/fSsyvLPL1k
Philadelphia lost, 107-106, though Saric finished with 21 points, 12 rebounds and two assists on 7-of-12 shooting in 27 minutes.

JaVale McGee remains the @shaqtin MVP 😂 https://t.co/sUYxTICwRM
JaVale McGee is the only NBA player to win two Shaqtin' a Fool MVP awards.
It seems a third is imminent.
In the second half of Saturday night's 138-109 win over the Phoenix Suns, the Golden State Warriors' big man tried to inbound the ball after Ian Clark, his teammate, made a free throw.
McGee quickly recognized his brain fart and ran down the court smiling with his finger in the air. It's a good thing he found it amusing, because the Warriors bench was doubled over in laughter.
After the game, McGee got his teammates on camera laughing about the play:
Damn guys can y'all wait until y'all take y'all jerseys off before y'all watch me take the ball out for the opposite team? 😂😂😂😂🙈 https://t.co/kBsjTHtnpw

When the Cleveland Indians lost to the Chicago Cubs in the World Series last month, LeBron James lost too.
The King and fellow NBA superstar Dwyane Wade, a native of Chi-town, had a wager on the series. The stakes were simple: Whoever's team lost had to wear the winner's uniform.
The #WorldSeries bet is on! @DwyaneWade (@Cubs) sends @KingJames (@Indians) the official wager. https://t.co/h71F22FqJA
So on Friday night, James will enter the United Center for the Cleveland Cavaliers' game against the Bulls wearing a full Cubs uniform.
Leading up to tipoff, Uninterrupted has released Claymation videos that playfully tease LBJ:
As @KingJames prepares to honor his bet payoff to @DwyaneWade, let’s revisit a pivotal moment in the wager between the two hometown heroes. https://t.co/njLWMXLeAn
Wade reposted one of himself announcing James' arrival like it's a fashion show:

The Lamar Jackson Heisman Trophy ticket that's worth $10,000 if he wins sold for $8,500 tonight on @PropSwapVegas. https://t.co/RupjVJ134a
Before the start of the college football season, one fan put $100 on Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson to win the Heisman Trophy.
It was a wise bet. Jackson entered the season as a +5000 underdog, but as of Nov. 14, he was the overwhelming favorite at -5000, according to OddsShark.
The ACC Player of the Year has scored five-plus total touchdowns in five different games this year.
On Friday, the fan sold the ticket for $8,500. If Jackson wins, the ticket is worth $10,100.

Following a first-half timeout during Tuesday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks, the Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard briefly stepped off the floor to hug Jason Terry.
It's unclear if the Jet was pulling a fast one on Smith, but Tony Snell—Smith's man—cut to the basket for an uncontested dunk.
Expect to see this on Shaqtin' A Fool.

Sometimes, a violation like the one committed by Brooklyn Nets guard Bojan Bogdanovic on Tuesday is too blatant.
After picking up his dribble at the top of the key, Bogdanovic got harassed by Los Angeles Clippers guard J.J. Redick. Then, he decided to take another bounce—just one!—before passing.
The referees, perhaps in a state of disbelief, failed to whistle the violation.

Boston Celtics center Al Horford missed Monday's 112-104 win over the Miami Heat for the birth of his daughter.
CSNNE's Mike Felger wasn't a fan of the move.
During the postgame show, Felger argued that Horford, who was in Atlanta, should've taken a private jet to Florida, then returned to his wife and newborn after the game.
"If there were complications, then OK, take that all off the table," he said. "If the mother or the child or something happened where there were complications, then I totally understand. But if it's just a generic child birth? Play the game."
You can watch the whole segment here:
Horford's sister, Anna, went after Felger on Twitter (warning: NSFW language):
Yeah, Mike Felger can fuck right off ☺️👍🏽 https://t.co/J7fsIHhMbt

The Baltimore Ravens ended Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals in peculiar fashion.
On 4th-and-8 from their own 23-yard line with 11 seconds left, the Ravens preserved their 19-12 lead by having punter Sam Koch hold on to the ball until time expired. Then, he stepped out of bounds in the back of the end zone for a safety.
While Koch milked the clock, Baltimore did whatever it could to stave off the Bengals—which included drawing a fair amount of holding penalties.
Because the play ended in a safety, though, that was it. The game was over.
Former NFL vice president of officiating Mike Pereira explained:
The Ravens won 19-14.

Using a trick play against Jeff Fisher is like running the triangle against Phil Jackson.
New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton fired one up against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, as wide receiver Willie Snead took a screen from Drew Brees before launching a bomb to running back Tim Hightower, who had one man to beat.
He beat ‘em.
Hightower converted the 50-yard touchdown, giving New Orleans a 49-21 lead after a successful Wil Lutz extra point in the fourth quarter. 
After what would've been a monster punt-return touchdown against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, Odell Beckham Jr. paid homage to his friend LeBron James.
OBJ mimicked James' chalk toss as well as "The Silencer" in the end zone.
But it was all for naught. The touchdown was called back on a holding penalty, and Browns punter Britton Colquitt celebrated as if he scored.
Beckham scored earlier in the game on a 32-yard catch-and-run. The Giants led 20-6 with less than 11 minutes to go in the fourth quarter.
Update: 4 p.m. ET Sunday, Nov. 27
Beckham scored later in the fourth, so he broke out the LeBron celebration once more:

After converting a first-quarter and-1 against Cleveland Cavaliers veteran Richard Jefferson on Sunday, Philadelphia 76ers rookie Joel Embiid got cocky.
The 36-year-old didn't care for The Process' barking and went back at him. Officials and teammates, including LeBron James, had to step between the two.
Perhaps sparked by their big man, the Sixers led 58-52 at halftime.
Cincinnati Bengals villain linebacker Vontaze Burfict pulled a fast one Sunday.
After roughing up Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., Burfict blatantly flopped after the slightest bit of contact from the 37-year-old.
It worked.
Smith was flagged 15 yards for unnecessary roughness on the third-down play, but Justin Tucker still came on to nail a 52-yard field goal and give the Ravens a 10-0 lead.

The Arizona Cardinals have had a lot of question marks at wide receiver this season, but Larry Fitzgerald remains as sure-handed as ever.

Arizona scored four plays later on a one-yard catch by tight end Jermaine Gresham.

DeAndre Hopkins is having a down year for the Houston Texans, but the wide receiver still has unreal hands.

After the game, the usually numb Saban talked about getting emotional during that moment:

After missing the Carolina Panthers' Week 5 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with a concussion, quarterback Cam Newton returned to form Sunday.
With about three minutes to go in Sunday’s shootout against the New Orleans Saints, the reigning MVP faked a handoff to Jonathan Stewart and took off for the end zone.
Newton crossed the plane and then proceeded to convert a two-point try, tying the game at 38. His heroics weren't enough to notch the victory, however, as the Saints won, 41-38, sending Carolina to 1-5 on the year.
Odell Beckham Jr. is having fun again.
With 1:24 to go and the New York Giants trailing the Baltimore Ravens 23-20 on Sunday, the third-year receiver took a slant 66 yards to the house.
Then he went nuts.
Beckham, who was flagged for taunting, “proposed” to the kicking net following his second touchdown of the day. After his first, the 23-year-old decided to lay under it.
 One of Beckham's former teammates, Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Prince Amukamara, was quick to congratulate the happy couple:
She said yes!!! 😱😱💍💍💍 congrats @OBJ_3 #nettiebeckham https://t.co/UtJOSkj7zb
The touchdown dash put OBJ at 222 yards on eight catches. New York held on to win, 27-23.  
Golden Tate has had a disappointing year.
Until Sunday.
The Detroit Lions wide receiver broke out for a cathartic 165 yards and a touchdown on eight catches against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. He celebrated his fourth-quarter score by taking pompoms from a cheerleader and doing a dance.
Tate had good reason to party, as his 23-yard touchdown helped Detroit tie L.A. at 28 with about six minutes left. The Lions would go on to win 31-28.

Odell Beckham Jr. took his relationship with the New York Giants’ kicking net to another level on Sunday.
Three weeks ago, OBJ brawled with the net. Last week, he embraced it.

Beckham’s score gave Big Blue a 17-13 lead over Baltimore.

Cam Newton took a shot, but he finished the job.
With 6:56 left in the third quarter of Sunday’s contest against the New Orleans Saints, the Carolina Panthers quarterback threw a leaping, flailing touchdown to tight end Ed Dickson.
Few (if any) other quarterbacks could make that play.
Newton’s highlight cut the Saints’ lead to 24-17.

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Kenny Britt was all over the Detroit Lions on Sunday.
The eighth-year man out of Rutgers totaled five catches for 121 yards and one score prior to the fourth quarter, but his most sensational play came with his legs.
Trailing Detroit 21-14, Britt hauled in a 47-yard pass from Case Keenum by clasping the rock between his legs while keeping it away from the defender.

The Pittsburgh Steelers seem to deploy a new weapon every game.
Last week, it was Sammie Coates. This week, it was a different wide receiver: Darrius Heyward-Bey.
With 5:39 left in the first quarter, Pittsburgh ran an end-around to the 29-year-old DHB, who surged through the Miami Dolphins 60 yards to the house.
The Steelers ran a successful two-point conversion and took an 8-3 lead.  
As he entered New Era Field before his first start of the season, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick wore a shirt bearing the image of deceased boxer Muhammad Ali.
The 28-year-old dual-threat signal-caller has made noise with his pregame protests during the national anthem this year, but he will look to let his game do the talking against the Buffalo Bills.

After knocking off the Los Angeles Lakers 112-107 in Saturday's preseason matchup, the Golden State Warriors' superstars met with Gavin, an 11-year-old fan with leukemia.
First, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green signed autographs and took pictures for Gavin and his friends, per ESPN's Arash Markazi. 
Then, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson came by and did the same:

Props to the Dubs for going out of their way to spend a few minutes with the group. It clearly meant a lot.

Friday night’s #BRVarsityLive Facebook stream featured a bevy of highlights, and among the wackiest was this 32-yard touchdown from Sylvan Hills wide receiver Jamar Lane.
With four minutes, 33 seconds left and his team trailing the anti-punting Pulaski Academy, Bears quarterback Jordan Washington floated a deep ball into the end zone. It actually bounced off a Bruins defensive back, and Lane corralled it while keeping his feet inbounds.
Then he brushed himself off.
Pulaski held on to win 35-23.

Everyone loves big-man touchdowns.
This play from Pulaski Academy (Arkansas) defensive lineman Will Hart, though, is as good as it gets.
With five minutes, 35 seconds left in a 28-17 game during Friday night’s #BRVarsityLive Facebook stream, the 6'1" senior snared a point-blank pass from Sylvan Hills quarterback Jordan Washington.
As if coming down with the pick wasn’t enough, Hart rumbled about 56 yards for a score.
Pulaski took a 35-17 lead.

Jordan Washington is the Sylvan Hills high school quarterback.
But when the Bears need a big play defensively, the senior checks in as a defensive back.
This was the case late in the second quarter on Friday night against the Pulaski Academy Bruins, a team that doesn’t punt and always goes for the two-point conversion.
With Pulaski leading 14-10, quarterback Layne Hatcher tried to go deep, but his QB counterpart picked him off with a leaping two-handed grab.

Pulaski Academy (Arkansas) head coach Kevin Kelley is not messing around when he says he doesn’t punt.
With seven minutes to go in the first half of Friday night's #BRVarsityLive Facebook stream, Kelley instructed his team to go for a first down…on 4th-and-30 from its own 10-yard line.
That's not how they drew it up before the game.
Pulaski quarterback Layne Hatcher was forced to float up a prayer, which was picked off by Sylvan Hill’s Anthony Duncan.

That was quick.
Just a handful of plays into their opening drive on Friday night, the Pulaski Academy Bruins (Arkansas) found the end zone to kick off the #BRvarsitylive Facebook stream.
Wide receiver Ray Jackson surged into the secondary and quarterback Layne Hatcher hit him in stride with a sweet deep ball.
Pulaski, the team that’s been known to never punt and always go for two-point conversions, took an 8-0 lead over the Sylvan Hills Bears.

JR Smith forever. 🐬 https://t.co/mC0iRcDZ1r
Free-agent shooting guard J.R. Smith describes himself as a dolphin.
Yes, a dolphin.
Here’s what the 2016 NBA champion told Charles Bethea of the New Yorker:
"The dolphin is my favorite animal. It’s graceful. When it jumps out of the water, it’s one of the most peaceful things you can see. Especially when the sun is hitting off the water. There’s something just so calm and peaceful about it. At the same time, if it goes down, a dolphin is like, O.K., let’s go. ... I’m a dolphin. That’s all people need to know."
Smith makes a valid argument. And it’s not the first time he’s been likened to the marine mammal, either.
In August, LeBron James described the 31-year-old as a dolphin while offering a different (but equally reasonable) explanation on the Open Run podcast (h/t SLAM):
"I don’t know man, JR is like a dolphin, man…You know why? I watch a lot of these… what is it called, Open Water? Or National Geographic, and dolphins like, they’re really killers. Sharks are afraid of them. But, they gotta have a group around them to become the best of their ability… And incredibly smart.”
The man-dolphin remains a free agent, and ESPN.com’s Marc Stein reported Friday that it’s "only a matter of time" before Smith starts entertaining teams outside of Cleveland.

Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Before Game 4 of a National League Division Series, one San Francisco Giants fan brought a live goat named Spock to AT&T Park in an effort to channel the infamous curse placed on the Chicago Cubs in 1945.
Andrew Baggarly of the Bay Area News Group talked to Spock's owner, Rodnel Magat, outside the stadium. He made it clear the goat's appearance was about the curse:
Meet this goat. His name is Spock. https://t.co/dJDr0phCNi
Chicago held a 2-1 series lead over San Francisco heading into Tuesday night's game, but the Giants led the contest 5-2 in the bottom of the seventh inning.

D'Angelo Russell's new tattoo of Muhammad Ali https://t.co/TsuxXaPguP
D'Angelo Russell has some new ink.
On Tuesday, Twitter user Andrew Martinez (@IamDrewInLA) posted a picture of a Muhammad Ali tattoo on the Los Angeles Lakers point guard's right calf.
As reported by Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times, Russell attended the same Louisville high school as the late boxing legend. Here's what the 20-year-old told Turner after Ali died in June:
It's crazy to see somebody with that type of legacy go. I went to his high school and I'm from the same city, so for somebody like him to pass away, it hurts. I'm young, so when I first met him, he was struggling a little bit and I didn't get to see him at his best. I just knew how great he was back in the day.
D-Russ was clearly impacted by The Greatest and his death, and it resulted in the depiction on his leg.

Tim Tebow an amazing individual. Tends to a man who had a seizure https://t.co/ttYrQiqePh
Forget about Tim Tebow's baseball pursuits for a moment and take in this story from ABC 15's Kari Van Horn.
While signing autographs after an 0-for-3 performance in his Arizona Fall League debut Tuesday, the former NFL quarterback placed his hand on a fan having what was described as a seizure.
Per Van Horn, the man breathed:
Tebow signing autographs. Fan has what looks like seizure. Not moving. Tebow puts hand on him and says a prayer. Man breathes. WOW.
Tebow stayed with the fan until medical personnel arrived:
My friend had a seizure at Mets game and Tebow prayed for him and stayed with him until paramedics arrived #Mets #MLB #ESPN #Tebow https://t.co/eVMP8iZ7b4
Classic Tebow.

Enemies, no longer.
Two weeks after getting whacked in the face with a kicking net during a frustrating loss to Washington, New York Giants star receiver Odell Beckham Jr. made nice with the piece of equipment in Sunday night's bout with the Green Bay Packers.
A lot can change in two weeks...@OBJ_3. https://t.co/0VpK5zwWoo
Following OBJ’s first touchdown of the season, an eight-yard strike from Eli Manning in the back of the end zone, he kissed the kicking net.
For most receivers, this would be an incredible grab. For Beckham, it was almost routine:
Beckham's touchdown cut Green Bay's lead to 23-16 with 2:54 to go.

The Toronto Blue Jays made quick work of the Texas Rangers with a sweep in the American League Division Series.
Game 3 went into extra innings tied at six on Sunday night, and it ended with a near-double play on a Russell Martin ground ball in the bottom of the 10th with men on first and second base.
Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor's throw from second was off the mark, and Josh Donaldson dashed around to score in a close play at the plate.
The Blue Jays will play the winner of the Boston Red Sox-Cleveland Indians series in the American League Championship Series.

Pittsburgh is stronger than cancer. #NFLPink https://t.co/q4fV2Fq19R
Before Sunday's 31-13 win over the New York Jets, Pittsburgh Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams met with and hugged a group of breast cancer survivors on the sideline.
Williams' mother died of the disease in 2014.
He dyed his hair pink that September and has kept the look ever since. Last season, D-Will wanted to wear pink accessories for all 16 games—instead of exclusively in October—but the NFL denied that request, according to ESPN.com's Field Yates.
Props to Williams for finding other ways to both honor his mother and raise awareness.

The Dallas Cowboys put on a show against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, and the star was running back Ezekiel Elliott.
With 11:47 to go in the third quarter and the ‘Boys leading 21-0, the rookie gashed the visitors with a 60-yard dash to the house.
Elliott was virtually untouched on his second score of the day. Through three quarters, Zeke piled up 133 rushing yards on 14 carries.

This embodied the first half of Sunday's game between the Dallas Cowboys and Cincinnati Bengals.
With about five minutes to go before the break, rookie quarterback Dak Prescott hit tight end Jason Witten with a strike across the middle. The veteran caught the ball in stride and then dropped Bengals safety Derron Smith with a ruthless right-handed stiff-arm.
The Cowboys scored a touchdown on the next play, and Dallas led the Bengals 21-0 at halftime.

He was greeted with "MVP" chants:

Urban Meyer and Jim Harbaugh are unlikely to ever get in a fistfight.

Some San Francisco 49ers fans are ready for a change.
As quarterback Blaine Gabbert struggled against the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday night, chants in favor of subbing in Colin Kaepernick spread throughout Levi’s Stadium.
Gabbert finished 18-of-31 for 162 yards, two interceptions and one touchdown in the 33-21 loss. Head coach Chip Kelly said he would address the position later in the week, per Chris Biderman of Niners Wire:
Chip Kelly says he's not discussing making a quarterback change tonight. "We're going to look at everything" on offense.
It’s important to note that Kap is reportedly still not 100 percent healthy following multiple offseason surgeries to his shoulder and thumb.

The Cleveland Browns are getting no respect from their home state.
According to a recent survey from Public Policy Polling (via Bill DiFilippo of Uproxx), 62 percent of Ohio natives believe Urban Meyer’s 4-0 Ohio State Buckeyes would beat the 0-4 Browns in a game.

With two men on and one out in the bottom of the 11th inning, Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Edwin Encarnacion sealed Tuesday's American League Wild Card Game with a booming home run to left field.
The 33-year-old turned on a pitch from the Baltimore Orioles' Ubaldo Jimenez, who struggled mightily in a brief appearance. The 2010 All-Star gave up three hits on five pitches.
The Blue Jays walked off with a 5-2 victory and will face the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series.
That'll be uneventful.

Derek Carr has ice in his veins.

Sunday belonged to Julio Jones.
The Atlanta Falcons superstar decimated the Carolina Panthers all game long and topped his performance off with a 75-yard catch-and-run for a fourth-quarter touchdown.
That score put Jones at 300 yards on the afternoon. You read that right—12 catches for 300 yards.

On Sunday, the 24-year-old mistimed his runup and was called for a false start. Long snapper Charley Hughlett started his motion but never let go of the ball. It looked like a Madden glitch.
The Browns moved five yards back, but Parkey still knocked the 45-yard field goal through the uprights to give Cleveland a 20-17 lead with 9:25 left in the third quarter.

The 64-year-old head coach spiked his tablet in frustration.
It wasn't quite a "Gronk spike," but it was a strong display of emotion for Belichick.

It's safe to say Jimmy Graham is back.
During the first quarter of the Seattle Seahawks' Week 4 game against the New York Jets, the veteran tight end made a ridiculous one-handed catch for a first down on a Russell Wilson pass.
Take another look:
Remember when Jimmy Graham was freaking awesome? It's still in there somewhere: https://t.co/HsQzDB0aJH
Graham, who had six catches for 100 yards and a score last week, tore his patellar tendon in Week 12 last season.

WHOA. Pregame shoving between the #Bills and #Patriots. Malcolm Mitchell and Robert Blanton getting things started. @News_8 https://t.co/nbntMSK2hX
Before Sunday's AFC East rivalry game between the New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills, things got heated.
Bills safety Robert Blanton shoved Patriots rookie quarterback Jacoby Brissett, which led to Pats wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell fighting back.
Bills safety Robert Blanton shoved Jacoby Brissett, leading to Malcolm Mitchell getting in Blanton's face.
Here's another angle:

The players were separated before the scuffle got out of hand. New England president Jonathan Kraft later jabbed Bills coach Rex Ryan over the scrap, per Phil Perry of CSNNE.com:
Jonathan Kraft takes a shot at Rex Ryan when asked about the pregame scrap involving Jacoby Brissett,  Malcolm Mitchell and Robert Blanton.
Kraft: "I think if you are less-than-disciplined in your personal approach, your team takes on the attitude of the coach..." (1/2)
Kraft: "...My guess is Rex probably loves that. That's why Rex is Rex. And that's why Bill is Bill." (2/2)
Kickoff is at 1 p.m. ET. This should be fun.

Antonio Brown will honor the late golfer Arnold Palmer on Sunday night against the Kansas City Chiefs. Palmer died last Sunday at age 87.
The Pittsburgh Steelers superstar's cleats will feature Palmer's likeness.
"Every week, I'm going to try to keep some motivation or put a picture of somebody that means the most to me or inspires me to keep me encouraged," Brown told ESPN.com's Jeremy Fowler, adding that he will adhere to the NFL's color policy.
As noted by Charles Curtis of For The Win, Brown tweeted out a video of himself and Palmer earlier this week:
Blessed to meet the legend Arnold Palmer ! His tenacity on the course + in business is so inspirational !!

Positive precious life #callGod https://t.co/x4sIKTcbiG
"A guy like Arnold, his legacy and what he meant not only to the world, but to Latrobe, to Pennsylvania, his legacy will live on," Brown said, per Fowler. "An inspiring guy. I'm glad I got a moment to share with him."
After this week's game, perhaps Brown will have a cold one:

Brandon Ingram could very well become a star one day.
But for now, he's just a rookie.
On Thursday, the Los Angeles Lakers had a talent show for their first-year players, and it included performances from Ivica Zubac, Zach Auguste, Julian Jacobs and the No. 2 overall pick from Duke.
Ingram curiously took the court wearing a poodle mask and white onesie before belting out a passionate rendition of Rihanna's "Diamonds."

Renfroe’s shot gave San Diego a 5-3 lead heading into the fourth inning.

Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey has made a habit of speaking his mind early in his NFL career.
Two weeks after calling out Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the rookie cornerback had some words for Baltimore Ravens receiver Steve Smith.
Ramsey said Smith approached him after the Ravens victory because he was mad the 21-year-old was “locking him up.”
Jalen Ramsey and Steve Smith still yapping after game.  Almost had some pushing and shoving until others intervened. #ASJax

On Thursday, journalist Pendarvis Harshaw spotted a mural in Oakland, California, that depicts San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
The portrait of Kaepernick features the words "We got your back," a clear reference to the 28-year-old's decision to protest the national anthem to bring attention to treatment of minorities.
"The illustration speaks volumes," Harshaw told NBC Bay Area's Lisa Fernandez. "It's about the community rallying around the athlete."
Harshaw also noted the significance of the location, as the mural is in Oakland Raiders territory.
All that's known about the artist is three letters, "FLC," which appear in the bottom right corner.

Prior to getting bludgeoned 27-0 by the New England Patriots on Thursday, the Houston Texans were somewhat confident.
After all, the poll above assumed they would score multiple touchdowns.
There's the mistake: Never assume anything against Bill Belichick.

While it's unclear if he was directly trolling the division-rival Seahawks, the choice of apparel is still amusing.

This was exactly how the Atlanta Falcons drew it up.
With nine minutes and 37 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter against the Oakland Raiders on Sunday, quarterback Matt Ryan fired a third-down pass to Tevin Coleman.
The ball bounced off the running back’s chest and flew near the goal line, landing in the hands of soaring wide receiver Justin Hardy as he entered the end zone.

He gave it to his friend and fellow nominee, team manager K.L. Norwood, who has cerebral palsy.

“I think it should’ve gone to the person who positively uplifts the school and everybody around him, and that person is K.L., for sure,” Akin told WFAA’s Ted Madden.
Norwood clearly appreciated the gesture, and he was all smiles throughout the joint interview.
Nothing like Ridge Nation! https://t.co/RotjgrKk9d

At 7’1”, 400 pounds, lineman Brave Williams is a big dude.
The senior at Lake Shore High School in Angola, New York, is taller and heavier than any player currently on an NFL roster, according to MaxPreps’ Lynden Ostrander.
"I've been bigger than everybody my entire life," Williams told Ostrander. "In kindergarten, I was already 5’3” and towered over everyone."
Williams reportedly picked up football just three years ago, and he started three games at nose tackle last season. He also played on the varsity basketball team (presumably at center).
Still raw, Williams is clearly a physical monster. He told Ostrander “his workouts include squats of 1,000 pounds three times and bench presses of 200 pounds 20 times.”
Williams has not received a scholarship offer yet, but he hopes to earn one this season.

Who’s taking the Megaphone Trophy this year?
The Notre Dame Fighting Irish have defeated the rival Michigan State Spartans in their past three matchups dating back to 2011. The two have not squared off since 2013, but the rivalry is being renewed in 2016.
No. 12 MSU will look to hand the No. 18 Irish their second loss of the season on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. ET.

"Matt from San Diego," huh?
Some believe this caller on a New England radio show is actually the athlete he talked about: Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
On Wednesday, CBS Boston’s Toucher and Rich took a call from a guy named Matt, who defended TB-12 after the hosts were razzing him about his over-the-top relationship with receiver Julian Edelman.
Matt said he was originally from San Diego—Brady was born in California—but has been in New England as a fan for over 20 years.
Here’s the meat of the caller’s take:
[I]t occurs to me that being true New England guys, you have to have something to complain about. So, you got three GOATs on the same team: Belichick, Brady, and Gronk. You got the Red Sox in first place. So, all that leaves you to go to is the fact that the man’s the greatest of all time, he’s got a good relationship with his receiver, and his wife’s Gisele Bundchen. I just think it’s very indicative of New England sports fans. Gotta have something to complain about.
Listen to it here:
At first, Matt really does sound like Brady. But as the call continues, he just sounds like a regular Patriots fan. Toward the end, especially when he laughs, he again sounds similar to the four-time Super Bowl champion.
Toucher and Rich investigated:
According to their sources, some people “close to” Brady believe it’s him:
Regarding the "Tom Brady" call. https://t.co/c2gMfhKQTF
Even if it wasn't Brady, there is another suspect:
Look who made it to the game... #fakebrady https://t.co/DeLJ7zPPkN
 
UPDATE: Tuesday, Sept. 20, at 10:50 a.m. ET
In a radio interview with Westwood One's Jim Gray (h/t For The Win's Charlotte Wilder), Brady denied making the call.
"And you get me exclusively, can you believe that … No, there’s none of me — like I said, you’re the only one I’m talking to,” Brady told Gray during his weekly spot.
Let's see if this ends RadioGate once and for all.

Adrian Beltre's 30th home run of the season came in style.
In the top of the second inning against the Houston Astros on Tuesday night, the 37-year-old dropped to a knee as he walloped a 1-0 breaking ball from pitcher Brad Peacock to left field.
This has become a recurring theme for the star veteran. It's almost like his power-up move.
Beltre's dinger gave Texas a 1-0 lead.

Marshawn Lynch with Bear Grylls is the greatest thing ever https://t.co/TyAanq67aG

David Johnson wasn’t a fluke.
The second-year Arizona Cardinals running back followed up his explosive 2015 campaign with a big night against the New England Patriots on Sunday.
With about 11 minutes go in the fourth quarter, Johnson shook off a handful of New England defenders before rumbling for 45 yards down the sideline.
While he didn’t reach the end zone, Johnson’s dash brought back memories of last year’s Week 15:

Prior to kickoff, however, a Brady lookalike invaded some tailgates and hung out with Patriots fans at University of Phoenix Stadium. All of them went wild upon seeing their star quarterback's doppelganger.

Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Terrance Williams had a costly late-game mental lapse against the New York Giants on Sunday.
With Dallas marching sans timeouts late in the fourth quarter and trailing the Giants 20-19, the 27-year-old failed to get out of bounds after catching a pass from rookie quarterback Dak Prescott.
Some teammates, including Dez Bryant, were trying to wave him toward the sideline:
Had Williams gotten out, Dan Bailey would've had a chance to boot a game-winning field goal around 60 yards out.
Instead, the clock expired, and Big Blue held on.

Victor Cruz is back.
During Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants wide receiver scored for the first time since Sept. 21, 2014.
Eli Manning threw a three-yard dart to the New Jersey native in the back of the end zone, giving Big Blue a 20-19 lead following a Randy Bullock extra point with about six minutes to go.
Naturally, Cruz broke out his classic celebration:
After Cruz's career was nearly destroyed the devastating Achilles injury he suffered in October 2014, it’s refreshing to see him back in action.

Trailing the New Orleans Saints 34-33 following a Seth Roberts touchdown reception with 47 seconds to go on Sunday, Oakland Raiders coach Jack Del Rio made the bold decision to go for two.
It worked.
Oakland held on to win, 35-34, but ESPN Stats & Info put a number on just how risky the move was:
Based on ESPN’s win prob. model, Raiders had 51% chance to win if they kicked PAT &amp; 44% chance if they went for 2 https://t.co/2FNbZxRwzj
Del Rio fired back:
Good thing ESPN isn't coaching the Raiders https://t.co/X6tB1YlZ4d
The coach also endorsed a tweet praising his daring call:
Jack Del Rio's two-point decision an example of a coach making a decision on what's going on in front of him, not convention.

Sterling Shepard has arrived.
Late in the first half of Sunday’s showdown with the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants rookie wide receiver hauled in a contested nine-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning.
Shepard's score gave Big Blue a 13-9 lead heading into halftime.

Now, take a moment to think about how LSU Tigers cornerback Tre'Davious White could possibly take that punt to the house.
Hit play.
After bouncing off tacklers and retreating past the Tigers' 20-yard line on the second-quarter punt, White whipped around and exploded for a 60-yard score Saturday night in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
The TD helped give LSU a 27-10 lead over the Jacksonville State Gamecocks.

Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Rich Hill had a perfect game intact through 6.2 innings Saturday night.
Yasiel Puig made it seven.
Miami Marlins third baseman Martin Prado roped a ball to left-center field, and Puig got on his horse before making a diving grab to preserve the perfect game.
Hill was pulled after the inning for Joe Blanton, and Jeff Francoeur broke up the perfect game in the eighth.
Still, given Puig's circumstances, that catch deserves respect:
Yasiel Puig's first start in LF since June 25, 2013 (his 1st month in the majors). His only previous MLB start in left field. #Dodgers
Yasiel Puig was a minor leaguer last month.

The freshman receiver snared it with his right hand while slicing between two defenders for a 42-yard pickup.

Quarterback Sean White flipped Johnson the ball in desperation near his team's 45-yard line, and the sophomore reversed direction after evading several defenders.
At around the 10-yard line, Johnson hurdled an opponent and eventually dived for the end zone, helping Auburn take a 7-0 lead at home.

You probably won’t see any funny tweets from Alabama Crimson Tide offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin this week.
With 1:34 to go in the team’s 38-10 win over the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers on Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium, wide receiver Robert Foster fumbled at Bama's 26-yard line.
Western Kentucky’s offense then punched in a touchdown at the 46-second mark. That’s when Saban ripped into Kiffin.
After the game, the head coach still seemed heated, per the Tuscaloosa News' Cecil Hurt:
Saban on his interaction with Kiffin during the game: "There were no arguments. Those are called ass-chewings."

Just a reminder to Michigan Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh: You're on national television.
During the No. 5-ranked team’s 51-14 win over the UCF Knights on Saturday, the 52-year-old appeared to pick his nose and then eat a booger.
Of course, this could’ve been a poorly timed fingernail bite. But the video seems to show otherwise.
UPDATE: Tuesday, Sept. 13 at 9:45 a.m. ET
Finding himself in the news for all of the wrong reasons, Harbaugh wanted to make a point to clear the air during a radio show appearance, via Mark Snyder of the Detroit Free Press:
I have never eaten a booger in my entire life. It might have looked like that was happening. But if you rub your nose and then you bite your fingernail, that's not eating a booger. There was no booger eaten.
For clarity here, for the record, I have never eaten a booger in my entire life.
Unless there's indisputable video evidence to prove otherwise, most fans will probably not buy Harbaugh's explanation.

As he entered Staples Center for a Thursday night Drake concert, Los Angeles Lakers point guard D'Angelo Russell was peppered with taunts from fans.
"Hide your phones," they jeered in the TMZ video, referencing the 20-year-old's now infamous Snapchat scandal involving teammate Nick Young.
At first, Russell ignored the hecklers, who got loud once he stepped inside. Then, the southpaw poked his head out and traded remarks with them.

Andy Dalton's and Joe Flacco's were also funny, but nothing topped Russell Wilson's: "Most likely to be the love child of Mario Lopez and Carlton Banks."
Upon reading it, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback immediately broke out the famous dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air:

A.I. also touched on his former coaches, dating all the way back through high school.
"Without my coaches putting me in a position to succeed—Mike Bailey did it my high school level, Coach [John] Thompson did it at the college level, and Larry Brown molded me into an MVP and a Hall of Fame player. Without those guys...I didn't do this by myself."
Of course Iverson had help. All the legends do. But The Answer wasn't half-bad himself:

Has anyone ever confused current Buffalo Bills assistant head coach Rob Ryan with rapper Lil Wayne?
Please say no.
Well, last preseason, the former New Orleans Saints defensive coordinator was nearly the victim of a robbery, according to a report from Ramon Antonio Vargas of the New Orleans Advocate. One of the would-be criminals apparently dialed the wrong number and, in a voicemail, mistakenly detailed to a federal worker the plot to rob Ryan.
"He don't got no security," the person said, per a court document obtained by Vargas. "He's just a regular football coach. ... He ain't ... big ... like [rapper] Lil Wayne or nobody ... that got bodyguards everywhere."
The Weezy connection—which certainly seems strange at first—is simple: Wayne is from NOLA.

"He ain't like Lil Wayne," the person said. "He just a ... football coach. ... Defensive coordinator of the Saints. He don't have no bodyguards ... in front his house."
The federal worker turned the voicemail over to the authorities. Police got involved.
Two suspects have since been jailed on other crimes and are awaiting trial. It was believed Ryan was one of several targets in affluent neighborhoods.
UPDATE: Wednesday, Sept. 7, at 12:10 p.m. ET
Per ESPN.com's Mike Rodak, Ryan discussed the situation with brother and Bills head coach, Rex Ryan, without going into full details:
Rex Ryan says Rob had called him about robbery plot. “But he never went into specifics. Obviously just a weird situation."

Tyrone Swoopes is a freight train.
Standing 6’4” and weighing 249 pounds, the Texas Longhorns senior quarterback used his size to punch in the game-winning touchdown against Notre Dame on Sunday.
It was a misdirection to the right, and once Swoopes dodged a defender in the backfield, he was gone. He soared across the goal line and solidified the 50-47 victory over the No. 10 Fighting Irish in double overtime.
Swoopes finished with 13 carries for 53 yards and three touchdowns while working with starter Shane Buechele.

Texas goes for the 3 point lead and...IT'S BLOCKED Notre Dame ties the game!!! https://t.co/TyucEZECWd
College football has returned with a vengeance.
On Sunday, Notre Dame pulled out a miracle following a touchdown from Texas running back D’Onta Foreman, which gave the Longhorns a 37-35 lead with 3:29 to go in regulation.
Then, the extra point got blocked.
Defensive lineman Jarron Jones sent it back, and defensive back Shaun Crawford took it to the house. The return counted for two points, tying the game at 37-37.
Madness.
If that play isn't evidence that there is a God and he loves Notre Dame then you're an idiot who doesn't get how sports work
When you think #Texas just took a lead on #NotreDame and the Irish block the PAT and return it to tie the game. https://t.co/rs9FUE9J1Z
For the 14th time tonight, everyone covering Notre Dame-Texas just ripped up their game stories.

Despite the loss, this cartwheel by Equanimeous St. Brown still gets a 10:10. https://t.co/wtfUsgxB1X
Notre Dame wide receiver Equanimeous St. Brown's second-quarter touchdown against the Texas Longhorns on Saturday made for one incredible picture.
But the internet couldn’t leave it be.
Here are some reactions to the acrobatic score, which looked like some sort of breakdance move:

Texas Longhorns quarterback Tyrone Swoopes dished out some punishment during his second-quarter touchdown run against Notre Dame on Sunday.
After the senior broke a 14-14 tie heading into halftime, he inadvertently knocked over a cameraman near the end zone before celebrating with his teammates.
Hopefully that footage is worth some bruises.

Wrong place, wrong time.
Early in the second quarter of the Texas Longhorns’ showdown with the No. 10 Notre Dame Fighting Irish on Sunday, a man on the Longhorns sideline got drilled with an errant pass from Fighting Irish quarterback Malik Zaire.
He tried to catch it, but the ball was thrown too hard. The poor guy took it off the chin, which knocked off his headset and sent him to the floor.
Here’s hoping he’s OK.

Note: Highlight starts around the 45-second mark.
This hurts to watch.
Imagine how much it hurt to experience.
During Puerto Rico FC's 3-0 NASL loss to Miami FC on Saturday night, defender Ramon Martin Del Campo tried to contest a shot from Dario Cvitanich.
It went poorly.
The shot found the net, and Del Campo found the pole.
Thankfully—what a glorious invention, those athletic cups—the 23-year-old appeared to be OK and was seen later in the match.

Somewhere, Drake is smiling.
On Saturday, the line “Chef Curry with the shot” gained a newer, truer meaning when Ayesha Curry swooshed a jumper against her two-time MVP husband during a pickup game in China.
(Reminder: She gets paid to cook.)
Ayesha celebrated after the bucket and then ran over to guard Steph on the other end.

THEY RUSHED THE FIELD https://t.co/eTOJ4cvcVT
Those poor Kansas Jayhawks fans.
After Saturday's 55-6 win over the Rhode Island Rams, the Jayhawks football team's first triumph since Nov. 8, 2014, students and fans stormed the field—an understandable catharsis following such a drought.
The 665-day streak is over: #kufball earns first victory since 2014 season with 55-6 rout of Rhode Island. More coming.
The euphoria was short-lived. The public-address announcer got in their ears:
KU students rush the field. Are told by the PA to go back "for the respect of this program."
Wow. #kufball fans rush the field, and PA guy reprimands. "This is a new era in Kansas football, an era in which you should expect to win."
Eventually, according to Matt Galloway of the Topeka Capital-Journal, the admonishment worked:
The verbal lashing from the PA announcer seems to have worked. Student section returning to their seats, heading to exits. Posts safe.
Ah, sweet victory.

A 17-3 lead over the USC Trojans on Saturday night was not good enough for the Alabama Crimson Tide.
With less than two minutes to go in the first half, Alabama defensive backs Ronnie Harrison and Deionte Thompson got into what appeared to be an intense exchange on the sideline.
Linebacker Reuben Foster soon joined in and grabbed Harrison.
Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban tried to diffuse the situation and could be seen on the television broadcast telling the players to "settle down" on the bench.
It's unclear what the source of the altercation was, but it was clear these guys were heated.
    
UPDATE: Sunday, Sept. 4, at 12 a.m. ET
After throttling USC, 52-6, the Alabama players seem to harbor no hard feelings. Here's a tweet from Harrison:
We competitors, sometimes we wanna win so bad our heads clash. Still got love for my brother @EJackson_4 💯💯💯
Winning cures all.

This is powerful.
During its first series of the 2016 college football season, Nebraska intentionally neglected to send out a punter against Fresno State and took a delay-of-game penalty.
Over the summer, Cornhuskers senior Sam Foltz died in a car crash along with former Michigan State punter Mike Sadler. The two were returning from instructing a kicking camp in Wisconsin.
Nebraska’s Twitter account posted this after the emotional moment, which resulted in cheers from fans and tears from players:
We had to take a delay of game, weren't able to get all 11 guys out to punt in time.

Missing one of them. https://t.co/o3mzXQZqlO
Before the game, the Cornhuskers made a point of rallying around the memory of their former teammate:
We play for each other.

We play for Foltz.

Family. https://t.co/W41M2k4NMU

Steve Spurrier is a legend at Florida for two reasons:
On Saturday, a third reason was born when Spurrier broke out sprinter Usain Bolt's signature pose at midfield.
The 71-year-old was Florida’s honorary "Mr. Two Bits" before the team hosted Massachusetts on Saturday night. He was on hand because his name was recently added to the Gators’ home field.
Here’s hoping Spurrier takes the field more often.

Dear Silicon Valley,
I need your expertise. Can you find my refrigerator?
Maybe it’s you, Amazon, with your visionary fleet of robotic drones? Or perhaps Uber, will you begin to operate as a problem solver rather than a problem child? Or Apple, maybe you can build a find-my-fridge app. New York City — and maybe all cities — needs a smart delivery service to help save local businesses from themselves.
The refrigerator I ordered is somewhere in a delivery truck in the tri-state area. Don’t ask me where because there’s no way to track it. I spent an entire work day waiting in vain for my appliances, including a medium-grade 30-inch Whirlpool bottom-freezer fridge with accu-chill that never came. And when I called the third online customer service rep at PC Richard, the local seller that advertises “honesty, integrity, and reliability” to determine why I received no call, no text, no knock on the door between the hours from 7:45AM and 11:45AM (my original delivery window), I was told they had tried to reach me on my phone before running off with the refrigerator.
My refrigerator is running — this is not a crank call.
I was assured that the PC Richard’s delivery man would return in two hours to install my fridge. I left a series of additional contact numbers with the “online” customer representative, but was told that I would have no direct access to the delivery driver. Expecting the worst, I called the toll-free number again an hour later to confirm his whereabouts and was placed on a lengthy hold for 30 minutes, until I was finally told that PC Richard delivery was done with deliveries for the day. It was only 1:30PM.
I have been told that the future will be lived in cities. But navigating logistics in the city where I live, New York City, can break you. Its imperfections remind me that we’re still not living in the future. It begins at the gateway, the notoriously inefficient Laguardia Airport, the choked-up trail of cars at the Holland Tunnel, and the delayed subway trains. It continues to the long lines at Trader Joe’s on a random Monday night. This place is like Level 3 autonomous driving in a blender: a giant ball of double-parked, semi-automatic customer disservice.
In the old days of mom and pop stores, I could have gone into the store and talked to Joe, the refrigerator salesman, whose nephew was probably also the delivery guy. Or if I had purchased from Amazon, like I do for more and more of my shopping these days, I’d have a clear path of escalation and could have at least tracked my refrigerator’s whereabouts. But here I found myself in the awkward middle ground, caught between an online service department and outsourced delivery service united only by their ability to disappoint me. I was a faceless voice on a phone with no clear course of escalation.
We are in a surreal moment of semi-automation. A local company can appear to be modern by selling goods on its website, but is unable to meet the baseline expectations of modern order fulfillment set by the internet giants. My only recourse was to call, call, call, again, and hold, hold, hold.
I explained my frustration to the fourth online customer service soldier whose job is to field calls from indignant customers like me. “How about we knock that refrigerator price down?” he said. “The only thing that’s going to make you happy is we deliver today, and that’s not going to happen.”
Is this rant nothing more than a one-star review? No it’s a real plea: help me find the proverbial refrigerator, along with a way for companies to better organize their automated procedures. I could have ordered my appliances from Amazon Prime, but I want local businesses to thrive. But to do so, they require modern logistical support. Otherwise New York City, like much of America, will just become another Walmart, USA.
Sincerely,
Tamara

Microsoft unveiled a radical redesign for Skype earlier this month, with a new look that has Snapchat-like features. While the company has overhauled its Skype apps, there’s also a new Skype logo that ditches the fluffy cloud aspects of the past. Brand New has a closer look at the new logo, and a comparison to the old one that everyone knows.
Skype has been using part of this logo for a while, but it appears the broader word mark is now moving to Microsoft’s corporate typeface. It’s much more consistent with Microsoft’s other software and services like Office, and likely reflects the company’s move to position Skype as business communications software.
Microsoft's latest Skype update includes a new Highlights feature that lets users share daily stories to a news feed. It also includes emoji responses for video calls, and a much bigger focus on text-based conversations. The new Skype design is available on Android immediately, and Microsoft is planning to refresh its Windows and iOS apps soon.
Smartphones have fast become the new frontier of artificial intelligence. Algorithms that used to run in the cloud, beaming results down to our devices via the internet, are now being replaced by software that runs directly on phones and tablets. Facebook is doing it, Apple is doing it, and Google is (perhaps) doing it slightly more than anyone else.
The latest example of mobile AI from the Silicon Valley search giant is the release of MobileNets, a set of machine vision neural networks designed to run directly on mobile devices. The networks come in a variety of sizes to fit all sort of devices (bigger neural nets for more powerful processors) and can be trained to tackle a number of tasks.
MobileNets can be used to analyze faces, detect common objects, geolocate photos, and perform fine-grained recognition tasks, like identifying different species of dogs. These tools are extremely adaptable, and could be put to a number of different uses, including powering augmented reality features, or creating apps to help the disabled. Google says the performance of each neural net differs from task to task, but overall, its networks either meet or approach recent state-of-the-art standards.
For consumers, this is going to mean more mobile apps with AI functions as developers start incorporating these tools. Running these sort of tasks directly on-device has a number of benefits for everyday users, including faster performance, greater convenience (you don’t have to connect to the internet), and better privacy (your data isn’t being sent off-device).
Apple pushed the latter angle particular when it released a set of machine learning APIs for developers (named CoreML) earlier this month, and both Facebook and Google have created their own frameworks for building mobile-first. Even Snapchat is working on putting image recognition on your phone, releasing its first academic paper on the subject this week. The next step for mobile AI? Specially designed mobile processors. Both Google and Apple have dropped hints they might be crafting such silicon, and ARM has already released a first early batch.
Microsoft is finally bringing its full version of Office to the Windows Store today. To coincide with the release of the new Surface Laptop running Windows 10 S, Microsoft Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, and Publisher will all be available in the Store. While Microsoft previously listed Office in the Store, this is the first time the company will let you download it and update the apps directly from the Windows Store.
The addition of Office is all part of Microsoft’s new push to convince developers to migrate their desktop apps to the Windows Store. After failing to convince developers to build new universal apps for Windows 8 and Windows 8, Microsoft now hopes its Centennial Desktop Bridge tool will help developers move traditional apps to the Windows Store. Surface Laptop owners and anyone with a new machine running Windows 10 S will have to download this version of Office, as 10 S is restricted to apps from the Windows Store.
In a support article, spotted by Twitter user WalkingCat, Microsoft notes there are some limitations on this Office version for the Windows Store. You’ll only be able to install 32-bit versions of Office, and COM add-ins are not supported. Microsoft isn’t including a OneNote desktop app in the Windows Store, but the existing UWP app will be installed instead. Windows 10 S users can still use the existing Office mobile apps, and Microsoft is placing its install and update process for Office in the Windows Store in preview until it’s fully tested.
If AI and robots are going to take our jobs, at least they can do it in the most relaxing way possible. Just like Shimon here — a four-armed marimba-playing robot designed by George Tech’s music technology center. Sure, Shimon is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to AI making music, but just listen to those jazz-fusion vibes.
Like many AI music experiments, the music Shimon is playing is generated by a method called deep learning. This essentially means mining a large amount of information (in this case, a dataset of some 5,000 songs) and looking for common patterns in the music. For example, if you have a sequence of notes F, G, A, what note will follow next? Deep learning will give you a good answer.
Shimon the robot has been around for a while now, playing alongside human musicians using preprogrammed songs. But now, it’s being used to play original compositions. The video above shows the first melody Shimon ever created, while the one below is melody number two — a slightly faster number:
As we’ve seen with previous experiments, the actual musical output is a bit avant-garde. Researchers working in this field say this is because the deep learning systems we use to analyze music tend not to be so good at thinking about long-term structure. They analyze the music in short bursts, and the resulting melodies sound quite abstract. It is possible to program in artificial constraints so the programs will produce songs with traditional verse-chorus structures, but at that point it’s not really AI-created music, but AI-human collaboration.
So, although the marimba is a particularly non-threatening instrument, the melody itself is proof that machines have a way to go. For more information on Shimon, check out this interview with its teachers, Gil Weinberg and Mason Bretan, over at IEEE Spectrum.
Hori is a well-respected Japanese video game accessory maker that’s been pumping out solid fighting sticks, gamepads, and screen protectors for pretty much as long as such things have existed. But I’m sorry, Hori, your new officially licensed Nintendo Switch keyboard is a deeply pointless product, and I’m here to suggest some improvements.
To be clear, a Nintendo Switch keyboard isn’t altogether a bad idea — at least not in Japan, where popular MMO Dragon Quest X is coming out soon. It’s just that this one has some... issues.
It’s not like no Japanese accessory maker has ever created an incredible keyboard for a Nintendo console before. This useless Hori effort made me think of ASCII’s awesome Gamecube controller keyboard, designed for Phantasy Star Online:
Just look at it! Now that’s a Nintendo keyboard. And with the Switch’s detachable Joy-Cons, you wouldn’t even have to make a full controller — just a keyboard with the rails for the Joy-Cons to slot into.
Like so:
Isn’t that better? I’m sure Hori could work with Nintendo to allow wireless input, or just include a wireless USB-A adapter for the dock. Throw a USB-C port on the keyboard itself and you could even get rid of the need for Nintendo’s really-should’ve-been-in-the-box Joy-Con Charging Grip, too.
But why stop there? This solution would still only work with the Switch in TV mode, robbing the system of its biggest selling point: versatility. What about those who want to play Dragon Quest X at Starbucks?
I think I have the answer. Lots of people use split keyboards for ergonomic reasons, and there are even gaming-focused models like this one from Kinesis. Inspired by that, and a suggestion from my colleague Rich, I’ve come up with the ultimate Switch peripheral:
Who wouldn’t want such a thing?
“Everyone in the world except like 17 people,” you say?
Okay, well, maybe. But dare to dream a little. It’d certainly bring more happiness to society than Hori’s actual Switch keyboard.
Which is coming out in Japan this September, in case you’re interested.
Amazon has released the Dash Wand, a new Alexa-enabled device that can help you scan grocery barcodes, convert measurements, and order household essentials from Amazon just by using your voice. The Wi-Fi-enabled Dash Wand is magnetic, so you can stick it on your fridge, and also offers some of the features of its bigger Echo sibling, allowing you to find recipes and restaurants without using your hands.
At a few inches long, and made out of white and black plastic, the Dash Wand looks like a refreshed version of the company’s original Dash devices. First released in 2014, those Dash also let you scan item barcodes or use voice controls to add products to your shopping cart, but forced you to check out via Amazon’s site. They also had no Alexa access — Amazon’s assistant wasn’t available to the public then — and were only available to a limited number of existing AmazonFresh users. A second-generation version cost $49.99 and could add anything on Amazon to a shopping cart, but users still had to check out manually.
The Dash Wand, on the other hand, lets you buy items directly, and is now available to all Amazon Prime subscribers in the United States. It’s priced at $20, but Amazon Prime subscribers who do pick one up will receive $20 back in their Amazon accounts, making the Dash Wand essentially a free purchase. Customers will theoretically then use that returned cash to buy things using their new Dash Wand, picking up paper towels, soap, and other household essentials by asking the device to order each one, rather than needing a more expensive Echo or an individual Dash button for each product. Buyers will also get a free 90-day trial of the AmazonFresh home grocery service.
Happy birthday to the GIF! The venerable file format turns 30 today, and Facebook is taking the opportunity to add a few GIF-related features to its service. Users could already post GIFs in status updates, but from June 15th, you’ll now be able to add GIFs in Facebook comments, allowing you to search through and select from a list of relevant files right there in the social network’s interface.
Facebook is also using the day to salute the surprisingly resilient format, throwing what it calls a “GIF party,” and offering statistics on its existing GIF usage. More than 13 billion GIFs were sent last year via Facebook Messenger, it says, after the company made the format usable on the chat service. The busiest day for GIFs was apparently January 1st this year, with more than 400 million sent, as hungover people across the globe let a short moving image do the legwork of expressing their friendship and love for them.
More worryingly, Facebook is also using the day to re-open the fractious debate about GIF pronunciation — hard or soft G — with a poll for US-based users. It’s a decision that may turn friend against friend and tarnish what should otherwise be a happy day, but we may finally work out what the people want, no matter what the format’s creator says.
A couple of weeks ago, District 9 and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp unveiled Oats Studios, his new project focusing on experimental short films. At the time, Blomkamp described the studio as an attempt to remain creative in a film industry that rewards endless sequels and franchises. Through Oats, he’ll be developing a range of potential projects, from serious science fiction to wackier concepts, with the hope that some of them may eventually make the leap to full-length feature films.
The first film from Oats Studios, Rakka, is now available for streaming on YouTube and Steam, and it depicts the aftermath of an alien invasion. The year is 2020, and aliens have enslaved humanity, and altering the Earth’s atmosphere. But Rakka isn’t a conventional short film. Instead, it’s a series of scenes depicting various points of view. Some scenes show what the aliens are doing to humanity; others track a resistance movement led by Sigourney Weaver, and an escaped prisoner named Amir. Later, in a climactic battle, resistance fighters shoot down an alien aircraft and track down its pilot.
On the eve of its release, I spoke with Blomkamp about his new film, the real-world inspirations, and the key to success for Oats Studios.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
This is the one of three projects Oats will be releasing in this initial volume of projects. Where did the story come from?
The original idea was to make make a science fiction piece that was about an occupying force in a foreign country, and it kind of grew around that. I always wanted to do a science fiction invasion piece that had direct parallels with an occupying force in a country, like the Germans in France, or Americans in Iraq. There's these levels of armed troops that are walking through neighborhoods, and well-built buildings, and local politicians have been turned or manipulated. There is a lot of stuff in there that I felt was really interesting, and to look at it from a different point of view is really cool. That's where the seed was from.
The narrator in the film says that in this environment, people have to do things that in peacetime would be really abhorrent, such as using a human being to bait a trap for the aliens. Is there another political parallel there that you were looking at?
No. There's a point at which I feel like you just start getting into character or pure sci-fi ideas. The same thing happened with District 9, where you started off with allegory, but there’s a certain point [when] it branches off, and as long as you’re not damaging the metaphor, then it's fine.
Some of that is just story or plot or character, and I think Nosh, [who proposes the bait idea], is so completely insane and nihilistic that what he's offering may tactically actually makes sense. But then in other times, it wouldn’t. That isn't necessarily a direct parallel with something related to war.
Tell me a little about the design in Rakka, because it feels quite a bit different from the other films that you've done.
The main idea that I like is that [the alien creatures] have this nanotech ferrofluid that changes shape. The aliens would have essentially come to earth in a lake. It forms whenever they need, and when they arrive at Earth, it probably split up into several pieces, with the different ships that formed out of it going to different continents and building the towers that they live in. They breathe a different atmosphere. If you look at the creature itself, it has this black hood on that also runs down the bridge of its nose. It's almost like a gas mask, but hooked directly into their nostrils. It just does whatever they need it to: it processes Earth's air into a mixture that they can breathe, it forms weapons, it forms the structures that they live in, it forms their vehicles. I just like the idea that [the fluid’s] always active, and it’s intelligent.
The aliens that we see in this piece, which we have dubbed the “Klum” aliens (rhymes with ‘plume’), are actually a sort of genetically cloned drone. They're not entirely sentient, and they're sent out by a far more intelligent species who we haven’t really seen yet.
There's a scene where a soldier sees something after his truck is blown up. Was that the superior alien species?
Yeah. They're floating around in the peripheral edges of our solar system, and they're visualizing what's happening on the Earth by proxy. They live inside some kind of quantum state back in their ship. They’re gathering any organism that they find that can help them think about how to survive the end of the universe. They know it's coming, and they don't want to die.
The Klum treat this species like a god. However, this intelligent species turned their back on them, but they didn’t do that to humans.
The character of Amir is an escaped prisoner. He's obviously been experimented on by the Klum. Can you tell me a little about him?
[The Gone World author] Thomas Sweterlitsch came up with this idea. The experimentation we see on Amir is the Klum trying to find out what this top-tier species sees in humanity: why are humans worthy of attention, but not the Klum? Amir wasn’t killed, and the experimentation gives him an eye into how the Klum see the world. I have ideas where his character goes, but we just have to see if the audience gets behind us in order for us to tell more of these stories.
So you see this as one small episode in a much larger story.
Yes. We don't know what form that story will take. Rakka feels like it could almost be more of an episodic thing, because there's a lot of avenues to explore. The footage is too unconventional and weird [for a mainstream feature], and the audience has to think of the footage as a snapshot into the window of this world.
It’s the same for the film we’re going to release in a couple of weeks. When the audience understands that this isn't the complete, final story, and they choose to get behind us financially, we can then figure out if this is an episodic thing, or if it’s one big feature film. There are other ideas that we have in Volume 1, and some that will be in Volume 2, that are explicitly feature films.
These stories aren’t pre-determined: they don't have to be HBO-style, 60-minute episodes. They can be multiple 20-minute pieces, you can have a five-minute window into a character with just one scene, or you can have a two-hour piece somewhere else.
It felt to me like you have the right amount of material for a future film with Rakka. You have the big set pieces that could then be connected with a much more complete story.
I've always thought of Rakka as much more in the camp of Star Trek or something, where you have a lot of interesting things to explore, rather than a movie. You could make a feature, but I think it's more interesting for it to be more of a long term, episodic format.
But if you had someone like 20th Century Fox come up and say that they wanted to do business, is that something you would be receptive to?
We would be receptive if our main goal failed. If you feel like you want to get behind it, go to Steam, buy the film instead of watching it for free. If you like what you see, the only way for us to make more is for you to give us cash to fuel the next round of stuff.
If that fails — which it probably stands a greater chance of failing than working — than a traditional approach to realizing some of the ideas is very much on the table. But it's not a goal. I could have just written Rakka, and went to Hollywood. I don't want to do that. I want to test this model and see if anyone in the world will get behind us.
Beyond Good & Evil 2 is dramatically different from the original — and that’s about all I can confidently say about the ambitious new game. First announced in 2008, Beyond Good & Evil 2 roared back to life this week at E3 with an explosive cinematic trailer that reintroduced players to Michel Ancel’s distinct and vibrant sci-fi universe. What the trailer didn’t show, however, was anything about how the game might play.
Not long after the reveal, Ancel and his team took me through a very early technical demonstration of the game. Where the original Beyond Good & Evil was a fairly straightforward third-person action adventure, its follow-up is something much larger and more complex. It combines elements of online worlds, early-access releases, role-playing games, and procedural generation. It’s also, admittedly, still pretty rough around the edges. Many of the game’s key elements — from graphics to combat to narrative — are still being implemented.
“There’s still a lot of work to do,” Ancel says, “but we now really believe that we’re going to make this game.”
But first, some clarification: while they bear the same name, this Beyond Good & Evil 2 and the one originally unveiled a decade ago are different games. Initially, the game was planned as a sequel, continuing the intrigue-laden story that turned the first Beyond Good & Evil into a beloved cult classic. Eventually, Ancel and his team at Ubisoft’s Montpellier studio decided to switch directions and create a prequel. The idea was to build an experience that could be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of whether or not they played the first game.
Three years ago they started working on the technology that would power the experience — it started out as a kind of solar system simulation tool — and only recently have they started actually building the game. “When you don’t have this technology, you can’t really start the game,” Ancel explains. “It’s too difficult. But now we can say for sure that we will make this game, we’ll finish it. Because we have the technology for it.” He describes the game’s current status as “day zero of development.”
Just what kind of game Beyond Good & Evil 2 will be is hard to pin down. It takes place in the same universe as the original, and is set a few generations before the events of that game. (Ancel insists “it’s not a reboot.”) Players will be able to create their own distinct in-game avatar, who will start on the bottom rung of society, before working their way up to become captain of a spaceship, complete with a crew. “Whatever character you choose, you will start at the very bottom of the social system,” Ancel says. “Maybe you’re delivering pizza. But one day you will have this gigantic spaceship.”
In a big shift from the first game, the prequel is structured like an RPG. You and your crew will develop new skills over time, and how you grow and change will reportedly depend on what you do and where you go. “You explore, you discover new cultures, those cultures are adapted to the planet, and then you can customize your ship based on what you discover on the planet,” Ancel explains.
Beyond Good & Evil 2 will be both a single-player experience and a co-operative online game, as Ancel says you’ll be able to play either by yourself or with friends. There’s also a shared world component, as certain in-universe events will happen for all players in the game. The worlds you’ll be exploring, Ancel explains, are a combination of hand-designed and procedurally generated. He describes it as “like a SimCity simulation.” Essentially, the developers have built all of the individual parts, as well as a logic system that puts them together in ways that make sense. This system allows them do things like fast-forward in time and instantaneously see how cities and planets will change over that span.
Similarly, the story itself appears to be something of a hybrid. Ancel explains that there is a specific narrative that will be told in the game, but that it will also include systemic events that happen based on what you do, the places you explore, and potentially the other players you interact with. “As developers, we can imagine that we will release other stories, other parts of the world,” he says. “We can expand it. But at the same time, we want to have that feeling of completion. ‘I’m going through a story and there’s a start, there’s an end.’ But you know how it is when you have online play — the real stories are going to come from people playing with each other.”
It all sounds incredibly ambitious, especially when you consider that Ancel also wants to treat Beyond Good & Evil 2 as something of an early access title, with a community of players offering feedback and testing early prototypes. The version of the game I saw, meanwhile, was still in a very early state. The graphics were mostly placeholder (Ancel says that “two weeks ago there were no graphics”) while aspects like combat and any kind of narrative aspect had yet to be implemented.
Instead, I was able to watch Ancel pilot a large ship that looked a bit like a flying submarine, around a rough version of the same city featured in the new trailer. According to Ancel, one of the pillars of the game is its sense of scale; the idea that you can explore places both huge and small. To demonstrate this, he flew his ship near a giant Ganesha statue that towered over the city, hopped out of his ship, and started walking around on the statue. Later on, he piloted his ship out of the atmosphere and into space; it reminded me a lot of the feeling in No Man’s Sky where you can see a planet on the horizon, and then actually fly there.
The big question, of course, is how all of these various elements and systems will fit together. And right now it’s just too early to tell. So much of the game right now consists of concepts and ideas, and it’ll be quite some time before we see them put into practice. Ancel says that 2018 is too early to expect the game’s release, though he hopes to have a new version of Beyond Good & Evil 2 ready for E3 next year, which will be “as close as possible to the trailer.”
That trailer ignited hope in the game’s vocal fanbase, who have been waiting years to learn just what’s happening with the game. It seems that Ancel has finally decided just what kind of game he wants to make — and next comes the hard part. “Now we are really building the game,” he says.
Dentists and patients alike want to know how to make dental work less traumatic — and one possible solution may be to combine it with virtual reality. That’s why researchers in the UK enlisted 80 people who needed a cavity filled or a tooth pulled, and separated them into three groups. They gave the first two groups VR headsets, but not the unlucky third control group.
The VR groups either got to explore a beach or navigate a city. The people in the control group just stared at the ceiling while the dentist yanked on their teeth. (Everyone in the study got pain meds or sedation if they needed it.) Patients were surveyed both immediately after their appointments, and a week later. The people immersed in the coastal VR reported less stress and pain than both the patients navigating through the virtual cityscape and the ones with no distraction — according to a study published today in Environment and Behavior.
Much bigger studies will need to be done to see if this holds up. But both the beach scene and the city do sound like reasonably pleasant virtual alternatives to watching the dentist’s tools at work (although two patients had to stop the city VR because they felt hot and dizzy).
Still, both locales are pretty unimaginative when you think about the virtual reality possibilities you could pair with the unique experience of a having a shrieking dental drill digging into your jaw. So, to help the researchers out, we came up with a menu of options for the full VR dental experience:
North Korea increasingly appears to have been behind the ransomware attack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers last month and shut down hospitals, businesses, and other systems in the process.
The Washington Post is now reporting that the US National Security Agency believes with “moderate confidence” that the ransomware, called WannaCry, came from hackers sponsored by North Korea’s spy agency. The report isn’t public, but the Post says the assessment has been distributed within the agency.
North Korea was first linked to WannaCry last month. Several cybersecurity researchers, including some at Symantec and Kaspersky Lab, saw code similarities between WannaCry and other malware previously traced back to North Korea.
At the time, the researchers said they only had a “weak” connection between WannaCry and the country, because there were other ways the code overlap could have occurred. But the NSA has now traced the ransomware back to IP addresses associated with North Korea’s spy agency, according to the Post.
Combined, the information builds a stronger case for North Korea being behind the attack. Specifically, the Post says a state-funded team known as the Lazarus Group appears to be responsible.
One very odd aspect about all of this is the fact that North Korea, a country, seems to have on some level been using WannaCry as a way to raise funds. When the malware infected a computer, it would lock down all files with encryption and demand that a $300 ransom be paid in bitcoin to restore them. Files would be deleted within seven days, the ransomware said, if the fee wasn’t paid.
According to the Post, that attempted payday hasn’t really worked. The bitcoin trail is apparently very easy to track, so it won’t be simple to cash out.
The WannaCry malware relied on leaked NSA code, so it doesn’t entirely prove North Korea’s hacking acumen either. But the country has repeatedly been involved in major hacking incidents over the past few years. In the US, most notably, it was said to be responsible for the 2014 breach of Sony Pictures. And the Post says it was linked last year to several thefts from banks throughout Asia.
In an attempt to even the playing field with competitors, Mozilla Firefox stepped up its game Tuesday by releasing an update that will increase browser speeds and cut down on memory usage.
Firefox 54 has opened up its upper limit of processes from one to four, although users can customize it to be more by entering “about:config” in the address bar and adjusting the settings themselves.
This new version of Firefox feels faster and it scores higher on an online browser speed test than Chrome or Safari, even after opening 20 tabs, although it still gives the old loading sign on all of the pages. Firefox product vice president Nick Nguyen calls this upgrade “the largest change to Firefox code in our history,” according to his blog post detailing the changes.
Have you used Firefox and wondered why it was so sluggishly slow? In the tech equivalent of finding out that someone has been manually inputting thousands of accounting entries into Excel, it turns out Firefox has been relying on a single operating system process to load multiple 2.5-megabyte-sized tabs at once.
In comparison, Google Chrome runs a process for every tab and then some. Right now, I’ve got 22 tabs open while typing this in Chrome yet 330 processes running on 1640 threads. In contrast to Chrome, the upgrade from single process to four processes may feel quite minimal. So why only four?
Even this slight increase in the number of processes comes with a trade-off for memory space, according to Mozilla software developers, reiterating Firefox’s reluctance to sacrifice RAM. Four is the optimal number the developers arrived at for computers with 8GB of RAM.
In order to adapt Firefox to run in multiple processes, Mozilla developers had to break Firefox Add-Ons that depend on a single-process architecture, Ryan Pollock, Firefox’s senior marketing manager, writes on Medium. Mozilla’s Project Quantum, created to optimize the browser engine running within a content process, remains in the works.
This latest software update seems to be building on aspirations that Firefox senior VP Mark Mayo expressed in January in an interview with The Verge. Mayo made it clear that Mozilla didn’t want the web to turn into a monopoly controlled by a few huge companies.
The improvements to Firefox come after a trying time for the company. In February, the company laid off about 50 employees after Firefox OS tanked, and Firefox employees have acknowledged how far the browser has fallen from its brighter days. But if Firefox can use less memory than Chrome and run slightly faster than it used to, it may present itself as a decent browser alternative. Nguyen is imploring former users to give the company another shot: “If you stopped using Firefox, try it again.”
Correction: June 14th, 8PM ET: This story has been updated to correct Ryan Pollock’s title. He is the senior product marketing manager for Firefox, not Mozilla’s head of product marketing.
The Nativ Vita music player looks like a tablet, except all you can do with it is play and control music. The 11.6-inch, 1920 x 1080 touchscreen device has onboard storage to host your digital music collection and can also access various streaming platforms, like Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and Tidal. The thing looks nice and has an impressive spec sheet.
Because it doesn’t include built-in speakers, it instead plays music through either USB, SPDIF, HDMI, and AES/EBU ports, or a Bluetooth, gigabit Ethernet, or 802.11ac Wi-Fi connection. You have options. It also includes a Cortex-A9 processor with 4GB of RAM, and up to two HDDs that support a max of 2TB of storage each. It’s also voice-controlled, has companion iOS, Android, and smartwatch apps, and includes an infrared remote. You can also stream over Google Cast or Apple Airplay. This thing does a lot and really seems like a legitimate option for someone who loves music and wants flexibility for their speaker setup.
Do I need a dedicated touchscreen solely for music when I can stream from my phone to my Bluetooth- or Wi-Fi-connected speakers? Probably not, especially when the Vita starts at $1,599, but at least it looks better than a PC and can be the music interface for a home. It’s now available and shipping through Nativ’s website.
Oftentimes, the best way to describe directions to someone is to explain using street view technology, so you can use notable landmarks as cues for turns and stops. While Google Maps has been pretty good at covering a large part of the world, it’s certainly missing one useful component: a helpful guide dog who photobombs every shot along the way.
At least that’s one competitive advantage for Daum, a Kakao-owned web portal, for its coverage in Ulleung-gun, Gyeongbuk, South Korea. Map services often employ human photographers to capture off-road images, and it appears this very good dog has decided to accompany just about every shot along the trail on this little South Korean island.
Need help finding that lookout point over the beautiful blue ocean? Sure, follow doggo up the stairs and hang when you’ve found the area with the wooden benches.
He / she even waits for you when you’re running behind.
Sometimes doggo is a little shy.
But never fear, we all just need a little break.
The photos appear to have been captured since July 2010, but I will happily take outdated directions with a side of fluffy virtual assistant. Explore on your own here.
Your move, Google Maps.
If you paid close attention to the 9-minute Spider-Man demo at Sony’s E3 2017 event, you might have noticed the superhero knocking a goon off a skyscraper — only to sling him safely back onto the building. Bryan Intihar, creative director of Insomniac Games, explained that the game won’t allow players to use Spidey’s abilities to kill villains, or anybody else for that matter.
“We wouldn’t not allow that,” said Intihar. “Marvel would not allow that, the world would not allow that.”
Intihar didn’t provide specifics about how the game prevents Spider-Man from committing first-degree murder, or you know, accidentally bumpy somebody a little too hard near a very high ledge. Though it appears, in the GIF above, the game’s AI may automatically perform the safety maneuver.
Like most mainstream superheroes, Spider-Man is largely known for pulverizing enemies within an inch of their life, while maintaining an acute moral high ground. Though in the past, Spider-Man has, despite what you might have assumed, killed his enemies a number of times.

Fantastic Four and X-Men: The Last Stand screenwriter Simon Kinberg has been tapped to direct the upcoming X-Men: Dark Phoenix movie for 20th Century Fox. Entertainment Weekly reports that it’s Kinberg’s directorial debut after producing several films in the X-Men universe, including Deadpool and Logan. Joining him are returning core cast members from X-Men: Apocalypse: James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, Sophie Turner, and others.
Dark Phoenix is another attempt on Fox’s part to tell the classic “Dark Phoenix” storyline from the comics. Taking place in the ‘90s, Dark Phoenix will reportedly see the X-Men take on Lilandra, the leader of the interstellar Shi’ar Empire played by newcomer Jessica Chastain, and the otherworldly Phoenix Force. The last time the X-Men were up against that Force was in The Last Stand, a movie so poorly received the franchise went out of its way to erase it from the series timeline.
With Kinberg and the cast signed on, it’s now full steam ahead for the movie as the X-Men franchise. The series, despite the middling reviews for X-Men: Apocalypse, is on an upswing after the successes of Deadpool, Logan, and FX’s Legion. And Kinberg, despite being a new director, has worked as an architect on the franchise for years, though the X-movies have seen more duds than successes on his watch. We’ll have to wait and see on this one.
At long last, the perfect score for arcade classic Ms. Pac-Man has been achieved, though not by a human. Maluuba — a deep learning team acquired by Microsoft in January — has created an AI system that’s learned how to reach the game’s maximum point value of 999,900 on Atari 2600, using a unique combination of reinforcement learning with a divide-and-conquer method.
AI researchers have a documented penchant for using video games to test machine learning; they better mimic real-world chaos in a controlled environment versus more static games like chess. In 2015, Google’s DeepMind AI was able to learn how to master 49 Atari games using reinforcement learning, which provides positive or negative feedback each time the AI attempts to solve a problem.
Though AI has conquered a wealth of retro games, Ms. Pac-Man has remained elusive for years, due to the game’s intentional lack of predictability. Turns out it’s a toughie for humans as well. Many have tried to reach Ms. Pac-Man’s top score, only coming as close as 266,330 on the Atari 2600 version. The game’s elusive 999,900 number though, has so far only been achieved by mortals via cheats.
Maluuba was able to use AI to beat the game by tasking out responsibilities, breaking it up into bite-sized jobs assigned to over 150 agents. The team then taught the AI using what they call Hybrid Reward Architecture — a combination of reinforcement learning with a divide-and-conquer method. Individual agents were assigned piecemeal tasks — like finding a specific pellet — which worked in tandem with other agents to achieve greater goals. Maluuba then designated a top agent (Microsoft likens this to a senior manager at a company) that took suggestions from all the agents in order to inform decisions on where to move Ms. Pac-Man.
The best results came when individual agents “acted very egotistically” and the top agent focused on what was best for the overall team, taking into account not only how many agents wanted to go in a particular direction, but the importance of that direction. (Example: fewer agents wanting to avoid a ghost took priority over a higher amount of agents wanting to pursue a pellet.) “There’s this nice interplay,” says Harm Van Seijen, a researcher with Maluuba, “between how they have to, on the one hand, cooperate based on the preferences of all the agents, but at the same time each agent cares only about one particular problem. It benefits the whole.”
Maluuba says this Hybrid Reward Architecture version of AI learning has expansive, practical applications, like helping to predict a company’s sales leads, or making advances in natural language processing. Watch Microsoft explain its methods, above.
Plugging things in is no fun, especially when a certain company refuses to embrace industry-standard plugs. Wireless charging is an obvious solution, which has been embraced by many Android manufacturers but has remained conspicuously absent from the iPhone. That might be about to change.
Wistron is a manufacturer in India, which Apple recently added to its roster to increase market share in the country and bring prices down. On Wednesday, Wistron's CEO Robert Hwang told reporters that the next generation of iPhones will include "new features like waterproof and wireless charging."
Hwang was talking about the increased complexity of manufacturing over previous iPhone generations, and since right now Wistron only makes the iPhone SE, it's probable that the waterproofing he's referring to is the same level of water resistance that the iPhone 7 has. But the mention of wireless charging is a big slip-up and a nice ray of hope for anyone who has been begging for this feature.
Other signs and rumors have pointed to wireless charging for the next iPhone, not least of which was a note from Ming-Chi Kuo, a typically reliable analyst at KGI Securities, back in February predicting that exact feature. Then a schematic leaked in April of unknown provenance and legitimacy, which showed a large pad the exact shape of a wireless charging antenna:
This is a tipped leak what means I can't confirm if legit or not but there you have it... #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/6OgASNUDNb
And a Reddit post a couple of days ago showed a purported font and back panel. The back panel is glass, which is another important factor for wireless charging:
This is more evidence than we usually have at this time about an upcoming iPhone, but it's still far enough away from launch that things could change between now and then. (Apple usually announces its iPhones in September, and the next iPhone has been rumored to be delayed.) But hopefully all our dreams come true and iPhone users can finally enter the wireless charging era.
Alto’s Odyssey, the sequel to the runaway mobile hit Alto’s Adventure, is set for release this summer, and amid all the hype and noise of E3, developer Snowman quietly showed off our first good look at gameplay for the upcoming endless snowboarding game.
As teased in the initial trailer, Alto’s Odyssey moves the action from the snow-capped peaks of the first one to “a variety of desert locales.” Rails are attached to moving balloons instead of stationary buildings, which characters will be able to bounce off of to reach greater heights. Dust devils dance at the edge of jumps, ready to propel players upward. And in addition to the jumping, flipping, and rail-grinding mechanics from the first game, Odyssey is adding the ability to wall ride, allowing characters to scale up the side of cliffs with a single tap.
It’s still too early to judge, but so far Alto’s Odyssey looks like a great sequel to the original game, keeping the fluid gameplay and stunning scenery that made the first Alto title so good, while expanding mechanics in some interesting ways.
Alto’s Odyssey is set to release sometime this summer.
Hollywood properties have been getting VR tie-ins frequently over the past few years, but now The Walking Dead is stepping things up with an entire series of virtual reality games. Skybound Entertainment, the production company co-founded by Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman, announced this morning that it is partnering with Skydance Interactive to produce the titles.
While audiences are most familiar with the story of Rick Grimes, featured in both the comic series and the AMC television show, the first VR game will actually focus on a entirely different set of characters. It’s not clear if later games will bring in more familiar faces, but according to Skybound Interactive president Dan Murray, Kirkman’s comic will be the primary inspiration. There’s no projected release date or other specifics for any of the projects just yet, but the press release issued by both companies does state that the first game will let players experience the world of The Walking Dead “through an innovative contextual interaction system.”
If that sounds vague and needlessly jargon-y, that’s because it is. But Skybound has been relentlessly forward-thinking when it comes to exploring digital platforms. The company produced the YouTube Red series Scare PewDiePie (before PewDiePie self-immolated, that is), and it is also working on a virtual reality adaptation of the interactive horror play Delusion. Most recently, Skybound showed off a film called Captured at the Overlook Film Festival, which used a mobile app to deliver additional content to audiences while they were watching the movie in real time. Of course, The Walking Dead itself has had a particularly strong run with its interactive Telltale game series.
Skydance Interactive has already been working in virtual reality as well, showing off its upcoming title Archangel as part of the offerings at IMAX’s new virtual reality arcades. (The title will be coming to consoles in July.) It’s not clear yet whether the new Walking Dead games will be brought to IMAX locations under Skydance’s existing partnership, but these kind of high-profile, IP-based titles could be a perfect fit for the location-based VR installations IMAX is working on. Of course, the benefit of something as widely popular as The Walking Dead is that it could potentially encourage headset adoption among consumers as well, making it a particularly intriguing option for gaming console VR.
Updated, June 15th, 1:15PM: Clarified language about Skydance’s existing partnership with IMAX.
Late last year, Netflix enabled downloads for offline playback, which was great news for subscribers who take planes, ride the subway, or own a phone. The function came with some minor caveats, like expiration dates for downloads and limited support for microSD storage on Android devices. Now, another limitation with offline playback is causing grumbles: some content can only be downloaded a finite number of times a year.
As pointed out by Android Police, the notification appears without advanced warning, popping up only when you’re about to hit the download threshold. If you try to download after reaching the limit, you’ll receive an error.
Android Police doesn’t have an exact figure on what this limit is, placing an estimate at four to five downloads a year. It’s also not Netflix’s fault the limit exists, as it doesn’t own the vast majority of the content it offers, and so, it is beholden to rights holders.
What is incredibly annoying, though, is that there are multiple scenarios where these limits could kick in before you ever watch something offline. Some offline content expires in as little as 48 hours, for example, leaving a short viewing window that can be interrupted by things like, you know, life. And what about offline content deleted to free up storage that then can’t be re-downloaded?
It’s worth noting that Netflix does state on a help page regarding downloads: “Due to studio limits, you may not be able to renew all titles. If you are unable to renew a title but would still like to watch it, you’ll need to connect to the internet to stream.” So, this info isn’t new and Netflix sort of puts it out there, but even the help page suggests you might find this out after your initial download(s), not before. PSA — if you didn’t know before, now you do. Wee.
During Game of Thrones’ second season, Arya Stark famously tells Tywin Lannister, “Anyone can be killed.” No line better encapsulates the show. Over the course of six seasons, fans have seen kings and peasants killed so often that it’s a wonder that we’re not desensitized to it all. YouTube channel Leon Andrew Razon Compilations stitched together the show’s on-screen deaths and attempted to count them all, and even though it’s only an estimate, it’s a staggering number.
Including rough estimations of who died during large-scale battles and city sieges, the final tally comes out to 150,966 deaths. That’s a ludicrous number for a TV show, even though the editor is inflating the numbers a little by counting the unsettling number of bird, horse, sheep, and dire wolf deaths, too.
Watching all this bloodletting can be thrilling and / or depressing, depending whether, like me, you’re still sad about the deaths of a few favorite characters. (Margaery!) Just don’t take this as a complete death toll for the entire series, because there’s no way it’s even close. Elio Garcia, a research assistant for author George R.R. Martin, once estimated that Westeros’ entire population is approximately 40 million. The War of the Five Kings (the war where everyone wants to rule the kingdoms for occasionally justifiable reasons) pulled armies from across the continent into a multi-theater conflict, killing thousands over the course of several years. Imagine all the murders and beheadings we don’t see on the show. Like that time Gregor Clegane went reaving through the countryside before the war even started:
It isn’t crazy to think millions died over the years. The show just has to leave some things offscreen.
Season 7 starts in a month, and the so-called Great War is about to begin. It won’t just be kings and queens. It’ll be dragons and ice zombies. The death toll is only going to get higher. Just don’t try to keep count.
When it arrived in 2014, Warner Bros.’ Shadow of Mordor delivered a masterful action role playing game set in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth. But the game offered just a hint of the developer’s actual vision, says Bob Roberts, the game’s design director. Shadow of Mordor told only about half of the story they originally envisioned, and its most novel design feature — the “nemesis system” that generates new stories for everyone who plays — was also pared back.
Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the sequel to be released this fall, offered an opportunity for Monolith Productions to fill in those blanks. Both the scope of the storytelling and the nemesis system have been greatly expanded, and they come together in the game’s fortress sieges — a series of epic, chaotic encounters that have been a highlight of this year’s E3.
Shadow of War picks up where Mordor left off, with the widowed ranger Talion still fused to the ghostly presence of Celebrimbor — an elf tricked by Sauron into forging the Rings of Power. (The story takes place between The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, but stands alone.)
As you fight your way through Middle-earth, you encounter nasty orcs known as Uruks who are hell-bent on killing you. If they succeed, they are promoted and gain new powers, making them more difficult to kill when you are reborn. Moreover, they’ll taunt you when you return, often in crudely hilarious terms. If you succeed, you can kill them — or you can take control of their minds and press them into your service.
In Mordor, you could use these dominated Uruks to trigger infighting within orc ranks. But in War, they become your army — and with the orcs at your side, you can storm entire fortresses and claim them for the Bright Lord.
At the suggestion of a Monolith employee, I started my time with War by attempting to seize a fortress. If Mordor was primarily a hack-and-slash affair, War demands a more tactical approach. First, I used some skill points to bolster Talion’s combat abilities. Next, I assigned four dominated Uruks to join me in battle, with each one leading dozens of orc soldiers. I could also designate one Uruk as my personal bodyguard, who I could call for assistance in battle with the press of a button.
Before the siege, War will show you the fortress’s defenses — its strengths, its weaknesses, and what sort of terrors are lurking inside. You can also spend in-game currency on items that will help you win — poisonous spiders who will eat away at your enemies’ health, for example, or a dragon who will roast everything in its path. When you’re ready, you tap a button and lead your army into battle.
Taking a fortress is a four-step process. First, you must capture three “victory points” scattered around the fortress. You do this by clearing out enemies with the help of your army. It’s tricky, though, because victory points are guarded by war chiefs — heavily armored Uruks who can take you out with just a few swings of their swords. Only after dispatching the chiefs can you challenge the fortress’s overlord to a fight, and you capture it by defeating him.
A more patient player might attempt to attack war chiefs when they’re away from their fortresses — though they will themselves be surrounded by well armed bodyguards. I was on a tighter time frame, and charged directly into battle — and quickly paid the iron price. War chiefs slaughtered me on each of two attempts to capture a fortress, and after a pair of defeats I waved a white flag and asked if I could play one of more manageable story missions. (It was delightful.)
But I’m eager to get back to the sieges, particularly during a proper playthrough when I’ve re-mastered the game’s controls and can take a more thoughtful approach to battle. Roberts tells me that most players will attempt their first siege only after several hours of gameplay — it’s meant to be a culmination, not an introduction. In a separate demonstration, I watched a Monolith employee successfully claim a fortress over about 20 minutes of gameplay, and it was thrilling to watch. Her team of Uruks stood up to their enemies with ease, and her clever attacks reduced the overlord to a pile of cinders.
Roberts tells me War’s best attribute is in the way its various systems collide — combat, role play, open-world questing, and the nemesis system, all working together to create a unique path for every player. It’s unpredictable in the best way, he says, before telling me a story about a recent moment in which a nearly-dead orc tried to retreat from Talion. “You haven’t seen the last of me,” the orc taunted — and as he was saying it, a giant beast known as a graug suddenly appeared, picked him up and ate him. The team at Monolith didn’t even know that could happen, Roberts says. “That may never happen again,” he adds. “But it happened for us. And it made our day.”


In summer 2014, an intern at the ACLU found a memo from a public meeting in which the San Jose Police Department asked to be reimbursed for a “UAV,” which he immediately recognized as a type of drone.
“It was tucked in the back of an agenda item,” says Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties policy for the ACLU of California. The City Council approved the purchase of the $8,000 drone as part of a million-dollar federal grant, but there had been no public debate over the merits of acquiring such a controversial piece of equipment.
Ozer asked community members if they knew about the drone purchase. “We thought maybe we just missed it but everyone else knew about it,” Ozer says. But no one they reached out to had any idea.
The incident confirmed a fear shared by civil liberties advocates: police departments around the country were buying surveillance equipment with FEMA homeland security grants with little oversight. Each year, over $1 billion of these grants are funneled to municipalities across the country, bypassing local budget processes and leaving community members in the dark about the acquisition of advanced surveillance arsenals. Cities in California have purchased or attempted to acquire drones, cellphone tower simulators, and other tools previously reserved for the federal government.
“We found, across the board, that even basic public conversation and debate was absent,” Ozer says.
The drone discovery was one of the events that led California’s Santa Clara County to become, in June 2016, the first in the country to pass an ordinance requiring transparency for police surveillance technology based on a recent ACLU model. The law requires public input, an impact report, and a use policy with details about data sharing before equipment is purchased. (Seattle passed a similar law in 2013, also with ACLU involvement, but its scope was limited to video surveillance.)
Last fall, the ACLU announced a nationwide strategy in partnership with over a dozen other civil liberties groups to promote similar bills in cities across the country. Called Community Control Over Police Surveillance, or CCOPS, the ACLU says there are bills with sponsors in 19 cities nationwide and one public transit system, the Bay Area’s BART. Chad Marlow, who is overseeing the nationwide strategy for CCOPS at the ACLU, says that organizing is underway in an additional 46 cities and one state, though he doesn’t expect them all to find sponsors.
In California, bills are up for debate in Oakland, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Palo Alto. Similar initiatives are underway in New York City, which will hold a hearing on June 14th, as well as smaller cities nationwide such as Somerville, Massachusetts; Madison, Wisconsin; and Richmond, Virginia.
Nicole Ozer says that over and over again she has seen communities fight back against the creep of surveillance technology. She believes ordinances like the one the ACLU is pushing are a first step to accomplish this.
“When communities know what’s happening, they are in a much better position to fight against it,” Ozer says. “You can’t fight what you don’t know.”
In Santa Clara County, where the law has been enforced since June 2016, community members say it’s working as intended, though the quality of use policies vary. After the law was introduced, 16 use policies were submitted at once for new and existing equipment. Some policies passed quickly with little scrutiny, while others were rejected; at least one policy passed despite public criticism.
When the Sheriff’s Department sought to fit officers with body-worn cameras, the ordinance required them to publicize a surveillance-impact statement and use policy before a scheduled public hearing. A draft use policy was deemed too broad by critics at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, ACLU, and CAIR, who voiced their objections in a letter to the Board of Supervisors. They took issue with the policy’s year-long data retention period, the ability of officers to view footage before giving testimony in certain situations, and lack of protections against biometric analysis like facial recognition.
Following an update on the use policy, the body-worn cameras were approved by the board of supervisors on January 24th, 2017. The new requirements prohibit the use of data for biometrics, requiring future approval from the county.
But when questions arose over a purchase enabling aerial infrared surveillance, the input of civil liberties advocates through the CCOPS process was brushed aside. In 2016, the Santa Clara Sheriff’s Department proposed a $620,000 purchase of an integrated helicopter mapping system that included a Forward Looking Infrared Imaging System, or FLIR, a type of thermal camera. The technology has been controversial since the early ‘90s, when the Supreme Court ruled that thermal imaging constituted a search requiring a warrant.
The use policy of the Sheriff’s Department and an early impact report approved a broad range of uses for the mapping system and thermal camera, and dismissed concerns about privacy as misinformed. Approved uses in the draft policy include “tracking suspects,” “evidence collection,” and, most vaguely, “other law enforcement or first responder uses not prohibited by law.”
That triggered a critical letter from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that called into question the necessity of the mapping system, arguing that aerial recordings of civilians created significant civil liberties problems. The letter was not enough to sway Santa Clara’s Board of Supervisors, and the Sheriff’s Department’s use policy stayed as is.
Adam Schwartz, a lead counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who authored the letter to the board, says that both the body cam and the FLIR case are evidence that CCOPS is effective.
“We would never have known this was happening if it wasn’t for the ordinance,” Schwartz says. “In both instances, we think the system worked the way it’s supposed to work. We don’t just wake up as civilians and all of a sudden there’s a new mapping system on a helicopter, or a new body-worn camera on the officers. Rather there’s a notice to the public beforehand, and an opportunity for public discussion.”
Other community members reiterated that merely being able to ask questions about surveillance technology and have them answered is reassuring.
Sameena Usman is a coordinator at the Council of American-Islamic Relations’ Bay Area office, one of the groups that advocated for the ordinance in Santa Clara. Usman attended the hearing when the FLIR was discussed. To Usman, the value of the ordinance is that it mandates transparency.
“That transparency has built trust,” Usman says.
The ACLU’s Marlow says that support for CCOPS-modeled legislation has largely been bipartisan. “We face neither resistance from the left or right,” Marlow says. “The only place we face resistance is from the police.”
In Pensacola, Florida, a version of the ordinance is being sponsored by City Council member Jewel Cannada-Wynn, and it is backed the state’s NAACP chapter, as well as libertarian and Republican groups.
“How often do people from both parties agree on anything?” says Sara Latshaw, regional organizer for the ACLU in Northwest Florida, who is overseeing CCOPS in Florida.
Bill Fetke is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a conservative grassroots group, and a supporter of the ordinance in Pensacola. He says he has confidence in local law enforcement, but opposes what he views as overreach by the state.
“There’s a camera watching you every five feet,” Fetke says. “I don’t do anything wrong, but I don’t want a camera staring at me every five seconds.”
Reaction from some conservatives he knows has been mixed, Fetke says.
“Most people kind of think I’m wearing a tinfoil hat,” he says. “They don’t think it applies to them. Even the libertarians who are in the middle aisle.” But he believes conservatives who don’t support the ordinance are thinking short-term.
“We need to force our government to follow rules,” Fetke says. “If we don’t stop them here, they’re going to trample all over our Fourth, Ninth, 10th Amendments.”
The spread in the use of body cameras by police departments across the country, often implemented with poor use policies, is another reason the surveillance bill is finding support. Promoted as accountability tools, departments also view body cameras as tools for gathering incriminating evidence, and most use policies make it difficult for family members of a victim in an officer-involved shooting to acquire footage.
In Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where a CCOPS ordinance is being sponsored, a police spokesman told the press that officers would use body cameras to gather evidence. “A lot of times we may not catch everything, but we can go back and look at it later,” the spokesman told the Hattiesburg American. A use policy for Hattiesburg’s body-worn cameras has never been made public. CCOPS legislation would force the department to release that policy.
Zaki Manian, of Restore The Fourth, a Bay Area-based civil liberties group, says organizations like his have a complicated relationship with body cameras. Manian believes they can be a tool for accountability, but mounting evidence suggests they could be used as just another surveillance technology.
“The only way you can ethically sort of balance these concerns is with consent of people in the community,” Manian says.
But even supporters of CCOPS admit the legislation has its limits. One fear is that the law would merely legitimize surveillance technologies that now exist in legal gray zones.
“When you pass a law, you create legality where there wasn’t,” says Malkia Cyril of the Center for Media Justice, a Bay Area nonprofit. “We create the legal framework where they can be legally abused.”
Cyril is opposed to police body cameras, and is skeptical that use policies, such as those arbitrated through CCOPS legislation, will be enough to rein in the abuse of surveillance in over-policed communities.
“Whether or not you have a use policy, does not mean there’s a way to enforce a use policy,” Cyril says.
“I can’t reiterate enough how dangerous it would be to me to if we rested on the laurels of a municipal policy. It’s insufficient. It’s important and insufficient,” Cyril says.
The limit of the ordinance is particularly visible in NYC, where the state’s constitution does not allow the City Council to veto NYPD purchases, and where pressure from a powerful police union has caused Mayor de Blasio, who campaigned on police reform, to bow to pressure more than once.
NYC’s CCOPS ordinance, dubbed the POST Act, is sponsored by 15 council members and is set for a City Council hearing on June 14th.
Like the ordinance in Santa Clara and bills elsewhere, it requires a use policy and public comment for the purchase of any surveillance equipment. But while the police commissioner would need to submit a use policy informed by public comments to the City Council, no city entity would need to approve a purchase. The only oversight would come from the NYPD Inspector General, an independent agency that audits the NYPD, which would be tasked with making sure the NYPD’s surveillance deployments are consistent with its own use policies. The process is similar to the public consultation that the NYPD undertook prior to rolling out a pilot body camera program in April. But that use policy came under criticism for not fully taking citizens’ opinions into account.
Nevertheless, proponents argue the legislation will promote transparency and force police departments to think critically about surveillance.
“It’s really about getting them to change the way they think,” says Brian Hofer of Oakland Privacy. He says in the months since the Santa Clara ordinance was put in place, he’s seen the use policies submitted by the police improve. It’s a sign, he suggests, that the law is working.
But the uncertainty as to whether the NYPD, or any police department across the country, will adhere to strengthened guidelines for their surveillance gear may be why advocates like Center for Media Justice’s Malkia Cyril are skeptical about an over-reliance on policy, while also acknowledging it as a necessary first step.
“Policy is one thing,” Cyril says. “Power is another.”

Call of Duty: WWII is supposed to be the Activision franchise’s back-to-basics moment: an opportunity to shed recent COD installments’ future-obsessed trappings and craft a “serious” shooter game against the backdrop of the world’s most horrific war. Developer Sledgehammer Games said as much here at E3 in Los Angeles. “Coming off of Advanced Warfare, it felt right for us,” says Aaron Halon, the game’s multiplayer lead, in an interview with The Verge. “We really want Call of Duty to get back to the grittiness, the brutality of war. That’s really what WWII did for our game.”
But judging from one recorded video of a campaign mission and some time with the game’s multiplayer mode this week at E3, COD: WWII comes across as just another shooter from the aging franchise. It doesn’t appear to have much to say about one of history’s most devastating conflicts — at least, nothing that hasn’t already been said by countless films, books, and television shows before it. And if WWII as a concept is supposed to revive COD as a game series, Sledgehammer doesn’t seem equipped to take the risks necessary to pull it off. Striking a balance between artful war commentary and mass-market pulp is hard enough. It becomes a daunting, perhaps impossible, task for a major game studio to do so with the expectation that it sell as many copies as Activision demands.
On one hand, sure: this is a shooter franchise, and COD’s primary mission has been to generate video game combat with ever-increasing technical sophistication. The kinds of personal and affecting stories that have defined the genre in other media have always taken a backseat to adrenalized thrill rides. (Sledgehammer made 2014’s Advanced Warfare, which featured exoskeletons and jetpacks, while developer Infinity Ward took the series to space in last year’s Infinite Warfare.) No one is expecting COD to outdo Saving Private Ryan in narrative ambition.
At the same time, Activision and Sledgehammer have sold this installment of COD as a kind of meditation on the costs of violence. “This global conflict was rooted in some true atrocities,” Sledgehammer co-founder Michael Condrey told Polygon in an interview earlier this year. “The story is anchored in some iconic moments in the war. The D-Day invasion in Normandy was one of those. There are also other things that make the war so powerful. The historical context of the atrocities of World War II is something that we want to tell the players.”
"We absolutely show atrocities," Bret Robbins, the game’s senior creative director, told Mashable back in April. "It's an unfortunate part of the history, but you can't tell an authentic, truthful story without going there. So we went there." But Sledgehammer has yet to disclose to what extent the game will acknowledge or feature, for example, any aspect of the Holocaust, one aspect WWII games have historically omitted.
So at first blush, Sledgehammer appears to have crafted something that feels less Spielberg and more Michael Bay. Big, explosive set pieces pause to showcase gruesome, dismemberment-heavy deaths. The stakes feel high in the way imminent death always does, and the action is compelling. But it’s not yet clear the game has the heart to hold it all together. You’re still basically just mowing down virtual human beings in ever-more-elaborate ways — throwing grenades over barricades, lighting men on fire, sniping heads from a bell tower — as you head from one objective marker to the next on a quest to save the world from bad guys.
The protagonist, a young Texan named Robert “Red” Daniels, is a fresh face for a COD game, even if he feels like a derivative Hollywood trope. Daniels is not a super soldier or a superhero, nor is he a grizzled war veteran. He’s just an everyday kid who gets tossed into the madness of WWII. Yet the game doesn’t give him, or you as the player, a directive other than to survive, kill, and advance. The primary perspective on view is that of the American soldier — a viewpoint that’s been explored time and again. (You will also get to play as a member of the French Resistance and a British officer, but it’s not apparent they serve a broader purpose other than to switch it up now and again.)
Contrast that with Electronic Arts’ Battlefield 1. That game, while mired by some of the same pitfalls that make mowing down armies of men a comically absurd chore, successfully strove to be a smarter breed of shooter. It balanced the genre’s intrinsic glorification of violence with a sense of disorientation that leaves you reeling and shell-shocked. Both in its single-player campaign and on the multiplayer front, BF1’s aesthetic and narrative choices made clear how the conflicts of the 20th century devalued human life. It was, at times, an anti-war message trapped in a best-selling FPS.
This is not to say that COD: WWII is not fun or entertaining. The game’s new multiplayer war mode, which has one team fighting to hold its ground while another advances, is exhilarating. The combat feels smooth, and the new class and weapons systems feel distinctive. COD still manages to be just fast-paced and intense enough to get your adrenaline pumping.
COD as a franchise made its mark on the first-person shooter genre — before it rose to record-breaking heights with 2007’s Modern Warfare — with three full games set during WWII. That it has returned again smacks of creative exhaustion.
Returning to its roots and “putting boots back on the ground,” as company representatives like to say, may be a convenient way to court back disaffected fans. But it’s not clear those fans will be returning to something drastically different. COD: WWII may feature all the old battlefields and weapons you see on the History Channel. But it feels, for now, like a shooter game in desperate need of a soul.

For the first time ever, Grammy voters for the 2018 awards show will cast their votes online, instead of with paper ballots. The Recording Academy hopes the swap will increase voter turnout and encourage younger members to vote, the LA Times reports.
The new online ballots will also give eligible voters the option to listen to the songs that have been nominated, as a way of encouraging voters to actually listen to the artists they’re voting for, BuzzFeed News reports.
One of the most common criticisms of the music awards show — from both artists and fans — is that it’s out-of-touch. The night’s biggest awards often seem to go to the most popular or recognizable artists, frequently snubbing critic- and fan-favorites. In 2014, Mackelmore’s The Heist won Best Rap Album over Kendrick Lamar’s Good Kid M.A.A.D. City — a snub that even Mack saw fit to publicly and dramatically apologize for. Last year, after Adele’s 25 won Album of the Year, she said, “My album of the year is Lemonade,” referring to Beyoncé’s critically adored visual album. Frank Ocean chose not to submit his album Blonde for Grammy nomination last year, telling The New York Times, “I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated.”
According to BuzzFeed News, the Recording Academy hopes that if its younger members turn out to vote online, the awards might more accurately reflect the listening habits of younger generations.
"There may be certain genres within our awards categories where the demographic that tends to participate in making that particular music might be more tech savvy in general, or might have more of a mobile lifestyle than certain other genres, and we think this might appeal to those folks,” Recording Academy VP Bill Freimuth told BuzzFeed News.
The internet has been proven to appeal to a lot of folks. The 60th Grammy Awards are scheduled to take place on January 28th, 2018 in New York City.
Marissa Mayer is no longer the CEO of Yahoo, following the company’s acquisition by Verizon. And as such, Mayer is not only a job-free woman, she is also no longer bound to Yahoo’s product portfolio. That’s right, she can use Gmail, and she’s psyched about it. At a conference in London today, Mayer reportedly said she is “looking forward to going back to Gmail” because she’s “always faster when using a tool I designed myself.”
"I'm looking forward to going back to Gmail"; @marissamayer on life post-Yahoo #fflondon
Marissa Mayer at accelerateHER forum: "I look forward to using Gmail again. Am always faster when using a tool I designed myself"#FFLondon
Dang! Shade! Remember, Mayer spent 13 years at Google managing multiple products, including search and Google Doodles. She was employee #20 at the company when she was hired in 1999, right out of Stanford. We’re all happy for you, Marissa. Enjoy Gmail’s suggested responses and labels and stay far, far away from sad Yahoo Mail.
Update 12:34 PM ET: Mayer tweeted that she plans to keep her Yahoo Mail account and credited its team for improving it.
I will continue to use the excellent Yahoo Mail too.  The team's hard work paid off with a dramatically better product. https://t.co/ZQyTvjULlW
It isn’t clear how she’ll use her email, although we do all need a burner account for random list servs and newsletter sign-ups.
There have been a lot of ultrawide monitors hitting the market recently, but Dell has been the king of the space (followed closely by LG) since the standard was introduced. Now the company is back with a massive, 38-inch curved ultrawide monitor, and I need one very badly.
The Dell UltraSharp 38 Curved Monitor (U3818DW) ticks nearly every box you want checked in a monitor this size if you’re looking for a productivity display. It features a 3440 x 1440 resolution, a 100w USB-C connection that can charge your laptop while transmitting data, and integrated dual 9w speakers.
The only downside here is the price, as the U3818DW comes in at a hefty $1,499. You can purchase the Dell UltraSharp 38 Curved Monitor on Dell.com beginning on June 23rd.
As NASA works toward sending people into deep space, the agency is looking for new types of space habitats that astronauts can live in far from Earth. One company, Nanoracks, has a design idea in mind — but rather than build something completely new, the company has a bold plan to recycle space hardware to create living quarters. Their plan: turn used rocket tanks into suitable places for deep-space explorers to live.
And now, Nanoracks has signed a contract with NASA to start turning this habitat concept into reality. Last summer, the company was one of six picked to be part of the second round of NASA’s NextSTEP program, an initiative to create concepts and ground prototypes of novel deep-space habitats. Now with a finalized contract, Nanoracks can get to work on developing its concept, called Ixion, and eventually turning a spent rocket tank into a habitat that can then be tested out in space.
Basically, the company just wants to utilize hardware that would otherwise go to waste. When a satellite launches on top of a rocket, the probe is typically delivered into its final orbit by the vehicle’s upper stage — the top section of the rocket that contains its own separate engine(s) and fuel. That means the upper stage usually orbits along with the satellite after it’s been deployed from the rocket. By the time it’s in orbit, most of propellant in the stage’s tank has been depleted, which creates a whole lot of empty space that is going unused.
If these stages go to a low enough orbit, they’re usually deorbited on purpose; any remaining propellant is used to redirect the stage toward Earth and have it burn up in the atmosphere. That way they don’t add to the growing amount of space debris already around Earth. But instead of getting rid of these stages, Nanoracks wants to keep them in orbit and then refurbish them, turning them into something completely new. “We’re augmenting what already exists,” Mike Johnson, chief designer at NanoRacks, tells The Verge. “You kind of double down for your money.”
The plan would be to vent the rest of the propellant out into space, making the tank completely empty. Or if the rocket uses cryogenic propellants, as many modern vehicles do, then the materials will boil off after a few days as the stage orbits Earth and is heated up by the Sun. Once the tank is completely empty, Nanoracks will fill it with pressurized air from smaller vessels attached to the outside. In fact, each of these tanks-turned-habitats will have smaller modules attached to the outside, containing vital supplies like life support systems and cargo that can be used to make the tank a viable place to live. The modules can also be used to attach the stage to other habitats already in space.
After the tank is pressurized, then it’s time to send in a crew — either humans or robots — to outfit the inside. Most propellant tanks are equipped with small hatches, and the company plans to add docking tunnels to these hatches to allow crews to get inside the tanks. They’ll then bring in foldable fabrics to make the interior a little more astronaut-friendly and comfier than just an empty metal structure. “The outfitting equipment is pretty lightweight; it’s made out of fabric and built in wiring,” says Johnson. “Compared to other ways of creating habitable space, it’s really a cheap way to do it — in terms of cheap in mass, cheap in cost, and cheap volume.”
It’ll be a while before such habitats are open for new tenants though. For now, Nanoracks is focused on developing the concept further and creating a prototype on the ground. After that, the team will try to refurbish a tank within one of the upper stages made by the United Launch Alliance, called Centaur. This stage is currently used on the Atlas V rocket and will soon be used on the company’s next vehicle called Vulcan. They then hope to attach this refurbished tank to the International Space Station for testing. And if all goes well, the tank may just stay there. “A secondary objective is that we could leave it there and potentially create a commercial space station module on the ISS,” says Johnson.
Nanoracks is aiming to get the tank habitat to the ISS in the next four years or so, says Johnson. But for now, the company is focused on this first contract with NASA, which involves doing a study on the concept’s feasibility. Out of all the other companies in the NextSTEP program, Nanoracks is the only company that plans to outfit used tanks, and Johnson hopes that will give them a lot of flexibility moving forward. “Anything that uses an upper stage could use this concept,” he says. “It really fits in everywhere.”






Patreon, the subscription-based funding platform that supports creators like Amanda Palmer and the Kinda Funny team, is getting a major update that includes live-streaming capabilities and a new visual design. Patreon co-founder Jack Conte says the features are intended to give creators more ways to engage directly with their patrons, while also giving them more ways to analyze and keep track of their subscriber base. They’ve been tested with a limited number of people on the platform, but will now be rolling out on a large scale.
One of the additions is a new app called “Lens,” which Conte describes as something like Snapchat or Instagram Stories, but limited to Patreon subscribers. The app “makes it really easy for creators to give patrons a window into their life and share videos and photos,” says Conte. It’s currently in beta, and will be released slowly over the next six months.
In addition to the Lens app, Patreon is partnering with a streaming company called Crowdcast to enable patron-only live videos. And creators will now be able to give subscribers early access to Patreon posts before they go live more widely. On the purely internal side, Patreon will offer creators access to a “patron relationship manager” — basically, a database with detailed information about subscribers. “You can just look at all the patrons who joined in the last two weeks and send them a gift, or look at all your patrons who recently hit their six-month anniversary and invite them to a live stream,” says Conte.
Creators could do all the things above before the update, and many already do. Crowdcast has advertised its services on the Patreon blog, and more generally, patrons pay to get closer access to creators, as well as a look at early or unfinished work. The point of this update, says Conte, is to make the process much easier. The early-access system, for example, will let them create one post and automatically open it after a certain period of time, instead of posting multiple updates or manually changing the access settings. Similarly, the patron relationship manager will replace the process of downloading and sorting through spreadsheets with subscriber info.
Things like the live-streaming system aren’t meant to substitute for a service like Twitch, and Conte says that Patreon isn’t meant to become a place where creators will host their main artistic output. But the company is trying to handle all the interactions between artists and fans, not just the money that passes between them.
Along with the updates, Patreon is announcing several new high-profile creators joining the platform, including McSweeney’s Internet Tendency and comedian Bill Burr. According to recently released statistics, the platform hosts 50,000 active creators and recently passed one million active patrons, who pay an average of $12 monthly. It’s currently on track to deliver creators $150 million in 2017, compared to $100 million total between its launch in mid-2013 and the end of 2016, and Conte says the site revamp is meant to provide a more professional feel. “It feels much more like, you know, a place to run a business — a place to actually make money and get paid and run a membership platform,” he says.
There's a peculiar dynamic going on in Los Angeles this week, as E3 — the biggest gaming showcase of them all — is taking place and, once again, paying little attention to the hugely profitable mobile games market. By most estimates, mobile gaming is generating in excess of $30 billion per year, and it's projected to eclipse consoles and the PC as the single most lucrative platform for games. And yet, cast your eye across the vast gaming landscape of E3 and you'll see mobile as only a space filler in between the traditional AAA blockbusters and barnburners. Why, I wondered, does the form of gaming we're increasingly spending the majority of our time and money on get so little hype and attention?
I realize that, on one interpretation, this question is tantamount to asking why there are no Oscars for YouTubers. And I want to encourage that interpretation! Because, seriously, why are there no Academy Awards for the work people publish on YouTube? Some of the cinematography and performances I've seen inside Google's bottomless pit of user-uploaded content now rival the best Hollywood has to offer. And, moreover, YouTubers are rarely as inane and uncreative as the latest Tom Cruise summer flick or yet another shakedown of the Pirates of the Caribbean money tree. My instinctive answer with regard to both E3 and the Oscars is that it's simply a matter of inertia. That's the way we've always done things.
Others will tell you that it's more complicated than that. The economics of mobile games are vastly different to those of flagship PC and console titles. Free-to-play games, even hugely successful ones like Dota 2 and League of Legends on PC, have never garnered much stage time at E3. And the big moneymakers on the mobile front are almost all free-to-play, with in-app purchases and upgrades making up the bulk of their income. It's tricky to figure out a sizzle reel for hot new IAPs. Tricky, I would argue, but not impossible.
2016's biggest gaming sensation was undoubtedly Pokémon Go. It was a massive global success, estimated to have produced nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2016 alone, and it was socially transformative, too, dragging many of us out of the house and giving us a reason to talk to strangers with a shared interest. At E3 that year, Nintendo wasn't afraid to give Pokémon Go its due time in the spotlight. Now, of course, Pokémon hype is a whole thing unto itself, but I think more companies should embrace the model set by Nintendo and commit to promoting their mobile games on an equal footing to their desktop and console titles. Hell, I'd at least like to see Nintendo keep it up, but the company's reverted to spending all its E3 time talking about its Switch console.
There's honestly little to lose by communicating to your players in the language they understand and giving them the game experiences they actually want.
I recall an old Malcolm Gladwell talk where he recounted some unintuitive statistical findings by researchers. If you ask people what type of coffee they favor, he pointed out, they all say something along the lines of a dark, rich, hearty roast. When you look at what they actually buy and prefer, however, it turns out the answer is a weak and milky coffee. Without wishing to offend mobile game makers, that's where we are today: with mobile games being the mild and milky coffee we actually consume but don't feel exceedingly proud to admit to liking. E3 still thinks all we're after is the glitz and violence of AAA console titles, and the real world is instead tapping away in Clash of Clans.
E3 doesn't need to be entirely transformed, but I do think it can make some changes to better reflect the way that most of us game nowadays. To do otherwise would be to accept an increasingly niche role in the wider gaming landscape. I've got a huge water-cooled gaming tower of doom at home, but I also have a stupidly powerful smartphone in my pocket — and it's the latter that now garners more of my time and attention. So if the established gaming companies are not going to try and capitalize on that new opportunity, odds are that I'll end up spending more time in the realms created by small-scale developers like the people behind Egg Inc. and Tap Tap Fish.
Alas, E3 is a show tailored to the long lead times and slow-burning buildup of $60 titles that are months away from release. The resources committed to the promotion of those games still dwarf anything invested in hyping up mobile games, and the reality is that my dream scenario of E3 as the all-inclusive gaming extravaganza is unlikely to ever happen.
I'd love to one day attend E3 with the assignment of covering only mobile games and to feel as overwhelmed with new stuff as my colleagues covering console and PC launches. But at E3 2017, we had very little of that: just the announcement of a new South Park game, a trailer for a new Alto game, Alto's Odyssey, and the utterly inexcusable travesty that is Garfield Go. Compare that against the glories of Anthem or that gorgeous Beyond Good & Evil 2 trailer, which showed zero gameplay, but was still thrilling to watch and appreciate. All I'm asking is a little bit of that extra love for the mobile gamers out there, for we are legion and we like to be flattered with beautiful imagery and hype-building showpieces just as much as our console-playing brethren.
Here’s a good meme to start your day with: it’s the “the floor is [fill in the blank]” meme, which is a spinoff of the very imaginative childhood game every person on Earth individually came up with, the “the floor is lava game.”
According to Know Your Meme, “the floor is” originated with this April 2016 tweet:
Me: I'm gonna go to sleep early this weekMe Tuesday @ 3am: pic.twitter.com/qL2K2yWZX3
The photos in this tweet are the most commonly used, with some Photoshop variations. But the meme didn’t really take off until the addition of other images last week. This is the first one I saw, and it seems to have spread the farthest:
the floor is men pic.twitter.com/BTRsthaqIl
Here are some more good ones.
The floor is a normal sleeping schedule, clear skin, nice body, and money in my bank account pic.twitter.com/KB5ddw3SD9
the floor is replying to texts days, even weeks late with "just now seeing this" pic.twitter.com/2K2JDGFQ5y
THE FLOOR IS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE  pic.twitter.com/1NQ1oyP2bJ
the floor is 8 hours of sleep pic.twitter.com/ydCfLHJO1t
Do you get the joke yet? The floor can be anything. If you like the thing that’s on the floor, you dive toward it, or in the case of this kind of gross example, you whack the floor with your pelvis. If you don’t like the thing, or you think the thing is impossible, you stay as far away from the floor as possible! The joke is limited only by the number of nouns in the universe, and by how long it takes us to get bored with it.

According to our pals over at the MemeEconomy subreddit, there’s still time to enjoy this meme before it’s ruined by the mainstream media. (I’m sorry!) In their words: “‘The floor is’ memes on the rise! BUY! BUY! BUY!” So if you’ve got a good idea for “the floor is,” maybe do it now before the moment passes.
the floor is having to voice an opinion on literally any social issue because youre a full grown adult with a massive audience pic.twitter.com/vVHQYYQKpl
Anyway, you get it. But before you run off to scale a wall and go viral, I’d like you to hear me out as I apologize to former One Direction member Liam Payne — not for referring to the video for his debut solo song “Strip That Down” as “four Old Navy commercials from 2007 smashed together,” but for making fun of an Instagram video that he captioned “the floor is lava” last week.
okay why are you jumping INTO lava liam??? how are you pushing off of a liquid to jump into the air/??? pic.twitter.com/P9LsTTtz0w
The video still doesn’t make any sense, but at least now I know he was trying to participate in a viral internet trend, likely at the behest of whoever’s in charge of his weird career these days. He’s a dad now, and I can’t really expect him to execute memes perfectly.
To clarify: “The floor is” meme is different than the #TheFloorIsLavaChallenge, which started on YouTube and isn’t that funny to me. YouTubers who encourage their young viewers to do elaborate pranks that require athleticism and rule-breaking worry me a lot. And, as a new father, I think Liam would feel the same.
Instagram is adding a new label to better differentiate paid-for posts from regular content. The label — which features the words “Paid partnership with...” — will appear above sponsored posts and stories created by celebrities and other users promoting brands or products over the coming weeks.
The addition comes in the same week that a report claimed that 93 percent of paid-for posts made by Instagram’s most popular users were not labeled according to FTC guidelines. The report, put together by marketing firm Mediakix, looked at Instagram’s 50 most-followed accounts and found that 61 percent of sponsored posts were related to the fashion industry. BuzzFeed’s Katie Notopoulos broke this data down further, splitting the posts into four categories: posts that failed to disclose a long-term sponsorship (49 percent of posts), the receipt of an expensive one-off gift (16 percent), a cheaper gift (12 percent), or single pay-to-post ads (12 percent).
FTC guidelines state that sponsored posts must have clear reference to the fact they serve as paid advertising, either with words like “sponsored by” in the accompanying text, or by using hashtags like #ad. Prolific Instagram users have previously found ways around this system, however, using vaguer hashtags like #sp or #partner.
The FTC sent notices to 90 Instagram users in April this year, to remind them to clearly disclose any “material connection” they may have with a brand or company. Some of the letters referenced these vague hashtags, saying that consumers aren’t likely to understand inclusions like “#sp” as indication of a paid sponsorship. They also noted that consumers are likely to skip over sponsorship hashtags when they were included in a group of more standard tags.
By putting the notification above the image or story, rather than in the description below, Instagram’s new system should make it clearer for followers to pick out paid-for posts. Of course, users will still have to choose to include the label when making their posts — potentially leaving the door open for more surreptitious advertising — but the service has a solid reason for businesses to want to clearly state their connections.
Metrics for posts with the “Paid partnership with...” label will be available to both user and advertiser, allowing them to see just how wide a reach they get for their marketing money. The creator of a post will be able to see metrics inside of Instagram itself, while business partners will be able to view it through the Facebook Page Insights apps.
Update June 14th, 10:31AM ET: Instagram has clarified where users and businesses will be able to view metrics on sponsored posts.
Razer has been making great laptops for a while with its Blade line. But whether you’re looking at the more portable Razer Blade Stealth or hefty Razer Blade Pro, Razer’s computers all share a similar flaw: the neon green accents, rainbow LED lights, and giant glowing snake logo. While the hardware may match up to other high-end laptops, the Blade line tends to look like a toy compared to offerings from Apple, Microsoft, or Dell.
But at E3 this year, Razer is announcing an updated version of the Blade Stealth that not only fixes the problem of presentability, but also almost every other issue that plagued Razer’s smallest laptop.
The most obvious change to the new Blade Stealth is both the least and most important: Razer is giving the range a new, more professional look. The gunmetal gray variant ditches the glowing Razer logo for a more subtle two-tone one, and swaps the rainbow backlight keys for regular white ones. Razer says that the gunmetal version is specifically designed for customers who want a more professional look from their computers, and, having been able to see a pre-production model of the new color in person, it certainly looks more suited to a work setting than Razer’s original version.
But Razer is also upgrading the Blade Stealth on the hardware front, too. The Blade Stealth now comes in two screen configurations: a full 4K 12-inch panel, which Razer had previously offered, and a new 3200 x 1800, 13.3-inch display that cuts the large bezels in half while keeping the rest of the body of the laptop the same size. The trackpad, which was a particular pain point on the earlier models, has finally been replaced with a Windows Precision Trackpad, which should make the experience of using it better. And Razer is boosting the RAM as well — the Blade Stealth now offers 16GB as standard, instead of only on the top configuration.
The 13.3-inch model starts at $1,399 for a 256GB model and tops out at $1,999 for a 1TB version, while the 12-inch, 4K version offers a choice between a $1,599 computer with 512GB of storage and a 1TB version at $1,999. All models of the updated Stealth offer a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 7500U processor clocked at 2.7GHz, and feature integrated Intel HD Graphics 620.
Between the new hardware that addresses most, if not all of the pain points of the previous model, and a new design that acknowledges that people may want to use Razer’s laptops in a professional setting, the updated Blade Stealth is a good sign from Razer that it’s finally growing up.
The updated Razer Blade Stealth will be available in the standard black color scheme in both the 12-inch and 13.3-inch models on June 14th, with the gunmetal variants  arriving later this summer.

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his intent to nominate Jessica Rosenworcel to fill the open Democratic slot at the Federal Communications Commission.
The selection — revealed quietly, late Tuesday night — marks a return to battle for Rosenworcel at the telecom agency: She served in that same role at the FCC from 2012 to 2016, only departing the commission because Senate lawmakers could not extend her term before the clock ran out at the end of the year.
In her previous stint at the agency, Rosenworcel had been a vocal, ardent supporter of net neutrality, and she voted for rules — drafted by then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler — to subject internet providers to utility-like regulation. This time, however, the agency’s new leader, Republican Chairman Ajit Pai, is looking to scrap those open internet protections.
Otherwise, Rosenworcel has been a forceful, public advocate for FCC policies and programs that seek to close the “homework gap,” as she calls it — the broad disparities in broadband internet service that make it difficult for students, particularly in rural areas, to do their schoolwork.
In the weeks before Trump’s official announcement, Rosenworcel had been widely viewed as the front-runner for her party’s open slot at the FCC, sources previously told Recode. She had the public backing of many congressional Democrats, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who formally recommended her to Trump for the open FCC post.
Sources also had expected Trump to announce Rosenworcel along with a nominee for the FCC’s other open slot — a Republican seat — and it had been widely believed that Brendan Carr, the general counsel at the FCC, would win that position.
Typically, such nominees are paired up in order to improve their chances of a swift confirmation by an ever-partisan U.S. Senate. But Trump opted not to announce his Democratic and Republican nominees together on Tuesday night. That could stoke speculation that Trump actually sees Rosenworcel as a replacement for sitting Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, whose term expires at the end of June.
The White House, for its part, previously has not indicated if it would renominate Clyburn to her post — and a spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday. Without Clyburn or some other Democrat, the FCC would not meet its three-member quorum, preventing it from acting on certain policy issues — including, perhaps, net neutrality.

When Google curtailed its Nexus program last year in favor of the Pixel, many commentators dismissed that as merely a rebranding exercise to make the latest thing feel fresh. I was in the minority that bought into Google's promise of a fundamentally different approach that would signal a direct challenge to Apple's iPhone, but the Pixel was still just the beginning. What we're seeing in recent times, in the ever-swirling rumor mill and through Google's hiring of new engineers, indicates the depth of Google's commitment to taking on Apple at its own game.
I wrote about this at length back in October: the big difference for Apple isn't just software, hardware, or customer service, it's all of those combined. Apple's unmatched strength is in the integration of all the important aspects that go toward building up a satisfying user experience, and it's long been true that the only company that could hope to match Apple was Google, owing to its dominance on the software front with the Android OS. The Pixel showed that Google was willing and able to produce a premium, uniquely differentiated phone (the Pixel camera remains unmatched, many months later), but it obviously wasn't the finished product of Google's grander project.
Apple's hardware lead is built atop a tight control, often monopolization, of its component supply chain. That's exactly where Google looks to be headed, with recent rumors and leaks indicating that the Mountain View company is working hard to secure a reliable source of OLED displays for a presumed Pixel successor with minimal screen bezels in the same vein as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6. That's why indications of an LG-produced Google phone for later this year make so much sense: it's not impossible for Google to still use HTC as its manufacturing partner and source panels from LG Display (which is nominally independent from LG Electronics), but it's more complicated than just going all-in with the Korean supplier.
Just like Apple, Google commands vast reserves of cash that it can deploy to help smooth out its supply deals, and that's exactly what its reported investment in LG Display is building toward. If the original Pixel was a trial run to test out what it's like to source and assemble all your own components, Google's big lesson from it was that demand for its phones will be high — and disappointment in the event of shortages would be even higher. Unlike Apple, Google doesn't yet have the promise of enormous unit sales to dangle as a carrot in front of potential suppliers, but that is liable to change dramatically with this year's Pixel, which would presumably enjoy much wider distribution and marketing than the original.
Two things were revealed yesterday: one is that Google is designing its own system on a chip (SoC) for future mobile devices, and the other is that the lead architect for that project is a man named Manu Gulati, who, until very recently, had been a senior engineer at Apple. Both of these are massive developments, showing that Google won't be content until it has maximum control over every aspect of its smartphone — exactly the same goal that Apple pursues with every new generation of iPhone — and furthermore underlining the level of ambition by poaching away someone who would surely have needed a lot of incentive to leave a job at Apple.
The SoC is the processing heart that powers the vast majority of functions of any modern smartphone, tablet, or smart speaker. Qualcomm's Snapdragon is the most famous and widely used example, Samsung's Exynos is a comparable competitor, and Apple's A series of SoCs are the current gold standard, delivering unmatched performance and efficiency. If Google is determined to not be dependent on another company's whims or fortunes, having its own SoC is an essential part of its future business as a mobile hardware vendor.
The current Pixel is built around the Snapdragon 821 chip — its speed and feature-rich architecture contribute to the excellent Pixel camera — but the instructive example for Google to beware is the Snapdragon 810. Qualcomm had a ton of overheating issues with that piece of silicon, sufficient for Samsung to skip using that chip at all in its Galaxy S6, and Google can't afford to find itself in a similar situation with the Snapdragon 845 or whatever there is down the line. So Google is now building its own SoC, as fully evidenced by its litany of job listings attesting to that ambition.
Beside freeing itself of the unpredictability of relying on other companies for critical components, Google's effort to control all the hardware inside its future devices will help it create more tailored, custom solutions. For instance, look at the way that notifications on the Samsung Galaxy S8 are signaled with a pulse of blue light tracing its way around the edges of its almost bezel-less display — that's nowhere near as impressive on a phone without the S8's sleek design. The coherence and synergy that can be drawn from hardware and software designers working in concert is best demonstrated by Apple, naturally, but I can envision future Google devices that have custom processing modules specifically to power Google's magical camera algorithms. How much better and faster would the Pixel be if its internal components were each designed for specific tasks instead of built to fulfill a generic set of requirements?
We don't know what difference a Google SoC would make to future Pixel phones, but it's obvious that Google is determined to find out. It's probably safe to presume Google is doing similar work to lock down its supply chain for less glamorous parts, like batteries and vibration engines and so on, and not all of it will be ready to debut by this year's end when the Pixel successor comes out. In fact, it's a practical certainty that Google's mobile processor is years away from making its debut in a consumer product, but that just goes to underline that Google is in this for the long haul. The Android maker has decided that building its own version of the iPhone is the best way to compete with the iPhone.
After years of neglect, Metroid is back: yesterday Nintendo revealed two new entries in the iconic sci-fi exploration series. One, Metroid Prime 4 on Switch, isn’t due for some time. But the Nintendo 3DS title Samus Returns is launching on September 15th, and it’s not just the first proper Metroid game since 2010 — it’s also a return to the series’s roots. Samus Returns is a remake of Metroid II on the original Game Boy, and it’s the first traditional 2D Metroid release in over a decade. The announcement may have come as a surprise to many, but it’s far from a new idea for series co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto. “I’ve been wanting to create a 2D Metroid for a while,” he says.
I had a chance to play through a 20-minute demo that represented the opening sequence of the game. Just like in the original Metroid II, Samus Returns opens with the titular bounty landing on the desolate planet SR388, and then exploring hostile caves home to angry aliens, including energy-sucking metroids. As in most Metroid games, you start pretty powerless; you need to seek out abilities like the morph ball and charge shot, which in turn help you open up new areas to explore. Samus Returns is a 2D game that features three-dimensional graphics, but the more detailed visuals don’t slow down the pace at all. In fact, Samus Returns is a much tighter action experience compared to the now-ancient Metroid II. Samus can now aim in any direction, and chain together attacks; if you time it right you can bat away an enemy and then immediately blast it with a critical laser shot. It feels fast and fluid, with a sense of immediacy that fits well with the series.
Outside of its tighter action and more detailed visuals, Samus Returns also includes a number of enhancements based around the 3DS hardware. For one thing, it’s the rare game that actually makes great use of the handheld’s glasses-free 3D effect, lending a sense of depth to the world. I found myself stopping to catch details in the background, like the corpses of unlucky cave explorers, and — unlike almost every other 3DS game I’ve played — I didn’t want to turn the 3D effect off. Meanwhile, the second screen is also put to use by displaying the in-game map at all times, making exploration a little easier. You can even place pins on the map, just like in Breath of the Wild, to remember areas you might want to explore later. (Sakamoto says he “wasn’t actually aware” of that feature being in the latest Legend of Zelda game.)
Sakamoto served as the designer on the original Metroid, and he directed its successor, Super Metroid. But he didn’t actually work on Metroid II. That said, he believes the portable game has an important place within the series — which is one of the main reasons he wanted to remake it. “In terms of Metroid II, that was a Game Boy game. It was quite a while back, and it hadn’t been revisited,” he explains. “Metroid II I feel has a really important place in the Metroid franchise’s history. It introduces us to baby metroid for the first time, and there are a lot of important elements in that title.” While Sakamoto is helming the production, the game is actually being developed as a collaboration between Nintendo and Spanish studio Mercury Steam, whose best-known work is arguably the Castlevania reboot Lords of Shadow in 2010. “It’s this really nice meld of each company’s experience and ideas, and the flavors that we bring to the series,” Sakamoto says of the collaborative process between the two developers.
Of course, as with any reimagining, there’s always the potential that any new features in Samus Returns could dilute the essence of the original experience. Metroid is known for its challenging gameplay and moody atmosphere, and with better aiming, faster action, and a more useful map, it’s possible that some of that feeling will be lost in Samus Returns. It’s a question the development team struggled with when they started working on the game two years ago. “What do we do to preserve some of that originality yet add to it?” asks Sakamoto. “I think the key is that you’re only adding things that improve upon that core concept. You’re not changing things just to change things. It’s really not that different from creating a game from scratch — you’re just looking to build something fun and enjoyable.”
Metroid: Samus Returns is a game that fans have been asking for for quite some time. And for Sakamoto, announcing the title yesterday provided a profound sense of relief — it’s both a game fans were clamoring for and a game he yearned to make. “I’ve had this sense of anticipation,” he says of the E3 reveal. “I wanted to talk about it, I wanted to tell people that we’re doing this.”
Everyone loves a good supercar: gorgeous, aerodynamic, laughably out of reach for almost everyone on the planet. We love to drool over photos of these cars, fully aware that we’ll probably never drive one. McLaren wants to change that perception with the release of the 2018 570S Spider, calling it the “most attainable” sports car ever.
This model is the third body type in McLaren’s Sport series portfolio, which includes the 570S Coupe and the 570GT. (We last saw the 570S Coupe at the 2015 New York Auto Show, and were appropriately bowled over by it.) The 570S Spider will make its global debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, which will be held in the UK June 29th–July 2nd.
The 570S Spider is motivated by a 562-horsepower, 3.8-liter twin-turbo V8 engine. The 0–60 mph comes in 3.1 seconds with a top speed of 204 mph. Those acceleration specs are a fraction slower than the 675LT Spider, but identical to the 570S Coupe. One of the neatest features is the 570S Spider’s retractable, hardtop roof that takes 15 seconds to open or close and can be engaged at vehicle speeds of up 25 mph. Top speed with the top down is 196 mph, so hang on to your hat.
McLaren says the first 400 units of the 570S Spider will be “launch edition models,” and will be priced at $208,000 each. That’s almost $200,000 less than the 675LT Spider and $120,000 less than the 650S Spider. So attainable! The convertible comes in two colors: “Sicilian Yellow” and “Vega Blue.”
Up until the official start of E3 on Tuesday, Nintendo’s presence has been limited to appearing on the stages of other companies. Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, confirmed with an appearance from Shigeru Miyamoto himself at Ubisoft’s press conference, is being produced by that publisher. Downloadable Zelda-themed Skyrim items appeared during the Bethesda event. And a giant Switch showed up in Microsoft’s presentation on Minecraft.
No wonder Nintendo didn’t bother with a big stage show at E3. Once again, the company opted for a prerecorded 30-minute Nintendo Direct stream, filled with announcements and gameplay footage.
The idea that E3 can be “won” grows more dubious every year, and comparing Nintendo with the likes of Sony or Microsoft is a fool’s errand. Those two companies go toe-to-toe over 4K, console exclusives, and who has the most teraflops of processing power in their latest machines. Nintendo’s announcements often feel more like the company is in competition with itself. Which announcement features the cutest stuff? Is it the amiibo? An old franchise reimagined with clay or yarn? Mario’s personified hat?
Nintendo doesn’t care about having the most powerful console ever; it just wants to rekindle childlike glee.
And, it works. Sometimes.
Nintendo’s presence on the E3 show floor is impossible to miss. Following in the footsteps of last year’s Breath of the Wild-themed exhibit, Nintendo has opted for a re-creation of New Donk City — the New York knockoff featured in Super Mario Odyssey.
By opening its doors to the public for the first time ever, E3 is on its way to becoming more of a show about fan service than ever before. The event now seems to be competing with fan conventions like Comic-Con or PAX. Lavish installations are not new to E3, but they’re increasingly extravagant. And Nintendo might just have the most impressive one at the show this year. It helps to have a strong new franchise like Mario preparing for another launch; it’s even better if fans consider your decked-out booth a must-see.
Nintendo was tight-lipped about its two most exciting announcements ahead of the show. Now we know Gamefreak is working on a “core” Pokémon RPG for the console. Nintendo also announced a new Metroid game — Metroid 4 — the first game in the Prime series in a decade. And it showed a remake of Metroid 2 for 3DS.
The first two games appear to be early in development, and Nintendo gave no clues as to when either would be released.
Nintendo will finish out the second half of 2017 with the launch of Arms, Splatoon 2, Pokken Tournament, and Super Mario Odyssey. Today, we learned that we’ll also get Metroid: Samus Returns on 3DS in September, while Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Rocket League launch this holiday. DLC for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will launch at the end of this month.
In 2018, fans can expect new Kirby and Yoshi games for the Switch. That leaves a lot of question marks for the future of the console after the holiday season. Though we expect Nintendo to reveal more in the coming months.
Pre-E3, it was believable that Nintendo would boost the Switch’s lineup with a new — or at least ported — version of Smash Bros. But, no such luck. Nintendo is trying to push into the competitive gaming scenes with Splatoon and Arms. No Smash Bros. on Switch feels like a missed opportunity.
And, while we’re on the subject of MIA games: where is the new Animal Crossing?
Nintendo has had little to say about its third-party support. Sure, we’ve got the Rabbids gaming coming and some Zelda-themed gear in Skyrim when the game launches for Switch, but the company has yet to reveal a killer exclusive beyond its own properties.



Like most days that end in tragedy, I woke up filled with anticipation. The weather forecast was excellent: 80 degrees, sunny, and very little wind — a rarity for the unpredictable Dutch coast, especially for a Sunday. Perfect conditions for my friend, a gregarious Frenchman, to bring his new Mavic Pro drone to the beach.
The first gin and tonic was served at noon.
My friend, let's call him Clouseau, had flown his drone just a few times prior because it's illegal to fly drones in the city center of Amsterdam where he lives. This would be his second visit to the unrestricted airspace of the coastline.
I had mixed emotions about him bringing the drone to the beach where I own what amounts to a glorified shipping container stuffed with mattresses and a fridge. Clouseau was a nuisance to my neighbors on his first visit. Often he'd leave the drone and its 4K video camera noisily hovering over the heads of scantily clad adults and sand-baked children. He’d do this for minutes at a time as he acquainted himself with the controller. Clouseau had absolute trust in the drone's ability to stay safely aloft while he learned to pilot the craft, literally, on the fly.
If you've ever flown a modern-day drone then it's easy to understand his confidence. The jump in intelligence from those Christmas-morning quadcopters to what DJI now produces is staggering in its progress. The way the diminutive Mavic Pro hovers in the air, glued to a spot in three dimensions as if tethered by invisible guylines is stupefying to a novice. The Mavic Pro’s impressively long list of autonomous skills are enough to give anyone an infallible sense of security.
The day went by without incident. Clouseau heeded my request to fly high and far, and as a result, my neighbors this time greeted us with curiosity instead of annoyance. By sunset we were alone: me, Clouseau, his Mavic Pro, and a dozen or so empty soldiers of tonic.
Ten minutes later the $999 drone would die in the sea, still three miles from shore.
Clouseau knew that the Mavic Pro's maximum range was seven kilometers. But he had become so dazzled by the Mavic Pro's ability to avoid all matters of trouble that he decided to explore the wind farm, barely visible on the horizon. And despite my pleading, and numerous warnings from the controller itself, he sent the drone past the point of no return — convinced that it would override his control and return automatically if there was any real risk. It was too late by the time he turned around.
Heading back fast yet still five kilometers from shore, Clouseau received a final warning that the battery was critically low and that the drone would make an emergency landing.
Beep.
Beep.
Beep.
The Mavic Pro had flatlined, yet the controller continued to send out a signal to come home. We listened to that goddamn bleeping for a nauseating 10 minutes while Clouseau hoped against hope that his expensive drone would somehow return. It never did, lost to the unforgiving North Sea forever.
It was then that I understood those stories of people driving off cliffs while blithely following the instructions of their GPS navigators. I'm also reminded of Arthur C. Clarke's adage that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
I watched an intelligent man do something incredibly moronic after becoming awestruck by an advanced technology. He was drunk; impaired by the gin but intoxicated by a magic he didn't understand, yet trusted beyond reason.
It’s a fatal elixir of blind faith in technology that will only become more potent, I fear, with the advances still to come.
Microsoft is preparing to launch a big overhaul of its Xbox Live Avatars system. Originally released as an Xbox 360 feature in 2008, Xbox Live Avatars have been slowly tweaked to include more props and customizability ever since. Microsoft is now introducing a new avatar system that’s designed to make these Xbox avatars a lot more customizable, with a huge focus on diversity.
The new avatars will let you fully customize your online character with new body type options, clothing, and props. During the Xbox daily briefing at E3 yesterday, Microsoft demonstrated the new avatar system with a trailer (above) and some behind-the-scenes footage of how the company is building the new Xbox Live Avatars. Microsoft’s trailer shows an amputee, playful costumes, wheelchairs, skateboards, and even motorbikes to demonstrate the wide array of props and customization. There’s even a new pregnancy option, and the ability to control the colors of an avatar with a picker system.

“We built these from the ground-up, they’re being built in Unity which is a whole new engine,” explains Bryan Saftler, a lead product manager at Xbox. “Avatars are meant for whatever you want your digital self to represent. We don’t want to put you in a box, there are no more checkboxes, no matter what you think you look like or what you want to present online.”
Microsoft’s focus on diversity also means that if you want to wear a dress on your avatar you can thanks to gender-neutral clothing and props. “If you can see it in the store you can wear it, we’re not holding you to any type of checkboxes,” says Kathryn Storm, interaction designer at Xbox.
It looks like Microsoft has done a really good job with these new avatars. The software maker is now planning to release what it calls its “Avatar 2.0” system to Windows 10 users first later this year, with the Xbox family of devices to follow.
AI isn’t going to be a threat to humanity because it’s evil or cruel, AI will be a threat to humanity because we haven’t properly explained what it is we want it to do. Consider the classic “paperclip maximizer” thought experiment, in which an all-powerful AI is told, simply, “make paperclips.” The AI, not constrained by any human morality or reason, does so, eventually transforming all resources on Earth into paperclips, and wiping out our species in the process. As with any relationship, when talking to our computers, communication is key.
That’s why a new piece of research published yesterday by Google’s DeepMind and the Elon Musk-funded OpenAI institute is so interesting. It offers a simple way for humans to give feedback to AI systems — crucially, without the instructor needing to know anything about programming or artificial intelligence.
The method is a variation of what’s known as “reinforcement learning” or RL. With RL systems, a computer learns by trial-and-error, repeating the same task over and over, while programmers direct its actions by setting certain reward criteria. For example, if you want a computer to learn how to play Atari games (something DeepMind has done in the past) you might make the game’s point system the reward criteria. Over time, the algorithm will learn to play in a way that best accrues points, often leading to super-human performance.
What DeepMind and OpenAI’s researchers have done is replace this predefined reward criteria with a much simpler feedback system. Humans are shown an AI performing two versions of the same task and simply tell it which is better. This happens again and again, and eventually the systems learns what is expected of it. Think of it like getting an eye test, when you’re looking through different lenses, and being asked over and over: better... or worse? Here’s what that looks like when teaching a computer to play the classic Atari game Q*bert:
This method of feedback is surprisingly effective, and researchers were able to use it to train an AI to play a number of Atari video games, as well perform simulated robot tasks (like picking telling an arm to pick up a ball). This better / worse reward function could even be used to program trickier behavior, like teaching a very basic virtual robot how to backflip. That’s how we get to the GIF at the top of the page. The behavior you see has been created by watching the “Hopper” bot jump up and down, and telling it “well done” when it gets a bit closer to doing a backflip. Over time, it learns how.
Of course, no one is suggesting this method is a cure-all for teaching AI. There are a number of big downsides and limitations in using this sort of feedback. The first being that although it doesn’t take much skill on behalf of the human operator, it does take time. For example, in teaching the “Hopper” bot to backflip, a human was asked to judge its behavior some 900 times — a process that took about an hour. The bot itself had to work through 70 hours of simulated training time, which was sped up artificially.
For some simple tasks, says Oxford Robotics researcher Markus Wulfmeier (who was not involved in this research), it would be quicker for a programmer to simply define what it is they wanted. But, says Wulfmeier, it’s “increasingly important to render human supervision more effective” for AI systems, and this paper “represents a small step in the right direction.”
DeepMind and OpenAI say pretty much the same — it’s a small step, but a promising one, and in the future, they’re looking to apply it to more and more complex scenarios. Speaking to The Verge over email, DeepMind researcher Jan Leike said: “The setup described in [our paper] already scales from robotic simulations to more complex Atari games, which suggests that the system will scale further.” Leike suggests the next step is to test it in more varied 3D environments. You can read the full paper describing the work here.
The Uber board member who made a sexist remark during today’s meeting about the prevalence of sexism within the company has resigned from his position. David Bonderman’s resignation from Uber’s board was first announced by The New York Times, and confirmed in a statement by Bonderman himself, in which he said his comment was “careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable.”
Bonderman was recorded making the remark in reply to to fellow board member Arianna Huffington, who was speaking about the need for more female representation on Uber’s board. When “there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,” Huffington said, to which Bonderman shot back “what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking.”

Bonderman — who helped found TPG, a private equity firm — said that the comment “came across in a way that was the opposite of what I intended,” but that he understood “the destructive effect it had,” and that he took full responsibility for it.
Uber is currently considering the findings of the so-called Holder Report: an internal investigation into claims of sexual harassment and a toxic sexist attitude within the company. Bonderman noted the report in his statement, saying that he had been working with the company for six months on the report, and recognized “the importance of implementing [its] requirements” for the future of the company.
His resignation will come into effect from tomorrow morning, and comes as Uber continues to hemorrhage executives and major figures. Earlier in the day, CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed that he was also taking a leave of absence from the company.
Smart speakers are the hottest new category in gadgets, and if Qualcomm has its way, there’s going to be a ton more of them starting next year.
Qualcomm is about to make it really easy for hardware companies to start building their own speakers. It’s introducing a reference design — basically, a preset configuration of chips, microphone tech, and audio systems — that companies can buy to base their products off of.
This isn’t something you’ll see a company like Amazon use. But smaller companies that want to create their own take on an Echo will be able to pick it up to quickly turn around a new product. It saves a bunch of time on testing, since Qualcomm guarantees everything will work together, which lets products get to market faster.
Qualcomm’s Smart Audio Platform includes most of the core tech needed in a smart speaker (aside from the actual speaker). It has far-field microphone systems, with support for beamforming, echo cancellation, and wake words. It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (including aptX HD for hi-res audio streaming), as well as support for Qualcomm’s AllPlay speaker speaker syncing system. And it’s generally designed to support the integration of voice assistants, like Alexa.
AllPlay isn’t a widely used system, which somewhat tempers the excitement here. Qualcomm advertises its new platform as being able to support synchronized playback between speakers, setting up zones, and even handling multi-channel surround sound, but that all relies on someone owning a bunch of AllPlay speakers. That might be more likely if a bunch of speakers roll out in the coming years with Qualcomm inside. But until then, these are mostly just going to be standard Bluetooth speakers.
Qualcomm says the first products based on its system should arrive by the end of the year, but it expects the pace to pick up in 2018.
Dave McCarthy is the Head of Xbox Operations and General Manager of Xbox Services, meaning he’s been deeply involved in the lead up to the reveal of Xbox One X. We had a chance to sit down with McCarthy at Microsoft’s E3 event space in downtown Los Angeles and talk about a range of topics, from how the company plans to explain native 4K to potential customers, how Minecraft has influenced Sea of Thieves, and why the company’s press event had fewer big budget first-party games and timed downloadable content (DLC) exclusives.
Let’s start with the DLC.
We saw “Console Launch Exclusive” through the Xbox E3 presentation, but we didn't see what had become really common in the last five years: timed downloadable content exclusives. Is Microsoft is still pursuing these partnerships with third-party developer or did any of those games show have DLC partnerships?
So the launch exclusive terminology that we use basically means, in simple terms, it's either going to appear first on Xbox or only on Xbox. And we can provide the breakdown of that afterwards, if you want to see that title breakdown. All of the AAA blockbusters are going to be across the Xbox One family of devices. They're going to play great on One, they're going to play spectacularly on Xbox One S. And they'll play even better on Xbox One X overall.
To clarify, it sounds like you're saying you're not focusing on third-party exclusives with DLC and that it's more about the best place a game’s going to run is on the Xbox One X?
We firmly believe that the best place to play these titles, all these titles, would be on the Xbox One X.
And no third-party exclusives for DLC?
The only exclusives were the ones we shared onstage yesterday.
You just got the first taste yesterday of what we're doing with original Xbox compatibility. We'll have a lot more titles obviously to announce. I was saying to somebody, the audaciousness of supporting three generations across the Xbox One family of devices. The first couple of times that Phil [Spencer] brought it up in the leadership team, you got kind of the nervous chuckles around the table, like oh, he's probably not serious when he says, hey, wouldn't it be cool if. He stuck with it, and when he sticks with everything in the leadership team discussion, they're like okay, I guess we're going to make this happen. So it was really cool to see us release the news on Crimson Skies yesterday as the first one, but there will be more to come! It's the same team that actually worked on the Xbox 360 backward compatibility overall. So these are our best and brightest compatibility minds looking at things. So watch this space!
Seeing is believing, obviously, with a lot of this stuff, right? You see the difference with the weather effects and the heat coming off the car and the details [in Forza 7]. You know, if Anthem looked great from Bioware on the amazing 4K screen in The Galen Center yesterday. So a little bit of it is seeing is believing. But I get back to more of this: you're going to notice a difference on your existing games, you're going to notice a difference where developers in both first-party and third-party do these free 4K upgrades that we noticed yesterday, across a large number of titles overall. And then when somebody's taking advantage of the frame buffer and you know, Dolby Atmos, and the wide color gamut, and all of the bells and whistles, it's going to be hard not to notice the difference.
Are you concerned that, right now, a lot of people don’t have 4K TVs? Even if they do, things don't probably stream in 4K from their cable box. Maybe they aren't even watching 4K on YouTube because of their wireless connection. What steps are you taking to put people in these environments where they're going to see what you’re describing?
Sure, right. There will be obviously some retail partnerships that we look at. Demo experiences that we'll do. I wouldn't say from a 1080p TV perspective you're going to be all that disappointed either, right? I mean you have automatic super sampling from the Xbox One X to your 1080p TV. It's still going to look pretty damn amazing. In fact, at home, I've been running this setup. We've had the kits for a couple of months now, and it's remarkable how I literally took the Xbox One X home, I put it on top of my Xbox One S. I pulled the HDMI cable out of the S, pulled it into the S. I literally re-synced my controller, using the one button touch. I had all my games on my external hard drive, plugged it in [to the X]. There was no install time. It was all running.
And I was sitting with my son and I didn't even tell him what the box was. He turns to me within five minutes and he's like, "Dad, what's happening with this box? Why is it running faster? Why does my game look different and better overall? And I said, "Well, I can't tell you right now, son. But--"

Can you explain how a game made by a third-party developer that doesn’t have Xbox One X will be improved? What type of differences specifically can we expect to see on the Xbox One X?
So you'll definitely see faster load times, because you've got a faster hard drive than Xbox One S.  Most titles are doing some notion of dynamic frame rate and their titles and if they will, you will see, unless they're locking at a certain number, because certain developers make the choice to do that, you're going to see a smoother frame rate. You're going to see better texture filtering, with them doing nothing overall, and then you're going to see most of them make use of dynamic resolution in their design right now. So you should see the highest possible resolution of textures in the game as well, without them touching a thing. All of those things will be true without them touching a thing.
So on older games, if the frame rate isn't capped, we’ll see frame rate improvements?
Yeah and consistency, for sure. Yeah, exactly.

Is Microsoft working on mobile game projects anymore, or is that on the back burner? Will we see Play Anywhere games on smartphones?
I mean in addition to Minecraft, some people kind of laugh at this, but Solitaire is one of our huge Live drivers on Windows 10 right now. I think it's moving into other interesting areas as well. You know, Mixer had a huge presence in the show yesterday, right? We talk about this split between the hour spent watching and playing games overall. The mobile client for Mixer's huge for us overall, in terms of consumption. Again, Live links that altogether overall. So I think you'll see more of us doing stuff across devices with Live at the center of all that we do and Mixer is the next big push as part of that.

Dave McCarthy: Franchises like Halo and Gears of War are still hugely important in our ecosystem. We made a really conscious decision with [the E3 event] and we were linked in arms throughout the leadership team on this: that we wanted to show every type of game for every type of gamer. And that was different from what we've done before, but it was a really conscious decision about where gamers are right now in the landscape. There are some that value 4K showcases. For some, community games really speak to them. [Showing] PlayerUnkown’s Battlegrounds was a big deal, right. I think console users — there's a lot of them out there that don't understand how big Battlegrounds is going to be. And it is, it is a huge deal, it's such an innovative format that really sucks you in when you try it.
We needed to create space in our briefing for that. We needed to create space for games around the world. We consciously chose to go around the globe a bit. And we wanted to showcase indie developers with titles like Cuphead and Artful Escape.
It's just a really conscious decision for us to go across the board and show the variation in the gaming landscape right now, which I think Xbox is well-positioned for because we do have the strong service for devices — because we do have Windows 10 in the same company — and we work closely with the team to make stuff happen there.
So it's a matter of consciously saying, hey there's a story we want to tell, that we're offering a ton of choice, regardless of what kind of gameplay type that you gravitate to.

The Verge: A couple of years ago, a number of Xbox employees spoke with me about Minecraft as a template the company could learn from, and build upon. Moving forward to the present, are there any examples of Microsoft is building off the Minecraft template with a new project?
Dave McCarthy: I would say some of the learning from Minecraft has even made its way into Sea of Thieves. So when we take a premiere studio like Rare “offline” for the past couple of years, there's been a lot of good learning from the team back and forth, especially around things involving the community in design. So what I really like about what the Rare team has done, they've really embraced this using our insider program to bring the community onboard. They're regularly giving feedback across both PC and our Xbox One panel of devices on how to design the game, what those sort of multi-screen considerations are. They're both going to be doing some interesting and innovative things with Mixer, both from an interactivity standpoint and things like co-streaming that have come out out there. So I do see it filtering into some of the studios, I think we'll see more around the idea of in-game marketplaces, I think Minecraft is really leading the way there overall. So it really has been a good education piece for us, but I think it's really interesting to see how it affects new IP development and I've seen some really neat interactions between the teams there.

E3 2017 has officially kicked off, and thousands of journalists, gaming industry people, and, for the first time ever, members of the public have flooded the Los Angeles Convention Center for the largest gaming show in the world. And virtually everyone seemed to be packing Nintendo’s massive E3 booth for a chance to get their hands on Super Mario Odyssey, the upcoming Mario adventure for the Nintendo Switch.
So it’s fitting that the booth is decked out as New Donk City — one of the levels in Odyssey — from top to bottom. Times Square-esque billboards line the walls, Donkey Kong-themed street signs pop out over the crowd, and crosswalk indicators are actually with Mario “?” blocks. On one side, you can find a Crazy Cap store (as seen in the trailer) handing out Cappy visors, while New Donk City flags proudly fly on the opposite walls. But until Nintendo decides to come up with some sort of virtual reality solution, the booth is probably the closest you’ll ever get to being in New Donk City. Aside from visiting the real New York City it’s based off, anyway.
At the front of the booth is a massive, life-sized re-creation of Mario, Cappy, and the new airship he’ll be piloting in Super Mario Odyssey, while scattered around the booth are statues of the various enemies that Mario will be able to transform into through the new “Capture” mechanic in Odyssey, also all built to proper scale. (On a related note, Goombas are much larger in real life than you’d necessarily think.)
Nintendo is also taking advantage of the Switch’s portable nature with the booth, with demo stations scattered everywhere, from rows of flat screens to smaller tables. There are even some park benches, where you can try out Super Mario Odyssey while being guided by a besuited denizen of New Donk City, just like in the game. (Although unlike in the game, it does not seem that the demo staff will have have to worry about being possessed by a magic hat.) Lines stretched out in all directions for a chance for the 10-minute demo, and the booth was completely packed from wall to wall with fans eagerly waiting their turn.
Of course, Nintendo has a few other games at E3 that aren’t Super Mario Odyssey. There were demo stations set up for Splatoon 2, ARMS, Fire Emblem Warriors, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, FIFA 18, Sonic Forces, and Pokkén Tournament DX toward the back of the booth. There was also a full fledged e-sports arena for some of the tournaments Nintendo will be holding over the course of the conference.
There is something inherently insect-like about the New York City commute: swarms of people crammed together into subway cars, piling into elevators, buzzing around the streets. To make the metaphor literal, 20,000 European honeybees joined the commute this morning, blocking the entrance to Vox Media's headquarters in downtown Manhattan.
Passersby stopped to marvel at the scene, phones in hand, snapping pictures. “Oh my gosh!” a woman shrieked. “New York City!” someone else yelled. “Yeah! Save the bees!” shouted a young woman with short, blond hair and colorful tights.
Hovering around the scene was beekeeper Katherine Morris, wearing a white hazmat suit and army green All Stars. She was waiting for another beekeeper to arrive — Andrew Coté, an independent beekeeper who works for Andrew’s Honey and sometimes helps out the city — so that the swarming bees could be scooped up in a bucket and carried to another beehive.
But why were the bees commuting, and why here?
Swarming is common when the temperatures rise, Morris explained. In fact, there have been dozens of swarming incidents already this season in New York City, according to Coté. “This is as natural as a kitten up a tree,” he says.
A bee colony generally hosts about 30,000 to 50,000 bees at one time, but when it gets warm, the queens produce a lot of new bees. This makes the colony huge, Morris says. When the colony is too large, the queen will take a third of it and fly to find another spot, says Morris. Or, if another queen was born in the beehive, she’ll leave with some followers. A beehive, after all, can have only one queen.
The honeybees grappling on the side of the Vox Media building were just waiting. Search parties — hundreds of scouts — had already been sent out to scour the area for a place to build a new hive. The building wasn’t ideal for that; bees like wood.
No one is sure where the bees started their commute, though. There are several beehives in Battery Park, at the southern tip of Manhattan, Morris says, as well as on the rooftops of several downtown buildings. (New York City legalized beekeeping in 2010, and bees are used for making honey or pollinating city gardens.) Today’s swarming bees likely came from one of those hives, but it’s impossible to pin down the exact origin.
Of course, when it comes to bees, there’s the question of the sting, which can be dangerous to people with allergies. These bees, however, were unlikely to sting — likely only if they were poked or prodded. “They don’t want to leave the queen because they’re the workers,” Morris says. “They’re there to protect her.” Besides, they had no hive to protect, a usual source of human-bee conflict.
A little after noon, Coté arrived in a white pickup truck. “Where is it?” he asked Morris as he stepped beyond the yellow tape. He turned, saw the swarm, and smiled. He was wearing a beige “I [bee] NY” jacket, which included a net to protect his face from stings. Then Coté, Morris, and a few other beekeepers got to work.
The first plan was to vacuum up the bees into a bucket, but the vacuum’s power cord didn’t work. So Coté gathered several cardboard boxes and brushed the bees off the wall using a thin, long brush with yellow bristles. As some of the bees were scooped into the box, hundreds of bees pushed off from the wall, forming a big cloud. Over the city noise, it was possible to hear a light buzzing. After the bees calmed down a bit, they were scooped again from the cardboard box into a larger wooden box filled with beehive frames. The whole thing was then placed inside a larger cardboard box of Bella dinner napkins and taped, so that the bees couldn’t get out.
“That’s not closed! Look at it!” Coté shouted as the other beekeepers used duct tape to close up the box. “It’s not closed!” The duct taping continued.
Coté says he isn’t sure where the honeybees will be transported. He will likely add them to existing beehives, especially ones that are struggling because they don’t have enough bees. After over an hour, the vacuum was finally put to work, and about a thousand bees were sucked up.
The box was finally loaded onto Coté’s pickup truck. Dozens of bees were still scattered around the street — without the rest of the colony, they will get lost and die, Coté says. But so it goes.
Once the insects were safely removed, the people on the streets swarmed forth again, buzzing in and out of their offices. The cloud of bees was gone, and so was the crowd of humans.

Oh, Uber. You’d think you’d be able to get through your very important meeting today about fixing your problems with pervasive sexism and harassment without someone making a really dumb, misogynistic joke. But alas, it was not to be.
Based on leaked audio from today’s all-hands meeting obtained by Yahoo Finance, Uber board member David Bonderman, founder of TPG Capital, made the crack after a remark by his fellow board member Arianna Huffington regarding the need for more female representation on Uber’s board.
Huffington said that when “there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board.” Bonderman’s response — “what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking” — would have been inappropriate in any context, let alone in the middle of a high-profile meeting about your company’s harassment and marginalization of female employees.
So... This just happened at @Uber's all-hands meeting. @YahooFinance's @JPManga got some leaked audio. 6:40 min https://t.co/QHXOp7TU0h pic.twitter.com/bqBLonNp49
Reactions to Bonderman’s dumb joke were quick and unapologetic.
Insane. An Uber director's casual jokey misogyny during a presentation explaining how he and the rest of the board are fixing its culture https://t.co/6qhWD8Ukml
Well, this a good way to undercut the whole 'zero tolerance for sexism' policy six minutes into Uber 2.0 https://t.co/6pL3Q2pNDO
Incredible. Within first 10 minutes of Uber all-hands meeting today, a board member makes a sexist joke. https://t.co/iurWrXTOXw pic.twitter.com/ngQW6uS5J3
Soon after the news of Bonderman’s tone-deaf remark, he sent an apology to Uber’s employees via the head of the company’s human resources department. “I want to apologize to my fellow board member for a disrespectful comment that was directed at her during today's discussion,” he said, in a statement provided by his investment firm. “It was inappropriate. I also want to apologize to all Uber employees who were offended by the remark. I deeply regret it.” A short time later, he resigned from the board, saying that he didn’t want to be a “distraction” while the company dealt with the Holder Report.
Update June 13th, 10:00PM ET: David Bonderman has submitted his resignation from Uber’s board after his sexist remark was reported.
Today, Google announced an expansion to its Play Store with its new Android Excellence program. Curated by Google’s editorial team, Android Excellence features rotating collections of apps that deliver a superb Android user experience, utilize many of Google’s “best practices,” and “have great design, technical performance, localization, and device optimization.” Broken down into two categories of apps and games, Android Excellence appears in Google’s newly revamped Editor’s Choice section.
The announcement comes after Apple’s recent WWDC debut of its overhauled App Store, with a new interface and shifted focus on discovery and how-tos. It also has a new way to highlight apps — the App Store’s upgraded landing page will feature one new app a day, opening possibilities for up-and-coming developers and encouraging daily visits.
While Google’s Android Excellence program is more extensive, the lists will only be updated quarterly, a move that might not serve users as much as it does developers (who can reap exposure for months). Also a bummer  — there are no descriptions to explain why editors select apps for Android Excellence, the way they do for other Google Play categories, like “5 Travel Apps for Your Next Adventure.”
Regardless, if you want to see what Google deems the best of the best, Android Excellence kicks off today in the Google Play Store. Below, their first round of selects.

If all the small enhancements to the iPad Pro 10.5 aren't speaking to you, good deals on the original 9.7-inch Pro have arrived. As spotted by 9to5Toys, Best Buy is offering a one-day-only deal on the 32GB 9.7-inch Pro right now: $449.99, which is $150 off the typical $599.99 asking price.
The main reason to grab a Pro model over the recently released $329 iPad model is Pencil support, but, of course, the Pencil isn't included with the Pro models, it's an extra $99. Also, Apple's Smart Keyboard covers for the 9.7-inch Pro aren't compatible with the 10.5-inch Pro, so that's something else to watch out for. Basically this isn't the greatest deal in tablets, but it is a good tablet that's about to get a lot more interesting with iOS 11. And $450, or $400 if you want to dig around for a refurbished model, is certainly more accessible than the $650 Apple wants for the 10.5-inch new stuff.
For years, experts have warned of vulnerabilities in the network that routes phone calls and cellular service — but those attacks may be more widespread than anyone realized. For more than a year, a Tor Hidden Service has been offering ongoing access to telecom’s private SS7 network for as little as $500 a month. Combined with known vulnerabilities, that access could be used to intercept texts, track the location of an individual phone, or cut off cellular service entirely.
Accessible on Tor at zkkc7e5rwvs4bpxm.onion, the “Interconnector” service offers a variety of services charged as monthly fees, including $250 to intercept calls or texts, $500 for full access, or $150 for cellphone reports (including location data and IMSI numbers). Well-heeled users can even pay $5,500 for direct access to the SS7 port, billed as “everything you need to start your own service.”
One customer wrote to The Verge with complaints about the service, claiming to have paid the site’s fee only to be ignored by the site’s manager, never receiving access to the SS7 dashboard. Others have gone as far as labeling it a scam. The site responded to the concerns earlier today, promising a free page to test the service next week, although access to the site will be heavily limited.
Still, the offering is consistent with what we know about SS7 hacking. Unlike the internet, the SS7 network is a closed network, only meant to be accessed by a handful of telecom companies. As a result, there are few authentication systems in place once a user is on the network. In the past, researchers have raised concerns about SS7 attacks that hacked into telecom company systems remotely, or directly reprogrammed leased equipment like a femtocell.
The site’s manager, who goes by the name Interconnect0r, declined to say how she was able to maintain access, but said it did not present significant technical difficulties, despite regular intervention from phone companies. She also said many others were maintaining access to the SS7 network using similar methods.
“It’s easier than you would think,” she told The Verge. “It’s difficult to wrap your mind around how [easy], unless you've got the right guidance, or stumble upon the right information.”
Most of the vulnerabilities in the SS7 have been known for years, although little has been done to fix them. In 2014, Karsten Nohl first demonstrated how the SS7 system could be used to track a user’s physical location, and subsequent work showed how bad actors on the network could intercept texts and redirect calls. Those attacks could break two-factor authentication, intercepting an SMS or audio call sent through the compromised network.
In 2016, Nohl used the vulnerabilities to track the location of an iPhone belonging to Congressman Ted Lieu as part of a demonstration for CBS’s 60 Minutes. The following March, Rep. Lieu and Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly raising concerns about the issue, hoping to spur more aggressive fixes from telecom carriers.
“We are deeply concerned that the security of America’s telecommunications infrastructure is not getting the attention it deserves,” the letter reads. “Most americans simply have no idea how easy it is for a relatively sophisticated adversary to track their movements, tap their calls, and hack their smartphones.”
Update 4:12PM ET: Updated with the complaints about the service.
Manfrotto is most well-known for its tripods and other camera accessories, but today it’s further expanding beyond that market with the launch of four new camera-oriented backpacks and messenger bags. All the Bumblebee-line bags are fabricated out of a rain-proof material that reflects sunlight. They also include a stretchable band specifically designed to hold a gimbal, but it can be used to hold a lens, too. The backpacks cost more than the messenger bags and start at $229.99. The cheapest messenger bag costs $129.99.
The most expensive and impressive bag, the Bumblee-230 PL, can hold a DSLR with a 70-200/2.8 lens attached and 10 additional lenses, or an attached 400/2.8 lens with five additional lenses. It can be rearranged to hold a video camera and features a 17-inch laptop compartment as well. The bag is pictured above and certainly looks like it can hold a bunch of stuff. It costs $279.99.
The messenger bags aren’t as large but do have something called a “silent quick-access flap” with a “NoiseFree Velcro silencer.” All of this is to say you can open your bag quietly. The most expensive messenger bag, the Bumblebee M-30, costs $149.99. It can hold a DSLR with a 70-200mm/2.8 lens attached and three additional lenses, a handheld gimbal, and a 15-inch laptop in its own padded compartment. This is what it looks like:
Bags! Who doesn’t love bags, honestly?
The latest cinematic iteration of The Mummy takes off when antiquities thief Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) unearths an ancient Egyptian tomb — in Iraq. Ignoring the portents of impending doom (and the fact that stealing antiquities is illegal and also wrong), Morton and his Army buddies unearth a sarcophagus. Inside lies the mummy Ahmanet, an undead pharaoh’s daughter who was mummified alive and is royally pissed off about it. She comes back to life, psychically imprints on Morton, and wreaks havoc on London.
Unlike werewolves or vampires, mummies are creature-feature mainstays that actually do have real-world counterparts. That’s why archaeologist David Hurst Thomas, co-curator of the Mummies exhibit on display at the American Museum of Natural History, has been getting a lot of movie-inspired questions lately. “It really opens the door to talk about this stuff,” Thomas says.
The number one question he’s getting isn’t about whether a mummy could remain undead and entombed for millennia, or even whether any ancient Egyptian tombs have been found in modern-day Iraq. “The question is — as if authenticity is going to be an issue in a Tom Cruise movie — ‘How realistic is that, to have a female mummy?’” Thomas says. “None of the classic mummy movies are about women.” The truth is, that’s one of the more realistic parts of the movie. More than half the mummies in Thomas’ Mummies exhibit are female. In ancient Egypt, mummification wasn’t limited to men. (Lead roles in Hollywood blockbusters are an entirely different story.)
But were ancient Egyptian princesses ever mummified alive? “I don’t know of any case like that,” Thomas says. Still, he adds, there are a lot of ways to mummify a body — and that body doesn’t always have to be dead when the process starts. “Mummies are known from every continent of the world except Antarctica,” he says. “And they have really very different roles in different belief systems.” So we rounded up a few highlights:
Mummification in ancient Egypt started by accident. The heat and dry climate sucked the moisture out of corpses, making them much less appealing to the microbes that typically drive decay. It’s why beef jerky doesn’t spoil as quickly as a juicy steak.
Around 3000 BCE, the ancient Egyptians became much more intentional about preserving their dead — kicking off the early days of mummification. By 1550 BCE, anyone who could pay for a better body in the afterlife shelled out to become a mummy after they died.
The embalming process went something like this: first, embalmers removed the deceased’s brain with a hooked instrument inserted through the nose. They also removed the internal organs — except the heart — through a small incision in the body’s left side. These were preserved separately and stored in ornate jars. Then, the body was washed with water and probably wine, and packed inside and out with a kind of salt called natron. The salt sucked the water out of the body for about 40 days, leaving the skin shriveled like a raisin. Oils were rubbed on the body to revitalize it before it was covered with a kind of tree sap, wrapped in linen and magical amulets, and buried.
“In Egypt, it’s all about looking good for the afterlife,” Thomas says. “And from the top to the bottom of Egyptian society, that becomes the goal.”
Thousands of years before the ancient Egyptians were wrapping corpses in linen, people in South America were mummifying their dead in an altogether different way. Between 7020 BCE and 1110 BCE, fishing communities collectively known as the Chinchorro people lived and died along the coast from southern Peru to northern Chile.
The Chinchorro people had a couple of different ways to preserve a cadaver — possibly as part of a belief system that used mummification to stay connected with the dead. But the Black Mummies — which get their name from the black manganese paint that covered the cadaver — were the standouts, physical anthropologist Bernardo T. Arriaza wrote.
The person preparing a Black Mummy first had to dismember and decapitate the body, and remove its internal organs. The skin, which was preserved separately, “was peeled away from the body and reattached later, like taking off and putting on a sock,” Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato wrote for National Geographic. To dry out the torso, the mortician stuffed the abdomen with hot ashes or coals.
Once the abdomen was dry and the bones were clean, the whole body had to be put back together again, as if it were lying down on its back. Cords tied the bones together, and sticks threaded up through the hips and rib cage, before passing into the skull like body-length splints. The hollow insides were stuffed with grass, ashes, dirt, and animal hair. Then the body was coated with ash, and the skin was carefully stretched back over the top. The last step was to paint the body with a black paste made out of the mineral manganese, which also gave shape to the deceased’s facial features.
Another question Thomas gets from museumgoers is: can you mummify yourself? “And the answer is, you sure can!” he says. Monks in especially ascetic sects of buddhism attempted self-mummification for different ideological reasons, but the end goal was to die of starvation and remain preserved for eternity.
There weren’t many who managed it. There are different numbers floating around, but according to researcher Kiyohiko Sakurai writing in a 1998 textbook, only 15 self-mummified bodies still remain in Japan. The earliest dates to the 14th century, and the latest to the turn of the 20th. The reason there are so few is probably in part because Japan’s humid climate was much less conducive to mummification than the dry and salty deserts of Egypt, or the west coast of South America.
The process was also, no surprise, unpleasant, and deadly. “It starts out with this really nasty 1,000-day diet where you’re just basically starving yourself and getting rid all of the fat in your body,” Thomas explains. The trick to self-mummification was to go low-carb. Monks cut rice, barley, corn, millet, and beans from their diet, and substituted pine bark, grass roots, and nuts for three years or more. The starvation diet altered the body’s composition “to one that was strongly resistant to decomposition,” Sakurai wrote.
When he was close to death, the monk would enter an underground tomb to be buried alive. Three years later, other monks would exhume the body and dry it over candle flames. If the mummification was successful, the mummy was re-dressed in monk’s robes, and arranged in a seated position to be worshipped.
As the ancient Egyptians learned, mummies can be made by accident, too. “The whole thing is just to somehow interrupt the natural biological process of decay, which means stopping bacteria,” Thomas says. That can happen in extremely arid, frozen, or soggy places.
Desert mummies span the globe, from caves in Nevada to ancient Egypt to the Taklamakan desert in China. Famous ice mummies include Otzi the iceman, the freeze-dried mummy of a Copper Age man who was murdered in the Alps and frozen in a glacier 5,300 years ago. There’s also the Llullaillaco Maiden, a 13-year-old girl who died of exposure as an Incan child sacrifice on an icy peak in the Andes.
Drying and freezing make some intuitive sense as preservation techniques — after all, it’s how we preserve our food. But it’s also possible to preserve a body in water, like the bog bodies discovered in Northern Europe. The low-oxygen, swampy, acidic environs of certain bogs essentially pickle the bodies — sometimes dissolving the bones, but leaving the skin and hair intact.
“So there are mummy stories all over the world,” Thomas says. Still, “It's the Egyptian ones that really rule the stage.” Here’s hoping that the next Mummy movie casts a bog body for the starring role — and yes, women could become bog bodies, too.
Expectations were high for Sony’s E3 showcase this week. Last year, Sony arguably stole the show with games like Detroit: Become Human, Days Gone, God of War, Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, a new Call of Duty, The Last Guardian, and a VR thing for Final Fantasy XV, to name a few.
So what did Sony show as the future of PlayStation this year? Detroit: Become Human, Days Gone, God of War, Spider-Man, a new Call of Duty (this time in World War II), a remaster of The Last Guardian predecessor Shadow of the Colossus, and another VR thing for Final Fantasy XV.
Yeah.
That isn’t to say Sony had a bad event — far from it, in fact. E3 is designed to generate excitement not just for this year, but for the years to come. Sony wants to sell the idea that you’re investing in a platform for the long term. That big projects should appear one, two, or even three years in a row, isn’t unprecedented. But with so many repeats this year — and so few surprises — it’s hard not to see this year as a rare miss for a company that’s been pretty dominant at the show for some time.
Sony is far from the only company with repeat performances. Every major company with an E3 event has a game or two that never seems to graduate. The Xbox exclusive Crackdown 3, for example, was first shown off in 2014. As for Ubisoft’s Beyond Good & Evil 2, hell, that project was first announced in 2008. It’s nine years old and still has no release date.
And all those games that Sony repeated have seen major improvements from last year. Detroit’s gameplay was demoed last year, and this year Sony unveiled more of its main storyline. Father-and-son parable God of War, meanwhile, showed more of the frenetic combat and some massive-scale monsters. Spider-Man, the capstone of the night, now looks playable.

To be fair, there were plenty of games that weren’t reruns. Sony announced a number of VR titles in quick succession, including Skyrim VR, a virtual reality port of a game that is legally required to be mentioned at least three times every E3. There was also a new Uncharted chapter and some Destiny 2 teasers.
But even those games, exciting though they may be, are familiar in their own right — sequels and remakes. They looked good, sure, but the big piece that Sony lacked — and one of the big reasons people have loved their past E3 showcases — was surprise. There were no new IP, big or small. Indie games had little to no presence onstage this year — a stark contrast from years past. Monster Hunter World, a new entry in the massively successful Japanese franchise, stands out as an impressive showing, but it’s also a game coming to Xbox One or PC.
The biggest surprise, in fact, might’ve been what Sony didn’t show. Standouts like Hideo Kojima’s I-don’t-even-know-how-to-describe-this Death Stranding (first seen last year) and The Last of Us Part II (unveiled at PlayStation Experience last December) were completely MIA. And after Microsoft spent over an hour trying to convince the world we’re ready for a 4K Xbox, Sony said nary a word about the PlayStation 4 Pro, its own 4K console that’ll be (at least) $100 cheaper by the time Xbox One X comes out. A big question has been how developers will use the hardware to enhance the visuals of its games, and after this week, we still don’t have a good answer.
Then again, it’s not as if Sony needs to “win” every E3. In this generation of gaming, the PlayStation 4 is clearly ahead of the competition, with Xbox One still playing catch-up in sales and Nintendo doing its own thing entirely with the Switch. And with events like December’s PlayStation Experience, the company has been creating other stages to showcase its offerings. But E3 is still the big one. Sony can afford a risk-averse year to refine, to say, “We wowed you last year with a lot of surprises, now give us a moment to clean these up a bit.” But that’s a rarity.
There’s been a lot of hype around the solar eclipse on August 21st. Thousands are traveling to the locations, like Tennessee or Wyoming, to see the Sun go completely dark for the first time since 1918. For those of us staying put, there’s the Eclipse Megamovie Simulator, which will let you see how the eclipse will appear in your area.
Enter your zip code and see an animation of what you can expect, as well as the best time to take a loop. It’s part of the larger Eclipse Megamovie Project, which will collect thousands of photos of the natural phenomenon from volunteers.
If the simulator isn’t enough, there is also the Solar Eclipse Timer, an app that talks you through the location of the eclipse as it happens so you know exactly where the Sun is during the event. With the simulator and the app, you have a pretty good shot of making the most of wherever you are when the eclipse happens. This is much better than paying for a cheesy cruise that lets you view an eclipse you can see from land.
Far Cry 5’s announcement rode in on a wave of controversy. Where past games took players to far-off lands where the player murdered the locals, Far Cry 5 is set in a small Montana county. The enemy is a group of largely white Americans. Its heroes are a ragtag group of resistance fighters, fighting against a cult — a group whose imagery is drenched in patriotic Americana and Christian symbols.
But its first demo, for all of the conversations around the change to the game, felt largely like the Far Cry games that preceded it — its Montana location serving less as a statement than as a playground.
A great deal of buzz around the game has been given to its politics, though Far Cry 5’s development reaches back much further than the election of President Donald Trump and the rise of the alt-right.
"I get that question a fair amount,” Far Cry 5 executive producer and creative director Dan Hay tells The Verge. “Our intention was not to make a specific political statement. Our intention was to build an environment and build a situation that felt real.”
Hay describes the game’s design and the political climate as a “chicken and egg” situation.
“It has been eerie, is the word I would use,” Hay says. “Usually when you're making a game, you take a break, you walk outside, you go have lunch, and the conversations that take place at lunch that you're listening to are vastly different from the conversations that are happening in the game. That is not the case in this game. And it's been strange.”
At E3, Far Cry 5 is present in the form of a short demo mainly showcasing the game’s different AI-controlled partners. Grace Armstrong is a sniper; Nick Rye is a pilot with access to a very tough to fly plane; Boomer is a dog. All three have different capabilities, with a character like Grace providing backup from afar, while Boomer is there to rip through nearby enemies and fetch a gun. My experience with the game provided little insight about the cult the group is fighting against, aside from some bloody run-ins. And I never got the chance to meet the Father, the cult’s leader.
Hay describes the Father as a man who believes the means — in other words, murder and mayhem — justify the end. In building the game’s antagonistic cult, Hay says it’s easy to look at them from a scholastic standpoint. Or, even an anecdotal one.
“When people think about cults, they have an idea in their mind,” he says. Ubisoft worked with a team of “cult experts”on the game, though Hay declines to say what kind of research they did. "I'll be super specific about making sure that folks understand that we did a bunch of research with cult experts, and that's why we built our own cult,” he says. “We wanted to make sure that people understood we weren't specifically targeting a group. We wanted it to be ours.”
But Far Cry 5 needed a magnetic villain — a leader who could convince you that they have answers you don’t. “What I want to know is that I'm sitting down with somebody who's intelligent enough, who's magnetic enough, that even though I have the preconceived notion that I would never be turned or never think of myself as joining a cult,” Hay says. “That this person after a while could talk to me and I would begin to believe that perhaps under the right circumstances they could win me over.”
At the very least, Far Cry 5 still feels very much in-line with its past. In 20 minutes, I’d managed to tangle with wolves and locals (with deadly results); joyride through the country (with deadly results); and man a plane long enough to bomb a stretch of farmland (much to my dismay, with no deadly results).
For those that want to sidestep the messy conversation about what the game may or may not say, Far Cry 5’s E3 demonstration was happy to oblige.




Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will take a leave of absence from the ride-hail company to grieve for his mother who just died in a boating accident, according to a company-wide email that just went out. Kalanick’s decision comes as the investigation in a pervasive culture of sexism and harassment at Uber has reached its conclusion.
“For the last eight years my life has always been about Uber,” Kalanick wrote. “Recent events have brought home for me that people are more important than work, and that I need to take some time off of the day-to-day to grieve my mother, whom I buried on Friday, to reflect, to work on myself, and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team.”
Kalanick wouldn’t say how long he intended to step away from Uber — “it may be shorter or longer than we might expect,” he wrote — but that the move was necessary for the company to effectively improve its battered image. “For Uber 2.0 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team,” Kalanick said. “But if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve.”
Kalanick had been weighing a leave of absence in the week since Uber’s board received the report from the law firm Covington & Burling into its toxic workplace. The investigation was prompted by Susan Fowler, an ex-Uber engineer, whose disturbing account of pervasive sexism, harassment, and managerial incompetency at the ride-hail company came to light last February. After Fowler’s story went viral, Kalanick said the company would “conduct an urgent investigation” into the allegations, and promised to fire anyone who “behaves this way or thinks this is OK.”
Since then, it’s been scandal after scandal at Uber, from high-level executives running for the exit to revelations about legally questionable practices. Every time Uber’s employees thought they were climbing out of the hole they were in, a new controversy would surface and the hole would get deeper. Just last week, it was revealed that two of the company’s top executives, Kalanick and senior vice president of business Emil Michael, had obtained the medical records of a woman in India who was raped by an Uber driver. After the news broke, Michael was fired from the company, while Kalanick weighing stepping away from the company he helped found eight years ago.
The probe was led by former US Attorney General Eric Holder and his colleague Tammy Albarrán. During the course of the investigation, Holder and Albarrán reported on a weekly basis to a subcommittee of Uber’s board of directors, consisting of Arianna Huffington, Bill Gurley, and David Bonderman.
At the time, the news drew criticism because of Holder’s ties to the company. Uber retained Covington & Burling for advice on safety issues. Holder even advocated for Uber last summer by sending letters to officials to drop policies mandating fingerprint-based background checks for drivers. Holder’s former chief of staff and Covington employee, Margaret Richardson, also sits on Uber’s safety advisory board. Early Uber investors Mitch and Freada Kapor Klein called the move “disappointing.”
Uber also retained the law firm Perkins Coie to specifically look into Fowler’s allegations. As a result of that firm’s investigation, 20 employees were fired and 215 claims of harassment, bullying, retaliation and other inappropriate behavior were investigated. Of those claims, 100 were dismissed with no action taken, while 31 employees were referred to training or counseling sessions, and seven were handed written warnings. Fifty-seven cases are still being investigated.
In its review, Covington says it conducted “200 interviews with current and former employees who shared a broad range of perspectives,” including employees with direct knowledge of Fowler’s allegations.

So what does Holder and Albarrán recommend Uber do to fix what’s broken? The report lands on 10 major recommendations, including “changes to senior leadership,” “enhance board oversight,” and “reforumulate Uber’s 14 cultural values.”
You’ll recall that Uber’s cultural values, created by Kalanick and chief product officer Jeff Holden, include such memorable turns-of-phrase as “Let Builders Build,” “Always Be Hustlin’,” “Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping,” and “Principled Confrontation.” The firm recommends that any value that has been used to “justify poor behavior” should be eliminated. At Uber’s all-hands meeting today, Huffington went further on the values, asserting that some of them have been “weaponized,” according to New York Times scribe Mike Isaac.
"A lot of people have told us that the 14 cultural value have been "weaponized" -- not all of them but a few of them." --Huffington
The firm also recommends that Uber create a “diversity advisory board” to ensure the company’s efforts to promote diversity through its hiring process is properly implemented. Uber should regularly publish its diversity numbers too, Covington suggests. The company published its diversity numbers for the first time back in March, showing that Uber was overwhelming white and male.
Covington recommends Uber update its discrimination and harassment policies to make them easier to understand, and to ensure that no reported instance of inappropriate behavior goes unreported. The company should also develop specific guidance on appropriate workplace relationships, including the types of relationships that are explicitly banned such as “individuals in a reporting relationship.” (Recode recently got a hold of a letter from Kalanick outlining Uber’s rules for sexual relationships, which came off as very trashy and tone-deaf.)
With Kalanick stepping aside, and many of the company’s top executives fired or resigned, the question remains: what comes next for Uber? Many of the company’s critics will no doubt be disappointed that Kalanick’s departure won’t be permanent. The argument is that with Kalanick’s leave only temporary, any attempt to start with a clean slate would be meaningless. But Uber’s defenders still see this as an opportunity for the company to hit the reset button.
Bradley Tusk, an outside advisor to the company, told The Verge that he came away with three main takeaways. The first was that Uber should report on a quarterly basis on the status of the implementation of each of the report’s recommendations. This would demonstrate that Uber cares about accountability and transparency. “They won’t want to do it because it’ll be a pain,” but the company should still consider making these quarterly reports, he said.
Second, Tusk said that when Kalanick returns to the company, his focus should be “innovation, growth, and scale,” and he should leave the drudgery of running a massive bureaucracy to his lieutenants. “He’s not a guy who gets excited about reading the minutes from the last board meeting or performance evaluations,” Tusk said, adding that since Kalanick wants to change the future, Uber needs to let him be “the future-changer.”
And lastly, Tusk noted that any tech startup that wants to avoid the many scandals that have befallen Uber over the last few months would be advised to read the Holder report and take it to heart. “You can upend the status quo while still being respectful and accountable to your employees,” he said. “It would behoove startups to think about how this applies to them.”




Freelance writer and academic Anthony Oliveira, known by the Twitter handle @meakoopa, has been suspended from Twitter, prompting a backlash from followers who contrast the decision with what they see as Twitter’s continued failure to combat the rise of the violent alt-right and the prevalence of anti-LGTBQ hate speech on its platform.
The suspension appears to have occurred no more than a few hours ago, and was brought to wider attention by the popular account @skullmandible. His first tweet about the suspension has more than 200 retweets as of this writing, and a hashtag, #freemeakoopa, shows the issue bubbling up throughout Twitter’s LGBTQ and literary communities.
important queer voice and academic anthony olivera banned by twitter the morning after pride weekend. are you serious @twitter #freemeakoopa pic.twitter.com/bZ48evHNeZ
Update: Oliveira told The Verge in an email, “I have no idea what the ban is for... Twitter has provided no explanation whatsoever; I awoke to the account locked. No emails or DMs have been sent. I can see people replying to my @, however, and am very appreciative of their remarks.”
One of Oliveira’s supporters, who did not wish to be quoted by name, explained the situation that followers believe led to the @meakoopa suspension. They posit a theory that Oliveira was suspended for doxxing someone who was trolling him.
The supporter recalls a college student tweeting a photo of himself and his girlfriend with the hashtag #PrideMonth and a caption along the lines of “celebrating my heterosexuality.” That tweet was followed with taunts about how straight people don’t feel the need to “flaunt” their sexuality. Oliveira reportedly responded by quote-tweeting this post with “Many congratulations to you and your sister.” That led to an argument with the original poster, with Oliveira eventually using the real names of the poster and his girlfriend. The poster, according to the anonymous @meakoopa follower, deleted the original tweet and locked his account.
Hey, unsuspend @meakoopa's account. It's a travesty that homophobes constantly abuse us and tell us to kill ourselves. and nothing happens
Silicon Valley ghouls like @jack aren't your friends and are silencing queer voices on Twitter while letting white supremacists roam free pic.twitter.com/iA6I2cWUsL
hey @twitter bring back @meakoopa immediately. you let nazis run roughshod over your site but you ban a queer academic? are you KIDDING ME
A second follower of @meakoopa told The Verge via Twitter DM that the original poster had included an Instagram link in his Twitter profile, which contained his real name: “The rumor with [@]meakoopa is that he used the real names of a straight couple he was making jokes about… And because it's technically against [Twitter’s terms of service] and [@]meakoopa has plenty of enemies on the right / alt-right, they could mass report and get him suspended.” Others have tweeted the same theory, but it’s important to emphasize that Twitter has not confirmed this as the inciting incident for the suspension.
Technically, this would be the same type of behavior that resulted in some of Twitter’s most public prior suspensions — a user with a large following identifying another user by name can be seen as encouraging harassment and abuse. Supporters have argued the intent is different, and that Oliveira is a vital voice on the platform.
Hey @Support and @jack thousands of LGBT look to @meakoopa as a leader & voice for the marginalized; what you did is horrifically tone deaf.
According to Siddhant Adlakha, a critic at the film site Birth. Movies. Death, which recently published an essay on The Babadook Pride Month meme written by Oliveira, Twitter hasn’t provided Oliveira with any information about why he was suspended. (Oliveira confirmed when reached for comment.)
@TwitterOpen, an official Twitter account dedicated to the platform’s LGBTQ community, tweeted “Looking into it!” in response to one of the complaints.
This is outrageous. #freemeakoopa https://t.co/z0FUidr0Hq
Twitter cited, as it has historically, “privacy and security reasons” when declining to comment.
Update: Oliveira’s account has been restored.
twitter suspended me bc I was impolite to straight people mocking the Pulse massacre.they have not apologized and I will not apologize.
Correction: A previous version of this article said that a tweet from @TwitterOpen had been deleted, but it has not.

Facebook has signed a deal to revive reality competition show Last State Standing, according to The Hollywood Reporter. American Ninja Warrior producer A. Smith and Co.’s Arthur Smith is behind the series, which will feature one contestant from each of the 50 states competing in games for a chance to win $500,000. A premiere date, episode count, and rollout plan are still undetermined, but production on the show has reportedly begun in Los Angeles.
Back in February, Facebook announced it hired MTV executive vice president Mina Lefevre to head development of the site’s scripted and unscripted content. Since then, contracts have been signed with outlets like BuzzFeed and Vox to create shortform series (shows 5- to 30-minutes in length).
Last State Standing’s deal comes on the heels of Facebook also reportedly closing in on a deal to revive Nicole Byer’s comedy series Loosely Exactly Nicole. The latter is a reunion for Lefevre and Byer: Lefevre originally helped develop Loosely Exactly Nicole during her tenure at MTV, where it ran for one season in October 2016.
Facebook’s original video content is expected to arrive close to the end of summer, and is part of the company’s concerted efforts, along with Facebook Live and rumors of an app for set-top TV boxes, to bring video to the forefront of user experience.
Since its debut in March, the Nintendo Switch has largely been a success — especially compared to its ill-fated predecessor, the Wii U. The console had the biggest initial two-day sales of any Nintendo console, and the company predicts that it will sell 13 million units by next April. Today at E3, Nintendo showed off a slate of games intended to keep that momentum going forward, including major first-party titles like Super Mario Odyssey, Pokémon, and Metroid Prime 4, as well as third-party games like FIFA 18 and Rocket League. According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé, the early success and future plans of Switch actually have a lot to do with the comparative struggles of the Wii U.
“We knew during the development of Nintendo Switch that we had a product that was really breakthrough,” he says. “But taking all of our learnings from past launches, we also knew that we needed to make sure that the concept was clearly communicated and I think we’ve done that in spades. And we’re going to continue to do that. And then we needed to make sure that a regular cadence of great content would be there. We’ve been able to do that to date, and with what we’ve highlighted in the E3 Spotlight and what we’re going to be talking about all week, we’re going to be able to continue to do that. That’s the key for us.”
On the hardware side, while the Wii U was confusing to many — its tablet-like controller almost seemed like a Wii accessory as opposed to an entirely new platform — the benefits of the Switch’s hybrid nature are much more obvious. It’s a game console you can take on the go, something Nintendo has made clear in its commercials and press events, and proven to be compelling with early releases like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
Outside of its messaging, one of the Wii U’s biggest issues was the long periods that went between major releases. That’s something Switch has been able to avoid, at least in these early days. The console debuted with the hugely successful Breath of the Wild, and is following it up with a steady stream of releases: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe launched in April, competitive fighter Arms debuts this week, Splatoon 2 launches next month, and an enhanced version of arcade fighter Pokken Tournament is coming in September. This all culminates with the release of Super Mario Odyssey on October 27th. Beyond that, today Nintendo also showed new Metroid, Pokémon, Kirby, and Yoshi games that will be launching in 2018 or later.
According to Fils-Aimé, the steady stream of games is a result of Nintendo being more considered with how it approaches developing new titles for Switch, especially compared to the Wii U. “We’ve been very thoughtful in the development cycle to make sure that the content would be ready when we needed it to be ready,” he says. “For example, Super Mario Odyssey — we knew it was critically important for that title to launch going into the holidays. And [producer Yoshiaki Koizumi] and the team made sure that that happened. Planning it out, and then having the dev teams be able to execute against that plan is essentially what we were able to do, and arguably what we weren’t able to do nearly as well with the launch of Wii U.”
The one big question that remains, however, is third-party games from developers that aren’t Nintendo. Switch features several notable indie developed games like Tumbleseed and Rocket League, while major publishers like Bethesda and EA have jumped on board as well. But while PS4 and Xbox One are comparatively similar to develop for, the Switch is a different beast. And this often creates issues with third-party games on the platform — they sometimes debut much later on Switch, or with fewer features.
Skyrim on Switch is a port of a game that originally came out in 2011, while the Switch version of FIFA 18 is missing the series’s incredibly popular story mode. It’s a similar issue that Nintendo faced with the Wii U — even if developers are interested in the platform, the technological hurdles make it difficult. “When we showed them Wii U, third-party developers were actually really excited about it,” says Fils-Aimé. “The challenge became, ‘How do I translate this interesting piece of tech into a compelling game?’ That’s where we didn’t see the completion of the circle.”
But the early success of Switch could be the remedy to this problem. With a big enough install base, the platform could become much more attractive to third-party developers and publishers, and — Fils-Aimé hopes — that would mean fewer late ports and feature-incomplete releases. “We would love to see that — whether it appears on our platform first, whether it appears at the same time as other platforms. That clearly is our goal,” he says. “But in the end, the developer needs to see that opportunity and dedicate the resources against it. The fact is, our development environment is a little bit different than the environment for other consoles, and so a third-party company needs to make a commitment to go down this, let’s call it alternate development path for Nintendo Switch.
“We believe that with a large install base, with a vibrant ecosystem, with a strong platform that delivers downloadable content, consumables, and all of the various ways that third-party developers are monetizing their content — if we deliver that, the content will come.”
The Federal Communications Commission does not have the authority to cap the cost of prison and jail phone calls within states, an appeals court ruled in a decision today, dealing a massive blow to inmates and their advocates who have spent years litigating caps on the cost of such calls.
Over several years, the FCC, under Democratic leadership, moved to cap the cost of calls for inmates. Activists argued that prisoners were effectively being extorted by private companies charging exorbitant rates — a move that benefited private prisons and the states that got cuts of the revenue. Some of those states joined with companies in appealing the FCC’s rules. The agency first moved to cap rates across state lines, and then, later, within states.
Today, the court ruled that the FCC had overstepped when it attempted to regulate the price of calls within states. In the majority opinion, the court left little wiggle room for advocates of price-capping, with the possible exception of the cross-state caps, which are a minority of calls made by inmates. The opinion vacated not only the agency’s proposed caps for in-state calls, but said the agency also lacked justification to require reports on video calling services. It also vacated a provision that would ban site commission payments.
“We’re profoundly disappointed,” says Lee Petro, who represented the Wright Petitioners, a group of families litigating for the rate caps. “Families lose, privately owned [inmate calling service] providers will win.”
The decision could end the years-long battle over the caps, which came to a head in a bizarre 11th-hour change from the Trump Administration. After current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was appointed to lead the commission, the agency did not move to revoke the rules, but did stop defending them in court, leaving independent intervenors to continue the fight.
Pai has long opposed the rules, and lauded the court’s decision in a statement. “Today, the DC Circuit agreed with my position that the FCC exceeded its authority when it attempted to impose rate caps on intrastate calls made by inmates,” Pai said. “Looking ahead, I plan to work with my colleagues at the Commission, Congress, and all stakeholders to address the problem of high inmate calling rates in a lawful manner.”
It’s unclear if the decision will be appealed to the Supreme Court. Lee says all options are being reviewed.
Correction, 4:05PM: An earlier headline said the ruling applied to cross-state calls. It applies to in-state calls.
If you’re a Switch owner looking to use your Switch with a TV, there’s basically been only one good option since launch: Nintendo’s bundled dock. Unfortunately it’s bulky, tough to travel with, and expensive, costing $89.99 for a spare one (if you want to set one up on a second TV).
Nyko’s new Portable Docking Kit, announced at E3 2017, solves that problem by offering a miniature, $45 Switch dock that will both allow you to prop up your console and connect it to your TV over HDMI while charging it, as spotted by Gizmodo. It’s essentially the perfect solution for players who want to take Nintendo’s already portable console with them, but still want to be able to throw games up on a big screen at a friend’s house or a hotel room without using Nintendo’s far larger dock. Nyko’s dock also includes a USB-C AC adaptor and HDMI cable, so it’s fully equipped out of the box to serve as a second spare dock.
The only downside is that the smaller Portable Docking Kit lacks the two regular USB ports that Nintendo’s larger dock offers, so you won’t be able to connect things like an Ethernet adaptor using Nyko’s dock. Still, it’s a small price to pay for the enhanced portability of the dock.
The Nyko Portable Docking Kit will be out sometime in the fall.

You know what they say — you wait a decade or so for a passable Metroid game then two come along at once. At least that might just be what’s going to happen based on Nintendo’s E3 announcements today, where the company first revealed Metroid Prime 4 for Switch and then followed up with Metroid: Samus Returns for 3DS.
While Prime 4 will presumably be a continuation of the first-person take on Metroid, Samus Returns brings the beloved series back to its 2D roots. The graphics are rendered in 3D, granted, but Samus Returns is a side-scrolling game based on Metroid II: Return of Samus for the original Game Boy. Metroid II is a brutally difficult game that I was extremely bad at when I was nine years old, but Samus Returns does look to be somewhat tuned for modern sensibilities — having the map on the bottom screen alone will be a major help.
Metroid: Samus Returns will be out for 3DS on September 15th.
Some people get upset about the Star Wars special editions. Others take umbrage at remakes of classic horror films. Me? As I discovered this morning, I get upset over reboots of 1990’s Joel Schumacher thrillers. Like Flatliners.
The trailer for the film, which features a pretty impressive cast led by Ellen Page and Rogue One’s Diego Luna, was released this morning. And it features everything you’d expect from a movie about medical students that decide to kill themselves in the name of science only to discover that they can bring their sins back with them in physical form. There’s creepy scare beats. Cacophonous, orchestral music cues. It has blandly attractive actors like James Norton saying things like, “I didn’t know the side effects would show up and start hunting us down.” And it looks great, too, with clean, stylish photography — exactly what you’d expect from director Niels Arden Oplev, who previously made the original The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
But for me, and probably at least one other person, the original Flatliners was a seminal piece of 1990s filmmaking. It featured a mind-boggling cast of soon-to-be superstars, including Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and William Baldwin. (Okay, not all of them ended up stars.) It was directed by Joel Schumacher, fresh off The Lost Boys and St. Elmo’s Fire, and well before Batman Forever and Batman & Robin would ruin everything for everyone. The movie’s self-serious tone was perfect for the angsty decade that was to come — and oh, the way it looked. Flatliners had style for days, with the medical students working in some insane gothic horror show of a school filled with domineering statues and neon lighting for no reason whatsoever. It was like the coolest goth club you could never get into, only in movie form.
And so now I sit here, watching this new trailer — and sure, it’s the same premise as Flatliners. Page’s performance appears to be as fantastic as always. And as my colleague Chris Plante pointed out, it nails the ‘90s thriller vibe; I’d put it somewhere between Final Destination and I Know What You Did Last Semester In Medical School. But that’s never what made the original movie so appealing. The first Flatliners was wonderful because, flawed and ludicrous as it was, it nevertheless felt elevated and exotic to 15-year-old me. Stylish and bold, it was happy to traffic in cheap scares and cheaper melodrama even while it earnestly tried to tackle real themes like guilt and shame. You can call it High School Insecurities: The Movie, and you’d probably be right, but that didn’t change the fact that it worked.
That’s not to say the new Flatliners can’t do the same for a new generation. It certainly could, and I’m sure if I’d seen the original for the first time at the age I’m at now, I would have a totally different take on the film. So perhaps it’s a matter of perspective. Or it could be that I just don’t see the big picture yet. Kiefer Sutherland will appear in the new film, making it more of a distant sequel than a true reboot, and perhaps his character returning will connect the two movies in a rewarding way that’s not evident at the moment.
Either way, it’s not fair to judge a movie based on its trailer, and I look forward to seeing what the new Flatliners has to offer when it opens on September 29th. But in the meantime, I’m glad I recently picked up the original on iTunes. Today’s a good day to die.
Nintendo is at E3 this year, and the focus is expected to be on the recently released Switch, with a particular emphasis on Super Mario Odyssey, the upcoming Mario adventure for its latest console.
Microsoft issued a “highly unusual” patch for Windows XP last month to help prevent the spread of the massive WannaCry malware. At least 75,000 computers in 99 countries were affected by the malware which encrypts a computer and demands a $300 ransom before unlocking it. Microsoft stopped supporting Windows XP in April 2014, but the software giant is now taking the unprecedented move of including it in the company’s Patch Tuesday round of security updates today.
“In reviewing the updates for this month, some vulnerabilities were identified that pose elevated risk of cyberattacks by government organizations, sometimes referred to as nation-state actors, or other copycat organizations,” says Adrienne Hall, general manager of crisis management at Microsoft. “To address this risk, today we are providing additional security updates along with our regular Update Tuesday service. These security updates are being made available to all customers, including those using older versions of Windows.”
Microsoft says it is releasing updates for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and all other more recent unsupported and supported versions of Windows due to an “elevated risk” of attacks that are similar to the WannaCry malware. The patches will be made available on Microsoft’s Download Center or Windows Update. Microsoft says this move to release security updates for platforms not in extended support “should not be viewed as a departure from our standard servicing policies,” and that this is an exception based on intelligence that led it to believe government organizations may use these new vulnerabilities to attack Windows systems.
Microsoft isn’t explaining who or what has tipped the company off to these potential new attacks. March’s security patches included fixes for hacking tools that were leaked from the NSA, and Microsoft didn’t acknowledge the source of the security flaw reports then either. There has been speculation that The Shadow Brokers, a group that leaked the NSA exploits, tipped Microsoft in advance to the previous exploits. Microsoft also mysteriously delayed its Patch Tuesday release in February by a month in an unprecedented move, blaming a "last minute issue".
If you're still running Windows XP then these new patches should be installed immediately, even though Windows XP wasn't as badly affected by the first WannaCry attacks. While almost all WannaCry victims were running Windows 7 without the latest security updates, it's not clear if these new attacks might target Windows XP more aggressively this time around.
Fans of Spanish actress Elena Anaya might have had a hard time recognizing her in Patty Jenkins’ superhero sensation Wonder Woman. Anaya is a headliner in Spain, with starring roles in films including Pedro Almodóvar’s The Skin I Live In, the drama They Are All Dead, and the ghost story Fragile. She’s become an international star as well, in the UK’s Swung, France’s high-profile criminal profile Mesrine: Killer Instinct and Mesrine: Public Enemy #1, and Chile’s The Memory of Water. To people around the world, she’s a memorable face.
But in Wonder Woman, that face is largely covered by prosthetics and makeup, and Anaya’s intensity only comes through in her eyes. She plays villain Dr. Maru, aka Dr. Poison, the savage chemist pioneering an explosive new form of mustard gas that may win World War I for the German forces. It’s a comparatively small role for her, but it’s a central one. She puts a face — a badly damaged face, covered with prosthetic plates — on the war’s weapons of mass destruction. She brings an eerie sensitivity and soulfulness to her acts of mass murder. And in her best scene, she coldly confronts the film’s love interest, Chris Pine, as he infiltrates a German party as a spy. I recently talked to Anaya about the fantasies she built around Wonder Woman’s most enigmatic character, Dr. Maru’s future prospects in a Wonder Woman sequel, and how she got those hideous facial scars. Also: how Dr. Maru is both an ant and a snake.
This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
How did you approach playing Dr. Maru?
It was very tricky for me to take on the evil of this character, and to live up to Wonder Woman, the strongest female character ever written in a comic book. Dr. Maru loves rage and enjoys people’s pain. She’s creating terrible weapons, and her purpose in life is to kill as many people as possible, and provoke as much pain as possible. When you read a comic book script and then you’re responsible for approaching a character like this, you think, “Well, how is it possible that somebody invented a character like this?” And then unfortunately, I realized that more than ever, there are evil people in real life. They are on television, they are very powerful people, and they don’t wear masks like Dr. Maru wears. These people are villains in real life, hurting a lot of people, and they’re doing a lot of damage to mankind. So that’s one answer.
The other answer is, I did my research about World War I. There was a terrible moment when the army and science came together. I researched Fritz Haber, the chemist who created mustard gas. His personal history was very scary. He was a chemist in a beautiful marriage with another chemist. He wanted to be a powerful man, recognized by everybody. But his wife begged him to stop. The night before the first gas-bomb test, he said, “I’m not going to stop,” so she killed herself with his gun. You imagine this tortured person going to bomb tests with his wife dead in his house, with his love passed away in the process.
Were you thinking about backstories like that in terms of explaining where her rage and pain comes from?
Of course, of course! When I create a character, I read so many things. I get a lot of inspiration from real life. But then that’s not enough. You need to be secure, and to use your imagination and your own tools, your own experiences, to inhabit the feeling. I had to invent all her past, all her sorrows, and why she’s so tortured, and what happened to her. I created her past, her background. You can’t just put on a face, like “Okay, I’m going to be very evil.” I think she makes people suffer to avoid her own suffering, because she cannot suffer anymore. You can see at the end of the movie when she is begging with her eyes, “Do not kill me.” Because everybody is human at the end of the tale. Even if you’re superstrong and you feel like you’re the smartest person on earth, when someone is going to kill you, you’re scared. You feel like a tiny ant. All your insecurities come up.
What did your version of her history look like? Did you have a reason for her facial scars?
I went to Patty Jenkins and asked, “What happened to her?” And she said, “She did it on purpose.” I was like, “What? Patty, you’re going further than I ever imagined.” She said, “She wants to provoke painful suffering, so she tested her own gas on her own face. She wanted to know how deep this form of her gas would go, so she put it on her own face.” You can see half of her face is completely gone. This is the sadistic side of Dr. Maru. And that was the idea of Patty Jenkins, who gave me the best tools ever to work with a character.
The science behind Wonder Woman's chemical weapon.
If her scars were consciously self-inflicted, why do you think it’s important to her to wear a mask?
Well, first of all, she’s working in a lab. She needs some protection. Same as she wears protection with her boots and gear. But also, she doesn’t want to be seen. She’s like a shade, always in the background. She works day and night in her lab. She’s only trying to erase what happened to her face so she won’t get much attention. She needed to know how deep the gas would go. Okay, she got that, now she needs to keep working. She has no time to give explanations to anyone about what happened. She just doesn’t like to be looked at. She doesn’t like to be the center of any conversation. She works alone. She has hundreds of people building bombs outside of her lab, but the only person authorized to get inside is Ludendorff.
She’s obsessive. She’s a maniac. And she doesn’t care about her face. It’s not important to her. She just doesn’t want attention.
Did you think about her history before the scar? About what made her into this sadistic person?
I think we’re all born in the same condition: we are pure. In any country on the planet, we are born pure. And then we’re terribly changed as things happen in our lives. The reasons I created for her — it’s a long story! I think she suffered. That she had a love she loved so much, and that person went with somebody else. She felt betrayed, and it weighed on her mind and heart. And she became sick. When your pain is not in your body, you can’t get rid of it. It’s like a scar. It can get dark inside, get infected, and that infection can kill your body, even if it’s just a tiny cut on your finger.
She wants to be loved. She wants somebody to take care of her. She doesn’t want to be so lonely and so independent, but she’s completely alone. She would love to have people trust her, and not only because she has an amazing intelligence, not just for the chemist she became, but for the woman she is now. We all have humanity underneath all these masks we wear. But she went so far. She finds it very difficult to get rid of all the hate in her soul. She hates so much, so much.
You bring across so much of this anger and hurt with your eyes. Was it frustrating having so much of your face covered, trying to communicate a character with some of your tools taken away?
In some ways, the prosthetics help! I’d go to work every day and put on this beautiful costume — those are real army boots, worn by a female warrior in the first World War. They give you a face. They give you a look, a vision, a perspective. You see the world so differently behind that mask, because you’re hiding so much with the plates. I’m a person who tries to not hide anything at all. I’m super-clear always with all my friends, my family, my lovers, the people I run into every day. The people who hide and cheat and live in the shade, they’re so interesting to play.
I mean, of course those plates were painful on my face. They were glued on, I had to wear them like 12 hours a day. I basically couldn’t eat or drink the whole day. And for talking [hoarse, wheezing voice with slurping noises] you need to do this voice, with this saliva thing. I told Patty “I want to use this noise of the saliva in her mouth all the time,” and she said it was too much. I know they got rid of most of the takes where I had the saliva thing going on.
But always, when I have to wear a mask, or anything I can use for my character — long nails or special boots or a wig — that gives me power. Whatever helps, they’re like magic tools for actors, even though sometimes they’re a pain in the ass. On this occasion, I loved my mask so much. I was very happy every day to wear that beautiful costume and those beautiful plates, and see how people reacted to them. Sometimes I’d just watch the monitor. There’d be seven people around the set, and the minute they’d turn and see my face, they’re like [gasps theatrically] “Oh fuck! She’s here!” They were so impressed!
What do you know about Dr. Maru’s future? Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins are contracted for a second Wonder Woman movie. Are you?
Yes yes yes. But I have no answer for that. As you know, when these movies are made, they ask you basically to marry them for the rest of your life. [Laughs] I’d be so happy to be back, to be able to be evil again. It’s so good, it’s so fantastic.
If she were to turn up again in a future film, what would you want out of her? What would you like to see her do?
Wow. I think Dr. Maru has a lot left to do, and show, and tell. She hides her femininity and vulnerability. It’s so easy for her to escape from every situation. She’s like a tiny criminal ant, it’s so difficult for her to be caught. She has many faces. You know, there is a moment in the movie when we see her face without the damage, and she looks like a fairly normal, easygoing chemist, like somebody who’s clever in her work. Who could tell that this person is going to invent the most destructive weapon ever? So I think Dr. Maru could have a nice side, and show it to the audience. It’d show a lot to the audience about evil people. About what I said about how they exist in real life, with a lot of power to changes everybody’s life.
How did current politics affect your performance?
I’m very in contact with reality. I love my job so much. This is what I dreamt to do. Being able to perform as a professional actress is a gift life has given me somehow. But on the other side, I’m very concerned about the situation in the real world. When I pick a project, I don’t just think about entertainment. I want to show people, while they’re in the movie, what kind of characters are in life, even though it’s a fiction movie. This movie talks about the world, about how we all have to do something — with power or without power, we have to try to get a better world. You know it’s going to be a very dangerous place.
I try to illustrate that evil exists. That evil can press a button and kill, can decide other people’s future and change mankind. They can provoke so much suffering. It’s happening in real life, and I think we’re all in shock, globally. There are so many crazy villains with power in our televisions every day. We just need to make the tiny effort to recognize them.
Patty Jenkins seems to have a particularly strong idea of how women can be heroes, how they can improve their roles in the world, and their portrayals in the media. How did the two of you work together on that question?
You know, I’m so proud of Patty Jenkins, since the first day I met her. I saw her fighting every day on set, defending her ideas. She was surrounded every day by so many people with so many opinions, giving their different points of view. With the best attitude, the best manners, she would explain to everyone why she wanted things this way. With so many people producing and offering opinions, it’s difficult, because you are one against 50 or more. Man or woman, if you become a director, you have to say, “We are going to take this direction, this is how I want it.” Everyone needs to marry her, in a way.
We have an expression in Spain: “She put everybody in her pocket.” Mostly at the end of the day, she got what she wanted. And she fought for it. She was so determined. She must have been exhausted afterward. But she had the best sense of humor, which is very important in this business. She’s an incredible woman, strong, very smart, very hard worker. She doesn’t get tired. She was in the first unit and then also in the second nighttime unit, running everywhere, doing everything. They’d say, “What are you doing here? You are Wonder Woman! What the hell! You should be sleeping, Patty!” “No, guys, I want to be with you and make sure everything’s clear.” It was such a big lesson, and I’m so proud. I celebrate every day these successes, because it means a lot for her, and for female directors.
Did you read any of the comics, or look at the history of the previous versions of the characters?
Yeah, I tried to find Dr. Poison at the beginning, when I got the script. I asked, “Holy shit, who is she?” I asked Patty, and she said, “Listen. We are doing this movie. There are so many comics. There are so many backgrounds, and so many things to put together. Let’s focus on what we have to tell in this script, which is a lot.” You just have to pick one background for yourself, even if it doesn’t match all the originals. You have to pick whatever the director asks you to play in the movie, and be conscious that your character is an important, clever piece, but it’s surrounded by so many other pieces You have to be conscious that you can’t tell the whole story just with your eyes. You try, but there is no room for everybody’s character background.
What was the environment like on set?
It was amazing. Patty has an amazing sense of humor. She was always very in contact with everybody’s needs, taking care of everybody like a mom, and laughing. The moment we had to be super-focused, we were super-focused. The moment we could relax, it was a very easygoing, relaxed atmosphere. And the lead actors, Chris and Gal, they made everybody’s energy very easygoing, even though it was a very expensive, crazy movie. It was like we were friends, like sometimes happens in independent movies. We were in a very good mood, and very proud of what we were doing.
How did you approach your big battle of wills with Chris Pine?
That was my first day on set. And that was cool. I had so much fun. I just wanted to look at his face and imagine and invent. When you have a face in front of your face, and that face is Chris Pine’s, it’s like, “Oh my goodness.” But it wasn’t Chris Pine’s face anymore, it was the character’s. And when he’s giving Dr. Maru attention, she’s thinking “What is going on here?” But she needs to hold her thoughts in and not show them to him. It was very fun. He’s such a good actor, and we had the whole day to shoot the scene. Patty was doing so many takes, asking us so many things.
I remember for that scene, Patty came to me and said, “Could you imagine that you’re a very ugly snake?” And I was like, “Yeah, Patty, I thought about it. If I had to think of an animal as my character, it would be a snake. But what kind of snake?” And then we went farther in on that look she gives him, the look of somebody who is still, but can kill you in a second, with just a tiny movement. The snake just holds its movement and looks at you, like hypnotizing you, but if it wanted, it could strangle you and eat you. I had so much fun.
Sony didn’t have a lot it needed to do at E3 this year. The company has had a sizable lead this console generation over the Xbox One in terms of overall units shipped, and the PlayStation 4 platform is coming off an early 2017 that was filled with big software wins like Horizon Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata, and Persona 5. While Microsoft had a lot to prove with the unveiling of the Xbox One X, Sony simply needed to follow up on its many announced titles.
And that’s more or less exactly what Sony did. The company played it safe this year without any real big surprises or reveals at the event. There was simply a steady stream of trailers and footage from upcoming PlayStation 4 and PSVR games, with extended looks at some games (like Insomniac’s Spider-Man) and more context for others.
Given that E3 itself is just getting started, and we’ve yet to get some hands-on time with most of what Sony showcased at its presentation, it’s still too early to say whether or not Sony has come out as the so-called “winner” of E3 this year. But can we break down Sony’s announcements at its event to see how things stand for the PlayStation 4 moving into the second half of 2017 and beyond.
In recent years, Sony has kept games its focus at E3, and this event was no exception. The entire showcase was essentially a parade of trailers and gameplay clips for big-budget PlayStation exclusives: Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Days Gone, God of War, Spider-Man, Detroit: Become Human, and an expansion for Horizon Zero Dawn. In fact, Sony only featured a couple of games that weren’t exclusive to the PlayStation 4, including Destiny 2, which will have content available as a timed exclusive on PS4 and Call of Duty: WW2, which is getting an early multiplayer beta on PS4 this summer.
It’s a bold statement: if you want access to the most big-budget AAA games, then you’ll need a PlayStation. The strategy stands out when compared Microsoft’s somewhat lackluster E3 for blockbuster titles (which was basically just Forza 7, Crackdown 3, and Sea of Thieves).
Console-exclusive titles are bad for players, but they aren’t going away anytime soon. And Sony showed at E3 this year that it’s got a really strong lineup of big games for the PS4 going forward.
Alongside the mainstream PS4 games was a dedicated section of the presentation for PSVR, which Sony seems to be taking more seriously than platforms like the Vita portable or Move motion controllers. Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games showed off trailers for some more serious VR games: the horror thriller Inpatient and a squad-based shooter called Bravo Team. On the lighter side of things, there was Starchild, a space adventure game with giant, glowing robots and Moss, which starred an adorable animated mouse warrior and is probably the closest thing we’re ever going to get to a Redwall game. Skyrim is coming to the PSVR, in the event that you haven’t played that enough times over yet. And let’s not forget Monster of the Deep, for that virtual reality Final Fantasy experience you never knew you wanted.
It’s a diverse lineup aimed at multiple kinds of VR users, from hardcore to casual, and it’s a reassuring sign that virtual reality and the PSVR aren’t just a passing distraction for Sony.
There was one big surprise from Sony at the event, and it was a doozy. Shadow of the Colossus, one of the most beloved PS2 games of all time, is getting a full HD remake next year. Given that Sony already had released a PS3 remaster in 2011, it’s hard to say that anyone was really asking for this, but the trailer looks spectacular, and unlike previous remakes of beloved games unveiled at Sony press conferences (looking at you, Final Fantasy VII Remake), we’ll hopefully be able to play the redone Shadow of Colossus sometime next year.
While Sony may have done an excellent job at highlighting its slate of upcoming software, the presentation was conspicuously lacking when it came to any mention of hardware, particularly the recently released PlayStation 4 Pro.
It’s a glaring omission given that close to a year after the Pro launched, there are still few PS4 games that support the updated hardware. But it’s especially strange given that Microsoft has put almost all of its focus at E3 this year on the Xbox One X, declaring it “the most powerful console ever,” and with an emphasis that the One X is the single best place for true 4K console gaming without compromise.
Sony has already had difficulty explaining why people should pick up a PlayStation 4 Pro over a regular PS4, and now, with another, more powerful 4K console to compete with, the company did nothing at E3 to clarify things. Sony didn’t say that any of its new games would look better on a Pro, or highlight any graphical improvements that gamers would see on the more powerful hardware.
It’s great that Sony had new trailers for a range of games. But, PSVR titles aside, almost none of these titles were new. Indie games were — as our friends at Polygon pointed out — weirdly absent. While the surprise of Shadow of the Colossus was nice, Sony spent most of its time on new trailers for games we’ve already seen. There was little to indicate what it has planned next. We know of a number of other big-name PS4 exclusive that are on the way — including Death Stranding, The Last of Us Part Two, and Final Fantasy VII Remake — but all were absent from the company’s E3 showcase.
PS4 exclusive games at Sony’s E3 conference that have vague release dates or no release window at all: Days Gone, God of War, Detroit: Become Human, Shadow of Colossus, Horizon Zero Dawn’s Frozen Wild DLC, Spider-Man, Skyrim VR, Starchild, Inpatient, Bravo Team, and Moss.
PS4 exclusive games at Sony’s E3 conference with an actual, semi-concrete release date: Uncharted: The Lost Legacy (out August 22nd) and Monster of the Deep, the Final Fantasy XV fishing simulator, will be out this September.
Correction: Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is out August 22nd. This post has been updated to reflect that.
Nintendo was the last of the three major companies to present at E3 this year (which it did through its now traditional online Spotlight stream as opposed to a full blown press conference), and as expected, the focus was all about the Switch.
Want to catch up? Here’s what the biggest news was out of Nintendo’s stream.
Super Mario Odyssey is Nintendo’s next big blockbuster Switch game, and its out on October 27th. Along with the release date, Nintendo showed a new trailer for the game, showing off some of the new gameplay mechanics and levels. In Odyssey, Mario will be accompanied by Cappy, who players will be able to use to take control of enemy characters (including a giant T-Rex!) in a new Capture mechanic.
Metroid fans, rejoice! After almost ten years of waiting (filled only with the poorly received Metroid: Other M and bizarre spin-off Federation Force) Nintendo has finally announced a fourth Metroid Prime game, coming to the Switch. There’s barely any other information — no release date, screenshots, or gameplay trailer — but presumably they’ll be more on the latest adventures of Samus Aran in the coming months
If you were disappointed when Nintendo didn’t announce a Pokémon game in the core RPG series of the franchise for the Switch at its Pokémon-themed Nintendo Direct last week, good news: Game Freak is working on one. Unfortunately, that’s all we really have on it for now, but at least we know it exists.
In slightly more concrete news, Nintendo showed off some trailers for new Yoshi and Kirby games coming to the Switch in 2018. The Kirby title showed off some new gameplay where Kirby can befriend enemies, instead of simply eating them for their abilities. Meanwhile, the Yoshi game seems to be a follow up to Yoshi's Woolly World, this time setting the action in a world built out of cardboard, with an interesting mechanic where players can flip over the 2D levels to the other side. Both games offer cooperative gameplay, which should gel nicely with the Switch’s Joy-Con controller.
Rocket League is making its way to the Nintendo Switch this holiday season, with some Nintendo-themed items and cars exclusive to the Switch edition. Interestingly, the Rocket League will offer cross network play against other platforms, although developer Psyonix has yet to detail exactly how that will work.
Mario’s next adventure looks incredibly wild and inventive — even by Nintendo standards. Today the company showed off the latest trailer for Super Mario Odyssey, which follows in the sandbox footsteps of the genre-defining Super Mario 64, revealing an experience that looks to be absolutely crammed with ideas and potential.
One of the core components of the game is Mario’s hat, which has been turned into a sentient character named Cappy, who can be tossed onto characters, enemies, objects, and vehicles, transforming Mario in the process. The trailer shows everything from a Mario T. rex to a Mario tank to a Mario Bullet Bill. The levels themselves, meanwhile — which range from urban cityscapes to typical desert and ice worlds — look to be very dense with things to discover and interact with. At one point in the trailer, the game even shifts to an old-school, side-scrolling Mario experience.
Super Mario Odyssey will be the biggest Switch game since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at launch, and it’s coming later this year. Nintendo revealed today that Odyssey will be available on October 27th.
Nintendo detailed what to expect from the first of the two DLC packs for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild back in May, and now we know when we’ll be able to get it: June 30th.
The first DLC expansion, The Master Trials, will include several new additions to the base game, including a new “Trial of the Sword” mode, where players will be forced to fight waves of enemies, but without any of their existing equipment that they’ve gathered over the course of their play-through. Completing the trial will power up the Master Sword further, allowing it to deal double damage at all times.
Additionally, a new “Master Mode” — i.e., hard mode — will be added, which increases the difficult by upgrading all the enemies found in the game (some of whom will now take to the sky on flying rafts), along with a variety of new armors and costumes inspired by earlier Zelda titles.
Nintendo also gave a brief teaser of the second DLC pack for Breath of the Wild, scheduled to release this holiday season. Titled “The Champions’ Ballad”, the expansion will somehow involve the four Champions —  Daruk, Mipha, Revali and Urbosa — although more details on that are still forthcoming. New Amiibo figures based on the four Champions are also in the works.
Yoshi is swapping wool for paper in his next adventure. At its E3 spotlight today, Nintendo unveiled the next Yoshi game, and it looks like a cross between Yoshi’s Woolly World and Paper Mario. Which is to say, it’s incredibly cute and cuddly. Outside of aesthetics, though, it appears to be more of what you’d expect from a new Yoshi game. Namely lots of side-scrolling action, filled with egg tossing and platforming. The game — which is currently just called Yoshi — is slated to launch on Nintendo Switch some time next year.
LG’s latest ultrawide monitor has been designed with gamers in mind. The new 34-inch monitor (34UC89G) features a 2560 x 1080 display with NVIDIA G-Sync and a 144Hz refresh rate.
The 21:9 monitor is a successor to the 34UC79G from LG, which also ran at 144Hz, but supported FreeSync instead of G-Sync. The 34UC89G features a widened color gamut, unique display modes including black stabilizer and dynamic action sync, and the refresh rate can be overclocked to 166Hz.
The 34UC89G comes in at $999, and will be available at retailers including Amazon, Newegg, and B&H later today.
According to Variety, a recent hire at Google indicates big changes are coming for future versions of the Pixel phone. Manu Gulati, an Apple micro-architect who worked on the company’s chip development for nearly eight years, has just joined Google, announcing the hire today on his Linkedin profile.
With a new title of lead SoC architect, Gulati’s move could, on the surface, arguably point to any number of Google SoC (system on a chip) developments. The company currently has none. It’s a new position for Google, which currently relies on third-party chips for all their products. Nest uses a chip by Texas Instruments, for example, while current Pixel phones use Qualcomm.
The focus on developing chips for Pixel, however, seems to be confirmed by a over a dozen new SoC-related job offers posted by Google — many specific to mobile — including “Hardware Engineer, Mobile SoC Architect,” “Mobile SoC CPU Architect,” and “Mobile SoC Memory Architect.” The listings include phrases like “Architect the memory sub-system of a high-end mobile SoC; including core configuration and PPA (performance, power, area) tradeoffs,” and “Help define the architecture of future generations of phone and tablet SoCs.”
Internally designed chips were not a focus for Google in the past, but this looks to be changing. It’s likely due in no small part to the drastically increased burden placed on phone hardware in recent years to not only handle more processor-heavy experiences like VR and AR, but voice and visual cues without latency. Apple recently debuted Core ML at WWDC, its new machine learning framework API for developers that directly tackles these issues. Craig Federighi, Apple’s SVP of software engineering, says the new API makes the iPhone six times faster at image recognition than the Google Pixel.
While The Information reported that Google was in talks to develop their own chips as far back as 2015, it’s become an increasingly crucial step for the company to advance in order to compete with Apple’s iPhone, and really, what consumers are demanding from mobile devices. (Our previous headline from 2016: “The Google phone is almost as good as the iPhone.”)
Gulati’s hire, coupled with Google’s additional bevy of job listings and recent news that  it’s reportedly offered to invest around $880 million in LG’s Display division, shows a real effort on Google’s end to crank up hardware and mobile efforts for future products.
Take a deep breath: Nintendo is actually making a new Metroid game. At its E3 spotlight today, the company officially unveiled Metroid Prime 4, the latest entry in the beloved sci-fi exploration series. Unfortunately, outside of the name and the fact that it’s coming to Nintendo Switch, we know nothing about the game itself.
The new game will mark the first entry in the Prime series in a decade, as the original trilogy concluded with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on the original Wii in 2007. The Prime subseries debuted on the GameCube in 2002, and was especially notable for successfully translating the iconic, moody exploration of the original Metroid games into a three-dimensional, first-person experience.
However, since the Prime trilogy wrapped up, it’s been tough times for Metroid fans. The most recent game in the series — Metroid Prime: Federation Force on 3DS — was a mostly forgettable shooter that had little of what made the series so iconic in the first place.
No release window has been announced for Prime 4, but given the sparse details available, the game is likely still fairly early in development.
A new Pokémon game is in the works for the Switch, Nintendo revealed today at its E3 Spotlight presentation. And unlike the recently announced Pokkén Tournament DX, the upcoming title is a proper “core” RPG Pokémon game from developer Game Freak, who has developed every title in the main Pokémon series since the original release of Pokémon Red and Blue back in 1996.
The news comes on the heels of Nintendo’s Pokémon-themed Direct presentation last week, which to the disappointment of many fans, saw an announcement of Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon for the Nintendo 3DS, leaving the Switch with only an upgraded port of Pokkén Tournament from the Wii U.
It’s unclear whether or not the Switch Pokémon game is the long-rumored Pokémon Stars — said to be a port of the existing Pokémon Sun and Moon from the 3DS — or a new entry in the series. In any event, it will mark the first time in the history of the series that a “main” Pokémon RPG title is coming to a home console. (Given the Switch’s portable nature, however, that title may be up for debate.)
Nintendo didn’t give any more information on the upcoming game, except to note that it won’t be released until sometime next year at the earliest.
When Nintendo officially unveiled the Nintendo Switch back in January, the company showed off an impressive slate of role-playing games for the device. One of those was the massive open world of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 — and at E3 this year Nintendo is giving an even deeper look at the game with a brand new trailer.
Much like the rest of the series, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 takes place in a beautiful fantasy-meets-science-fiction world, one that stands out due to sheer scale. The new trailer shows off massive explorable worlds, and towering enemies and flying fortresses. It’s the kind of game that should be a great fit for Switch, where players can get in a bit of exploration wherever they go.
And it won’t be too long before you can venture into the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, either — the game is launching this holiday season.
While most of Nintendo’s announcements at E3 focused on upcoming games for the remainder of this year, the company did give a glimpse at some titles for farther down the line, including a first look at a new Kirby side-scroller.
The new game — currently just called Kirby for now — features Nintendo’s ravenous pink puffball as he goes about his usual repertoire of devouring enemies to assume their abilities and floating through the air. But Kirby for the Switch seems to be built around a new mechanic whereby Kirby can also befriend his enemies instead of eating them, after which they join the player as either computer-controlled or multiplayer allies. Each enemy type seems to have their own moves for when they’re befriended, and in addition to fighting alongside Kirby, allies will be able to join together for powerful team up attacks,
Given the push by Nintendo for local multiplayer on the Switch, it’s easy to imagine that Kirby will presumably feature local cooperative multiplayer using the Joy-Con controllers, although there’s no confirmation of that yet.
Kirby is expected to release for the Switch sometime in 2018.
Vizio has been on a hell of a journey in the past couple of years, from smart TVs, to dumb TVs with tablets for remotes, to a new kind of smart-ish TV in this year's P-Series and M-Series SmartCast lineup. The line of 4K TVs has slightly improved picture quality and more color, but what makes it most interesting is the in-depth rethink of how app-based TV should work.
The M-Series starts out at $699.99 for the M55, a 55-inch 4K "XLED Plus" display. For $2,499.99 you can get the 75-inch version. The P-Series has more LED dimming zones for better contrast ("XLED Pro"), and higher refresh rates — 240Hz compared to 120Hz in the M screens. The 55-inch P55 model is $999.99, and you can go up to 75 inches for $3,499.99. The new lineup is available now online and in stores.
Rocket League is heading to the Switch, as revealed by Nintendo in its E3 Spotlight announcement stream. The popular virtual soccer game took the world by storm over the summer of 2015, when it was first released on PC and PS4, followed by a Xbox One and Mac OS X versions in 2016.
The Rocket League reveal was mixed in with an opening reel of gamers going head-to-head in a variety of competitive games for the Switch, including Arms, Splatoon 2, and Pokkén Tournament DX.
Later on in the presentation, Rocket League developer Psyonix detailed that the Switch port will be released this coming holiday season. Rocket League on the Switch will include some exclusive Nintendo-themed customization items and cars (like a Mario cap), and in a significant bit of news, will feature cross network online multiplayer against other platforms, although details on how that will work and what platforms will be compatible are still rather slim.
Along with the Nintendo exclusive items, Rocket League on the Switch will also include a local wireless multiplayer mode, presumably similar to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. And while no mention was made of split-screen co-op on the Switch, the feature is supported on the Xbox One, PS4, and PC, so it’s possible that it could make its way to the local multiplayer-focused Switch as well.
GM just popped the hood on its small but growing fleet of self-driving Chevy Bolts. The 109-year-old automaker announced today that it has completed production on 130 additional all-electric autonomous vehicles at its Orion assembly plant in Michigan.
This round of Bolts has been fitted with a new version of the self-driving technology that GM has been developing with Cruise Automation, a San Francisco-based autonomous vehicle startup that the company acquired in early 2016. They’ll soon meet up with the 50 Bolts that are using the current Cruise / GM technology to drive the streets of San Francisco; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Detroit.
GM first signaled its interest in self-driving cars back in 2015 when it started testing the tech on a few Chevy Volts. But it wasn’t until the company invested $500 million in Lyft in January 2016 (and the subsequent acquisition of Cruise) that it started talking up an ambitious goal of developing a fleet of for-hire robot vehicles. Since then, the automaker’s been steadily revealing more about the project, including dashboard footage of the first-generation tests.
Apart from a few spy shots, though, this is the first official look GM’s offered of the Bolt’s new kit of sensors. They’re fitted with the usual stuff like LIDAR and cameras, but GM’s not saying much more beyond that.
This is likely far from the last round of self-driving Bolts to be assembled in Michigan — GM reportedly wants to have thousands of them roaming public roads in 2018, and Lyft is gearing up to deploy the autonomous vehicles to its existing ride-sharing system by 2020 or 2021.


Sprint just launched a new promotion that’s a very good deal but also seems like the ultimate Hail Mary throw of desperation. The company is offering an entire year of free service — including unlimited data, talk, and text — to customers who switch to the carrier and bring over an eligible phone. Current postpaid subscribers at Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are eligible for the deal, and it also covers family plans. Here’s the page that explains the offer, and I’m not really seeing any alarming fine print or gotchas. There’s no contract involved. You’ve got to pay a $30 activation fee up front, but that gets refunded within two billing cycles. Also, this is only for new Sprint customers.
But so long as you sign up sometime before June 30th and port over a number from one of Sprint’s main rivals, you get a year’s worth of service that runs through July 31st, 2018. It’s not totally free, mind you. Sprint notes that you’ll have to cover a SIM card and pay taxes and fees each month, and you’ll get hit with other monthly charges if you turn off AutoPay or eBilling. Disabling both AutoPay and eBilling will result in a recurring $7.99 payment each month.
Sprint’s unlimited plan includes:
You must own the phone that you’re bringing to Sprint, as well. So if you’re paying a monthly installment plan, you’re out of luck. Sprint lists the following devices as eligible for the free year of service:
Apple iPhone 5C (Verizon only), iPhone 5S (Verizon only), iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S, Apple iPhone 6S Plus, Apple iPhone 7 (Verizon only), Apple iPhone 7 Plus (Verizon only), Apple iPhone SE
Google Nexus 5 (AT&T and Verizon only), Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Pixel, Pixel XL
Motorola E4, Z2 Play, G4, G4 Play, G4 Plus, G5 Plus, Moto X Pure Edition, Galaxy S7 edge Special Edition, Galaxy S7 Special Edition, Galaxy S8 Special Edition, Samsung Galaxy S8+ Special Edition
I’m guessing that “Special Edition” is Sprint’s weird way of referring to the unlocked US versions of the Galaxy S7 and S8 devices, since those are compatible with the carrier’s network. Just make sure you’ll be happy with whatever phone you currently have for another few months. Sprint says:
After 10/1/17, you can upgrade to a new Sprint phone by leasing or purchasing it in monthly installments - you’ll still enjoy your free year of service. Any upgrades prior to 10/1/17 will require a plan change to Unlimited data, talk and text and you’ll lose the remaining free months in your year of free service.
So if Sprint’s network is serviceable where you are, this might be a thing worth at least investigating to see if a year of potentially very significant savings is worth bailing on whichever carrier you’re with right now. Once the promotional period ends, you’ll pay $60 for a single unlimited line or more depending on your family plan situation.
A group of 30 entertainment companies, including power players like Netflix, HBO, and NBCUniversal, have joined forces today in an effort to fight online piracy. The new group is called the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), and the partnership, while somewhat thin on specifics, will allow the content creators involved to pool resources to conduct research and work closely with law enforcement to find and stop pirates from stealing movies and TV shows.
The first-of-its-kind alliance is composed of digital media players, networks, and Hollywood outfits, and all recognize how the internet has paved the way to an explosion in quality online content. However, piracy has boomed as a result: ACE says that last year saw 5.4 billion downloads of pirated films and TV shows.
"In this golden age of content it's more important than ever that we remain vigilant about copyright protection,” says CBS executive VP Jonathan Anschell in a statement. “For the creative community to truly flourish, it must know that its work will be safe from theft.”
To ensure that, the group will work with organizations like the MPAA in the US and other outfits in Europe to uncover large-scale criminal operations, file litigation, and seek agreements with companies to reduce stealing. Those efforts will combine with the work each company already does to combat piracy online, though it’s not totally clear how much and how quickly this coalition will ramp up the fight and what specific measures against pirates might be taken.
The full list of ACE partners includes: Amazon, AMC Networks, BBC Worldwide, Bell Canada and Bell Media, Canal+ Group, CBS Corporation, Constantin Film, Foxtel, Grupo Globo, HBO, Hulu, Lionsgate, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Millennium Media, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount Pictures, SF Studios, Sky, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Star India, Studio Babelsberg, STX Entertainment, Telemundo, Televisa, Twentieth Century Fox, Univision Communications Inc., Village Roadshow, The Walt Disney Company, and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.
The creation of ACE is a major concerted effort from the entertainment industry against online piracy, and comes months after the failure of the MPAA and RIAA’s “six strikes” initiative. Meanwhile, pirates have gotten particularly brazen lately. Back in April, a pirate named The Dark Overload managed to steal the fifth season of Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black, claiming that shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic, and IFC had also been stolen.
Disclosure: NBCUniversal is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.
Update 12:45pm ET: A previous version of this article stated that ACE would forge agreements with pirates to reduce stealing. That was incorrect. The group will make deals with legitimate companies. The piece has been updated.
Amazon’s Echo is great. It’s a speaker for music, a digital assistant with Amazon’s excellent Alexa voice control, and a useful smart home controller. But why buy an Echo from Amazon when you could build one yourself? Here’s how:
To put together your own Echo, you’ll need a few supplies. The most important thing is a Matrix Creator or Matrix Voice. They’re development platforms that connect to a Raspberry Pi and are designed to help makers test new hardware applications at a low cost. More importantly for us, they feature an eight-microphone array, which is perfect for creating our DIY Alexa. Any microphone will technically work, but the multiple microphone array is the closest you’ll get to Amazon’s own system on a budget.
Next, we’ll need the aforementioned Raspberry Pi. If the Matrix is the ears of our DIY Echo, the Pi is the brains. It’ll supply the processing power to run Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service, the audio output to connect a speaker, and Wi-Fi or Ethernet to connect to Amazon’s servers to get the answers to whatever you ask your Alexa. A Raspberry Pi 3 will have onboard Wi-Fi, but if you have an older one, you’ll need to pick up a USB adapter or plug in via Ethernet. You’ll also need a keyboard, mouse, and display to hook up to your Pi for the setup process.
Optionally, you’ll want a USB battery pack, to allow for your DIY Echo to work away from a wall outlet, a speaker for improved audio output, and some cardboard and tape to make a case.
We’ll be working off the official Alexa GitHub repository’s guide to running the Alexa Voice Service on a Raspberry Pi so you’ll want to follow along here. Additionally, we’ll be using some modifications from Matrix to take advantage of the more advanced mics the Creator or Voice have to offer.
First off, you’ll want to hook up your Raspberry Pi to your screen, keyboard, and mouse, and then plug in your Matrix Creator. Following the guide from the Alexa GitHub, you’ll need to create an Amazon developer account, and register a device — in this case, our Raspberry Pi — with a device and security profile.
Next, you’ll need to install the Amazon Voice Service sample app from the GitHub page.  Once you’ve gotten the installer ready, continue to follow the instructions to input the security profile information from the earlier step, and then begin the installation. Let it run; it’ll take roughly 20–30 minutes to finish.
Once that’s done, flip over to the Matrix guide: you’ll need to configure the Pi to use the Matrix microphones, and install the Matrix software.
Then, all you need to do is follow the final step from the Alexa GitHub guide, and start the three software processes you need to access the Alexa voice service. Unfortunately, you’ll have to do that every time you boot up the Pi to get the Alexa services running. While it is possible to do some more work in the terminal to get all this to launch at startup so the keyboard mouse and screen aren't required every time, that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.
Once that’s up and running, congratulations! You’ll have your very own Echo. But to really finish things off, you’ll want to cut out a tube of cardboard, hook up a battery pack and speaker, disconnect the mouse, screen, and keyboard, and tape everything up together in a roughly cylindrical package for the true faux-Echo experience.
As of today, Verizon is officially the owner of Yahoo. Yahoo’s assets are now being mashed up with those of AOL, which Verizon bought in 2015, into a horribly named new division called Oath. Oath will contain sites like HuffPost, Yahoo Sports, TechCrunch, and Engadget, as well as apps and services like Alto and Brightroll. Tumblr will also fall under the Oath umbrella.
With the deal complete, it’s also being announced that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is departing the combined company. Mayer was an incredible hire by Yahoo when it brought her on as CEO five years ago. She came to the company after spending more than a decade at Google spearheading key products like search and Maps.
Yahoo was obviously a challenge to turn around. And while Mayer didn’t exactly save the company, its share price more than tripled during her tenure. (Although, much of that value may have come from an early Yahoo investment in Alibaba; Verizon isn’t acquiring that investment as part of this deal.)
The Yahoo acquisition has taken a long time to close. Verizon initially made an offer last July, for $4.83 billion in cash. But the deal hit a number of speed bumps after it was revealed that Yahoo had been subject to multiple major data breaches. Verizon decided to stick with Yahoo anyway, ultimately just shaving $350 million off the purchase price.
Like its AOL deal, the Yahoo deal is about turning Verizon into an advertising juggernaut. Not only is it acquiring ad technology from Yahoo, but it’s acquiring another suite of highly visited sites. Combine that with the information Verizon is already able to mine from AOL visitors and its own internet service customers, and the company is able to get an increasingly big picture of what people spend their time doing online. That’ll help it better target ads, especially as companies like Google and Apple begin to cut down on what advertisers are able to get away with online.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration just awarded the Tesla Model X a 5-star safety rating in every category and subcategory after conducting the first independent crash test of the electric vehicle since its launch in 2015. Tesla was quick to trumpet the rating, noting the Model X was the first SUV to receive the federal government’s highest safety rating across the board.
The NHTSA also released this video of the Model X crash test, so we can watch the vehicle crumple like an accordion from multiple angles.
“Model X performs so much better in a crash than gas-powered SUVs because of its all-electric architecture and powertrain design,” Tesla said in a blog post. “The rigid, fortified battery pack that powers Model X is mounted beneath the floor of the vehicle creating a center of gravity so low that Model X has the lowest rollover probability of any SUV on the road. No other SUV has ever come close to meeting and exceeding this rollover requirement.”
That rollover probability is so low, Tesla once claimed its engineers couldn’t even “flip” the Model X during internal crash tests. Rollover is often the main safety problem for SUVs. Tesla claims that Model X owners have a 93 percent probability of walking away from a crash without serious injury.
Indeed, Tesla CEO Elon Musk often tweets out stories about accidents involving Teslas where no injuries were reported.

Tesla has always been bullish about its crash resilience, going so far as to boast that the Model S broke the NHTSA crash test ratings record in 2013. This turned out to be slightly exaggerated, prompting NHTSA to revise its advertising guidelines to forbid automakers from stating that a car received a higher score than what’s possible.
Tesla’s commitment to safety took a hit last year when a Model S owner was killed when his car smashed into a truck. The fatal accident took on new relevance when it was revealed that the Model S was in Autopilot mode, prompting questions about the safety of Tesla’s advanced driver assist system. NHTSA later exonerated Tesla for any involvement in the crash.
Still, the 5-star safety rating for the Model X is certainly an important feather in Elon Musk’s cap, especially as he guides his company into a very crucial year. Next month, Tesla is expected to begin delivery of the Model 3, the company’s first mass-market electric vehicle. And in September, Musk has said he will unveil Tesla’s first stab at an all-electric semi truck.

If you want a truly massive 4K TV in your house — and you have a nearly limitless budget to make it happen — there’s only one option for you: the C Seed 262. This monstrosity comes in at 262 inches, a staggering size that makes a 100-inch TV look tiny in comparison.
It’s hard to overstate how massive the 1,763-pound C Seed 262 is. It comes with 10 integrated speakers for a 9.1 cinema surround sound environment; there is a remote-controlled fabric cover that protects the 19-foot-wide LED screen; and there’s even a built-in 4K media server.
We asked C Seed how much the 262 will cost, and it’s quite a bit. The TV alone will cost $539,000, and if you want it installed (with a “project management package”) that will cost you another $38,500. As my astute colleague Vlad Savov noted, "This TV costs more than a New York apartment, which is apt because it's bigger than a New York apartment."
Given that the company assumes you own a mansion in its press release — it asks you to “enjoy a viewing experience that up to now was simply unavailable outside a private movie theatre in a remote corner of your mansion” — the price isn’t that surprising.
The C Seed 262 is available this summer. Have your assistant look into it.
Arizona-based company World View Enterprises has an ambitious goal: send humans to the upper edges of the atmosphere using high-altitude balloons. It’s a dream that’s still years away from being a reality, so in the meantime, the company is aiming to send something a bit smaller to the edge of space: fried chicken.
Today, World View announced that it will be sending Kentucky Fried Chicken’s new spicy Zinger chicken sandwich to the stratosphere for multiple days. The sandwich’s ride is the Stratollite, the company’s balloon vehicle that acts a bit like a low-hanging satellite — except it doesn’t orbit Earth and you don’t need a rocket to launch it. The Stratollite is essentially a high-altitude balloon designed to leisurely float about 100,000 feet up, while carrying instruments or probes that can provide communications services, for instance, or scan the Earth’s surface. For this flight, the balloon will be holding a chicken sandwich.
The mission may seem like a gimmick, but the point is to test out a significant capability for World View. The Stratollite will stay in the stratosphere for four days — the longest the vehicle has ever flown. Up until now, test flights of the Stratollite have lasted between six and 12 hours. But eventually, the company hopes to keep these vehicles in place for months to a year at a time. So the chicken flight could be a big step toward making even longer duration missions a reality. (There’s no real reason the payload has to be a chicken, of course, but why not? Brands helping brands.)
To stay in the upper atmosphere for extended periods of time, the Stratollites are designed to “surf” the high-altitude winds. The vehicles will use data collected by national weather services and also by its own onboard instruments to determine which direction the upper atmosphere winds are headed. The Stratollite can then shift its altitude to ride these winds and remain in the same general location over the Earth. Such a technique will allow the balloon to fly in a circle that’s about a few miles across.
“Think of it as sailing the stratosphere,” World View CEO Jane Poynter told The Verge in February. “We’re sailing with the winds and take advantage of the fact that these winds are moving in all these different directions.”
This flight will be the first one in which all of the different subsystems of the Stratollite are put to the test. Before the company has tested out parts of the altitude control system, for instance, as well parts of the communications system. Now, they’ll all be working together, along with the solar power technology that will provide power to the vehicle for multiple days. Meanwhile, the Stratollite’s payload will weigh about 100 pounds and will mostly just include the chicken sandwich, along with some other unique items such as “the chicken sandwich flying system that keeps the chicken looking good,” according to Taber MacCallum, founder and CTO of World View. A camera will also be on board, and at some point the sandwich will take a selfie.
After this chicken run, World View eventually hopes its Stratollites can provide the same types of services as satellites for a much lower cost, since they don’t have to launch on multimillion-dollar rockets. Poynter thinks they could be particularly helpful for weather research and advanced evacuation warnings. “If you fly a Stratollite over that area, and you fly the radar pointing down at the ground, you get high fidelity ground wind information,” Poynter said back in February. “So you give them hours and hours of warning, so they can really evacuate and get to safety before a tornado comes barreling through the area.”
World View’s ultimate goal is to send people up with these balloons. This tourism venture — called Voyager — would see paying customers gently float to the upper atmosphere for five to six hours, riding inside a fancy cabin with large windows that can overlook the curvature of the planet. All the amenities you could want will be on board, including a bathroom, a bar, and Wi-Fi — for a steep $75,000 a ticket, which you can already reserve online.
But before all that can happen, the chicken has to fly. The KFC sandwich is set to get off the ground sometime toward the end of the month, with the Stratollite’s launch window opening on June 21st. The vehicle will be taking off from a remote site 40 miles outside of Tucson, Arizona and going somewhere between 60,000 and 80,000 feet up. World View even plans to live stream the mission — the first time the company has ever done a live broadcast. (And sent a KFC sandwich to the edge of space.)
"We’re excited to be the ones pushing spicy, crispy chicken sandwich space travel forward,” said KFC president Kevin Hochman said in a statement.
Update June 13th, 1:00PM ET: This article was updated to include additional information from a press conference.

Franklin Robotics, a Massachusetts-based robotics company with a team that includes the inventor of the Roomba, just launched a Kickstarter campaign for its newest robot. This time it’s not a carpet-cleaning or floor-cleaning bot, but one designed to kill the weeds in your garden.
Called Tertill, the round, 2.5-pound bot uses sensors to identify weeds in a vegetable or flower garden. It then uses a spinning string trimmer to cut off weeds near the ground. But it’s not using any fancy cameras or artificial intelligence to identify weeds. Instead, chief technology officer Joe Jones says, it’s relying on cheap capacitive sensors to determine whether the plants it has brushed up against are tall or short.
“The big problem with weeding is, how do you tell the difference between a weed and a plant that you want to keep?” Jones said in an interview with The Verge. “With a garden, you can recognize the difference between weeds and crops based on size. So anything that’s short enough to go under the robot is considered a weed, and anything taller is considered a plant.” What about short plants that you don’t want Tertill to whack? The solution there is a Tertill-resistant collar you can put around new plants until they’ve grown tall.
It’s a relatively low-tech approach to this kind of land-sweeping robot, and it’s unclear at this point how well it will actually work. The Tertill is also solar-powered, and is supposed to run every day, which its creators say will also help keep weeds from thriving.
But Jones said he hopes the bot will grow smarter over time, and, that if it’s a successful product, he plans to add more features. One feature the team has considered adding is a kind of motion sensor-triggered reaction that would cause the bot to move and help scare pests and rodents away. They might also utilize artificial neural networks to make Tertill smarter. “I used to be quite against neural nets,” Jones said over the phone, “but they’ve won me over.”
Tertill costs $199 on Kickstarter right now, and is expected to ship in March 2018. Jones says that it will likely cost around $300 if and when the Tertill goes into full production.
Most recently, Jones and his team were running Harvest Automation, a robotics company focused on moving potted plants around nurseries and greenhouses. Harvest Automation also developed robots designed to work in e-commerce fulfillment centers.
But Jones’ biggest claim to fame is undoubtedly the Roomba, which Jones is credited for inventing. iRobot first started selling the robot vacuum cleaners in 2002, after years of Jones trying to get the bot off the ground (erm, floor). The company has since sold more than 15 million Roombas.
Jones once told New York magazine that the one thing he’s learned about robots is “they always break your heart. One way or another. What you do is try again.”

Election systems across 39 different states showed traces of attacks by Russian hackers after an examination during last year’s election, according to a new report from Bloomberg. In some cases, the attackers even gained access to state-level voter roll data, compromising records on as many as 90,000 voters.
It’s unclear how much of the government was already aware of those efforts. Last week, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), who attends classified briefings as part of the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested the full scope of Russian involvement in the election had not yet been revealed. "I don't believe they got into changing actual voting outcomes," Warner said in an interview last week. "But the extent of the attacks is much broader than has been reported so far."
The heart of the compromise seems to have been Illinois, which was compromised in late July 2016. According to Bloomberg’s report, attack signatures from the Illinois attack were detected in 37 other states, including critical election managers in Florida and California. Not each of those signature hits necessarily indicates a compromise, but it suggests a broad, concerted effort to compromise US election systems.
There’s still no evidence that the attacks compromised the vote tallies or election results in any state. The closest the attackers came was voter registration databases, which could, in theory, be altered to strategically erase registrations. But the compromises described by Bloomberg only affected state databases rather than the county-level data that’s used by polling places, and the distributed nature of the US election system seems to have prevented them from reaching further. There’s also no indication that any voting machines were compromised.
Still, any election-related compromise is alarming, and many expressed concern to Bloomberg that the lessons learned in the attack could be used to compromise future elections.
The news comes on the heels of a leaked NSA report, which detailed direct attacks on an election contractor in Florida, as well as various online absentee services. The alleged source of that report, an NSA contractor named Reality Leigh Winner, was arrested on federal charges shortly before the report became public.
Instagram is releasing its Archive feature to all users today, after testing it with a smaller group of people last month.
The feature lets anyone on Instagram hide their old posts without deleting them. If you go into the “...” menu on a photo, where you’d normally see options like edit and delete, there’ll now be an option to archive the image placed right on top. Hitting that button will send the photo to a private gallery — your archive — where only you can see it.
Instagram seems to be hoping that the archive will both stop people from deleting their photos and make people more comfortable with sharing certain photos in the first place. Some of its users — and some teenagers, especially — have a habit of deleting pictures that don’t garner enough likes or that feel too personal later on. The archive won’t necessarily stop that behavior, but it’ll at least keep the pictures around for later viewing.
There’s also a way to send photos from the archive back to your profile, where they’ll appear in their original chronological location. Instagram doesn’t notify others of your archiving and unarchiving habits at all, so you’re able to move things in and out as much as you’d like.
When it hits your account, you’ll be able to access the archive from a little rewind-style button in the top right corner of your profile in the app.
Astro launched in March with the goal of cleaning up your inbox using an AI assistant. It’s an interesting, if not perfectly convenient, way of managing overflowing inboxes that’s meant to make life easier for business users in particular. And today, Astro is getting two new features that push its credentials for business users even further: integrations with Slack and Alexa.
The Slack integration is particularly neat. Once Astro has been linked to Slack, any searches will pull up results from both your inbox and your Slack channels. I suspect this could make things very messy, since Slack searches surface conversations you were never even a part of. But I like the idea of integrating an email client with the service that’s supposed to — and in some cases does — kill email.
You won’t be able to reply to Slack messages directly within Astro, but you will be able to tap on search results to jump straight to the conversation in Slack. And you’ll be able to take emails and embed them in new Slack posts, so that you can move a conversation into Slack. Andy Pflaum, Astro’s co-founder and CEO, demoed the integration for me during a meeting earlier this month, and it all seemed to work pretty naturally.
Astro is also bringing its AI assistant, Astrobot, into Slack itself. It’s another way of combining email and Slack, with the bot pinging you occasionally with items that might need your attention. You’ll be able to respond to emails directly within the chat window, without changing over to Astro itself, which is pretty handy.
Unfortunately, there’s one big hiccup that I encountered while trying to test these integrations in a pre-release version of the app: you need administrative permissions in order to hook into a Slack account, and my company doesn’t grant me that level of access. I suspect a whole lot of people will find themselves in this situation, which means that Astro’s smart new integration won’t get used unless you have a very trusting IT team. Or, as Astro is hoping, a company that chooses to widely adopt its software.
The Alexa integration, on the other hand, should be entirely doable on your own. (Assuming, at least, that you aren’t trying to hijack someone else’s Echo.) Once it’s set up, you’ll be able to ask Alexa to read your recent emails and even respond to them with quick replies. The system can be locked up with a PIN code, so that other people can’t access your inbox just by asking.
Pflaum wouldn’t disclose how many users Astro has gained since its launch a few months back, but he says that the company is “very pleased and confident” so far. He also says that Astro plans to continue adding new integrations, mostly focused on the needs of business users — so think basics like calendars, but also specialized apps like Salesforce CRM. A Windows app is in the works, too; Astro is already on Android, iOS, and macOS.
Everything that’s currently in the app will remain free, but Pflaum says Astro will eventually begin charging people and organizations for “more advanced versions, especially around ways that teams can collaborate and share information.” I suspect Astro and its AI bot will have to get a lot more advanced, proactive, and just generally helpful before big organizations consider paying to use them. But for now, the free version is a unique alternative for anyone in desperate need of help sorting through their inbox.
Microsoft first announced OneDrive Files On-Demand at Build last month, and now Windows 10 testers can try out the feature today. Thurrott.com reports that Windows Insiders on the Fast Ring running Windows 10 build 16215 can now download and install a new OneDrive update, which enables the new Files On-Demand. The new feature allows you to download files as you use them, rather than sync entire folders down to a device and waste space.
It’s almost identical to the placeholders feature OneDrive used to have in Windows 8.1 before it was cut from Windows 10, and Files On-Demand is actually improved with a better status symbol in File Explorer that shows you which files and folders are synced for offline usage. A green checkmark indicates that items are synced to a device, a solid green checkmark shows files you manually sync for offline use, and an empty cloud icon shows that files are in the cloud and not stored on the device. All apps across Windows 10 will be able to access synced OneDrive files in this way as the desktop client stores them directly in the OneDrive folder.
Microsoft is planning to release OneDrive Files On-Demand with its Windows 10 Fall Creators Update later this year, bringing back the placeholders feature that has been sorely missing in Windows 10.
Microsoft’s big reveal this week of the Xbox One X, the high end of its Xbox line and a competitor to Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro, has set the stage for a new conversation about the future of the console industry. This debate isn’t simply about comparing the two devices, deeming one superior, and predicting which will win out. It’s also about the very nature and purpose of a game console in 2017.
We heard a lot about the Xbox One X being “the most powerful console” ever created, and Microsoft dropped frame rate and memory metrics and the phrase “4K” to hammer home the point that it’s built a more capable piece of hardware. But absent from the conversation was Windows 10, arguably Microsoft’s one key advantage that Sony will never be able to replicate.
By not trying to explicitly tie the Xbox to Windows 10, as some rumor watchers predicted the company might try, Microsoft ended up recommitting itself to the idea that PCs and consoles should stay separate — at least for now. In many ways, it feels like Microsoft introduced a stopgap device, indicating that the Xbox’s core identity still remains somewhat in flux as the company figures out how to best merge the idea of a console with that of a PC.
It helps to imagine a starkly different press conference, one in which Microsoft abandoned the idea of a standalone game console as we know it and unveiled a new, unified platform. This theoretical device would have married the best of the PC — upgradability, universal cross-platform play, and premium performance — with the benefits of a console, which lets developers better optimize software around known hardware standards and offers customers plug-and-play accessibility. This new device could have been called the Xbox 10 S, to indicate it runs on the new lightweight Windows 10 S that Microsoft announced back in May.
As my colleague Chris Plante pointed out last week, a console like that would help Microsoft finally realize its dream of an all-in-one entertainment machine — a dream it’s been toying with since Windows Media Center in the early aughts. It would be capable of playing games at the performance level of a gaming PC while also serving as the media hub of the living room. It could incorporate voice and motion control by resurrecting the Kinect and a hands-free digital assistant by tacking on Cortana. It could let you browse the web and download games with optional mice and keyboard input and, best of all, play every possible game regardless of which platform it was primarily developed for.
It would be the dream machine for many: a true living room PC that at last erodes the division between the console space and the Windows ecosystem. Arguments around exclusive titles, developer support, and even price would all be rendered moot if Microsoft could achieve what Valve, with its Steam machine philosophy, couldn’t — all in a package far cheaper than your standard gaming PC. It wouldn’t matter how large Sony’s install base is if Microsoft were able to redefine the entire idea of a game console.
But Microsoft didn’t do any of that. In fact, it followed Sony almost to the tee, save the Xbox One X’s power boost over the PS4 Pro and the requisite $100 higher price tag. The One X is, simply put, a more graphically capable Xbox. It doesn’t run any special software or bridge the console and the PC any better than before. It just plays Xbox One games better than before, so long as you have a 4K TV capable of HDR. (In some cases, Microsoft says the console will deliver performance and resolution benefits even on 1080p sets, thanks to techniques like supersampling). It’s perplexing, because it means Microsoft is yet again competing with cheaper PlayStation hardware while also trying to sell gamers on an experience that remains inferior to a desktop.
There are a few reasons why Microsoft may have felt compelled to take this route, instead of trying (and potentially miserably failing) to make a living room PC. The dream machine I described above sounds fantastic, but it’s also unrealistic.
For one, Microsoft might have trouble convincing gamers to use an Xbox running Windows so long as Steam exists as the primary distribution platform for PC titles. The company could try sidestepping Valve and urging developers to use the Universal Windows App architecture for any and all games in the future. That way, games could be distributed through both Steam and the Windows Store, ensuring they’re playable on every PC and the Xbox One X. However, it’s unlikely Microsoft could convince developers and consumers to abandon Steam or prioritize another platform over it. Big game publishers have tried and failed at that, EA with Origin and Ubisoft with UPlay most prominently.
Another big issue would involve the splitting of its player base. As it stands now, developers will be able to optimize for the Xbox One X if they so choose, but no game will ever be released exclusively for that pricier product. At this point, Microsoft is saying that every Xbox game released from now until the next big generational leap (if one ever comes) will play across the entire Xbox family, and that’s the only way Microsoft and Sony have been able to get away with selling these mid-generation console updates.
Had Microsoft decided to turn Project Scorpio into a Windows machine, it would have risked irreversibly splitting its user base. In that scenario, some games could conceivably be developed to run only on Windows, with developers knowing that Scorpio games could be downloaded via the Windows Store. Going even further, whole feature sets, accessories, and platform perks would have to developed and geared toward the subset of Microsoft customers who buy into the new vision. The idea that, just four years into a console generation, players would feel forced into buying a new device to stay current would likely not sit well, especially not with a community just now forgetting the Xbox One launch debacle of 2013.
The truth is that it seems we’re not quite ready for a do-everything gaming device. The industry is bifurcated between PC and console for a reason: some people want the ease of a TV, couch, and controller, while others are willing to pay extra for performance and more hardware freedom. Not to mention that Microsoft would be effectively bowing out of the console race had it decided to try and change that equation. It appears much safer for the company to steadily build its bridge — with cross play, “play anywhere,” and the Windows 10 Xbox app — rather than take a radical jump off the cliff.
The silver lining here is that it’s clear where Microsoft is headed. Xbox chief Phil Spencer sits on the Windows 10 board for a reason. Every year at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the company makes an effort to show just how much work it’s putting into joining its console with its pervasive desktop OS. So it’s only a matter of time before Microsoft makes the leap and the division between console and a computer falls away.
Maybe it will happen with the next generational leap. The Xbox Two, or whatever silly name Microsoft ends up tacking on, could be the true living room PC we’ve all been waiting for. It could perhaps even be modular and upgradable, ending the need for generational console updates for good. But that’s years away. Right now, we have to settle for faster GPUs and more teraflops packed into the same familiar boxes. It’s far from a dream machine, but it’s good enough for now.

You learn a lot about movie protagonists from the first choice they make in a story. Films have to convey most of their characterization through dialogue and action, and the early choices are the ones that define a character’s identity. Consider the first decisions made by Nick Morton, Tom Cruise’s hapless antihero character in the misbegotten Universal Studios franchise-launcher The Mummy. The movie starts with him going AWOL from the Army to loot an ancient tomb. He nearly gets himself and a buddy killed with his lack of planning and basic observational skills. Out of sheer impatience, he deliberately vandalizes the protections around an ancient sarcophagus. And in the process, he unleashes the monstrous undead princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), kicking the plot into motion. Before the first act is over, he’s established himself as a reckless, greedy, amoral ass.
Nick has a redemption arc coming, so this setup gives him plenty of room for character improvement. But the script doesn’t do much to justify or underline that arc, beyond throwing in one line about the good man inside him, “fighting to get out.” His ultimate act of altruism is muddled by sloppy storytelling, and the lead-up is vague and lazy. His character is only really convincing — and entertaining — in the early going, when he’s an unalloyed bastard. And the story so clearly leads in a direction where that bastardry could have been fully realized, in a way that would have given the film some real narrative power. Both as a standalone film and as a platform for Universal Studios’ planned Dark Universe series of monster movies, The Mummy would have been more effective if it had fully embraced that introductory scene, and let Nick Morton become the story’s villain.
Nick certainly has the opportunity to choose Team Evil. When he awakens Ahmanet, she identifies him as her “chosen one,” and sets out to sacrifice him with a magical dagger to incarnate the Egyptian god Set into his body. She tells Nick this will make him immortal and all-powerful, so they can be together forever. He isn’t down for this plan, with good reason — Ahmanet initially doesn’t offer him a choice, and he justifiably doesn’t trust an angry mummy trying to slice him open. He also doesn’t believe in the supernatural, until Ahmanet takes up psychic residence in his skull. It takes him some time to come to terms with what’s happening to him, and that time is mostly spent running from reanimated corpses and learning about the secret monster-fighting organization Prodigium.
But over time, Ahmanet’s offer starts to look better. She’s seductive, powerful, and entirely focused on elevating Nick to godhood. Prodigium, on the other hand, is a cold and merciless organization that plans to execute Nick because they can’t break his magical ties to Ahmanet. Prodigium representative Dr. Jekyll (Russell Crowe) is utterly unsympathetic about Nick’s situation — as he should be, since Nick brought it on himself through careless, selfish greed. But given the choice between ignominious death at Jekyll’s hands in a souvenir-packed warehouse somewhere, and a symbolic death that gives him ultimate power, Nick’s choice should be fairly clear.
Nick’s lust for wealth, his well-established tendency to charge wildly forward instead of thinking things through, and his blatant amorality all amount to a perfect setup for a twist where he does embrace Ahmanet’s plan, and chooses to become a god. His sympathy for Ahmanet is well-established in the movie, and so is his distrust for Prodigium, which tortures her and plans to vivisect her. His only emotional tie to the organization is through member Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), who’s set up as his love interest. And yet ultimately, he selflessly stabs himself with the magic dagger in order to get Set’s power — solely so he can save Jenny’s life.
None of this action is particularly well foreshadowed or choreographed. Nick’s relationship with Jenny mostly consists of her scolding him, including informing his Army buddies that he’s a lousy lay and a premature ejaculator. Before the film even starts, Nick hooks up with Jenny, apparently so he can steal her map to Ahmanet’s tomb while she sleeps. (Again, he’s a bastard.) But the writers take it for granted that his abrupt third-act feelings for her will read as sincere and life-affirming, and his sudden choice to die for her sake will come across as an honest moment of redemption. It doesn’t, both because their on-screen relationship is so thin, and because his selfish aspects are so much better established than his altruistic ones.
And it doesn’t help that the film ends with a fuzzy, hand-waving monologue about Nick’s status. Nick clearly ended up with at least some of Set’s power, but isn’t fully a god — maybe because Ahmanet didn’t do her full sacrificial ritual? Or because he chose selflessly? Or because he shrugs off the will of an immortal god by thinking good-guy thoughts? It’s manifestly unclear, and so are his future intentions. An ending voiceover from Jekyll and Jenny suggests he’s become some kind of wandering hero who might show up to save their bacon later in the franchise, but the writers leave it all undefined and unsatisfying. Presumably it’s a dangling hook for later films in the series, but with no idea what Nick can do or who he’s become, the promise of his return isn’t particularly exciting.
But consider how the story could have gone if the avaricious, rash, self-absorbed rogue of the opening scenes actually chose to throw in with the beautiful immortal who’s offering him godhood. Impulsively choosing eternal life and boundless power would be more in keeping with Nick’s established character. It’d be more in keeping with what he’s seen of his available options. And it’d be more appropriate to the film’s themes, which suggest that power corrupts, and that the world is defined by the eternal struggle between humanity and the monsters lurking around its edges. It’d even fit with the plot of the 1932 version of The Mummy, the one Universal is drawing on here — in that film, the mummy’s chosen consort does voluntarily join him for power, immortality, and love, and only reneges on the deal when she gets frightened by the grotesque mechanics of the death she’ll have to endure to claim her godhood.
Besides, if Nick consciously chose to embrace evil, and become The Mummy’s ultimate villain, that would be a stronger, sharper ending for a film that goes soft and sentimental in its final act. Any time Cruise steps away from his squeaky-clean screen image, it comes as a surprise, and has a significant impact on longtime moviegoers. His creepiest characters (as a contract killer in Collateral, say, or a screaming blowhard boss in Tropic Thunder, or the creepy motivational speaker in Magnolia) always draw significant attention and interest. A full-blown Cruise villain would have established the Dark Universe as a series to watch for daring, unpredictable choices.
Heroic sacrifices of the type seen here, on the other hand, are so common in films that The Mummy’s screenwriters apparently didn’t feel they needed to justify this one. It’s taken as a matter of course that Nick’s noble side will beat his greedy side, so the script barely bothers to set up any sense of internal conflict for him, or to build a compelling relationship between him and Jenny. Given that she’s hardly even a character, the film never feels like it has emotional or personal stakes on the level necessary to build emotional impact around her survival.
But if she and Prodigium had to face a reincarnated god together — especially a reincarnated god they had multiple opportunities to stop earlier — those stakes would suddenly seem intense and personal. And the ensuing battle might give Prodigium time to redeem and recenter itself, which it desperately needs if the Dark Universe is meant to draw on the group again. Since The Mummy is more about Nick than Prodigium, the organization doesn’t come across as a compelling element that can wind through many films. It looks incompetent and disorganized, a sloppy containment system led by a part-time madman who can’t even reliably contain himself. The group has one job in this film — restraining a dangerous mummy — and it fails badly. Rallying the group to fight Set / Nick at the end of the film would have put the focus back on what the group does well, and show why its adventures through other Dark Universe films might be worth watching.
A climactic face-off between Set / Nick and Jenny would also be a fitting conclusion for the fights she’s been having with him through the entire film, where she represents research, knowledge, and attention to detail, and he represents the forces of self-serving chaos. If she and Jekyll had been given the chance to step up in the final battle, they might have been able to establish themselves as ongoing heroes, worth a franchise’s attention. Instead, Jekyll largely disappears and Jenny becomes a damsel in distress, gasping for rescue again and again. The film ends with only one real hero left — Nick, sort of, since it’s now so unclear what he is or what he wants — and without any statement of purpose for Prodigium or the franchise to come.
And finally, if Jekyll, Jenny, and the forces of Prodigium weren’t initially able to destroy Nick — if they faced down Ahmanet, but couldn’t contain her more powerful consort — Universal Studios’ Dark Universe franchise might have the ongoing villain it needs more than anything. One of the greatest flaws of modern superhero movies is their tendency to kill off their villains at the end of the story, robbing franchises of the chance to build ongoing rivalries between heroes and their nemeses. Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become a fan-favorite character for a number of reasons: Tom Hiddleston and the writers behind him have made the character funny, scary, and sexy, with a compelling arrogance and impressive powers. But he also draws fans because he’s lasted long enough to become a complicated character, with his own redemption arc, and his own well-established internal struggles. That kind of longevity and depth are incredibly, frustratingly rare for villains in franchise films. The Mummy had the chance to embrace it, and instead discarded it.
The good news is, it’s not necessarily too late for any of this. Nick’s link with Set is so poorly explained at the end of The Mummy that his character could potentially go anywhere. Prodigium still needs redemption. The Dark Universe still needs a meaningful throughline, assuming The Mummy’s dramatic box office failure doesn’t torpedo the entire series. There’s certainly the question of whether Cruise would want to return to a franchise that’s been heavily critically panned and rejected by audiences in its maiden voyage. And Cruise’s preference for playing rakish, overmatched, but enduring good guys is well-established; he might veto any plot that takes him in a dark direction. So it’s possible the Dark Universe might not get him back at all, let alone for an out-of-character villain turn. But if Cruise declines a second Dark Universe outing, a monstrous god-Nick would certainly be easier to create with special effects than a heroic human Nick.
But the bad news is, it’s too late for The Mummy itself. A story that might have been about different ways of approaching the darkness is instead a half-hearted story about an antihero more or less accidentally finding his better nature. An attempt to set up a world-spanning fight against evil is instead a story about an organization so badly managed that one mind-controlling spider can take it apart. And what was meant as a triumphant reclamation of a film studio’s history has turned into a giant question mark about whether the whole endeavor is worth the effort. As a hero, Cruise can’t save the day in this case. As the villain, he might have managed it.

Razer is branching out its line of gaming headsets to consoles with its new Thresher Ultimate headphones for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
The Thresher Ultimate come in separate versions for Microsoft’s and Sony’s consoles, with the PS4 version featuring blue highlights while the Xbox model is decked out in green. Both connect over 2.4GHz wireless, instead of Bluetooth, and offer a range of about 150 feet with direct line of site or around 60 to 70 feet if there are obstructions in the way. Either way, you’re probably good for getting sound from your couch, unless you’ve got a really large living room.
From a design perspective, Razer put a focus on comfort. The Thresher Ultimate feature a double headband design, allowing the headphones to offer both a durable aluminum band as well as a softer padded cushion. And in a nice touch, the ear cushions have indentations to make them more comfortable for users with glasses, in a first for Razer’s over-ear headphones.
Like Razer’s Man O’ War headphones, the Thresher Ultimate feature a retractable microphone for when you’d like to communicate / trash talk during online play, and the headphones offer both volume and microphone controllers directly on the bottom of the ear cups.
The Thresher Ultimate headphones will cost $250 when they ship later in June.
John Mulaney and Nick Kroll’s Oh, Hello on Broadway, a two-man show that was once on Broadway, is now available to stream on Netflix.
The show originated Off-Broadway in December 2015, then moved to a road tour, and eventually Broadway’s Lyceum Theater, where it received positive critical attention and ran from October 2016 to January 2017. The characters originally became popular as a Comedy Central bit called “Too Much Tuna,” which was a recurring feature on The Kroll Show. The Oh, Hello guys also grew in popularity following an appearance on the IFC show Comedy Bang! Bang! with The Lonely Island.
Both Mulaney and Kroll have debuted solo standup specials on the platform in the past, and they’re working together on the animated Netflix series Big Mouth, due out later this year. This special, recorded at New York’s 92nd Street Y, is directed by Michael John Warren, who is best known for music documentaries about Jay Z, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and others, as well as a handful of live Broadway recordings including Shrek the Musical and the 2008 revival of Rent.
"Oh Hello on Broadway" is now on Netflix. Its a full Broadway play with special guest @SteveMartinToGo. Its great. pic.twitter.com/nZPf9EAtuD
In Oh, Hello, Mulaney plays George St. Geegland and Kroll plays Gil Faizon, a pair of rude, elderly friends who met while dodging the Vietnam draft in Toronto. I haven’t seen it but I believe there are some catch phrases, such as “too much tuna.”
Anyway, you can stream it now!
Microsoft’s new Windows 10 S operating system is designed to just run Windows Store apps, but that’s probably going to be a problem for most Windows users. If you’ve just purchased a Surface Laptop, or you’re considering a range of Windows 10 S computers, then it’s simple to upgrade to the full Windows 10 Pro version. The upgrade will be free until the end of the year for any Windows 10 S computer priced at $799 or above, and for schools and accessibility users. If you don’t fit into that criteria then it’s a $49 upgrade fee, processed through the Windows Store. Here’s how to upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro.
When you first download an app outside the Windows Store and attempt to install it on a Windows 10 S PC you’ll see a dialogue box that explains the restricted OS, and offers you a way out. Microsoft plans to customize this per app in the future, and in cases where the desktop app is actually listed in the Windows Store it will offer the opportunity to download the app from there. Right now, the only difference you’ll see between the dialogue boxes is if you attempt to install another browser as Microsoft tempts you back to its Edge browser instead.
At the bottom of the dialogue box, follow the “see how” link where it says “Still want to install apps from outside the Store?” This link will open the Windows Store to a new page that offers to switch to Windows 10 Pro, and offers a comparison between 10 S and 10 Pro. If you need to pay the $49 fee you can proceed, otherwise you’ll see a free upgrade button. Be warned: this switch process is irreversible, so once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 Pro you can’t switch back to Windows 10 S, even if you reset the PC. You can also enter your own Windows 10 Pro key manually if you want to avoid the $49 fee, or simply proceed by clicking the upgrade button.
Windows 10 will then ask if you’ve saved all your files, and then prepare to switch the PC over to Windows 10 Pro. This switch takes less than a minute and then the system will reboot and you’ll be immediately converted to Windows 10 Pro. All apps and settings will remain, and a notification will inform you the switch has been successful. At this point you can proceed to install regular Windows desktop apps from outside the Windows Store just like any other regular Windows 10 PC.

Microsoft’s press conference at this year’s E3 was always going to be the early highlight of the show. Going in, we knew the company was planning on unveiling the final consumer version of Project Scorpio alongside a slate of new games and other announcements. Right away, Microsoft gave us a name, Xbox One X, alongside pricing ($499) and a release date (November 7th).
That alone was enough to satisfy a torrent of news headlines and first reactions, and Microsoft followed it up by packing quite a bit of news into its two-hour presentation. Some of it bodes well for the Xbox’s ongoing comeback, while other announcements seem to further put the platform at risk as it struggles to keep pace with Sony and the more successful PlayStation 4 consoles. It’s far too early to declare which company “won” E3 this year. But we can certainly break down Microsoft’s biggest announcements by whether they help or hurt its platform. Let’s start with the positives.
Microsoft was quick to point out that the Xbox One X will be the world’s “most powerful game console.” The company isn’t exaggerating. Packing a 6-teraflop GPU and 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, Microsoft has bested Sony in the hardware department in a big way.
The company claims that Xbox games will now be able to take advantage of HDR lighting effects and native 4K resolution along with a slew of other performance upgrades that aren’t dependent on your TV hardware, like higher frame rates and supersampling for 1080p TVs. Only tentpole first-party releases, like Forza Motorsport 7, will likely be optimized for native 4K at 60 fps, but Microsoft says any developer that wants to take advantage of the extra firepower in the Xbox One X will able to do so either prior to their game’s launch or with a post-launch patch.
Some players may not be able to tell the difference between a game running on the Xbox One X versus the PS4 Pro. But for the first time in years, Microsoft is able to flip the script on Sony, which arguably took its early and continued lead in the console market by beating the Xbox One on both price and graphical performance.
This is a big deal for consumers who want only the best and don’t care that much about how much it costs or the fact that you’ll need a 4K TV to make the most of the visual experience. Microsoft seems hopeful that being able to tout its hardware as the best in the industry will be enough to win over an important and influential contingent of consumers.
After a roughly two-year quiet period, Crackdown 3 got spotlighted during Microsoft’s E3 press conference with a gameplay trailer and a release date. The game, due out on November 7th, will feature the same set of genetically enhanced supersoldiers policing a futuristic city of criminals. Plus, former NFL player and all-around likeable and amped up internet personality Terry Crews was also trotted out in the video to promote the game and lend his signature voice acting skills.
Sure, we don’t know whether any of Crackdown 3’s original promises of total city destruction will hold true. Microsoft has already confirmed that the game’s single-player mode won’t feature the seemingly revolutionary destructible environments that cloud computing platform Azure is supposed to provide. But it’s refreshing to see the game resurface at long last, and with the wildly fun and absurd heart of the Crackdown series seemingly intact.
Backwards compatibility is Microsoft’s go-to gotcha card when it wants to gin up support with fans and really stick it to the Sony diehards. Because the PS4 is incapable of playing older games with software emulation — and Sony doesn’t want to invest like Microsoft has — the Xbox platform is the best way to play games from back in the day like Skate 3 and Red Dead Redemption.
At its E3 press conference, Microsoft took another victory lap in the backwards compatibility department by announcing support for some original Xbox games. The company didn’t tease a ton of titles — in fact, it just showed arcade flight game Crimson Skies — but we can assume there will be other big-name exclusive Xbox titles coming back from the dead. Personally, games like Fable, Elder, Scrolls III: Morrowind, and Psychonauts would be enough to sell me on the feature.
E3 is supposed to be the one time of the year that game companies pull out all the stops to convince consumers that the next year will be loaded with flashy blockbusters. For Microsoft Studios, the company’s in-house game development arm, that has traditionally meant announcing exclusive games that are supposed to make the Xbox a more enticing platform, especially in the face of an increasingly formidable lineup of PlayStation-only titles in recent months.
As far as new big budget announcements, all fans received during yesterday’s press conference was an official reveal of Forza Motorsport 7, a game pretty much everyone knew was coming. Microsoft didn’t tease the next Halo, which could have been an easy win. This isn’t to say Microsoft arrived empty handed. The company championed multi-platform titles like Anthem; first-party games we already knew were coming, like Crackdown 3; and a whole suite of mid-budget and indie games, including Cuphead and Tacoma.
Microsoft wanted to focus on the variety of games it has to offer. It did, except the big, bold exclusives felt noticeable absent. That’s not a great look if Microsoft wants to chip away at Sony’s lead.
The Xbox One X may be Microsoft’s ticket to winning back the enthusiast market it lost when it fumbled its original launch in 2013. But the tricky truth is that resolution and frame rate metrics (and even a 4K UHD Blu-ray player) aren’t enough to sell a majority of consumers on a pricier console. To those not steeped in rain drop physics and dynamic lighting effects, 4K doesn’t mean all that much, especially when you don’t have a proper TV. Even Sony has had trouble justifying the existence of its $100 cheaper PS4 Pro, given how inconsistent the lineup of supported software titles is six months post-launch.
In a way, the launch of the Xbox One X at $499 puts Microsoft right back in its original predicament of offering a new home console and charging more than its primary competitor, all for features the mainstream gaming community may not want, at least right now. Of course, better graphics and performance sounds, on paper, far more valuable that the Kinect was back in 2013, when it was bundled with the original Xbox One. Yet Microsoft has handed Sony a potential victory: a console priced higher than the PS4 Pro. Price was arguably what set the Xbox One back at launch, and there’s a real chance it will do the same again with Xbox One X.
Eero kicked off an arms race of router innovation when it launched the first mesh Wi-Fi system last year. It seems like everyone is making mesh Wi-Fi systems now: Google has one. Samsung has one. There are new mesh startups like Plume and Lumo. Established players like Netgear and Linksys are in the game, one-upping each other with specs and features because one-upping each other with specs and features is their fundamental purpose on this planet.
But Eero is still the standout — a modern hardware startup that arrived with such a fundamentally good idea about how to reinvent an unloved product that it kicked off a wave of change. Eero is out today with updated products that introduce a new wireless standard for smart homes and a new $10-per-month Eero Plus service that adds network security monitoring and improved parental controls. The new base Eero system is now a $299 two-device bundle of a second-gen Eero base station and a new smaller Eero Beacon. Systems range up to a $499 Eero Pro package of three base stations. Combined, it all forms the beginnings of what Eero calls an “operating system for the home.”
But hold up: one of the biggest stories in tech is that very few promising startups get big before being swallowed by what Walt Mossberg has called “the oligarchy”: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. Other standout companies with similar ambitions to rethink the home have all been gobbled and hobbled over the past few years: Nest and Dropcam were acquired by Google, while Samsung snagged SmartThings. And Eero’s all-white design, set-it-and-forget-it simplicity, and consumer-friendly marketing have certainly led a few people to suggest that Apple should eventually snap it up.
All of this adds up to a very hard question: can Eero succeed in creating a new kind of ecosystem while facing down waves of competition and the inevitable pull to sell out?
Eero announced itself in 2015 after CEO Nick Weaver spent time working at Menlo Ventures investing in companies like Dropcam and Roku. Both companies struggled with bad connectivity in the home. “It drove a lot of their customer complaints,” says Weaver. “So we kept looking for an investment [in Wi-Fi], and couldn’t find it.”
Weaver left Menlo and started Eero with two co-founders in late 2014. The first office was his living room. Hardware and software development took two years, marked by  lengthy delays for preorder customers and investments by First Round, Menlo, and Andy Rubin’s Playground Global, among others. The first Eero units shipped in early 2016, and received enthusiastic reviews.
Weaver makes it a point to highlight the technical breakthroughs behind Eero.
“We’re making the radios do things they aren’t designed to do,” says Weaver. The first-gen Eeros have a pair of Qualcomm Wi-Fi radios used by several other companies, but Eero built custom drivers for them. “Most of these radios are designed to make one connection. When an Eero comes up it’s forming links between as many other Eeros as possible.”
Other mesh Wi-Fi systems like Netgear’s Orbi system have a third radio that’s dedicated to a backhaul connection between base stations, and in reviews and tests they’ve been consistently faster than the first-gen Eero. The new second-gen Eeros have three radios, but the smaller Beacon extenders are still dual-band, and Weaver insists that being able to move client and backhaul traffic around each radio at will is ultimately a more powerful approach.
“When you reserve one radio for just mesh that means you aren’t writing great software,” he says. “We’re the only product on the market that can scale out to any number of devices.” Cheekily, when the company released a major software update with new radio driver code, it renamed its system TrueMesh to highlight the difference.
Every Eero network connects up to Eero’s cloud service, which constantly gathers data about how the systems are performing and what devices are on the network in order to optimize performance. “Every time Apple or Xbox or Sonos pushes a software update it slightly changes how the devices work and interact with the network,” says Weaver. “We're constantly looking at how quickly devices get IP addresses, how well they roam, all these things that change. And we use software updates as a way of improving device performance — we've done a bunch of stuff to make sure, say, Sonos works properly with Eero. Basically, we're running the world's largest interoperability study.”
Being responsible for every connection in customers’ homes was initially much more pressure than the company realized, Weaver says. “Devices like smart thermostats and speakers are crashing and restarting more frequently than you think. Most of time you don’t notice, because you’re not using them. But when you’re supposed to be rock-solid infrastructure, that’s a huge amount of responsibility. We ended up revamping a lot of the core algorithms and core tech for how Eeros communicate with each other.”
Eero says it’s pushed more than 30 software updates since the product launched last year. That’s a furious rate of change for any hardware product, let alone a Wi-Fi router, which most people never update even once.
Weaver tells me Eero has no plans to look at network data beyond performance. “We don’t collect data about where you go on the internet — that’s not interesting,” he says. “We sell a premium product, and soon a service. We’re not running ads, and we’re not doing any commerce. The data is just so we can rapidly improve the software.”
Weaver says the $10 / month or $100 / year Eero Plus service will get features added to it over time, comparing it to Amazon Prime. It’ll roll out with more robust parental controls and network security that blocks malicious websites and protects against botnets. “We’ve fingerprinted 5 to 10 million devices at this point,” says Weaver. “We're getting really good at understanding which devices are behaving normally and which ones are behaving abnormally.” Misbehaving devices will get flagged, and users will get regular security reports.
All of that is nice, but the competing Luma mesh Wi-Fi system offers both parental controls and network monitoring for free. The Google Wifi mesh system has cheaper per-base hardware costs, and it’s not like Google can’t find reasons to start aggressively collecting network data to build services around it.
Ultimately Eero’s going to need to pump up the value equation of Eero Plus by adding more features to justify the monthly service fee. And that could go a lot of ways, from additional privacy services like built-in VPNs and anonymous browsing to bigger ideas like opening up space for third-party apps to run on Eero networks, which Weaver says “would be pretty interesting.”
The new Eeros also support the Thread wireless standard, which may or may not be a huge deal in the future. Thread is a long, long story. It’s a low-power wireless standard designed for smart home devices like locks and light switches that claims to fix the complexity of Bluetooth and weirdness of older standards like Z-Wave. It was originally developed by Nest, and somewhat lost inside the drama that unfolded with Nest’s acquisition by Google and subsequent acquisition of Dropcam. Google shipped a Thread-compatible chip in the Google OnHub router, but it was never enabled, and there’s no Thread hardware in the newer Google Wifi mesh networking system. And there aren’t any fully Thread-compatible smart home devices out there that I’m aware of.
But Thread is also a mesh networking system, and having Eero also connect to lower-power devices like sensors and light switches means that you don’t need unsightly and complicated hubs between your smart home gadgets and your network. “There’s a really healthy pipeline of [Thread] devices that have been ready for a long time,” says Weaver. “Everyone has been waiting for a Thread border router so they don’t have to do a $50 loss leader hub with every product they ship.”
“Others have made this promise and it never came to fruition,” he adds. “Thread runs in the 2.4GHz spectrum like Wi-Fi, and there’s a lot of coexistence work you have to do to make sure you can maintain a 2.4GHz connection to a Wi-Fi device while maintaining connectivity to a Thread device.” Client devices like phones can manage having both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in the 2.4GHz spectrum by rapidly turning those radios on and off in millisecond bursts, but that’s not a workable solution for a router, which has to handle multiple Wi-Fi connections at once.
Basically, Weaver says Eero has been able to figure out how to do something no one else has ever figured out how to do with Thread. Not Nest, which invented Thread but failed to ship a rumored Thread hub codenamed Flintstone for years, and not Google, which stuck a Thread chip in its OnHub Wi-Fi router but never enabled it. The newer Google Wifi mesh system doesn’t have Thread support at all.
“The reason [the OnHub chips] haven’t been turned on is coexistence,” says Weaver. “That’s not something you can just do in software. You have to do it in hardware.”
Existing Eero customers can add Thread support to their networks by adding or swapping in a second-gen Eero or Beacon unit. And Weaver says a wave of marketing will come when there are a few Thread devices on the market. If it all works, you’ll be able to add smart home components to your network as easily as any other Wi-Fi device — and Eero will have the simplest solution for making sure all those connections are stable and optimized.
There’s also a huge marketing push coming alongside the new Eero products, with big displays in Best Buy, a major ad campaign, and retail availability in Walmart and Target. But while Eero certainly has the mindshare and attention of the industry, it still has a long way to go in terms of sales. The company won’t give me exact sales numbers, but Weaver says he’ll call me when there are a million homes with Eero systems in them.
So: a hot VC-backed hardware startup solving thorny technical problems with a cool product customers love that’s just about to take the next step in terms of sales and marketing. I keep asking: can Eero go it alone, or will it inevitably sell out to the giants like so many other companies?
“No,” says Weaver. “We’re trying to build a real standalone company here.”
“There is not one single home that has all Apple devices or all Google devices or all Amazon devices,” he adds. “We have an opportunity to be an unbiased piece of infrastructure that runs every part of connectivity in every part of the home that's not tied to one specific ecosystem. That's a huge opportunity.”
I bring up Nest, which sold to Google for $3.2 billion but then stagnated before releasing a new camera last month. Would that kind of offer do it? “That was probably one of the most spectacular technology M&A outcomes we've ever seen,” says Weaver. “You get to a situation like that and you've got a responsibility to your board and your shareholders to evaluate offers.” He brings up Instagram, which continues to be innovative and beloved by consumers after being acquired by Facebook.
But a couple days later, when I ask yet again, Weaver makes it clear that his preferred outcome is to stay independent. And as Eero grows, its ranks swell with employees leaving the giants — including several who previously worked on the once-revolutionary AirPort Wi-Fi product line at Apple.
“When you’re a company at our stage, you’ve got one or two products you’re working on, and the ones that you’re working on, you ship,” says Weaver. “When you get to these bigger companies, there’s tons of products you’re working on, and very few of them ship.”
So can Eero actually build the ecosystem on top of your home network it’s dreaming of, while fending off fierce competition and the inevitable promise of a check from the giants? We’ll see. But there’s something great about a smaller company totally focused on its own concise product line without the politics and platform lock-in games of the giants.
“Every single device that matters in the home is going to be connected to the internet and every piece of content we consume in the home is going to be delivered over the internet,” says Weaver. “The opportunity here is to build a lasting brand at home.”
Eero is back: a little over a year after kickstarting the home mesh networking trend, the company is announcing its second-generation hardware. According to the company, the new Eero provides double the speed and range of its predecessor, yet has the same footprint and form factor as before. The second-generation Eero is also the first product on the market with fully functioning Thread support, so it will be able to connect to a variety of smart home devices expected to arrive in the near future.
In addition to the new, faster, and more powerful hub, Eero is also releasing a smaller product called the Beacon. It is designed to extend the range and coverage of your Wi-Fi network just like the other hubs, but it has an even smaller size and plugs directly into a wall outlet. Starting today, you can order an Eero kit with one Eero hub and one Beacon for $299; $100 more gets you the hub and two Beacons. A “Pro” system is also available for $499, which includes three Eero hubs. All kits are expected to start shipping in a few weeks.
New hardware isn’t the only thing from Eero today — the company is also launching a new subscription service called Eero Plus. The service, which costs $9.99 per month or $99 per year, provides enhanced parental controls; a security service that Eero says will protect your network and devices from malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks; and priority access to Eero’s customer support. CEO Nick Weaver describes the services as “similar to Amazon Prime,” and says the company will add more features to it without raising the cost in the future.
Ever since Eero launched its first mesh router, the market has been flooded with similar ideas and systems. Incumbents like Netgear, Linksys, and TP-Link have all released mesh home router systems, and even Google and Samsung are in the router game now. All of the systems basically do the same thing: provide strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home by using multiple nodes, or router units, that are wirelessly linked together.
Eero’s first-generation product delivered on its claims, and we found it to be quite the solution to troublesome home networking problems when we tested it. But the other systems that have come out since have either provided even faster speeds and stronger coverage, more services, or delivered a similar experience at a lower price.
With its new hardware and service plans, Eero hopes to close the gap and even surpass its competition. The new hub has a tri-band radio and can broadcast on three wireless bands at the same time (the first-gen model had a dual-band radio), and Eero says it is the smallest access point on the market with such a capability. Unlike the Netgear Orbi or Linksys Velop, Eero does not reserve one of the three bands just for communication between the units; Weaver says any one of the three bands can be used for sending data to devices or for communication between the nodes, depending on what the network demands are.
The Beacon is not as powerful as the new hub and does not have a tri-band radio, but Eero claims it provides 20 to 30 percent better performance than the first-generation Eero. It is half the size of the hub and is designed to placed in areas where power cords are unsightly or unable to be used, such as in stairwells, kitchens, and hallways. The Beacon also includes a downward-shining LED nightlight, which can be automatically controlled by the device’s ambient light sensor or with a manual schedule set in the Eero app. Both the new hub and the Beacon are backwards compatible with existing Eero systems, so current customers can add new hubs or Beacons to their networks as they see necessary.
Including Thread radio support is a bit of a bet on the future of smart home tech by Eero. Thread has been around as a smart home protocol for a few years, and a number of existing routers, such as Google’s OnHub line, have dormant Thread radios in them that have not yet been put to use. Thread is said to be simpler and easier to deploy than competing standards ZigBee and Z-Wave, but there aren’t yet any devices on the market that can make use of it. Weaver says that will change now that the new Eero comes with an active Thread radio: finally there will be a hub for Thread devices to connect to. These devices will likely include smart home staples such as lights, locks, and doorbells, and Weaver says the idea is you won’t have to use a secondary hub like SmartThings to connect your smart home devices.
The home router market is wildly different in 2017 than it was two years ago when Eero first broke cover, but Weaver says Eero is well-positioned to be a neutral party for your home network. While other companies, such as Google and Samsung, sell other devices that connect to Wi-Fi networks and may have different priorities based on those businesses, Eero is only focused on networking and doesn’t put any device ahead of another — whether it’s from Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, or another company.
Eero’s new products catch it up to the technical capabilities of the other mesh router systems without making them more complex or difficult to use than its earlier efforts. Given how popular its first products were, the new Eero devices should prove to be even more so.
At last year’s E3, Nintendo put most of its focus on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, dedicating the majority of its booth to the sprawling open-world adventure. Expect a similar focus this year, but on a much different game: Super Mario Odyssey.
Mario’s next big game is expected to launch this year, and will be the biggest — and most important — release for the Nintendo Switch after Breath of the Wild. Expect to get a much more in-depth look at Odyssey’s new open-world gameplay, which looks to build off the genre-defining Super Mario 64.
Outside of Super Mario, you’re likely to see and hear about other notable upcoming Switch games, including Splatoon 2, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and that strange crossover Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Hopefully we’ll also learn about the Switch’s recently-delayed online service, as well as just what’s going on with the Virtual Console.
And then there’s the 3DS. While much of the focus will be on Switch, expect to hear about at least a few new titles coming to Nintendo’s dedicated handheld. That’s likely to include the just-announced Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, as well as other surprise games. As for wildcards, there’s a small chance Nintendo will talk mobile games as well. A smartphone version of Animal Crossing is expected this year, while a mobile adaptation of Zelda is also rumored to be in the works.
As per usual, Nintendo won’t have an actual press conference at E3, but will instead announce news on a livestream on June 13th. The keynote will be followed by additional streams showcasing the company’s lineup of games, as well as competitive tournaments for games like Splatoon and Arms.
Here’s how to check it out:
Starting time: San Francisco: 9AM / New York: 12PM / London: 5PM / Berlin: 6PM / Moscow: 7PM / Beijing: 12AM (June 14th) / Tokyo: 1AM (June 14th) / Sydney: 2AM (June 14th).
Keynote live stream: Nintendo will be streaming the event directly on its site, as well as on both Twitch and YouTube.
Microsoft unveiled its new Xbox One X console earlier this week, promising “true 4K” gaming on “the world’s most powerful games console.” While many are debating what those promises truly mean and whether we’ll see the majority of games in Native 4K or checkerboard rendering, Microsoft’s Xbox chief Phil Spencer believes the Xbox One X is “a true 4K console.” In an interview with Eurogamer, Spencer explains the Xbox One X name, a lack of first-party game announcements, and the all-important $100 price gap between the Xbox One X and the PS4 Pro.
“I look at [PS4] Pro as more of a competitor to [Xbox One] S than I do to Xbox One X,” claims Spencer. “This is a true 4K console. If you just look at the specs of what this box is, it's in a different league than any other console that's out there.” Spencer points out 40 percent more GPU speed, more RAM, and the speed of storage as the advantages of the Xbox One X over the PS4 Pro, but he also knocks Sony’s methods for getting to 4K resolutions with some of its games. “When I think about techniques to somehow manufacture a 4K screen like what some other consoles try to do, this is different than that.” Spencer also says he expects the majority of consoles that Microsoft sells next year will be Xbox One S.
On the topic of the actual console name, Spencer says “the name had to have Xbox One in it” because the Xbox One X is part of the family of consoles. Microsoft couldn’t call it Xbox One Elite because it already has a version of the original Xbox One with that branding, and the Xbox One S is the existing console so it couldn’t use “S” alone. “Getting the trademark for Scorpio is really hard,” explains Spencer, “When we do names, you have to pick global names for things.” Microsoft ultimately picked Xbox One X because it fit with the power message and the original Xbox branding.
Finally, Spencer addresses the lack of first-party game announcements during Microsoft’s E3 press conference. Microsoft had plenty of big games to show, but in terms of announcements it was only Forza Motorsport 7 as a truly new triple-A title. Spencer believes Ori, Super Lucky’s Tale, and Sea of Thieves serve as solid announcements, but he admits he has been heavily focused on hardware over the past few years since taking over the chief Xbox role. “I do think we have an opportunity to get better in first-party and to grow,” says Spencer. “We've got great support from the company to go do that.”
Spencer also notes Microsoft has signed some “things we haven’t announced” but that it’s too early to build hype about. Microsoft canceled Fable Legends and Scalebound earlier this year, and it seems like the company is learning from showing games that aren’t ready too early. Spencer notes Microsoft could have demonstrated Halo in 4K, but that takes time away from getting the game ready. “I'm going to be conscious of putting things on-stage when I know I can make a commitment to my fans and customers that they're going to get to play those games.”

Project Fi is Google’s specialized wireless service designed primarily for Google’s own phones. It doesn’t get much attention because, in order to use it, your main phone pretty much has to be either a Google Pixel or a Nexus device. It hasn’t kept up with the trend of unlimited data that other carriers are doing now, but it does have a refreshingly simple business model.
Here’s how it works, if you don’t know: you pay $20 per month for your phone and $10 per GB of data that you use. That’s pretty much it. Additional phones are $15 per month and use the same data bucket. If you don’t use the data, you just pay the base rate of $20. If you use more than you planned, your “overages” are just charged at that $10 / GB rate.
Fi also has another feature that I love that Google doesn’t get much credit for: you can order free, data-only SIM cards and slap them into whatever device you want at no extra charge — it just pulls from your usual data bucket. Google announced this deal alongside support for iPads and other devices back in late 2015, but I’m only now realizing how great it is.
Project Fi is an MVNO, which means Google doesn’t actually own the towers or the network you connect to, it leases time from actual carriers. In Fi’s case, it’s T-Mobile and Sprint. I’ve only ever really seen it connect to T-Mobile and the data-only SIM only works on T-Mobile. I felt that all of this is necessary to point out because if you’re thinking of switching to Fi, you should know that their coverage might not fit your needs.
I need data connectivity to do my job, especially when I’m reporting at events. And for me, that means having access to more than one wireless carrier just in case. So while my main phone is Verizon, I also keep a Project Fi phone around as a backup for tethering.
Which brings me to the data-only SIM card. If I have a gadget (like the iPad Pro I’m using now) with a SIM card slot, it means I can use LTE on it directly rather than fuss around with turning on my phone’s tethering. It’s much more convenient, but it’s also great because I’m not draining the batteries on two different devices just so I can have internet access on one of them.
It makes me wish more devices had LTE options. Now that I know it won’t cost me a monthly fee to have LTE in a tablet, I want the same option in my laptop. There’s a very real chance it’s going to help determine my next computer purchase.
Because it doesn’t cost any extra, I can put Fi data-only SIMs in all sorts of stuff. Grab an old phone that’s sitting a drawer, put a SIM in it, and now you have a backup data device. I’m currently hunting around for a good, unlocked mobile hot spot with a big battery to replace my usual battery backup. It’s a thing I want now, I want to LTE all the things.
Don’t forget, though: it’s a data-only SIM. That means you can’t use the proper phone functions without some (sort of hacky) Google Dialer / Hangouts workarounds. (But for a secondary device, it hardly seems necessary.) You also may have to futz around with the APN settings to get a device to connect, but a surprising number of devices “just work,” including the iPad.
Maybe someday Google will stop treating Fi like a side project and make it directly available and easy to set up on more than just its own phones. In the meantime, it’s my favorite way to add LTE to my devices. If I don’t use them, they don’t cost me anything. But I have a feeling I’ll be using them a lot more now.
France and the UK are considering imposing fines on social media companies “that fail to take action” against terrorist propaganda and violent content, under a joint anti-terror campaign announced Tuesday. UK Prime Minister Theresa May will discuss the proposed measures with French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of her visit to Paris today.
In a press release, the Prime Minister’s office said the campaign aims “to ensure that the internet cannot be used as a safe space for terrorists and criminals.” May and Macron will discuss “the possibility of creating a new legal liability for tech companies if they fail to remove content,” the UK release states, including potential fines.
Leaders across Europe have pressured companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google to more swiftly remove hate speech and terrorist material online, though there are concerns that aggressive legislation could infringe on free speech. May called for stricter internet regulations following recent terrorist attacks in London and Manchester, and her government has criticized WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services for providing terrorists with a “secret place to communicate.”
The Prime Minister’s office says France and the UK will work with tech companies to help curb terrorist content online and develop tools to “identify and remove harmful material automatically.” Some tech companies have already begun incorporating tools to automatically detect illegal or extremist material, though experts have said that such material can be difficult to define.
“The counter-terrorism cooperation between British and French intelligence agencies is already strong, but President Macron and I agree that more should be done to tackle the terrorist threat online,” May said in a statement Tuesday. “We are united in our total condemnation of terrorism and our commitment to stamp out this evil,” she added.
The European Commission this month said that tech companies have made “significant progress” in removing violent material and hate speech, though Twitter and YouTube are still failing to abide by a voluntary “code of conduct” agreed to last year. German lawmakers are also considering legislation that would impose fines of up to €50 million ($56 million) on social media companies that fail to remove hate speech and other illegal content from their platforms. Critics say the measure would delegate too much power to private internet companies, and that it may curb freedom of speech online.

For the first time, Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that the iPhone-maker is building  the technology to power self-driving cars. In an interview with Bloomberg, Cook said that the firm is currently “focusing on autonomous systems” — rather than, say, a car stamped with the Apple logo — and that this could be used for many different purposes.
“We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” said Cook. “Autonomy is something that’s incredibly exciting for us, but we’ll see where it will take us. We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we’ll do, but we’re being straightforward that it’s a core technology we view as very important.”
Apple’s interest in autonomous vehicles has been something of an open secret in Silicon Valley. Rumors about the company’s efforts (codenamed Project Titan, and reportedly started in 2014) have been swirling for years. More recently, documents have emerged that clearly show Apple’s involvement in the technology, including the publication this April of a permit for the company to test self-driving cars in California.
Apple reportedly hired more than 1,000 engineers to work on Project Titan, but was forced to tweak its focus. In October last year, it was reported that the company had shrunk the team’s ambitions, from attempting to compete directly with the likes of Tesla by building the company’s own electric car, to focusing more on the software side of things. This interview with Cook confirms that this is Apple’s priority.
Whatever the company’s final goal, it is now, at least, being a bit more candid about its interest. Cook told Bloomberg that Apple sees the car industry as ripe for disruption, and noted that self-driving technology is just one of three “vectors of change” that will come to fruition in the near future. The other two, he says, are ride-sharing and electrification. “If you’ve driven an all-electric car it’s actually a marvelous experience,” said the Apple chief.
Sony’s E3 keynote wasn’t too big on major reveals, largely focusing on known quantities like God of War and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. There was one announcement, however, that really did shock me despite not even making it into our roundup of the event: Monster Hunter World, a new game coming next year for PS4, Xbox One, and later PC.
I don’t blame my colleague Chaim for omitting it — Monster Hunter has never quite broken through in the West, and its presence in Sony’s keynote probably left a lot of viewers nonplussed. But trust me, Monster Hunter World is huge news. Here’s why.
Monster Hunter is an action-RPG series developed by Capcom. It started on the PS2, but really took off in Japan when Capcom developed the Monster Hunter Freedom games for PSP. The heart and soul of Monster Hunter is co-operative multiplayer in which players, yes, hunt monsters together, and the four-player local wireless play made the PSP games a legitimate phenomenon in Japan. Overall the Monster Hunter series has sold over 40 million units, mostly in its home country.
Well, where do you want to start? Judging by the trailer and brief press release, Monster Hunter World is the biggest overhaul yet for the series. It’s by far the most advanced on a technical level, and marks the first time that Capcom has developed a brand new Monster Hunter game for a system anywhere near this powerful — the original and 2 were on PS2 first, 3 came out on Wii, while 4 and Generations were developed for the 3DS. (I’m not counting the spin-off Monster Hunter Frontier MMOs.)
This doesn’t just mean that World is the prettiest Monster Hunter yet, although it undoubtedly is — it means that Capcom has been able to change major elements of how the game plays. World maps are no longer segmented, meaning you won’t come across any loading times when transitioning from one area to the next; Capcom says the environments feature a “living and breathing ecosystem” that can be used to your advantage.
But the biggest difference, at least in the trailer, comes down to style of play. The trailer sees a solo player making his way through a level and using stealthy techniques to locate a monster, climb on it, and take it down, which is about as far from the typical Monster Hunter approach as you can get. The game does feature multiplayer, but it’s using a new drop-in system where you head into the world yourself and can send out flares to signal to other players that you’d like them to join in. That’s a big change from previous games, where you had to form groups before deciding which quest to head out on, and it could help make Monster Hunter World a lot more accessible to a Western audience.
Monster Hunter XX, the expanded version of Monster Hunter X (known as Monster Hunter Generations in the US), just came out for 3DS in Japan and will hit Switch later this year. It’s unclear whether it will see release elsewhere; Monster Hunter World, on the other hand, is the first game in the series with a “simultaneous launch window.” In any case, it’s a major coup for Sony.
Monster Hunter isn’t quite the sales juggernaut it once was in Japan, but if World turns out well it could be a serious system seller in its home market. The PC and Xbox One versions aren’t coming to Japan at all, but neither platform has a big following in the country. Even the PS4 hasn’t performed too well locally, however — while Sony announced today that it’s sold over 60 million systems worldwide, fewer than five million of those have been in Japan. That said, it’s worth noting that Monster Hunter games have always sold better on portable consoles than home machines.
Well, you should, because Japanese games are having a heck of a moment right now and that moment won’t last too long if no-one in Japan is buying consoles.
But even then, Monster Hunter World looks like the series’ best shot yet at Western success. The Monster Hunter series is famously beginner-unfriendly, with arcane menus that are only slightly more forgiving than the complex controls and deliberate, weighty combat system. If Capcom can refine these elements while preserving the game’s immense depth and addictive loop, Monster Hunter World could really be something special.
Bless you. I do too. Maybe the Japanese trailer for the game will reassure you — it’s more action-packed and shows a lot of combat that’s very much in keeping with prior entries in the series. But there’s no doubt that World is going to be a big change, and you might be better off holding out for XX eventually coming to the Switch in English if you want more traditional hunting action, not to mention local co-op play.
Many fans assumed that XX for Switch would be the precursor to an eventual Monster Hunter 5 for Nintendo’s new console, too, since the system’s hybrid play-anywhere design seems to be a perfect match for the series. World complicates the matter, however: it’s not clear whether or where this new direction will take off. It’s entirely possible that Capcom could consider it a spin-off and later proceed with a more conservative sequel on the Switch — or even the 3DS.
Whatever happens, Monster Hunter World is one of the most surprising and intriguing announcements yet to come out of E3 2017 for anyone familiar with the series. And that could soon apply to a whole lot more people around the world if what Capcom’s planning works out. We’ll bring you more coverage of Monster Hunter World later in the week; the game is due out globally in “early 2018.”
When I reviewed the Sense sleep tracker and described it as only marginally better than a sham product, I felt bad. Time has now validated my assessment, as Hello Inc, the company built around the Sense tracker as its sole product, is going under — but I still feel bad.
The person announcing the shutdown of Hello, James Proud, is the young founder of a small team that led the company and its sleep-tracking gadget through a successful $2.4 million Kickstarter campaign, $10.5 million in Silicon Valley funding, and a subsequent $40 million funding round. More than 19,000 backers bought into the Sense idea, so it was clearly hitting on a hot area of consumer interest and demand, however the one thing the company forgot to do was develop a robust device that actually did what it promised.
What bums me out about the entire Sense saga is how calculated the whole thing felt and still feels. Proud was one of Peter Thiel's entrepreneurial fellows, which is a scheme the Facebook board member initiated to get young people to skip university for a $100,000 grant to pursue some business idea and put their skills to practical use. My impression is that the idea with Hello, in classic Silicon Valley style, was to tap the most underserved market — there's been plenty of data to show that sleep diagnostics has been a big and underdeveloped opportunity — and just figure out the product along the way. Needless to say, neither the "let's do a startup and figure out the hardware later" nor the "let's build a device and figure out the business aspects later" attitude is the right one, but the idealist in me leans more toward the latter approach. I know of more companies, such as YouTube, that have turned a popular but unprofitable product into a viable business than I know of companies that developed good products after their slick marketing campaign.
Current Sense users will be emailed instructions on how to export all of their data and delete their accounts, if they so wish, later this week. Proud says there's still a chance that the Sense service will continue, however I've heard from someone familiar with goings-on behind the scenes that Hello has been unsuccessful in finding a takeover buyer and is now unable to even pay its bills. So it seems conclusive that this is indeed the final goodbye for Hello.
Dennis Rodman is back in North Korea, the former NBA star announced this week, with help from a marijuana cryptocurrency startup. Rodman, who has made several controversial visits to North Korea, tweeted a photo of himself holding an airline ticket for the state-owned Air Koryo on Tuesday. In a subsequent tweet, he thanked PotCoin, a digital currency for buying and selling weed, “for sponsoring my mission.”
The purpose of Rodman’s visit remains unclear, though it comes amid heightened tensions between the US and North Korea over Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Four Americans are also currently detained in North Korea.
In a press release announcing the visit, PotCoin said Rodman will provide more details about his “historic” trip upon returning to the US. The weed startup also described him as having “long-time friendships” with both President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, the autocratic leader of North Korea. Rodman has previously appeared on the Trump-hosted reality show The Apprentice, and endorsed Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. He also described Kim as “a friend for life” after visiting North Korea in 2013, and has drawn criticism for his public appearances alongside the dictator.
Speaking to CNN before boarding his flight, Rodman said hopes to do “something that's pretty positive” during his trip, though he said he did not intend to bring up the detained Americans during any discussions with North Korean leaders. “Well that's not my purpose right now... My purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea," the former Chicago Bulls forward told CNN.
Rodman, wearing a PotCoin-branded t-shirt and baseball cap, said in a short video released Tuesday that the trip is “all about peace.” One of Rodman’s previous trips to North Korea was sponsored by an Irish betting company. The value of PotCoin surged following Rodman’s announcement early Tuesday.
Speaking to reporters in Tokyo, Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon said that the US was aware of Rodman’s visit, and that he is traveling as a private citizen. “We are aware of his visit. We wish him well,” Shannon said, as reported by Reuters. “But we have issued travel warnings to Americans and suggested they not travel to North Korea for their own safety.”






Late last month, The New York Times announced that it was doing away with its public editor position, a sort of ombudsman for the paper, in part because the role had been filled by reader comments on the internet. The Times, publisher Arthur Sulzberger wrote in a memo, would be opening its comment sections on a greater number of stories and partnering with Google to manage them. It would be “a sea change in our ability to serve our readers, to hear from them, and to respond to them,” Sulzberger wrote. Today, the Times is unveiling the results of that partnership: an in-house process for automating comment moderation called Moderator.
Until recently, moderators for The New York Times would manually approve an average of 12,000 comments every day, with a team of 14 wading through reader responses as they came in. In a bid for a more targeted strategy, the Times partnered with Alphabet arm Jigsaw to organize comments based on their likelihood of being flagged for moderation. Times community editor Bassey Etim says the organization has already been using Moderator, and has been slowly ramping up the number of comments it approves through it. About 20 percent of comments are now automatically approved by the tool.
In February, Alphabet announced a related tool called Perspective, built to detect “toxic” comments. By mining millions of comments and drawing input from a human panel, the company said, it could begin to predict abusive text in a percentage format — a comment could be, for example, “40 percent similar to comments people said were ‘toxic.’” (Etim says the Times provided anonymized data to Alphabet for the project.) The system was by no means perfect: for a time, a demo seemed to identify all comments written in Arabic as partially toxic, even if the content of the text was uncontroversial. Sexist YouTube remarks plugged into the system by The Verge were marked as mostly non-toxic at the time. But less-nuanced comments, such as profanity-filled tirades, seemed easily caught in the net.
Like Perspective, Moderator charts comments based on their likelihood of being toxic or similar to comments previously flagged by moderators, creating a percentage score with the most likely to be flagged appearing closer to 100 percent. The Times will continue automatically approving some comments, and a ranked list will point moderators to the most controversial comments first. Etim says the organization won’t need to sacrifice too much accuracy for the sake of automation. As one example, he says, out of more than 8,300 opinion section comments submitted on a day last month, if the algorithm had been set to approve comments with a 10 percent or lower score, about 1,500 would be approved. Out of those 1,500, 22 would have been flagged by human moderators — not too far off from mistakes humans may have made anyway.
This new system, the Times says, will mean the organization can open up more stories to comments. Starting today, all of the organization’s “top stories” — those that appear with a summary on the Times homepage — during business hours will be opened for comments.
The Moderator announcement comes at a volatile time for comment sections around the internet. Several prominent news organizations have axed them entirely, arguing that the cost of moderation is not worth the potential rewards. Others have countered that comments are an essential reservoir of expertise, and that well-tended sections can build thoughtful audiences.
Meanwhile, in the internet at large, there are still questions about how massive social media audiences should be moderated, and for the most part, they rely heavily on human judgment. The Times is certainly a smaller, more special case — a paywalled news site — but the early success seems encouraging.
Still, there are hurdles in the Times’ quest to, as the guidelines put it, facilitate “civil” conversations that “avoid name-calling” — hurdles like teaching the algorithm when to flag newly coined insults about politicians. “There’s no historical record of ‘orange menace’ needing to be rejected,” Etim says.


One of my favorite PS4 games is Until Dawn, Supermassive’s cinematic horror adventure from 2015. The game took Heavy Rain’s branching story structure and applied it to a self-aware slasher tale, which felt like a much more natural fit — even if you made the wrong call and let a character die in an gory instant, the story would just keep going. And though it was a single-player game by design, it turned out to work really well with a bunch of people on a sofa yelling frantic instructions to the player.
For Supermassive’s next game, the British studio is expanding on that idea. Hidden Agenda is a new narrative-driven PS4 crime thriller that’s designed to be played with multiple players collaborating on the characters’ decisions and actions. The really neat step is that each person uses their smartphone as a controller, letting them vote on options and act on information that may not be available to everyone else.
Hidden Agenda is part of a new initiative by Sony called PlayLink, which will enable a range of games that let you use iOS or Android devices as controllers. Other upcoming PlayLink titles include a party game called That’s You and a new entry in the popular Singstar karaoke series.
It’s easy to see how PlayLink could make party games more accessible for players who aren’t traditional gamers; Jackbox has found success with a similar idea in its Party Pack releases. Applying the tech to a gritty serial killer story, however, is pretty novel, and a smart way to build on what worked in Until Dawn. Hidden Agenda will be out at some point this year.
I feel like I always start a Surface review the same way, so here goes: I’ve always wanted Microsoft to build a laptop. A couple of years ago, Microsoft nearly did that with the Surface Book but it wasn’t enough.
The Surface Book was top heavy, chunky, and it had a removable screen that I rarely detached. Like many Surface devices, it was different for the sake of being different, but it wasn’t the ultimate laptop that Microsoft claimed it would be.
Microsoft has now finally created the laptop I’ve been waiting for, and it’s simply called the Surface Laptop. The Laptop has virtually everything a working person could ask for, yet strangely, Microsoft has bundled the Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S, a new, slightly crippled version of Windows 10 that only supports apps from the Windows Store. It can’t run any apps downloaded from a website that a pro user might want, such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Steam, or VLC. Microsoft knows there aren’t enough apps in the Store itself, so it’s allowing Laptop buyers to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for free through at least the end of this year.
I can’t really get my work done without many of the apps I use daily, so I installed Windows 10 Pro on the Surface Laptop and have spent the last week using it as my main PC. (For a look at the Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S, be sure to check out my colleague Dieter Bohn’s review.) With Windows 10 Pro, the Surface Laptop has everything I want in a modern Windows laptop. Microsoft has created a unique blend of the finest laptop ingredients, and the result is something that looks stunning and feels luxurious. Is this the ultimate Windows laptop, though? Nearly.
Ditching Windows 10 S lets me run Chrome, Photoshop, 1Password, and a bunch of other desktop apps that aren’t available in the Windows Store. I can set Chrome as my default browser, install small utilities like Wox or Seer that make it easier to use Windows, or make low-level changes to the system if I desire. None of those things can be done on Windows 10 S. If you’re a heavy Windows user like me, you’re going to switch to Windows 10 Pro on the Surface Laptop straight away. It’s a quick process that takes less than a minute and involves a reboot.
Microsoft claims Windows 10 S is more secure and has better battery life due to some mysterious optimizations, but based on my experience using it with Windows 10 Pro, it’s hard to see how those claims are true. Windows 10 S is just a restricted version of Windows 10 Pro, and the fact it takes less than a minute to “upgrade” to the Pro version proves that fact. It might have better battery life simply because you’re forced to use Microsoft Edge as a browser, and because Microsoft controls what apps are available.
Take wox, for example, it is a fully customizable desktop search tool like Alfred on the Mac and it's not available on Windows 10S. It might not ever be, because it can replace Windows functionality at a level that's beyond regular Windows Store apps. But it's essential to me for custom Google searches. Everybody who's used Windows for any length of time probably has their own example of a must-have app that's either not available in the Store or probably won't be placed in the Store because it doesn't follow Microsoft's guidelines.
I’ve not had any issue with battery life or performance using Windows 10 Pro on this machine. It really feels like the Surface Laptop was built for Windows 10 Pro and restricting what you can do with it, as Windows 10 S does, sells it short. I’ve been testing the $1,299 Intel Core i5 model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and I’ve regularly attached it to a Surface Dock to power two displays, and it has handled it well. I can’t imagine why you’d pick any other variant — the cheaper models have less RAM and storage — and it’s the lowest price point where colors are available.
Microsoft has done some great work on the battery life with the Surface Laptop, and upgrading to Windows 10 Pro doesn’t appear to have any negative effect. I manage to get around 8 hours of solid battery life each day, which is enough to know I can head into the office without a charger. That’s the same amount of stamina that Dieter reports experiencing with Windows 10 S.
Amusingly, I’m most impressed with the fact I can close the lid and it goes to sleep properly and the battery doesn’t run down if I haven’t used it for 12 hours. (This has been an issue with every other Surface product save for the Surface Studio I’ve used.) Even if you use the Surface Dock and close the lid it will activate a clamshell mode so you can transform it into a desktop PC and attach a full keyboard and mouse.
On the hardware side, Microsoft hasn’t gone for any of its usual laptop / tablet hardware gimmicks here and I appreciate that. The Surface Laptop has a beautiful colorful aluminum finish around the entire device, and it all feels like a typical wedge-style laptop. I’ve been testing one with the striking burgundy color, and it has an impressive 13.5-inch display with the usual 3:2 Surface aspect ratio. Despite not being the typical black or silver most laptops are, the burgundy Surface Laptop doesn’t look any less professional in a work environment.
Underneath the display is something that makes the Surface Laptop a lot different: alcantara. Microsoft has opted for the Italian alcantara fabric, something that’s usually found in expensive sports cars, for the palm rests and keyboard area of the Surface Laptop. It gives it a premium look and feel, and it has allowed Microsoft to essentially build its Surface Pro keyboard into this laptop. That’s a good and a bad thing: the key travel feels great, and the spacing is solid, but just like the Surface Pro there’s a little bit of flex here. (The hollow echoing sound when you type that plagues the Pro’s elevated keyboard is fortunately not here.)
I’m a little concerned over the durability of the alcantara fabric, as it feels like owning a black pair of jeans you constantly have to use a lint roller on. I’ve been wiping off the Surface Laptop a lot, and I fear that people who don’t take care of it will end up with a very grubby looking machine in a year. I have no complaints about the trackpad, though. It’s the exact same size as the Surface Book and it feels just as good. It’s great for all of the multi-finger gestures Microsoft has built into Windows 10.
Alcantara isn’t the only gamble on the Surface Laptop. Microsoft has decided to forgo using USB Type-C ports here. The usual Surface connector, regular USB, and mini DisplayPort are present, but that’s it. I’m disappointed USB-C didn’t replace the mini DisplayPort, but I can understand why Microsoft is a little hesitant. USB-C is a mess of dongles and chargers that don’t work across devices, and my experience with the single port has been mixed. I dream of the day we can use one connector for everything, but the reality is we’re not there yet. Microsoft might have gambled and made the wrong decision here, but I feel like for most people USB-C simply doesn’t matter yet.
It would be easy to compare Microsoft’s Surface Laptop to Apple’s MacBook Air that is still praised by many today, but I think that’s unfair. The MacBook Air hasn’t been a class-leading laptop for years with its low-resolution display and aging design. Competition like Dell’s XPS 13 and HP’s Spectre x360 have shown that Apple has been left behind, and Microsoft is now releasing its Surface Laptop at a time when it’s apparent that Apple has given up on its MacBook Air.
The Surface Laptop isn’t perfect and the alcantara fabric will be a risky decision, but it does manage to achieve something very Apple-like: desire. I know there are laptops out there with more bells and whistles, but I still want to buy a Surface Laptop. Microsoft has managed to strike that fine balance of something that looks beautiful and luxurious, but that’s fully functional and effortless to use.
That’s what makes Microsoft’s insistence on Windows 10 S so confounding — it puts it at a weird disadvantage right out of the box. I understand that Microsoft needs to encourage developers to put their programs and apps into the Windows Store, and forcing 10 S is a way to do that, but when you’re spending $1,000 or more for a laptop, you don’t want it to be crippled right away.
Fortunately, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro is quick, easy, free (for now), and doesn’t have any particular downside, so it’s something I recommend you do. (And chances are, you’d probably do it even without my recommendation.) Provided you make that upgrade, the Surface Laptop might be the new default computer I recommend, essentially taking over exactly where the MacBook Air left off.
Finally. It's a word that's famously overused in tech, and it's understandable. As we use products every day, we can imagine that if just one or two small things changed, it would be perfect. But tech companies aren't just interested in iteration, even if those changes seem obvious to us. Instead, we often get offered half-baked ideas that are meant to be the start of new wave of innovation.
So when Microsoft started making Windows hardware, it felt like it was obstinately refusing to make the obvious thing. It made tablets with kickstands, laptops with detachable tablet screens, and desktops crafted for designers with too much money. Microsoft tried everything it could try to convince us to use a new kind of computer.
But now, finally, Microsoft made a device that's not trying to be something new and weird, it's just trying to be the thing you want. It's a laptop that's powerful enough to run all your apps, but thin enough to carry around — something with a high-resolution screen, a good keyboard, and a reasonable price. It's the obvious thing to make, and so Microsoft gave it the obvious name: the Surface Laptop.
This review covers the Surface Laptop running Windows 10 S. For a review of it running Windows 10 Pro, see Tom Warren’s review.
There are three things that most people who've heard of the Surface laptop are likely to remember. First, it looks a lot like the MacBook Air. Second, it has fabric on it. Third, it runs a new, limited version of Windows called Windows 10 S.
All of these things are true and I'll get into them, but none of them matter. What matters is that Microsoft has built a computer that doesn't overextend itself with any gimmicks.
Finally.
It's not entirely fair to say the Surface Laptop looks like an Air. It comes in different colors! It has that fabric! But it's also totally fair: two of the three physical dimensions of the machine are nearly identical to the classic wedge shape we associate with the Air. But where the Air and most other laptops try to soften their lines with gentle curves, the Surface Laptop goes for angularity. It's more Lamborghini than Porsche, and that gives it a unique aesthetic.
To me, though, it doesn't matter that the Surface Laptop sort of looks like the Air. Their resemblance matters because the Surface Laptop achieves in 2017 what the second-generation Air did in 2010: strike precisely the right balance of power, utility, portability, and battery life that the majority of regular consumers actually want. When you want to include a good Intel Core processor (and the fans it still unfortunately requires), a big battery, a few ports, and a good keyboard and trackpad, you end up with this shape.
The biggest hardware difference between the two, of course, is that the Surface Laptop has a big, bright, beautiful, pixel-dense, 13.5-inch touchscreen. It has a 3:2 aspect ratio, something Microsoft likes to do on its devices, and I like it, too. The taller screen means that you don't have to scroll as much on webpages and apps. Microsoft will talk your ear off about the technical qualities of this screen, but all I can tell you is that it looks great, gets very bright, and is super responsive.
It's also compatible with the Surface Pen (sold separately), and I really like how Microsoft has evolved those features so they feel like they're part of the core OS instead of something that locks you into OneNote. The screen doesn't fold flat either, so you'll really only want to use it for quick things, as the screen wobbles a bit when you write on it.
Finding the right balance for the hinge must have been tricky, though, and I do think that Microsoft might have made the hinge a little too tight to accommodate those Surface Pen users. It's a little too difficult to open the laptop one-handed when it's sitting flat on a table.
The Surface Laptop starts at $999, but I feel that exists more so that people will spend the extra $300 for the model I'm testing here, a Core i5 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It's the model I recommend if you decide to get this laptop.

That combination of features means that unless you venture into serious gaming or video editing, you won't experience any regular slowdowns or hiccups. I certainly haven't in the past week, despite using upwards of 10 apps at a time paired with a browser running a dozen tabs. But gamers beware: I got all sorts of stutters and frame drops playing ReCore with a few apps running in the background.
I also have no qualms about battery life. Under very heavy use, I still got up over seven hours, and more regular use got me beyond eight. I suspect that if I were very careful about which apps I ran and how I tuned the battery settings I could push that over nine or maybe even approach 10. One important note: pay no attention to Microsoft's claim of 14.5 hours of video — that's full-screen local video playback only, which bears no relation to how people actually use computers.
Setting aside the colors and the fabric, Microsoft fundamentally made conservative decisions with the design. It doesn't have a screen that rotates around to become a tablet and it doesn't have the USB-C ports that the rest of the industry is trying to move everybody toward. As a person who dreams of a single cable, that bums me out. As a person who isn't fond of dongles, I get the decision. But because there's no SD card slot, I still have to carry a dongle around for my camera. Annoying. For the record, there's a single traditional USB port (plus another on the power brick for charging a phone or tablet), a mini DisplayPort, a headphone jack, and Microsoft's magnetic Surface Connector for power.
But again, choosing to go conservative with the design means that more people won't have to think through convoluted trade-offs when they're looking for a computer. It's powerful enough for most, it's light enough for most, and it doesn't ask you to buy a bunch of new cables.
Of course, the one design element that's not conservative at all is the Alcantara fabric that surrounds the keys and covers the palm rests. In fact, every person who has seen this laptop asks about it first. Most think it feels nice but is still a little weird. Most also think it's a bad idea because it will wear down after months and years of use. Or that it will get easily stained. Or, at minimum, it'll get grimy and nasty.
So yeah, about that: I am no expert on this stuff, and I certainly haven't had this laptop long enough to render final judgment. And Microsoft definitely didn't do itself any favors when it said users should treat it like a luxury product. Nor is it reassuring when the company says that Alcantara "ages beautifully, growing richer and darker over time, and is wonderfully soft to touch."
Even so, I think it's going to end up not being a very big problem for most people. Microsoft uses the same material on its Signature Type Covers for the Surface Pro tablet and there aren't that many reports of problems on it. It does pick up crumbs and lint sometimes. Also, I dutifully smeared some Caesar salad dressing on the palm rests of my Surface Laptop and it wiped off completely with a damp cloth.
The big question is why Microsoft used this fabric in the first place. As far as I know, it's simply an aesthetic thing and makes the laptop feel nicer. It certainly makes the laptop stand out and gives you something to talk about when you open it up. That's reason enough, I suppose, and I admit I like the feel of it. But I don't hate the feel of bare aluminum, either. As my colleague Tom Warren says, it would be much easier to just wipe aluminum clean.
A small thing: the way that the fabric gets attached to the laptop means that there needs to be a small indentation around the edge of the laptop deck. That, in turn, means that there's a tiny gap that runs around the seam of the laptop when it's closed.
I'll say this: I think using this fabric is an unforced error. It allows all these jokes about carpet on a laptop. It drives a conversation about the Surface Laptop, sure, but probably not the one Microsoft was hoping for.
The last thing everybody should know about the Surface Laptop: it ships with a new operating system called Windows 10 S. I say it's "new" but that's not really true at all, because the only new thing here is that 10 S is locked down so it can only run apps downloaded from the official Microsoft Windows Store.
That limitation has a ton of benefits: it means that Microsoft can vet every app that goes on your machine for malware. It means that those apps will follow new rules inside Windows that can keep them from chewing up your battery or hogging your system resources. It means that Microsoft can more confidently push out security updates and new features.
But the trade-off for all those benefits isn't worth it because the Windows Store is an app desert. Many of the apps you expect are either not in the store or — if they are there — are worse than what you can get on iPads, Mac, the full version of Windows, or even on the web.
In addition to all this, you cannot change the default browser in Windows 10 S away from Edge. Even if Chrome and Firefox were available in the store (they're not), you'd have to copy and paste links into them just like you do when you use them on iOS. (You can set other default apps, like email, to whatever you like.)
Everybody will hit the wall on different things. For me it was 1Password and SimpleNote. Both have good Windows apps, but neither are in the store. And the video conferencing solution we use, Zoom, is also unavailable in the store and its web-based equivalent doesn't work in Microsoft's browser, Edge.
When you download and try to install an app from the web, instead of letting you run the .exe, Windows will pop up a box offering to search for it in the store, where there's a very good chance you won't find it. For some apps, Microsoft says it will pop up a custom dialog pointing you directly to the app (or an equivalent) in the store.
Presumably, Microsoft is shipping Windows 10 S by default in an attempt to juice developers to get their apps into the store. Maybe that strategy will work, but I am not optimistic. Switching from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free through the end of the year (and perhaps beyond) and takes only a few minutes to do.
When I said up top that it doesn't matter that the Surface Laptop ships with Windows 10 S, this was what I meant. The first or second time that the pop-up to switch to Pro appears, most regular users are just going to go ahead and click it. (Students and other users in managed settings: sorry for your luck.)
Be warned, however, that for now there's no going back to Windows 10 S without completely reformatting your machine.
One small note for potential Mac switchers: even though I find many of the third-party apps on Windows deficient compared to their Mac equivalents, the gap is closing. And Microsoft's own apps like Mail and Calendar are quite good. Most of all, Windows 10 just feels modern and well-thought-out in a way that macOS Sierra sometimes doesn't: Cortana works equally well from a keyboard or with your voice, for example, and settings and notifications are much easier to find now. I also really love the Windows Hello feature, which uses facial recognition to log you in nearly instantly.
The Surface Laptop totally lives up to expectations.
I think it's the new de facto Windows laptop that most people who want a Windows laptop should get — provided they can afford to spend $1,300 for the step-up model. It strikes exactly the right balance of power, portability, utility, and design for most people; albeit at a slightly higher price than its direct competitors.
To tell the truth, I don't know that there's some sort of incredible technical achievement here. It's thin but not that thin, powerful but not wildly so. Microsoft just chose to do the obvious and correct thing with this laptop over and over, even if that thing is a little boring. Then it slapped a piece of carpet on top to spice it up. I expected Microsoft to do a good job on this hardware, and it did.
But the other expectation I had for the Surface Laptop is that I'd be unable to actually get the apps I need from the Windows Store, and I was right. If you buy this laptop, you're going to end up taking the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.
There are thinner Windows laptops. There are cheaper Windows laptops. There are more powerful Windows laptops. But all those laptops ask you to make more uncomfortable compromises than the Surface Laptop.
Logitech is unveiling a new security camera today called the Circle 2. Except the Circle 2 isn’t really one camera: it’s four different cameras in one (maybe more, depending on how you set it up). It’s meant to be wired and wireless, mounted to walls and windows, and used basically however you’d like. The only downside is that you’ll have to buy the right parts to transform it into the kind of camera you’re looking for — and there are a lot of different parts.
On its own, the Circle 2 is surprisingly small. It’s a little black disc with a 180-degree camera on one side and a smart connector on the back. The 180-degree camera is great, because it allows a single camera to monitor a ridiculously wide area. And the smart connector is what allows the camera to transform into a bunch of different shapes.
The Circle 2 isn’t meant to be used as just a tiny disc — in fact, it can’t be. It’s meant to be paired with a traditional wall mount, a battery mount, a window mount, or a plug mount that goes straight into an outlet. You’ll need at least attach one of them to power the thing.
At launch, Logitech will be selling two kits: one includes the camera and a wall mount and sells for $179.99. The other includes the camera and a battery mount and sells for $199.99. As accessories, it’ll also be selling a weatherproof extension cord, a window mount, a wall plug mount, and an extra battery; these range in price from $29.99 to $49.99. For the most part, you can mix and match the different mounts (though in one strange exception, the extra battery requires you to have purchased the camera’s battery kit first). On the plus side, the entire camera is weatherproof, so it can be used outside in any setup. The kits and accessories are supposed to begin shipping next month.
Overall, Logitech seems to have devised a smart system that opens up a lot of possibilities for buyers. One of the things Logitech says it saw with the original Circle camera was that customers had a lot of different ways they liked to use them, and its goal this time is to make it easier for customers to put the camera wherever they’d like. Logitech hints that more mounts could come over time as customers show interest in different uses of the camera.
The Circle 2’s shape-shifting is really the biggest new feature — the camera is otherwise about the same as its predecessor. Owners will be able to stream footage through the Logi Circle app and get notifications about activity. Unfortunately, some of the much more useful features require additional payment. You’ll need to subscribe to the $100-per-year, per-camera Circle Safe Premium service in order to get person detection or set activity zones. Otherwise, you’re stuck with much less useful notifications.
That kind of fee isn’t unique to Logitech — Nest also charges for person detection — but it makes cameras like these a much bigger investment if you’re using them for security. As a way to monitor your kids or a pet, though, you can probably skip out on extra payments.
Logitech has also set up Alexa support for the Circle 2; every camera has a built-in HomeKit chip, so they’ll work with Apple’s system, too. (Although, a caveat: apparently HomeKit doesn’t support battery-powered cameras, so the Circle 2 will only work with HomeKit when plugged into a wired power source.)
When the Circle 2 launches next month, it’ll face off against quite a few competitors vying to get inside your home. Netgear’s Arlo line of cameras has indoor and outdoor options, and it even recently added an option expressly designed for monitoring babies. Canary’s Flex camera takes a similar put-it-anywhere approach, with the ability for a single camera to work plugged or unplugged, indoors or out.
On top of those options, Nest just announced the Cam IQ, which shoots in 4K so that it can punch in on details. Nest even offers some of the smarts that Logitech is charging for — like person detection — for free. This should make it much cheaper if you’re looking primarily for a security camera, not a way to monitor your kids while they’re playing in the backyard.

God of War. Spider-Man. Horizon Zero Dawn. A new Call of Duty. Choose-your-own sci-fi adventure Detroit. Big-budget zombie game Days Gone. A VR thing for Final Fantasy XV.
That was Sony from E3 2016. This year, the company showed off... well... God of War. Spider-Man. Another Horizon Zero Dawn. A new Call of Duty — now in World War II. Choose-your-own sci-fi adventure Detroit. Big-budget zombie game Days Gone. And a VR thing for Final Fantasy XV — this time fishing.
That isn’t to say it was a bad show from Sony — far from it, in fact, as each of those games have taken the year to really improve themselves. There was also a new Uncharted adventure, a remastered Shadow of the Colossus, and some Destiny 2 exclusives. Here’s everything you might’ve missed.
There was, alas, nothing for Vita.
Sony’s E3 presentation may not have had a lot in the form of new announcements, with most of the trailers and news offering new clips and extended looks on already revealed games.
That said, there were some interesting notes and a few surprises. We’ve rounded up the most important ones here.
The Lost Legacy is the first Uncharted game to not star Nathan Drake, but our new heroes — Uncharted 2 treasure hunter Chloe Frazer and Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End mercenary Nadine Ross — don’t seem to be straying too far from the series’ roots. This time? They’re after the tusk of Ganesh, which is presumably some kind of ancient treasure.
Sony’s showed off a seven minute long gameplay segment of Days Gone, it’s upcoming open-world zombie survival game trailer. The clip showed off a quieter pace than earlier trailers, with some more stealth gameplay. It also show how players can  harness the mindless hordes of zombies to their advantage. There’s still no concrete release date, though.
Shadow of the Colossus is a cult classic game from the PlayStation 2 — so popular, that Sony already released a remastered version of the game back in 2011. But now it seems that Shadow of the Colossus is getting a proper HD remake for the PlayStation 4, set to release sometime in 2018.
The next God of War game — first unveiled at last E3 — shifts the setting to Norse mythology and introduces Kratos’ son Atreus to the series. The new trailer showcases more of the hack and slash action the game is known for, complete with gory finishing moves, along with a vague “early 2018” release window.
David Cage’s next narrative action game Detroit: Become Human got a new trailer as well, showing off some of the branching choices players can make. The new clip showed off a character named Marcus, as he leads other androids in a riot against their human makers. Again, no hard release date yet.
Sony closed out the conference with a reveal of some gameplay for Insomniac’s upcoming Spider-Man game. As expected, the title is filled with acrobatic action and combat that favors chaining attacks together, along with a glorious look at how the open world web-slinging will work. That said, there were quite a few quick-time events that could sour the deal. Spider-Man is a PS4 exclusive, set to release in 2018.
Bungie will release Destiny 2 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 6th, two days before the official launch date Bungie announced at the game’s reveal event last month. The new release date was slipped into the very end of the newest cinematic trailer for Destiny 2, which Sony showed off here at its E3 press conference. Soon after, publisher Activision also confirmed the PC release date — almost two months later, on October 24th.
It was originally assumed that this new release date was a PlayStation exclusive, part of Sony’s ongoing deal with Bungie and publisher Activision that’s lasted since the original game’s launch in September of 2014. As part of the deal, PS4 players will get access to exclusive strikes, weapons, and armor for up to one year after Destiny 2’s release. However, game director Luke Smith was quick to clarify on Twitter that the release date is for both consoles.
Destiny 2 will launch on all consoles September 6th.
Smith’s careful wording here indicated that the PC version of Destiny 2 wouldn’t be ready in time for the console launch, a fact later confirmed by Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg. "We are also hard at work with our friends at Bungie optimizing Destiny 2 for the PC, which we will be releasing in all its glory on October 24," Hirshberg said, confirming what Bungie had already admitted in an interview after the game’s big announcement.
Bungie also gave out beta information. The beta will last around two and a half days, from 1PM ET, July 21st to 12AM, July 24th for PS4 and Xbox One. The PC beta is slated to happen later on in August. If you preorder Destiny 2, Bungie says you’ll get early access to the beta: 1PM ET, July 18th for PS4 preorder owners, and the same time but a day later for Xbox One.

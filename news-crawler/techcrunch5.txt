Once again there are indications the UK government intends to use the law to lean on encryption. A report in The Sun this week quoted a Conservative minister saying that should the government be re-elected, which polls suggest it will, it will move quickly to compel social media firms to hand over decrypted data.
The paper quoted an unnamed government minister saying: “The social media companies have been laughing in our faces for too long”, and suggested that all tech companies with more than 10,000 users will face having to significantly adapt their technology to comply with the decryption law.
The relevant Statutory Instrument, to enable UK government agencies to obtain warranted access to decrypted data from communications service providers, currently sitting in draft form, will be voted through parliament within weeks of a new government taking office after the June 8 general election, according to the report.
As is typically the case when strong encryption comes back under political pressure in the modern Internet age, this leaked hint of an impending ‘crack down’ on tech firms came hard on the heels of another terrorist attack in the UK — after a suicide bomber blew himself up at a concert in Manchester on Monday evening. The underlying argument is that intelligence agencies need the power to be able to break encryption to combat terrorism.
Strong encryption, cryptic answers
The problem — as always in this recurring data access vs strong encryption story — is that companies that use end-to-end encryption to safeguard user data are not able to hand over information in a readable form as they do not hold the encryption keys to be able to decrypt it.
So the question remains how can the government compel companies to hand over information they don’t have access to?
Will it do so by outlawing the use of end-to-end encryption? Or by forcing companies to build in backdoors — thereby breaking strong encryption in secret? The latter would arguably be worse since government would be opening app users up to potential security vulnerabilities without letting them know their security is being compromised.
The UK government has been rubbing around this issue for years. At the back end of last year it passed the Investigatory Powers Act, which threw up questions about the looming legal implications for encrypted communications in the UK — owing to a provision that states communications service providers may be required to “remove electronic protection of data”.
It’s those powers that ministers are apparently intending to draw on to break social media firms’ use of strong encryption.
During the scrutiny process of the IP bill last year, ministers led a merry dance around the implications of the “electronic protection” removal clause for e2e encryption. The best interpretation of which was that the government was trying to frame a law that encouraged tech platforms to eschew the use of strong encryption in order not to risk falling outside the scope of an unclear law.
“He seems to be implying that providers can only provide encryption which can be broken and therefore can’t be end-to-end encryption,” was Lord Strasburger’s assessment of the government response to questions on the topic last July.
No clarity has emerged since then. The situation is still ongoing fuzziness about the legality of e2e encryption in the UK. To break or not to break, that is the question?
Arguably, as Strasburger suggested, this is strategic; intentional obfuscation on the part of the UK government — to spread FUD as a strategy to try to discourage use of a technology their intelligence agencies view as a barrier to their work.
But the problem for the government is that use of e2e encryption has been growing in recent years as awareness of both privacy risks and cyber security threats have stepped up, thanks to data breach scandal after data breach scandal, as well as revelations of the extent of government agencies’ surveillance programs following the 2013 Snowden disclosures.
Not holding encryption keys allows tech firms to step outside the controversy related to digital snooping and to bolster the security cred of their services. Yet, as a result, popular services that have championed strong encryption are increasingly finding themselves in the crosshairs of government agencies. Be it the Facebook Messenger app, or Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging platform, or Apple’s iOS and iMessage.
After another terror attack in London in March, UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd was quick to point the finger of blame at social media firms — saying they should not provide “a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other”, and asserting: “We need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.”
Of course she did not explain how intelligence agencies intended to “get into” encrypted WhatsApp. And that earlier political pressure on encryption morphed into calls for social media firms to be more proactive about removing terrorist content from their public channels. At least publicly. Discussions held vis-a-vis encryption were not made public.
But again, if the latest reporting is to be believed, Rudd is intent on breaking strong encryption after all.
Exceptional access, unacceptable risk 
It’s worth revisiting Keys Under Doormats; aka the paper written by a group of storied security researchers back in 2015, re-examining the notion of so-called “exceptional access” for security agencies to encryption systems — at a time when debate had also been re-ignited by politicians calling for ‘no safe spaces for terrorists’.
The report examined whether it is “technically and operationally feasible to meet law enforcement’s call for exceptional access without causing large-scale security vulnerabilities” — posing the question of whether it’s possible to build in such exceptional access without creating unacceptable risk?
Their conclusion was clear: exceptional access without unacceptable risk is not possible, they wrote. Nor is it clear it would even be feasible given how the services in question criss-cross international borders.
Here’s one key paragraph from the paper:
Designing exceptional access into today’s information services and applications will give rise to a range of critical security risks. First, major efforts that the industry is making to improve security will be undermined and reversed. Providing access over any period of time to thousands of law enforcement agencies will necessarily increase the risk that intruders will hijack the exceptional access mechanisms. If law enforcement needs to look backwards at encrypted data for one year, then one year’s worth of data will be put at risk. If law enforcement wants to assure itself real time access to communications streams, then intruders will have an easier time getting access in real time, too. This is a trade-off space in which law enforcement cannot be guaranteed access without creating serious risk that criminal intruders will gain the same access. Second, the challenge of guaranteeing access to multiple law enforcement agencies in multiple countries is enormously complex. It is likely to be prohibitively expensive and also an intractable foreign affairs problem.
They further concluded:
From a public policy perspective, there is an argument for giving law enforcement the best possible tools to investigate crime, subject to due process and the rule of law. But a careful scientific analysis of the likely impact of such demands must distinguish what might be desirable from what is technically possible. In this regard, a proposal to regulate encryption and guarantee law enforcement access centrally feels rather like a proposal to require that all airplanes can be controlled from the ground. While this might be desirable in the case of a hijacking or a suicidal pilot, a clear-eyed assessment of how one could design such a capability reveals enormous technical and operational complexity, international scope, large costs, and massive risks — so much so that such proposals, though occasionally made, are not really taken seriously.
One thing the paper did not consider is that much politicking can be primarily intended as a theatre of influence for winning votes from spectators..text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

And the timing of the latest leaked call for ‘decryption on-demand’ coincides with an imminent UK general election, while also serving to shift potential blame for security failures associated with a terrorist attack that took place during the election campaign off of government agencies — and onto a softer target: overseas tech firms.
As we’ve seen amply in recent times, populist arguments can play very well with an electorate. And characterizing social media companies as the mocking, many-headed pantomime villain of the story transforms complex considerations into a basic emotional attack that might well be aimed at feeding votes back to a governing party intent on re-election.
“…to disclose, where practicable… in an intelligible form”
Returning to UK law, the (still draft) ‘Investigatory Powers (Technical Capability) Regulations 2017‘ is the legal route for placing obligations on comms service providers, under the IP Act, to maintain the necessary technical capabilities to afford government agencies the warranted access on demand that they keep demanding.
Yet exactly what those technical capabilities are remains unclear. (And “vague” technical requirements for exceptional access are also raised as a problem in Keys Under Doormats.)
Among the list of obligations Technical Capability Notices can place on comms service providers is the following non-specific clause:
To provide and maintain the capability to disclose, where practicable, the content of communications or secondary data in an intelligible form and to remove electronic protection applied by or on behalf of the telecommunications operator to the communications or data, or to permit the person to whom the warrant is addressed to remove such electronic protection.
The document also sets out that decrypted data must be handed over within a day after a CSP has been served a warrant by a government agency, and that CSPs must maintain the capability to intercept simultaneously comms and metadata for up to 1 in 10,000 of their customers.
The technical details of how any encryption perforations could be achieved are evidently intended to remain under wraps. Which means wider data security risks cannot be publicly assessed.
“I suspect that all the vagueness about concrete technical measures is deliberate, because it allows the government to deal with the technical details within a particular technical capability notice, which would be under a gag order, and thus avoid any public scrutiny by the infosec community,” argues Martin Kleppmann, a security researcher at the University of Cambridge who submitted evidence to the parliamentary committees scrutinizing the IP bill last year. And who has blogged about how the law risks increasing cyber crime. 
“It’s easy to criticize encryption technologies as providing ‘safe spaces’ for terrorists while forgetting that the exact same technologies are crucial for defence against criminals and hostile powers (not to mention protecting civil liberties),” he adds.
“Intelligence agencies don’t seem to actually want bulk access to encrypted data, but merely want the capability to intercept specific targets. However… if a system allows encryption to be selectively circumvented at the command of an intelligence agency, it’s not really end-to-end encryption in a meaningful sense!”
One possibility for enabling ‘exceptional access’ that has sometimes been suggested is a NOBUS: aka a ‘nobody but us’ backdoor — i.e. a backdoor which is mathematically/computationally impossible to find. However Kleppmann points out that even if the math itself is solid, it merely takes one person with knowledge of the NOBUS to leak it — and then, as he puts it, “all mathematical impossibility goes out of the window”.
“The only way of making a system secure against adversaries who want to harm us is by designing it such that there are no known flaws or backdoors whatsoever, and by fixing it if any flaws are subsequently discovered,” he argues.

Crypto expert Bruce Schneier is also dismissive of notion there might be a ‘third way’ for authorities to securely gain exceptional access. Asked by TechCrunch whether there could be any way for the UK government to implement a technical capability without the law effectively removing e2e encryption, his response is very clear. “No,” he says. “Just like the US, the way for the government to get the access it wants is to destroy everyone’s security.”
Meanwhile, on the vulnerability front, Kleppmann notes that even users of services which have open source components — such as WhatsApp, which uses the respected (and independently security reviewed) Signal Protocol for its encryption system — there’s still a requirement for users to trust the company’s servers are doing what they say they are when they hand over keys. Which could offer a potential route for a government-mandated backdoor to be slipped in.
“With WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage there is the remaining problem that you have to trust their server to give you the correct key for the person you want to communicate with,” he says. “Thus, even if the encryption is perfect, if a government agency can force the server to add the government’s special decryption key to your list of device keys, they can still subvert the security of the system. People are working on improving the transparency of key servers to reduce this problem, but we still have a long way to go.”
“I do believe open source is very helpful here,” he adds. “It’s not a silver bullet, but it makes it more difficult to sneak in a backdoor unnoticed.”
Previously, UK government ministers have both claimed they do not want to ban end-to-end encryption nor are demanding that backdoors be built in digital services. Although they have also described the rise of e2e encryption as “alarming“.
When interrogated specifically on the e2e question, the former UK Home Secretary (and now UK Prime Minister) said that companies should take “reasonable steps to ensure that they are able to comply with the warrant that has been served on them”.
Yet — and you might be spotting a pattern here — there has been no definition of what those “reasonable steps” might be.
Therefore it remains unclear where the UK’s legal line will be drawn on encryption.
Backdoors and outlaws 
If The Sun‘s story is correct, and UK government-ministers-in-waiting are indeed preparing to demand the likes of WhatsApp and Apple hand over decrypted messages then those “reasonable steps” would presumably require an entire reworking of their respective security systems.
And if the companies don’t bow to such demands what then? Will the UK government move to block access to WhatsApp’s e2e encrypted messaging service? Or ban the iPhone, given that Apple’s iMessages also uses e2e encryption? We just don’t know at this point.
A spokesperson for WhatsApp declined to comment when contacted for a response to this story.
Apple’s press team did not respond to a request for comment either. But the company has a history of strongly defending user privacy — taking to the courts in the US last year to fight the FBI’s demand to weaken iOS security to help facilitate access to a locked iPhone that had been used by a terrorist, for example.
WhatsApp has also had its service blocked multiple times in Brazil after it was taken to court for not handing over decrypted data to law enforcement authorities. Its response? To state in public that it cannot hand over information it does not hold.
However, the legal situation in the UK is different owing to the 2016 IP Act — with its troublesome clause about “removing electronic protection”.
And while there may be fresh moves afoot in the US to introduce a decrypt bill in the US — such legislation has not yet come to pass. Whereas in the UK the relevant law is now framed in such a way as to be possible to interpret that it requires CSPs to deliver up decrypted data on warranted demand.
So it’s not apparent that there would be any legal route for Apple to try to fight a decryption order for iMessage — should it be handed one by UK government agencies — given the company has a substantial presence in the UK. (As does Facebook, the parent of WhatsApp.)
“You can’t run a company as an outlaw,” says Danvers Baillieu, former lawyer turned COO for a startup after a stint working for VPN firm, HideMyAss. “If you change the law and it is [a company’s] legal duty to do something they don’t really have a leg to stand on. It’s all very well them saying they’re going to crusade for this and that but they ultimately have to comply with the law.”
“As a VPN provider we obviously told people to get lost the whole time from other countries because we didn’t have a physical presence there and we said we just had to abide by UK law. So we were constantly having services taken down in countries like India and Turkey and other places — because the authorities there would then lean on our local server providers,” he adds.
“But we could get away with it because we weren’t physically there. But the moment you have a physical presence — and the moment we got taken over by a multinational [HMA was acquired by AVG in 2015] we suddenly had to think about these things far more, because suddenly we were part of a multinational with offices in all these countries. And we had to be a lot more sensitive to these things.”
At this point we simply do not know what these multinational tech giants might feel they have to do to their security systems behind closed doors when/if they are being leant on by the full force of UK law — also behind closed doors, as CSPs are forbidden from disclosing the existences of Technical Capability Notices.
And if they’re being leant on to build and test backdoors to afford UK intelligence agencies access to their systems we may never know as there’s no legal route for them to tell their users what’s happening.
Perhaps they’d just remove marketing materials that mention ‘end to end’ encryption from UK versions of their services — and, much like a warrant canary, we’d have to make an inference that a certain service might no longer be trustworthy for UK users from that moment on.
“It would certainly make for some very bad PR, were a company to defy the gag order and make it publicly known,” says Kleppmann. “So maybe in such cases the government would choose not to serve a technical capability notice in the first place, and only rely on cooperation from companies that are happy to cooperate voluntarily. But now we’re really in guesswork territory.”
Meanwhile, plenty of tech services are of course built and maintained by overseas firms or developers with little or no presence in the UK.
Which raises the question of how the government would respond to that workaround for its plan to acquire decrypted data? And whether it would seek to block access to services that offer e2e encryption and cannot be legally compelled to build in backdoors.
A lawyer we spoke to for this story who did not wish to be identified suggested there may be some overseas providers that are willing to “do something” — “if they can find a way to do so, and want the comfort of a legal compulsion”.
For those overseas providers that are adamant they will not remove electronic protection when handed a UK warrant, it’s difficult to say what the government might do. The source suggested they could try blocking access to such services by leaning on other UK-based companies — such as ISPs and multinational app stores.
“We’ve seen in the Digital Economy Act, in the context of overseas porn sites which fail to comply with UK rule, the fall-back position is one of ISP blocking,” they said. “There is also the (seemingly non-binding) approach of having a chat with app store operators and other ‘ancillary service providers’, to encourage them to take action — presumably, removing an app from the store, or the removal of payment services provision from the app/service in question.”
A blocking strategy would be highly unlikely to render it impossible to access all services offering e2e encryption without any government backdoors — so, as ever, the political desire to have an absolute workaround for strong encryption would be doomed to fail. Meanwhile, the cost to mainstream app users of government requiring CSPs build access exploits into their systems ‘just in case’ would be greater risk their communications are hacked, leaked and snooped on.
“I think ultimately the reputable, multinational companies would comply but then you’re always going to have some kid spinning up a service from their bedroom in the middle of nowhere — or you have the latest version of Telegram, or something like that — and then it’s not going to comply. So obviously any sensible criminal or terrorist is not going to use the mainstream ones,” says Baillieu. “Criminals are generally quite dumb about this sort of stuff. But whether that applies to the more motivated terrorists, we just don’t know.”
“I think equally there’s a very good argument to say you should make it hard for these people to do this stuff,” he adds. “They shouldn’t just be able to use the most convenient apps that everyone has on their phone. We should make it difficult for them — and they might slip up… And I think you can make it quite hard for non-compliant apps to get distributed.
“I think a lot of people, probably this week, are feeling a little bit vulnerable. And we have to do something to address this.”
While Baillieu’s view is understandable, given the horror and fear generated by terrorism, it does risk losing sight of the wider, day to day risks posed to all users of digital services if governments systematically undermine data security. And we don’t have to look far back in time for an example of the risks.
The WannaCry ransomware, which caused havoc globally earlier this month, including locking out healthcare systems in the UK, utilized an exploit developed by (and leaked from) US intelligence agencies.
So, really, a “clear-eyed assessment” is what’s called for here — despite, and perhaps even because of, the horrors of terrorism.
“These proposals are unworkable in practice, raise enormous legal and ethical questions, and would undo progress on security at a time when Internet vulnerabilities are causing extreme economic harm,” is how Keys Under Doormats‘ assessed the “exceptional access” proposals of 2015.
Two years later their assessment would surely be that the risks of seeking to systematically backdoor encryption now are only greater — as more and more systems are being connected and more and more people are dependent on the data they contain.
Yet politicians in positions of power are apparently intent on waging yet another self-defeating crypto war. Where’s the sense in that?

Write about technology for any amount of time and you’ll get run through the hype wringer. It’s impossible to avoid. After all, it’s the excitement of new technologies that drew so many of us to this field in the first place. And when DJI debuts a product like the Spark, the word “game changer” gets tossed around a lot, just like it did with last year’s Mavic Pro.
But disruption takes time. Even at the breakneck speed of technology, change rarely happens overnight. In hindsight, it’s easy to pinpoint the mainstreaming of a technology on a single event, like the launch of the first iPhone. But that short-term memory wipes away a lot of the preamble and ramp up. In hindsight, it’s easy to forget, say, how much of a struggle the earliest Android phones had.
The word “mainstreaming” has been tossed around among those who follow the drone world. Here’s a CNN story from 2013 titled “Drones go mainstream.” And here’s Slate with “2015 Was the Year of the Drone.” And of course, one for the Mavic Pro from last year titled, “You Know Drones Have Gone Mainstream When Even Martha Stewart Loves Her Mavic.”
Sure, Martha is less known for her technical prowess than her homemaking, but being a millionaire TV star who gets stuff for free probably doesn’t quite qualify one as “mainstream.”.text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

I’ll admit that I find myself being a bit more cynical about all of this based on recent experiences. For whatever reason, I find myself talking a lot to 3D printing companies these days. Promises of future successes are inevitably tempered with something approaching apology for the hype. The industry has never stopped growing, year over year.
But in the eyes of much of the public, it’s been an abject failure. The promise of a 3D printer in every home has been all but abandoned. It’s become a yardstick for hype and failed promises. It’s invoked regularly when talking about technologies like drones and virtual reality. And if nothing else, it’s a good object lesson in how a category’s hype cycle can be a big setup for failure.
Like industrial 3D printing, industrial drones are sticking around. Along with other technologies like robotics and automation, they have already proven invaluable for what the manufacturing world calls “the three Ds” — jobs that are dirty, dull and dangerous. I recently spoke to GE VP Colin Parris about the use of drones to survey flare stacks used in drilling operations in the Bering Sea. Drones replace the need for workers with mountain climbing skills and really good life insurance plans.

But industrial uses don’t always lead to mainstream acceptance, as we learned from 3D printing. Most consumer drones are prohibitively expensive for mainstream users. And the ones that aren’t are often a pretty crappy experience, not too far removed from the bad shopping mall kiosk helicopters that were good for about two flights. And like low-end VR offerings, having a bad, cheap first experience could be enough to put many users off the tech.

Of course, the drone/3D printing comparison isn’t an exact one-to-one. For one thing, the joys of drone flying will be immediate for many. And for another, while many drones take time to master, it’s not exactly on the same level as learning to create a complicated 3D model as is often mandatory in 3D printing.
And drones come with their own growing issues, including privacy and safety concerns that have led to increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration, among others. Trying to figure out precisely how legal it is to fly a drone around your neighborhood is pretty tricky — and from the looks of it, things don’t seem to be getting much easier, even after you go through what may or may not be an optional registration processing, pending appeal.
Still, with every subsequent generation, the category is more accessible. And photography and video will almost certainly be a large part of their path toward a more mainstream acceptance — that and the sheer fun of flying them around. But even with the far more affordable $499 price point on the Spark, the price is still too high for true mainstream adoption.
That doesn’t mean the space won’t get there. It’s just another reminder that mainstreaming doesn’t happen overnight.

British Airways has a problem. Its new IT system has completely crashed five times inside a year, and today it added a sixth global crash to the roster. All flights from Heathrow and Gatwick have been cancelled until at least 6pm in London tonight, affecting all BA flights globally. The airline is asking passengers not to come to the airports. The system failure also took out the BA website for two hours.
Travelers at airports serviced by BA are predictably flooding the company’s Twitter account with complaints.
The airline has said it has found no evidence of a cyberattack, despite some reports of BA staff telling passengers this. It’s highly unlikely to be a cyberattack at this point, but let’s keep our minds open.
At 1pm a British Airways spokesman said: “We have experienced a major IT system failure that is causing very severe disruption to our flight operations worldwide. The terminals at Heathrow and Gatwick have become extremely congested and we have cancelled all flights from Heathrow and Gatwick before 6pm UK time today, so please do not come to the airports.”
The failure has affected BA flights around the world, with planes being grounded and passengers stuck either in terminal buildings or actually on planes, with passengers unable to disembark due to gate shortages.
The failure comes as thousands of Britons head abroad for the long weekend with half-term school holidays next week.

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman announced today that he’s making a big bet on Change.org, the site for social justice petitions. Hoffman is leading a $30 million round, with other investors including big names like Bill Gates and Y Combinator president Sam Altman.
“Change.org, the global hub for collective action, is a crucial democratizing force in this era of growing civic participation,” wrote Reid Hoffman on LinkedIn. “It helps enable a world where you don’t need to hire a lobbyist to have real impact on the issues and policies that matter to you.”
The organization was founded in 2007 by CEO Ben Rattray. Since then, almost 200 million people around the world have used the site to raise awareness for a range of causes, including human rights, the environment, education and health issues.
Rattray wrote a post about the global mission. “We are in the early stages of the development of a new, more participatory form of democracy, and in order to realize the potential that technology has to transform civic engagement, we need to build tools that give us wider reach and enable deeper involvement,” he said.
The proverbial tongue-in-cheek in Silicon Valley is that people want to build things that “change the world.” This one actually does.
But they’re not a nonprofit, they’re a business. They make money by charging companies and nonprofits to sponsor petitions, which they say brought in $20 million in revenue per year. Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to keep them from laying off 30 percent of their staff in September. They have since introduced crowdfunding, which has generated “millions of dollars of revenue.”
This isn’t the first time that Hoffman bet on the Change.org team. In 2014, he was part of a large group of high-profile investors, including Richard Branson, Ashton Kutcher and Twitter co-founder Ev Williams.
They’ve raised more than $42 million dating back to 2012.
Google has launched a new venture capital program focused on artificial intelligence, Axios is reporting.
Google declined to comment on the report, which states that the initiative will be led by longtime Google VP of engineering Anna Patterson and involve a rotating cast of engineers instead of the venture investors who work for Alphabet Inc.’s corporate venture unit, GV.
It isn’t completely surprising that Google might create an investing practice around AI, particularly given Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s recent pronouncement that Google is becoming “AI first” rather than “mobile first.”
Indeed, AI was the running thread throughout the recent Google I/O developer conference, where the company introduced new tensor processing unit (TPU) chips that promise to more quickly train and run AI models for researchers and businesses; it also announced (among many other things) that its Google Assistant, the company’s virtual personal assistant that’s available on devices like the Google Home and Pixel phone, will soon grow more conversational.
Also potentially playing into this new development: Google’s recent acquisition of Kaggle, a platform that hosts data science and machine learning competitions.
According to Axios, Patterson and company will reportedly be co-investing with GV when it makes sense to do so. Check sizes, it says, will range from $1 million and $10 million to start, though it isn’t yet clear how much Google plans to commit to the program, yearly or otherwise.

This week, DJI announced a brand new drone, Mark Zuckerberg delivered the Harvard commencement speech and Airbnb’s internal data science program was announced. These are the top stories of the week. This post is also a newsletter, so you can sign up to have it delivered to your inbox on Saturday mornings. 
1. Mark Zuckerberg tells Harvard we need a new equal opportunity social contract  
Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard commencement speech centered around how we can improve life through big projects, equal opportunity and building both local and global community. He outlined a plan “to create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose.” Rather than focusing on the opportunities for the Harvard students graduating in front of him, he urged the students to ignite opportunities for those less fortunate.
2. Airbnb is running its own internal data science university 
If there’s one role that’s in demand in Silicon Valley, it’s data scientists. Every company has its own strategy for hiring and training, but Airbnb has taken things a step further. The company is running its own university-style program for data science, complete with a custom course-numbering system.

3. DJI announces its tiny new $499 Spark drone 
DJI held a live-streamed keynote, during which it announced its newest drone, the Spark. With a palm-sized body and sub-$500 price point, the company is taking some pretty significant steps beyond just photographers and videographers. It’s still a pretty expensive toy at the end of the day, but with the number of features the company is tossing in here, the notion of a solid drone for the rest of us just became a little more real.
4. Uber says it accidentally underpaid drivers in New York City
Uber was supposed to take a 25 percent cut from driver fares, after taxes and fees were taken into account, according to the terms of Uber’s 2014 driver agreement. But in New York, Uber accidentally calculated a higher commission that took into account the full fare, before taking into account taxes and other fees. Uber says it is fully prepared to refund that money to drivers in New York, plus interest. That will result in tens of millions of dollars in payouts for the company.
5. Jim Hackett is the new CEO of Ford
After a day of speculation, Ford named Jim Hackett, who had been running Ford’s Smart Mobility business, as the new CEO. The move signals the company’s ambitions in the connected car space. Hackett will replace Mark Fields, who is retiring.
6. Quora launches its first self-serve ad platform
Newly minted unicorn Quora launched its first self-serve ad platform. Advertisers both large and small will be able to create text-based ads and mobile app install ads — both of which look particularly native and non-intrusive.
7. Bitcoin surged past $2,000 for the first time
Bitcoin has been on a tear this year. That’s according to a range of bitcoin exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken. The valuation puts the total market cap of bitcoin — the total number of coins in circulation — at $32.92 billion. Here’s how to stage an initial coin offering. 
8. Peloton is the newest unicorn
Indoor fitness equipment company Peloton closed a $325 million Series E financing round, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. Spinning has turned out to be a big business, and this brand has been gaining traction in the at-home fitness space. Peloton’s $2,000 bikes have developed a cult following, mainly because of its live-streamed classes.
Weekend reads
The FCC published the notice of proposed rule-making that would roll back the 2015 Open Internet Order establishing net neutrality. Its first and primary justification for doing this is a way of defining broadband access that’s so backwards, it’s ridiculous. It would be funny, if the future of the internet didn’t depend on this incredibly disingenuous maneuvering.
“I attended Google I/O this week, and saw a lot of cool things,” writes columnist Jon Evans. “But what really hit home for me, at the keynote and the demos and the developer sessions, was just how dominant Google has become, in so many different domains … and, especially, how its only real competition comes from the four other tech behemoths who dominate our industry’s landscape.” More here.
As bitcoin continues to mature, there’s a new term we need to learn. WTF is an ICO? 
There are few verticals filled with more utopian dreams than the studios and startups building virtual and augmented reality experiences. While some are looking to craft 3D experiences that integrate into the real world, others are aiming to create massive worlds to which we can escape. The one thing many of them have in common, however, is that they are built on a game engine from a company called Unity. Here’s why Unity, which closed on $400 million in fresh funding this week, is poised to become the next tech giant. 
Robots are great at doing things they’ve been shown how to do, but when presented with a novel problem, such as an unfamiliar shape that needs to be gripped, they tend to choke. AI is helping there in the form of systems like Dex-Net, which uses deep learning to let a robotic arm improvise an effective grip for objects it’s never seen before.
The basic idea behind the system is rather like how we figure out how to pick things up. You see an object, understand its shape and compare it to other objects you’ve picked up in the past, then use that information to choose the best way to grab it.
Dex-Net doesn’t have the advantage of being a living person with eyes and a memory, so its creators gave it more than six million artificial 3D representations of objects and had it work out the best way, theoretically, to pick up each. In real life, the system looks at an object, compares its point cloud to those in its memory and picks what it thinks is the closest fit.
The researchers presented Dex-Net with dozens of objects it hadn’t seen before, and its chosen grip only failed one time. That suggests the system is fairly robust despite being trained on synthetic data — plus, it comes up with its candidate grip in an average of less than a second.

Dex-Net is the product of Berkeley roboticists, who are set to present the latest version of the system at a conference in July. They also plan to release the data set of objects and point clouds they’ve amassed.
At the Formula E Paris ePrix over the weekend, the driverless Roborace navigated a lap of the 1.9 km course all by itself — all 14 turns.
The autonomous car uses five lidar sensors, two radar sensors, 18 ultrasonic sensors, two optical speed sensors, six AI cameras and satellite positioning information to know where it is and navigate its route. All this data is processed by Nvidia’s Drive PX2, which can perform 24 trillion operations per second, according to a Roborace press release.
Which is fast. The Roborace car itself, however, is not. Yet.
The hardware is on board for some serious racing: four 300 kW motors and a 540 kW battery that can propel the car over 200 mph. But while it’s learning its route — and while the engineers are learning how the car learns — it fairly creeps along the track with a human-driven chaperone car following behind.
Check out the official video to see its first run in Paris. It’ll take another lap in Berlin during the next Formula E race and at races for the rest of the season.

KidPass, a monthly membership program that gives parents access to a variety of kid-friendly activities across their city, has raised $5.1 million in Series A funding, the startup reported this week. Currently live in New York, the new funds will allow the service to expand to new markets including L.A., San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and Chicago.
The round was led by Javelin Venture Partners, with participation from new and existing investors, including CoVenture, Y Combinator, TIA Ventures, Bionic Fund, Cocoon Ignite Ventures, and FJ Labs among others.
Jed Katz, Managing Director at Javelin, and Rachel Jarrett, President of Zola, will join KidPass’s Board of Directors as a result of this funding.
The idea for KidPass is similar to ClassPass – a subscription service for adults looking to try different fitness classes around town, like yoga, cycling, Pilates, dance, and others. Though KidPass has a similar name, the two companies are not related.
However, KidPass works a lot like ClassPass does. Customers pay one monthly fee then can try classes all over town.
KidPass co-founder Solomon Liou explains he and his fellow founders, Aaron Kaufman, Chhay Chhun, and Olivia Ballvé, decided to start the company after becoming parents themselves and became frustrated with how difficult and time-consuming it was to find great activities for their kids.
“While there were mobile apps to instantly book restaurants, doctors, and taxis on-demand, there wasn’t anything like that for kids’ activities,” says Liou. “In fact, the main way that parents discover kids classes today is still through word of mouth from talking to other parents, or using Google Search and going through page after page of results. It’s time consuming and difficult to navigate, with many businesses not even having a presence online,” he adds.
Plus, even when you found a class, many providers only took in-person registrations, or required you to book upfront payments for semester-long programs – all before you know if your child will even like the course, Liou notes.
To use KidPass today, parents choose from one of three membership options which start at $49 per month. These subscriptions offer credits that can be used to pay for the various activities, like dance classes, arts and crafts activities, sports, museum classes and camps, science and technology classes, swimming classes, kids cooking classes, fitness classes, academic classes and many more.

At present, there are over 900 activity providers using the platform, like Gymboree, Kidville, Music Together, Super Soccer Stars, Physique Swimming, The Craft Studio, Chocolate Works, the Museum of Modern Art, YMCA, JCC, and others.
Since its launch in January 2016, 20,000 families have signed up for the service and have booked over 100,000 activities. There are today over 3,000 subscribers in NYC, and the KidPass is growing at 20 to 30 percent nearly every month, Liou says.
The service works by offering parents a certain number of credits that can be used per month to book activities. The basic tier includes 10 credits and supports up to 2 children. The middle tier supports up to 5 kids and includes 25 credits. And the highest tier supports unlimited kids and 50 credits.
Some activities only take one or two credits, but other premium activities and camps could take 10 or more. Any unused credits will roll over for three months, in case parents get busy and can’t use the credits right away.
This credits-based system could help KidPass avoid the problems that plagued ClassPass – that company eventually had to raise prices and ditch its unlimited tier in order to stay afloat.
“[The use of credits] allows us to charge varying prices to the parents depending on the activity’s cost to make sure that parents get a great deal, while ensuring that the unit economics work well for us as a marketplace supporting both businesses and families,” explains Liou. “We have had positive gross margins as a business because of our business model, and we intentionally avoided any unlimited plans that could be highly unprofitable,” he says.
There are a few reasons why parents would want to pay for a service like this instead of booking directly with a class provider.
Most importantly, however, is that KidPass provides a means of discovery for children’s activities. In the large markets KidPass serves, there are so many activities available that parents may not know of all their available options. They also might not want to commit to booking multiple sessions with an activity provider before being able to try out the class or camp first.
KidPass isn’t the only startup tackling this space. It competes with others like Sawyer and Pearachute, for example.
In addition to expanding to new markets, KidPass is developing software for activity providers that helps with class management, online registrations scheduling and payments. This software is in private beta with some KidPass partners.

Sprig, the startup that makes and delivers its own food, is shutting down today, The Information reports. TechCrunch has since obtained a copy of the email Sprig is sending to customers today.
“It is with a heavy heart that my co-founders and I share that Sprig, Inc. will be shutting down the app today,” Sprig CEO Gagan Biyani wrote in an email customers will receive shortly. “We apologize to those of you who relied on Sprig for daily meals, and to our extended Sprig team for how this will impact them.”
So if you are trying to order food from Sprig today, you’re out of luck because today is Sprig’s last day of operations. This doesn’t strike me as a huge surprise because Sprig has been experimenting with some interesting strategies in the last few months. For example, it opened its kitchen on Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco to start serving food to walk-in customers, and also started delivering its food via Caviar. Sprig had also been struggling in Chicago, where it laid off seven people and paused its operations last July.
Sprig’s shutdown will affect around 200 people, including part-time employees, TechCrunch has learned. There will be a severance package, and, at this point, the goal is to help connect now-former Sprig employees with other companies that are hiring.
Sprig, which had raised $56.7 million to cook and deliver its own meals, is not alone in the on-demand food delivery graveyard. It joins the likes of Maple, which shut down earlier this month, SpoonRocket and India’s Ola. Meanwhile, Munchery has been on the struggle bus for a while, so maybe it’s only a matter of time before Munchery joins the crew.
The on-demand food business is tough, especially if you’re trying to handle all elements of the experience, like sourcing the food, cooking the food and delivering it. It’s a lot.
“No question, I’m sad that the Sprig model did not work out — but the food delivery space on the whole is growing,” Biyani wrote. “The demand for Sprig’s convenient, high-quality food was always incredibly high, but the complexity of owning meal production through delivery at scale was a challenge. After spending four years as a food-tech industry insider, I’m amazed at what the space has become. Food is one of the foundations of society and I believe strongly that it must become more sustainable and ethical.”
Here’s the email Sprig is sending to its customers:
Dear friends and customers,
It is with a heavy heart that my co-founders and I share that Sprig, Inc. will be shutting down the app today. We apologize to those of you who relied on Sprig for daily meals, and to our extended Sprig team for how this will impact them.
Food delivery has a bright future, and I’m proud of the work we have done at Sprig that has had a positive impact on the space.
To our employees: thank you. You provided the best customer service in the industry and created innovations that were admired by your peers. You created a daily rotating menu with hundreds of different dishes served, you prepared the most delicious delivery food I’ve ever tasted, you built a 100% self-engineered system that delivered industry-leading transparency and accountability in our ingredient sources and nutritional data, and you created a logistics engine that let us bring food to people hot and ready to eat often in less than 15 minutes. All of our employees, including our servers, kitchen, hub and HQ staff, will receive two months pay as part of the close down. More importantly, we will be hosting career days to help you on your next path. You are armed with experiences that will help accelerate your career and we will be there to help you succeed. (Note: If you are a company that is hiring and interested in talking to our team, please e-mail us at jobs@sprig.com.)
To our customers: you have been our inspiration on this journey. Thank you for the tremendous word-of-mouth growth and feedback you’ve provided us: your messages, phone calls, photos, and reviews made this all worthwhile. We’re proud to have delivered millions of meals to you, and hope you keep demanding the best from the companies that feed you. Four years ago, food delivery was a pain — expensive, hard to find, and poor quality. Today, there are thousands of restaurants delivering amazing food to you; we’re hopeful for the future.
To the press and public: No question, I’m sad that the Sprig model did not work out — but the food delivery space on the whole is growing. The demand for Sprig’s convenient, high-quality food was always incredibly high, but the complexity of owning meal production through delivery at scale was a challenge. After spending four years as a food-tech industry insider, I’m amazed at what the space has become. Food is one of the foundations of society and I believe strongly that it must become more sustainable and ethical. I’m hopeful that the food delivery companies that are succeeding will make this a priority. Please continue to help us inspire change: encourage sustainable food systems, better treatment of workers and more awareness of nutrition. These are serious issues and they cannot have enough attention.
As for me, my primary goal for the coming weeks is to ensure our team members find their next steps. After that, some time for personal reflection, then off to the next venture.
Thank you for everything,
Gagan
I’m in touch with Sprig but the company said to refer to the email for official comments.
The UK Prime Minister is using the annual G7 summit of seven of the world’s major industrialized democracies to push for more to be done about online extremism, including co-ordinating on ways to force social media platforms to be more pro-active about removing and reporting extremist content to authorities.
Theresa May is chairing a counter-terrorism session at the G7 summit today in Sicily, meeting with the leaders of the US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and representatives of the European Union.
It’s a drum her own Home Secretary has been banging at home in recent months. And just the latest instance of the political thumbscrews being applied to social media giants.
In Germany in April, for example, the government backed proposals to levy fines of up to €50 million on social media firms that fail to promptly remove illegal hate speech from their platforms.
Before leaving for the summit yesterday the BBC reported May planned to lead a discussion with her fellow world leaders on how to “work together to prevent the plotting of terrorist attacks online and to stop the spread of hateful extremist ideology on social media”.
According to The Guardian, she is expected to tell her G7 counterparts that the fight against ISIS is shifting from the “battlefield to the Internet”, and to urge them to co-operate to enforce stricter rules on social media companies.
Specifically, the newspaper said May will press for social media firms to:

develop tools that could automatically identify and remove harmful material based on what it contains and who posted it
tell the authorities when harmful material is identified so that action can be taken
revise conditions and industry guidelines to make them absolutely clear about what constitutes harmful material

The move follows another terror attack on UK soil after a suicide bomber blew himself up at a pop concert in Manchester on Monday evening, killing and wounding multiple people.
Although there have been no suggestions so far that social media platforms could have thwarted the attack by providing pre-emptive intelligence.
Indeed, the UK government’s own counterterrorism policies are facing the most uncomfortable questions in the wake of the attack, given the bomber had been repeatedly reported to police in the years prior. Yet was not, evidently, stopped from obtaining the know-how or materials to construct a bomb. Nor from successful executing an attack.
Other recent instances of terrorism on UK soil have included an attack in Westminster in March, when a lone attacker used a car and knives to attack pedestrians and police. The Westminster attacker apparently sent a WhatsApp message minutes before commencing the attack saying he was waging jihad in revenge for Western foreign policy.
While a homemade bomb planted on a London Underground Tube train in October last year, which failed to go off, had apparently been put together by the teenage perpetrator following instructions found online.
The problem for UK security services is they are under-resourced to meet the scale of the threat. As Muddassar Ahmed writes today in The Independent, there are around 3,000 people on UK terror watch lists — yet only 4,000 staff in MI5, the domestic intelligence agency. The agency simply does not have the manpower to closely monitor so many potential terrorists.
May has also faced specific criticism in the wake of the Manchester attack for cuts the government made to UK police numbers. She had apparently been warned two years ago that cuts to community policing in Manchester could threaten counter terrorism efforts in the city. The optics at this point look terrible.
Her G7 comments therefore risk looking like an attempt to shift both blame and responsibility — with May leaning out to apply pressure on social media firms in a bid to effectively outsource the responsibility for terrorism monitoring to tech platforms. At a time when her own government’s policy towards domestic policing and counterterrorism resourcing looks to be lacking.
Perhaps the most significant push she’s making at the G7 is for the countries to co-ordinate on revising industry guidelines on harmful material and on the conditions they place on tech firms. Although, according to Guardian sources, she’s not advocating for financing penalties at this stage (such as those already on the table in Germany).
The paper quotes a senior government source saying May wants the the G7 nations to “move towards a common approach focused on the need to defeat [Isis]. In particular she wants to use G7 to call for the members to adopt a collective approach when working with tech companies on this agenda, and she will say that the industry has a social responsibility to do more to remove harmful content from its networks”.
However, whether she will be able to convince President Trump to join a collective attempt to apply extra pressure on US tech giants is not clear.
Much of what she’s generally calling for social media firms to do is already arguably taking place. For example, Facebook has previously said it is working on tools and technologies to try to automate flagging up extremist content, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly discussing the potential of AI to help with content review.
Facebook also emphasizes that it does already reach out to authorities if it finds evidence of an imminent threat of harm or terrorism. And does already use AI and image and video matching technology when it identifies terrorist content to try to unearth related content and accounts, for example.
That said, ongoing criticism of the effectiveness of Facebook’s content moderation processes underline the scale of the company’s own challenge on this front. And the 3,000 additional moderation staff announced by Zuckerberg in the wake of another content moderation scandal represents a tiny drop in the ocean for a platform with nearly two billion users.
With the additional moderator headcount Facebook will still only have 7,500 people employed to review all flagged content — so more than MI5’s headcount but relatively far fewer, given the staggering scale of its content moderation challenge, which runs the gamut from reviewing and making judgements on extremism/terrorist related content; to child abuse and other criminal content; to hate speech and racism; to violence and cruelty of all stripes. All the while aiming to balance ‘safety with openness’, as it puts it, i.e. preferring the sharing of controversial/disturbing content — provided it’s not illegal/sadistic. (A very tricky balancing act to pull off, evidently.)
In a statement today responding to May’s comments on extremist content, Facebook’s Monika Bickert, head of global policy management, said: “We want to provide a service where people feel safe. That means we do not allow groups or people that engage in terrorist activity, or posts that express support for terrorism. Using a combination of technology and human review, we work aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it — and if there is an emergency involving imminent harm to someone’s safety, we notify law enforcement. Online extremism can only be tackled with strong partnerships. We have long collaborated with policymakers, civil society, and others in the tech industry, and we are committed to continuing this important work together.”
Twitter did not provide a statement when contacted for comment but a spokesman pointed to what he said are proactive technological steps the platform takes with regards countering violent extremism, such as using technological tools to surface accounts that are promoting terrorism. He noted, for example, that between July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, a total of 376,890 Twitter accounts were suspended for this reason — with 74 per cent of those having been surfaced by the platform’s tech tools rather than via user reports.
Update: In a joint statement after the meeting, The Guardian reports the G7 leaders backed May’s calls for social media firms to do more to tackle online extremism. “We agreed a range of steps the G7 could take to strengthen its work with tech companies on this vital agenda. We want companies to develop tools to identify and remove harmful materials automatically,” she said.

“Can anyone tell me what this is?” the teacher asked. Outside the rust rains had come again and the building reacted by assembling a nano sphere shield. They would be inside until it stopped. None of the children were old enough for the skin adaptation. She might as well keep them busy.
She held up half of a glass object, the top edge crude and sharp.
“A cup?” asked Sarla.
“Close. It’s been broken. It’s from the 21st century, circa 2017. Let me show you what it used to look like,” said the teacher. She turned the Time Jog to find images of the object in its prime. There was a website – an old page of text that had once been viewed on a glass screen – that showed the item whole. It was some sort of silicate jar with red beads inside, much like the sand outside the school. She projected the image in the air in front of her.
“An hourgulp,” said Rudo. He had been weaned off of ed-stim and could finally focus on human faces. He searched for a reaction in his teacher’s. She smiled.
“Very good,” she said. “But they called it an ‘hourglass’ back then. That’s an excellent answer, though,” she said. She glanced to her periphery to bring up his daily log and noted his face-to-face interaction improvement. His overall score inched out of the red and into the yellow.
He made a smile like a grimace. She noted that, too. Facial expressions were an indicator of a healthier mind..text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

“Before we came to this planet, our home, the planet Earth was full of artisanal objects that they sent up the gravity well in hopes of recreating our old life. They had special writing tools called pencils and objects made of paper that they could read with their eyes. They also had special foods, like pickled cucumbers,” said the teacher.
“That’s discussing,” said Rudo.
“Disgusting, yes. They didn’t understand the things we do now,” said the teacher. “They also had things like this, things that had little value but were still used in order to improve their moods, like the drugs we use now. We have little use for an object like this now but at the time it cost a very reasonable $12,000. It was made by a great artist, Marc Newson. He once made an object that all of the earth humans adored. It was their god.”
“Dollars?” asked Pip. He was still ed-stimming but something passed through to his subconscious and he woke out of his educational reverie.

“Dollars are old money,” said the teacher.
“Wasn’t that a lot?” asked Sarla. “I saw an old YuTubez about dollars. They were expensive.”
“Not much more than a printed organ costs today. They didn’t have important things to spend their money on so they spent it on silly things. Remember, this was one hundred years ago. Times have changed,” said the teacher.
The children nodded. Many of them had had their biomes replaced at the age of five. They remembered their parents worrying about the cost and they remembered the pain. But now they could breathe the methane outside. So they understood that now you spent money on important things.
“What’s a Hodinkee?” asked Pip.
“We don’t know. But what is important is that we understand that this is how the early people told time. It was very sad for them and they were very naive to spend so much on a glass object,” said the teacher.
“We’ll never be that dumb again,” said Rudo.
Some of the kids giggled. Pip fell back into edu-stim and began to drool. The teacher sent a hover to clean him.
As the hover washed the boy’s face the teacher looked out past the horizon of the red, dead planet and remembered the YuTubez of the earth shattering, 15 cities blossoming red then black, the final ships escaping her orbit and entering the future. Then she looked back at her students, ten children, five stuck in a virtual dream world, their metallic carapaces glinting in the soft light above. The burning rain outside slid off the nano spheres and hissed on the ground. We’ll never be that dumb again, she thought, imagining how care-free humans had been, buying needless hourglasses while their politicians plotted the End War. Let’s hope so.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin is building a massive airship, we learned in April, and now The Guardian reports some additional details about the purpose and nature of the project. It’ll be used both as a private luxury air yacht for Brin and his retinue, as well as for humanitarian aid purposes. Also, it’ll be the largest aircraft in the world, at nearly 200 meters (656 feet) in length. Go big or go biggest.
While it would be the biggest active aircraft, it would still be smaller than either the Hindenburg or USS Macon airships from history – the latter of which occupied the same hangar where Brin is currently building his new aerial masterpiece. Its construction is being funded entirely with his own money (of which he as plenty), and once completed, it’ll be used to ferry supplies including food on humanitarian missions around the world, as well as for personal intercontinental travel.
Brin’s longtime personal fascination with zeppelins and airships helped fuel his interest in building his own, and he enlisted the help of various experts in the field, including former NASA programs director Alan Weston. While Brin originally hoped to use hydrogen (yes, Hindenburg-style hydrogen) to lift the craft, it’s currently being developed to employ helium, in accordance with FAA regulations.
No word yet on when Brin’s airborne conveyance will actually take to the skies, but it’ll be hard to miss when it does, given the scope and scale of the project. Many of us probably remember gawking at the ocean-going yachts of Silicon Valley’s brightest stars from the first big tech boom – maybe airships will be the luxe transportation item de rigueur for the next generation.

The startup insurance application processor Quilt has added a life insurance product to its portfolio and has begun pitching its digital enrollment in 37 states across the country.
In partnership with Generation Life (a 50-year-old insurance company that was recently acquired by Swiss Re), Quilt is looking to make the process of applying for life insurance easier so that the under-insured population of millennials can have the coverage they need.
Quilt’s digital application can cut the approval process for life insurance policies of up to $1 million from months to a mere 15 minutes, the company said.
The company wouldn’t say what would make someone ineligible for a policy, but noted that “many” of the company’s existing customers could qualify for approval online.
“We are thrilled about this new collaboration and look forward to working with Quilt. Together we will provide high quality products and services to help more young people get life insurance and protect their families,” said Philip Walker, CEO of Generation Life Insurance, in a statement.
Walker, who also serves as the chief executive officer of iptiQ Americas by Swiss Re (according to his LinkedIn profile) has a long history in the insurance business… and the connection to Swiss Re is invaluable for a company like Quilt.
It’s important to note while Quilt is selling life insurance products, it’s not handling the policies themselves.
Basically the company is trying to create a better user experience for new customers, rather than reinvent the policies themselves.
The company launched in 2016 with a renters insurance portal that would speed up the approval process for that type of insurance product. Now, with Generation Life, the company is expanding into its second insurance vertical.
Ultimately, Quilt wants to partner with one insurance provider across a range of categories including travel insurance and pet insurance next in line (not necessarily in that order).
And while Quilt won’t hold the policies, it will handle the process of settling claims in most categories (life insurance… is a different animal, according to Quilt chief executive Blair Baldwin).
And while insurers get a bad rap, Baldwin says it’s mostly undeserved.
“The big carriers make all of their money on their investments,” Baldwin says. “They target 10% returns for the policy business…. They’re really not trying to screw the customer.”
In a sense the industry is maligned because it’s outdated and misunderstood, according to Baldwin.
“You can say what you will about legacy organizations where the average age is 57 and they’re all predominantly older, white gentlemen. They’re trying to run a business and they’re trying to do right by the customer. They just have an outdated mindset,” Baldwin says.
The industry may be old and stodgy, but Quilt is hoping that with its new enrollment process, it can get you covered (I see what they did there).
 
Share economy startups which allow someone to ‘share’ their labour or skills have proliferated over the last few years. Even simple ‘share your skills’ communities with no commercial model have appeared such as Impossible.
Now these companies are joined by Pickle, a peer-to-peer mobile app that enables users to do ‘jobs’ for one another. Founder Daneh Westropp decided to create the app after running away from home and school at the age of 15 and realising that young people are often looking for ways to sustain themselves and make themselves independent.
Users simply say what they want or need and how much they are willing to pay (if anything), others who are willing and capable then ask questions, negotiate and accept. The money is brokered through PayPal and once the Job is completed both parties rate each other. The app takes 20% from each completed job, 10% from either side of the transaction. The company is aiming to raise a seed round. There is an iOS and Android version.
But there’s a twist. Within the app users can ‘dare’ each other, the idea being to add an entertainment element into the mix. And this is a social jobs app with hashtags, @user and threaded comments.
Although all this sounds pretty fanciful, Westropp says the target audience is “Gen Z” and Young Millennials who want to translate their interests into the gig economy. In other words they pick up tasks that are actually in line with what areas of work they are interested in.
She says so far the app has garnered 90,000 users since its launch in January, entirely organically. She adds it is not a TaskRabbit in that it contains dares or challenges making it more like a “social platform for jobs”.
Westropp says Taskrabbit and Bizzby operate “inflexible business models, with long verification processes, limited tasks which translate into expensive and boring interactions with the consumer.” This means they are more like traditional job agencies with no community.
The founding team is Daneh Westropp, Bee Binitie, Dmtry Yhans. So far it has two Angel investors. Frederic Hofmann who is a director at Anthemis group (Fin tech investment company) and Nick Robbins.
Who knows, maybe it will take off with this generation. The challenge it faces is what happens when a young person answers a job that turns out not to be what they thought it was. There is a reason their competitors have longer verification processes rather than none.
In her defence Westropp says they plan a number of safety measures including Phone number verification; Social Network Verification; Admin Moderation; sending your location; Ratings. In addition every job post has a like, dislike and report function which encourages the community to flag jobs that seem suspicious or break community rules. Jobs that are disliked/reported are flagged to the Pickle team, who investigate the issue further.
Engage Ventures is a new, Atlanta-based accelerator fund for early-stage deals. It isn’t managing a ton of money — it just closed on $15 million for its debut effort — but it does have some interesting financial backers.
Unlike a corporate venture unit that’s trying to satisfy one company, Engage has instead secured its capital commitments from 10 Fortune 1000 companies that are, frankly, all over the map, and include AT&T, Chick-fil-A, Cox Enterprises, Delta Air Lines, Georgia-Pacific, Georgia Power Foundation, Intercontinental Exchange, Invesco, The Home Depot and UPS.
The idea, says managing director Thiago Olson, is to ensure Engage’s portfolio companies have as many potential partners, as well as acquirers, as possible.
It’s an interesting proposal, and one we saw more recently and on a much larger scale with Fifth Wall Ventures, a real estate-focused venture firm that earlier this month closed on $212 million in commitments from an array of heavy-hitting corporations in the real estate industry. (Among Fifth Wall’s investors are CBRE, the brokerage and real estate services giant, and Lowe’s, the home improvement franchise.)
Engage isn’t a micro fund, exactly. It’s more like the accelerator spin-off of an Atlanta-based venture firm called Tech Square Ventures, where Olson, a former entrepreneur, is also a venture partner. The outfit is being run independently, however, and it plans to invest in 16 companies each year, focusing in spring and summer on eight companies for three months at a stretch, beginning this August.
Other things to know: There is no sector focus. A startup’s initial product should be built or near completion. And interested startups will receive $75,000. In exchange, Engage is asking for upwards of 6 percent of their businesses. (Olson says Engage will take a smaller ownership stake in startups that are further along or have already raised some outside funding.)
Engage is also promising office space to companies that need it, along with mentorship from a network of local founders and operators who intend to aid the startups with their growth tactics, pricing structures and go-to-market strategies.
Naturally, introductions to Engage’s 10 corporate backers are designed to sweeten the deal, too.
If you’re thinking that Engage sounds an awful lot like the hundreds of other new accelerator programs around world, we’re with you. (As of last year, at least, there were 160 of them in the U.S. alone.)
But it is smartly taking advantage of a growing trend — that of giant companies trying to keep up with the technological shifts that could impact their businesses, and that are willing to work together if it helps to keep them relevant.
Startups can certainly benefit from that trend, too.
To become a member of Engage’s inaugural class, here is more information. Engage, which is based in Georgia Tech’s Technology Square, began taking applications yesterday.

After a painful first-quarter miss, Snap, the parent company of the popular social app Snapchat, is looking to avoid the same fate in the second.
According to Digiday, Snap is working to drive new and increased business ahead of the end of its second quarter. To do so, the company is said to be cutting deals. In the words of the report, Snap is “looking to goose its ad business with offers of discounts and incentives to ad buyers.”
At least some of the discounts have an end date, it appears. The same report, citing “multiple agency executives,” notes that Snap’s proffered “bonuses, discount coupons and media credits for ad buys” are tied to the close of the second quarter. If the incentives work as likely intended, Snap could book new top line inside the current quarter that might help it meet or best market expectations.

Of course, incentives are not new, and potentially using discounts to drive growth is not something inherently bad. Snap declined to comment on the purported deals.
After its first-quarter miss, Snap’s share fell steeply, erasing much of the company’s post-IPO gains. Snap, which went public at $17 per share, traded as high as $29.44. It’s worth $21.30 today. Therefore, it is not surprising that Snap wants to avoid another embarrassing earnings miss. And to see the company allegedly turn to discounts with expiration windows is not an utter shock.
There is a bit more to the story, however, that we should understand by viewing Snap’s first quarter’s results inside of proper historical context.
Snap’s first quarter
Grounding Snap’s discounting push are its first-quarter results: The company grew rapidly, lost billions and missed expectations on both ends of its line. Snap reported first quarter revenue of $149.65 million. The street had anticipated a $157.98 million tally.
The company was expected to be deeply unprofitable in the quarter, due in part to one-time share-based compensation expenses. Even so, Snap bested the market’s expectation of a $1.92 per share loss with a steeper $2.31 per-share deficit.
And finally, Snap’s growth in daily active users, or DAUs, fell 2 million under the expected tally of 168 million.
That is broad context for why Snap may be pushing hard to ensure that it doesn’t miss again in the second quarter. A similar setback to its share price will put it either at or below its IPO price, a dramatic repudiation of the young company.

Snapchat Revenue (in millions)Create column charts

Second quarter dreamin’
As such, Snap must not miss when it reports its second-quarter results. But there is something lurking beneath the firm’s first-quarter miss that is interesting for us to consider: seasonality. Or perhaps more clearly: too much seasonality, and too soon.
In its S-1, Snap noted that it seasonality impact its business. That fact surprised no one. Ad-based businesses often see more sales during the fourth quarter when holiday buying cycles push consumer spend up. Brands, naturally, want a chunk of those dollars, and they spend to get them.
Snap’s fourth quarter was gangbusters, with the firm reporting $165.68 million in revenue, up from $32.72 million during the fourth quarter of the preceding year. If the sheer magnitude of growth between Snap’s results compared to the year-ago period surprises you, bear in mind that Snap is a very young business, with fewer than four quarters of positive gross margins under its belt, including the first of this year.
The company’s year-over-year results were impressive. But also notable was the firm’s history of continuing to grow sequentially — that is, from one quarter to the next — despite the impact of seasonality. More simply, through the 2015 holiday cycle, Snap’s revenue grew sequentially in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the seasonally-amplified fourth quarter of 2015.
The company generated $32.72 million in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $38.79 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2016. That gain was smaller than other sequentially-derived revenue gains listed in its S-1, but it showed that, at the time, Snap was growing so quickly that even the impact of seasonality couldn’t knock it off its upward sequential path.

Its forward momentum was greater than the potential for a slow first quarter, compared to the expectedly hot preceding fourth quarter. The company failed to repeat the feat in the first quarter of 2017.
New year, new results
If you recall, Snap’s first quarter brought in $149.65 million in revenue. And, as we listed a moment ago, Snap’s fourth quarter of the preceding year saw $165.68 million in top line. The second figure, from the earlier quarter, is larger than what the company reported in the first quarter. That’s a sequential decline in revenue.
Why do we care? Because as we try to understand the company’s first-quarter miss and its rush to cement the second quarter, we need to have the company’s history in mind. And, of course, historical analogs.
After all Snap, for all its hype, is another social company that sells ads. That’s not precisely new, though Snap is certainly, from a feature perspective, different than Twitter, for example. And, until recently, it was differentiated from products inside the Facebook orbit.
This brings us to a question: Is it normal for a company of Snap’s age to see seasonality impact its revenue in terms of driving its sequential revenue down? Let’s ask Ben Thompson.
Thompson, following Snap’s results, noted on Stratchery that the historical record is not overly kind to the company in this area. Thompson looked at the past results of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Snap in the following way: After one of the companies started to grow at “>100% […] year-over-year,” how long did it take for the firm to see a seasonally bolstered fourth quarter followed by a sequentially smaller first quarter?
Google won with nine years. Facebook and Twitter both rocked four. Snap, using Thompson’s results, made it just one year.
The obvious inference from the difference is that Snap’s business is operating in a different fashion than the other listed companies, two of which are in its social space.
Its quicker-to-declines results are hard to read positively, except the following perspective: Snap grew so quickly that vetting it against the results of historically similar companies is silly. That sort of argument works for private companies that want to present adjusted EBITDA as profit and other such silly things. We can discount it.
Investors’ expectations
Spry readers will have caught our inconsistency by now, so let’s address it.
That Snap’s revenue fell from the fourth quarter to the first is simple. But, if we compare investor expectations for the first quarter to what happened in the fourth, the market actually anticipated the decline. Bringing the numbers back to you here, investors expected Snap to report $157.98 million, which is still a lighter result than the firm’s fourth-quarter sum.
So, investors were, in fact, ready to allow Snap to snap its record of sequential revenue growth regardless. Again, interpretation is yours, but I have a hard time finding the inordinately bullish in that fact.
All this brings us back to Snap’s second quarter sprint, which takes on extra weight in light of the preceding. Snap not only fell behind historical antecedents’ results but fell under the already low bar that investors set for it, regarding sequential revenue growth consistency.
That’s doubly not good.

You’d be forgiven if you can’t be bothered to drag yourself to the store to shop for shoes and clothes and things for your bedroom. The internet is there for you, after all. But if you don’t know what you want? Well, I guess there is an app for that. And Judah Friedlander wants to take it on.
In this episode of Judah vs. the Machines, Friedlander, a self-described shoe expert because he “has feet,” tries to be better at shopping for three human guinea pigs than an app called Operator.
After standing in phone booths with no phones, not playing pool with pool players, poking fun at a dead plant and engaging in one awkward handshake, Friedlander sat down with three people who can’t bear to shop for themselves and have no idea what they want. To determine the best options for them, he asked them intently about their likes and dislikes, their fears and motivations and their worldly desires to feel refreshed upon waking up.
For his part in the competition between man and AI, we see Friedlander make the very human decision to search Google, the trick up his sleeve, for the items the three shoppers seek. Meanwhile, Operator does its deed using some AI smarts Friedlander decidedly lacks.
In the end, the shoppers had the opportunity to choose between products selected by the human-curated chatbot and those selected by Friedlander. Watch the video above to find out who shops the best and whether there is an answer to Friedlander’s burning question: Are there volcanoes in Austria?

It was a long road that took the two founders of Boxbot from drinks at Drake’s Dealership to winning the prestigious Pear Berkeley Challenge, but both Austin Oehlerking and Mark Godwin are very at home on the road.
The two had successful careers at Tesla and Uber, respectively, two companies that are inarguably on the vanguard of the autonomous driving revolution. But Godwin and Oehlerking both had been bitten by the startup bug, and wanted to solve the problem of last-mile delivery.
The still-in-stealth technology they developed was so impressive that it won the Pear competition — an annual event sponsored by the firm of the same name that awards $250,000 to a startup founded by students, alumna or professors from the University of Berkeley — along with some seed investments from House Capital, Afore Capital and The Graduate Syndicate.
Given their pedigrees — even before joining Uber and Tesla — it’s little wonder that Godwin and Oehlerking took the top prize.
The 35-year-old Godwin began working with drone technology while at Berkeley, doing research for the Office of Naval Research. Godwin then became part of the team that Berkeley fielded alongside the University of Sydney to compete in the DARPA Urban Grand Challenge.
He then went on to found a company called Automa Systems, an early Uber competitor that eventually turned into an Uber for trucking. That company was on the cusp of signing a term sheet and raising capital when Uber approached Godwin with an offer he couldn’t refuse.

For Oehlerking, the path was a little bit less circuitous, but no less impressive. After attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergrad, Oehlerking took a job as the director of vehicle engineering for Arcimoto, a Eugene, Ore.-based company making electric three-wheelers.
The 30-year-old co-founder then went back to grad school to do more work on electric vehicles, and landed a job at Tesla after graduation, where he worked on their partnership with Toyota, working on the Rav 4 drive train and then on the Model S.
Knowing that he wanted to run his own firm, Oehlerking returned to the East Coast to get a business degree from Harvard and then made his way back out West yet again.
The two men were introduced through a mutual friend from Harvard Business School, and were both on the same messaging channel for Stanford and Harvard alums interested in new mobility technologies.

Those common interests spurred Oehlerking and Godwin to launch Boxbot. And while the company is still in stealth, one could imagine that their last-mile delivery solution will combine aspects of autonomy and drones.
A longtime supporter of student efforts a Stanford, Pear has been active investing in companies from the other side of the bridge thanks to the talent that’s been on display, according to Pejman Nozad.
“UC Berkeley is a boiling ocean of entrepreneurs,” says Nozad in a statement. “The next big thing might be coming from the other side of the bridge!”
The $250,000 equity commitment that Nozad and his partner make in the winning Berkeley company comes with a nod to the university through a 10 percent gift of Pear’s equity stake back to the university.
“We are excited for this high-caliber technology team and we appreciate Pear VC for its contribution to Berkeley’s vibrant new venture ecosystem,” said Ikhlaq Sidhu, founder of Berkeley’s Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology (SCET).
Businesses usually spend lots of time and money trying of attract potential customers. Now a startup called Riley aims to help them prioritize those sales leads.
Riley was part of the winter class at Y Combinator. (In fact, CEO Daniel Ahmadizadeh said he and his co-founder Helson Taveras applied several times with different products and ideas before getting in.) The startup is announcing today that it has raised $3.1 million in seed funding.
The current version of Riley is focused on real estate agents. If you see an ad or listing for an agent who’s using Riley and you decide to give them your information, you’ll get a text message within a few minutes from the agent’s “office manager” or “assistant,” asking some basic questions about you and what you’re looking for.
So even if the agent is busy or sleeping, the potential customer still gets a response right away. And it goes beyond being a simple auto-responder — Riley has a team of live concierges (Ahmadizadeh said they’re mostly college students for now) who follow scripts. Over time, as the real estate agents rate their performance and review their scripts, the concierges should get better.
And after each conversation, Riley can tell the agent which leads should be pursued first.

“When the real estate agent wakes up in the morning, they’ll know which hot lead they should focus on, versus the nine other cold leads that came in the middle of the night,” Ahmadizadeh said.
 Riley’s funding comes from YC, FundersClub, Social Capital, Fuel Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Liquid 2 Ventures, Rough Draft Ventures and angel investors including WayUp CEO Liz Wessel and YC’s Michael Seibel and Paul Buchheit.
Ahmadizadeh said Riley has already built software to make the interaction easier for the concierges, and over time, he hopes to automate more of the process — though even under the current system, Riley is already managing more than 100,000 conversations each month.
In addition, he eventually plans to expand beyond working with real estate agents: “Our thought longer term is to be vertical agnostic — not just real estate — and communication-channel agnostic.”

U.S. consumers may be cutting the cord with pay TV, but that doesn’t mean they’ve stopped watching the big screen, according to new data released by Nielsen this morning. In a report detailing the viewing habits of U.S. adults, the measurement firm found that 92 percent of all viewing among U.S. adults (those 18 and older) still takes place on the TV screen.
The data was collected during the fourth quarter of 2016, and compares TV screen-based viewing to viewing on PCs, tablets, smartphones, and other TV-connected devices like game consoles and streaming players such as the Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku and others.

By combining the gross minutes viewed on TV (82.1 percent) with those minutes viewed using TV-connected devices (10.2 percent), Nielsen determined that the lion’s share of video watching continues to be on the big screen. Meanwhile, PCs accounted for 5.1 percent of video-watching minutes during the quarter, smartphones were 1.8 percent, and tablet video was only 0.7 percent.
These findings contradict the current belief that the increasing usage of mobile phones for video viewing has come at the expense of the TV.
“This analysis is based on actual, behavioral data and that is what makes Nielsen an industry leader,” said Peter Katsingris, SVP Audience Insights, Nielsen, about the company’s findings.
“What we found was that contrary to the popular narrative that smaller screens were taking away time from the TV glass, when we looked deeper we found that overall time spent viewing on the TV had the most minutes among every age or ethnic demographic looked at. In some cases the share of viewing was as much as 97 percent,” he added.
That’s not to say that TV-watching means linear television delivered through cable or satellite providers, of course. What sort of content was being watched was not a focus of Nielsen’s study. It’s likely that many of these consumers are not watching live TV, but are instead streaming Netflix or other video content from online services through smart TVs or attached players.

However, while the TV still has a strong toehold for now in terms of total minutes spent viewing, when you delve into the data from other angles, you can see where the smartphone is gaining ground. For example, 91 percent of those 18 to 34 use smartphones each week, but only 79 watch TV. (However, these users do prefer TV-connected devices, as over half use them each week.)
In addition, smartphones account for 30 percent of the total average audience among those 18 to 34, versus 29 percent for TV. Compare that with the older age group (50+), where smartphones only account for 17 percent, and TV 54 percent. (Average audience is defined as the number of adults engaging with the platform in an average minute during the week.)

And smartphones are more heavily used among this younger group (18-34) than TV, accounting for 19 hours, 39 minutes of weekly viewing, compared with 19 hours, 18 minutes taking place on TV.

The larger takeaway here is that while the TV may still be the preferred screen for video watching among adults, the smartphone is gaining ground with the youngest demographic. But the overall averages for adults may not fully reflect this shift, due to how much the oldest adults still watch TV.

Personal finance management app MoneyLion was created to help users save money, reduce debt and improve their credit. Today the app is being updated to provide users with more personalized information about how they can improve their financial health, as well as even faster access to personal loans.
Like other PFM apps, MoneyLion works by connecting with all of a user’s bank, credit card, student loan and other financial accounts and then providing them with information about how they could improve their financial health.
One way it does this is by giving users personalized recommendations to encourage positive financial behaviors. By analyzing their individual spending habits and credit, the MoneyLion app gives daily advice based on a user’s most recent financial information.
Another way it aims to help users is by improving their credit. It offers free credit reports from TransUnion and Equifax, push notification credit monitoring and access to credit counseling and credit repair services.
The latest version of the MoneyLion app has an updated user interface to make things easier to navigate and provide faster access to the information. With its new UI, MoneyLion’s home navigation now shows swipe-able cards to provide up-to-date information, recommendations and personalized advice.
The app also has streamlined the process of applying for personal loans from MoneyLion itself. Users who are looking to borrow from MoneyLion can now get a loan approved in as little as 15 seconds, and can have funds in their account as quickly as the same business day.
That combination of personalized financial advice and access to personal loans is helping users improve their financial health, MoneyLion says. Customers have saved more than $5 million in rate reductions and rewards by demonstrating good financial behavior, and users save $46 on average in overdraft fees each month, the company says.
Are five human heads better than one computer brain? Not when it comes to playing Go. AlphaGo, the AI created to play the game of Go better than anyone alive, has defeated a team made up of five Go champions in a demonstration match on Friday.
The team included Chen Yaoye, Zho Ruiyang, Mi Yuting, Shi Yue and Tang Weixing, and on the AlphaGo side – just AlphaGo, obviously. The match ended when the human players resigned in the face of AlphaGo’s certain victory.
Another demo match on Friday saw a human/AlphaGo team take on another human/AlphaGo team, this time with Gu Li and the AI going head-to-head with Lian Xiao and his own artificial teammate. Lian Xiao and his AlphaGo companion ended up victorious, also forcing a resignation from the opposing side.
Commentators noted that the human players seemed to be enjoying observing and studying AlphaGo’s moves, and adapting their own play as a result. That’s basically what Eric Schmidt celebrated in a tweet, embedded below, and Google’s own social media accounts are echoing similar sentiments.


This speaks volumes about where AI is headed – human players are teaming up with AlphaGo to have even more fun with the game! https://t.co/42X58NvEga

All of which is to say: Don’t panic, AIs are our friends!
…for now.
Far Cry 5 developer Ubisoft is playing with fire – hellfire, that is, as it sometimes arises in America’s more backwater regions. The Montana setting for the forthcoming Far Cry game is a very different type of locale for the series, which typically features tropical destinations as the backdrop for its super violent action-packed gameplay.
This trailer reveals that not only will Far Cry 5 occur in a setting much closer to home for Americans, it’ll also deal with issues that are very central to current affairs. As the game’s hero, you’ll be taking on leadership of a resistance opposing a fanatical religious cult, which, based on the trailer above, takes considerable inspiration from fundamentalist Christian communities. One might say it has certain… documentary qualities.
Far Cry: Primal pushed the envelope in a very different way, taking away players’ guns and throwing them back to the beginning of human civilization. Far Cry 5 looks like it could incense and alienate an entire group of gamers – ironically the same that might be irate about having their guns taken away IRL. But it also looks interesting as hell, and that’s bound to keep the attention of franchise fans, politics aside.
I’ll be in Reykjavik next week and you know what that means… I want to meet you! So we’ll be holding a small meetup (not really a pitchoff but feel free to pitch me while I’m there) at Bryggjan Brugghús, Grandagarði 8, 101 Reykjavík, Iceland.
The event is being held on Tuesday, May 30, from 5 PM to 7 PM UTC.
Event starts at 5pm and you can meet the speakers and mentors coming to Startup Iceland 2017. Expect some booze, some fun, and some nice networking.
You can RSVP here. See you soon!
The League, a dating app that prides itself on selectiveness and requires members to be approved before joining, has traditionally taken expansion pretty slow. Originally launched in early 2015, the app is still only in 7 cities – New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington D.C and London.
But the startup just announced they are about to embark on a summer tour, adding 10 cities before the end of August.
They are: Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami, Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Diego, Denver, Seattle and Toronto.
These will roll out in batches, with the first three to launch being Philly, Atlanta and Miami in early June.
The startup will also be hosting a launch party in each city, which they explained is a good way to show its new members that The League is more than a random app on your phone – and actually has a human and community element behind it. This is especially important because a major component of The League’s monetization strategy is pairing you up with a real person (who they call a concierge) to help you perfect your dating profile, as well as advertising real-life events in your city.
A lot of data goes into deciding what cities The League expands to. Instead of rolling out nationally on day one like other dating apps have done, they have focused on slowly adding cities to make sure they are the right ones to support the app. For example, the startup looks at the amount of college educated singles in each city before launching, which they aptly translated into a list of the best cities for aspiring power-couples.

Of course since The League requires approval to join, the startup needs to make sure they have enough users in each city before they open the doors. That’s why each city has a waiting list that is already open today. Since The League typically likes to launch a city with 2,000 “founding members”, and their approval rate is between 20-30%, a city needs about 10,000 people on the waitlist before it makes sense for the app to launch there.
These 10 new cities will bring The League to 16 total cities by the end of the summer, putting them close to their new goal of 20 cities (with at least a few more being international) by the end of 2017.
This looks like a scooter, but it’s actually the BMW Motorrad Concept Link, the latest in BMW’s series of exhaustingly named Motorrad concept vehicles, which imagine a not-so distant future in which we all travel around in angular, sci-fi style.
The Link offers an electric drive, which makes possible the lower seat that BMW says facilitates easily getting on and off the vehicle. It has a reverse gear, which is not typical of many motorcycles, letting you negotiate city spaces more easily. There’s onboard storage under the seat bench, and it has cutaways that let you see the technology powering it within.

There’s no instrument cluster on the Link, but that’s because it projects information like speed, remaining charge and navigation information right onto the windscreen. The windscreen can also be swapped out for other options for greater personalization. There’s also a secondary display below the handle bars that offers touchscreen input, and the handlebars have built-in touch sensitive controls for easy access to favorite features while en route.
BMW goes beyond the bike to include a design for rider equipment, including a lightweight jacket with hidden protection. There’s also motion controls built in that let you open the luggage door with a wave of your arm.
These Motorrad concepts aren’t likely to enter production anytime soon, but instead provide some insight into where BMW thinks the industry is headed. I could go for a flash future scooter, so this one makes sense to me.

Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where each week we tell jokes about other people’s money.
This week, Katie Roof, Matthew Lynley and I — Alex Wilhelm — were joined by Rick Kline, a partner at Goodwin Procter. Kline is a lawyer focused on “M&A transactions [and] capital markets transactions,” according to his official bio, making him an ideal addition to the crew for this week’s natter.
On the show we took a dive into IPOs, what constitutes a good pop, and who might be next. We also drilled into the massive new Softbank fund and what it might mean for tech rounds both big and small. Oh, and Peloton remains something that we can’t get enough of. Some of us even Soul Cycle.
It was good to be back in the studio following our live edition in New York. (If you missed it, catch up!).

When Solar Impulse pilot Bertrand Piccard set out to fly around the world in a plane that uses no fuel, he knew he wasn’t going to get much rest. During the journey, he would be able to sleep, at a maximum, three hours per day with rest meted out in twenty-minute intervals. The plane, which could only accommodate one aviator, required a human systems check every twenty minutes.
For part of the journey, Piccard used Sana Health technology to put him to sleep in flight, and to sleep as deeply as possible during those scant moments.
The Sana Sleep “smart goggles,” will be available to the too-tired public starting in the second quarter of 2018, according to Sana Health founder and CEO Richard Hanbury. The company recently closed a $1.3 million round of seed funding from Founders Fund, Maveron and SOSV, among others. The goggles will sell for about $400 a pair, Hanbury said.
The entrepreneur began working on this technology as a solution to his own chronic pain and related sleep issues. He suffered from chronic nerve damage pain, after surviving a disabling Jeep accident in Yemen in 1992. However, the technology has broad-based appeal. Not including defiant toddlers, everyone wants a good night’s rest.
Sana Health founder and CEO Richard Hanbury.
Still, one in three adults in the U.S. doesn’t get enough sleep, according to the most recent available data from the CDC. Insomniacs suffer mood and memory impairments, among other undesirable corollaries, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have verified.
Sniffing a major market opportunity in the restless masses, a number of tech companies have begun trying to allay insomnia in recent years. They’re making mattresses of novel materials, a wide variety of wearables, sleep tracking apps and other IoT devices to encourage better sleep.
Venture investors are falling for the promise of a good night’s rest, too. According to deal tracker Crunchbase (which is owned by TechCrunch’s parent company) at least 30 sleep-related tech startups, including 6 hardware companies, landed seed or venture rounds since the start of last year.
For its part, the Sana Sleep looks like padded goggles, or a pared down and comfy version of a VR headset. It is being tested currently with athletes in training who want the most restorative sleep they can get while traveling extensively.
Hanbury explained this is how the device works: “It uses audio-visual stimulation to trigger specific patterns in the brain. In the same way that when you go into a nightclub, and hear fast music and see strobed lights, this produces an excited state in your brain, this device produces the patterns your brain needs in order to produce deep states of relaxation.”

The goggles emit pulses of light and sound. The wearer is conscious of the lights and sounds at the outset of each use, but becomes less aware of these as they drift off to sleep. The goggles measure things like a users’s pulse and breathing, and customizes the signals in response to the individual’s biometrics.
The goggles must be trained, initially. After about 4 uses wearers (even those dealing with chronic pain issues) can get to sleep within ten minutes, and more importantly can sleep through the night.
Prior to closing their seed round, Sana Health had raised $450,000 including from the HAX hardware accelerator run by SOSV. The firm reupped its investment in Sana’s seed round, according to General Partner Cyril Ebersweiler, because its technology solves the hardest sleep cases.
“Sana is based on 24 years of sleep research and has gone through extensive subject trials. While bringing continuous improvement to the experience, the company will need to now spend some time understanding which distribution channels are the most adapted for its offering,” he said.
The efficacy of the company’s goggles in early tests have led Sana Health to pursue a classification as a medical device from the FDA in the US.

Nintendo is unleashing a monster title on the Switch — quite literally — after Capcom revealed plans to bring its Monster Hunter franchise to the console with the upcoming Monster Hunter XX title. (That’s “double cross” not “XX,” by the way.)
While it might not be mainstream in the West, Monster Hunter is a huge franchise in Japan.
Where do we start? Past games in the series have helped Sony sell millions of PSPs, Nintendo sell millions of 3DSes and literally gotten top marks from the critics. The original game graced the PlayStation 2 in 2004, and newer additions have landed on the PS3, PS Vita, Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360 not to mention Windows and iOS. XX was actually first released for the 3DS in March and there’s plenty of anticipation for the Switch version.
Today’s reveal is a big deal for gamers, but equally so for Nintendo the business. The firm’s share price jumped over five percent on the news. Today alone, Nintendo added $2.2 billion to its market cap as its share price reached its highest since October 2008.

There’s no word for now on when Monster Hunter XX will land on Switch. More information has been teased for Saturday — which is also the date of this year’s Monster Hunter Championship — so diehards won’t have to wait too long.
The Raspberry Pi Foundation has announced it’s merging with another code club charity, Dublin-based CoderDojo. The aim is to advance shared goals around furthering the march of computing education for young people.
CoderDojo began in 2011, and at this point there are more than 1,250 of its code clubs across 69 countries, which it says are regularly attended by more than 35,000 young people between the ages of seven and 17.
The aim of the pair joining forces is to quadruple that number — with the goal of having 5,000 CoderDojos up and running by the end of 2020.
“Bringing together Raspberry Pi, Code Club, and CoderDojo will create the largest global effort to get young people involved in computing and digital making,” said Philip Colligan, CEO of the Pi Foundation, in a blog post announcing the merger.
The Pi Foundation’s core mission has always been to get more kids coding — even as the low-cost single-board computers it designs have found their way into the hands of makers of all ages.
It said today it will provide practical, financial and back-office support to the CoderDojo Foundation, which will continue as an independent charity, based in Ireland — freeing it up to focus on scaling its network. The merger is subject to approval by Irish regulators.
“Nothing about CoderDojo’s brand or ethos is changing as a result of this merger,” added Colligan. “CoderDojos will continue to be platform-neutral, using whatever kit they need to help young people learn.”
Colligan will be joining the board of the CoderDojo Foundation as a director, while the Pi Foundation will become a corporate member, though there’s no financial interest here as both are not-for-profits.
This is not the Pi Foundation’s first such merger. Back in November 2015 it also joined forces with U.K.-based Code Club.
At the time there were around 3,150 Code Clubs in the U.K., with some 44,000 regular attendees, and a further 1,000 clubs globally. Figures that have since stepped up to almost 5,900 U.K. Code Clubs reaching around 82,000 kids, and a wider network of 10,000 Code Clubs around the world reaching circa 100,000 kids.
“Code Club and CoderDojo are both massively successful organisations in their respective areas, with strong brands. The rationale for the merger is the same: alignment of goals, communities and day-to-day activities, but very little overlap between programs and funding sources. We expect to be able to achieve significant economies of scale, and to learn from each others’ different approaches and experiences,” Colligan told TechCrunch.
“One of the most attractive aspects from my personal point of view is CoderDojo’s strong presence in the developing world,” he added.
He said the Foundation does not have “any immediate plans for further mergers” at this point.
Soft Space, a payment provider in Southeast Asia, has closed its $5 million Series A as it looks to expand across the region, and potentially into Japan.
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Soft Space works with large enterprise customers, typically banks, to offer customized solutions for mobile payment, both at point-of-sale and other parts of the process. Typically these solutions are white-labeled. The startup currently active in its home market, Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. This new investment is provided entirely by Transcosmos, a Japanese firm that specializes in business and expansion which works with chat app Line among others.
Beyond providing capital, the deal is strategic for both parties, Soft Space chief strategy officer Chris Leong told TechCrunch. With the backing of Transcosmos and existing partners such as Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation — which invested in Square and Stripe to help them expand to Japan — Soft Space is assessing the potential to move into Japan. It is also working closely with Japanese firms that are eying the market in Southeast Asia to help them expand and adapt to local payment behaviors.
“Japanese companies are really coming into Southeast Asia as the next phase of growth,” Leong said.
Indeed, the internet economy in the region is tipped to grow to be worth $200 billion annually within the next decade, according to a report authored by Google. Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy and highest population, is a particular expansion focus and Leong said that Soft Space “wants to do more” in the country.
The company, which currently has 76 employees across three offices, isn’t going to go crazy on the hiring front, Leong said, but it is looking into acquiring requisite financial licenses across its core markets: Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. That would allow it to operate independently, whereas currently it must work with local partners.
Leong added that the company recorded take-home revenues of 27.8 million MYR ($6.5 million) over the last year. While it has reached break-even already, he said that profitability isn’t an immediate focus — instead the priority is scale and development.
Spruce, a new startup looking to speed up the mortgage-closing process, has raised $4.5 million in its Series A financing from Bessemer Venture Partners, Omidyar Network and Third Prime Capital, along with a slew of private angel investors.
Founded by two former employees of the robo-advisory wealth management company Betterment, the new startup is notable for a few reasons.
First, it’s yet another startup launching to tackle the real estate market — an industry that’s been a huge target for venture dollars — and it’s also a clear sign that the ecosystem in New York is maturing.
When you have startups begetting more startups, it’s a strong indicator of the health of a particular ecosystem. The same can be said for the involvement of core group of Betterment employees that invested in Spruce’s Series A.
Betterment chief executive Jon Stein, vice president of communications and policy Joe Ziemer, vice president of operations Boris Khentov and Mike Reust, the VP of engineering, all invested in their former co-workers’ new venture.
Founded by Patrick Burns, former product manager at Betterment and Spruce’s chief executive, and Andrew Weisgall, the chief operating officer at Spruce and former head of data science at Betterment, Spruce is angling to reduce the time to close a real estate deal by improving title insurance assessment and issuance.

That arcane corner of the real estate market can take as much as 4-5 days and costs property buyers and seller up to roughly $4,000, according to a statement from the company.
It’s also an incredibly lucrative practice. Roughly $15 billion in annual premiums flow to title insurance, and most of that is retained by agents. That number doesn’t even include another $5 billion in extra fees charged for closing and escrow services.
The guys at Spruce guesstimate that fees to title companies may be the single largest closing cost in buying or refinancing a home.
https://vimeo.com/217687814 
“After hearing of countless frustrating experiences from the mires of real estate transactions, we saw a great need to apply those same principles, knowing that doing so could have a big effect,” Burns wrote to me in an email.
The learning experience for Burns began with some channel surfing and binge watching HGTV. On the show Burns wrote that he would watch house flippers nickel and dime over building costs, but eat thousands of dollars in closing fees to ensure they would receive title insurance.
In a blog post published earlier today, the company stressed the importance of title insurance, noting that it protects the property rights of real estate owners.
Here’s the problem, as Spruce sees it:

The work that goes into establishing that certainty costs money, so you would expect some of the premiums to go towards that. However, that’s not all that is going on—title companies are far less efficient than they could be at doing that work. The research, processing, escrow and closing that comprise a title company’s role in ensuring and insuring that a real estate transaction is legally effective are often extremely manual, paper based processes. That means they’re more costly than they need to be, more error prone, subject to increasing amounts of fraud, and provide a slower and more opaque process for borrowers than might otherwise be possible.
Why haven’t these companies kept up with the times, and applied modern technology to their operations? Lack of incentive, of course.
Demand is guaranteed—mortgage companies require you to buy a policy, and realtors and lenders often direct you to one specific title insurance agent that would consider you a ‘captive customer’, leaving you open to paying more than you should for a worse experience than you deserve.

Spruce is in 11 states today, and it plans to expand to reach 24 by the end of next month. It’s targeting a fully nationwide service by the end of this year.

For those operating a bitcoin exchange — where people can buy cryptocoins — you’d imagine that the current surge in value for bitcoin and others like Ethereum’s ether coin is a dream come true. The answer is yes and no.
Coinbase, the world’s most funded bitcoin exchange, was dragged offline by the massive increase in interest in the space. Users have reported issues with various aspects of the service this week, and things reached a head on Thursday when the Coinbase website and mobile apps were unavailable to users for hours due to “unprecedented” levels of trading and traffic, the company said.
Bitcoin crossed the $2,000 mark for the first time this past weekend, and the charge continued this week until yesterday when, after reaching a new high of $2,805 on the Coinbase exchange, the valuation fell to $2,307. The currency has since stabilized, but its current value of $2,475.23 represents a $116.41 drop over the last 24 hours.
“The market cap of digital currencies has increased ~50 percent to $91 billion in the past week. As a result, Coinbase has seen a dramatic increase in traffic and trading volume,” the company told TechCrunch in a statement.
“The Coinbase engineering and support teams have been working round the clock to keep up with this unprecedented volume. However, Coinbase.com has suffered a few outages, including degraded performance and deposit/withdrawal delays for some users. We are actively working on resolving these issues and restoring our site to normal performance,” it added.

Things seem more stable today, with the Coinbase website and app functioning as usual. Having said that, at the time of writing, there are some minor issues with certain debit and credit cards, according to the company’s own status report.
According to Crunchbase, Coinbase has raised more than $117 million from investors that include Bank Of Tokyo – Mitsubishi UFJ, the New York Stock Exchange, Union Square Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Andreessen Horowitz. Its $75 million Series C in 2015 was a record funding round for any bitcoin-focused startup.

Playing god has never been a particularly strange ambition for Silicon Valley.
Even so, there are few verticals filled with more utopian dreams than the studios and startups building virtual and augmented reality experiences. While some are looking to craft 3D experiences that integrate into the real world, others are aiming to create massive worlds we can escape to. The one thing many of them have in common, however, is that they are built on a game engine from a company called Unity.
Unity Technologies, which builds tools for developers crafting 3D content across multiple platforms, has been having a pretty solid year.
Earlier this week, the company announced that it has closed a massive $400 million investment from Silver Lake Partners that, according to a report in the WSJ, valued the company at $2.8 billion. This raise comes hot on the heels of a $181 million investment just 10 months prior.
“Unity could be one of the most important technology companies in the next decade,” said Barry Schuler, a partner at DFJ Growth, which led Unity’s last round.
Schuler’s biases should be apparent, but his belief — that if virtual and augmented reality manage to take off, then Unity will be poised for greatness — is one shared by many investors and industry insiders I’ve chatted with.
Opportunity
The world Unity is ripe for is one based on spatial computing, a term for technologies that enable our interactions with digital objects to grow much more in line with how we interact with real-world things.
Rendering of a user viewing 3D objects with Microsoft HoloLens
Shopping for clothes online might transform from scrolling on a handheld device to peering at a real-world mirror and seeing what a hat or shirt would look like mapped in 3D on your head. It’s a world that’s limitless in its potential, though it will likely rely on some groundbreaking hardware to enable it as well as powerful software suites known as game engines.
Game engines may have initially been built for video game titles, but the needs of several other major industries are beginning to line up and shape the ambitions of the companies like Unity that create them.
Unity CEO John Riccitiello
“We call it a game engine, but really it’s an animation/interactive/lighting/physics/presence engine,” Unity CEO John Riccitiello told TechCrunch. “And it happens to also be what Audi needs. And it happens to be what the guys at the Large Hadron Collider also need.”.text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

Riccitiello joined Unity in 2014 as CEO, taking the reigns of the company from co-founder David Helgason who started the company from the ashes of a faltering game studio in Copenhagen. Prior to joining, Riccitiello served as CEO of Electronic Arts, one of the world’s largest video game companies.
Ubiquity
When Unity launched it was just another game engine — its breakthrough moment came when it was first to launch development support for the iPhone, bringing a host of developers into the world of iOS in its earliest days.
A decade later, the company has around 1,400 employees and its software powers more than half of all new mobile gaming titles.
The SF-based company may already have a healthy grasp on mobile, with competitors like Epic Games and their Unreal engine focusing more heavily on desktop gaming, but an area where Unity is increasingly focusing its efforts is in the AR/VR space.
“Nobody that worked at Unity five or 10 years ago thought that we were going to be perfectly positioned for VR,” said Riccitiello. “I don’t think that we’re making Unity into all these different things, I think that all these other industries now need what’s been traditionally called a game engine.”
More than two-thirds of all content created for AR and VR uses Unity’s engine. Ninety-one percent of applications on emerging AR platforms like the Microsoft HoloLens are created on the engine, while Samsung’s Gear VR has about 90 percent of its gaming titles built using Unity.

While AR and VR technologies are incredibly young, the companies fighting for dominance over the platforms are the ones that have loomed large for quite a while.

Google has its Daydream platform for mobile VR and its Tango platform for mobile AR. Facebook just introduced its augmented reality platform at its most recent F8 developer conference and also owns Oculus, which makes high-end VR headsets. Later this year, Microsoft will bring Windows Holographic support to VR headsets, and the company has done extensive work on its augmented reality HoloLens headset.
Schuler believes that Unity will only benefit from these companies continuing to duke it out for control, due to the engine’s widespread support for different platforms that users can publish to simultaneously with the click of a few check boxes.
“In the past when there weren’t standards or a winner emerging, it’s typically been bad because you need to get developers to buy into your development platform and make decisions about who is going to emerge the leader and that process slows everything down,” Schuler said. “With Unity, you’re really betting on the category because it has this great ‘write once, publish to everything’ platform.”

The company’s tools are free for personal use and priced on a per-device subscription for larger customers that scales based on the revenues being brought in.
As its capabilities widen and the popularity of its products surge, questions arise on what’s next for the rapidly growing company
One thing Schuler does not expect on Unity’s horizon is an acquisition from a platform giant. “If Google or Facebook were to buy Unity, everything that makes Unity work would go away, what makes it work so well is that they are a pure play, independent company.”
Riccitiello wasn’t too verbose on the topic of an exit, but said going public would be a topic of conversation for the future. “There will be another day when we talk about IPOs, but certainly not now,” he said.
Simplicity
Unity’s simplicity may be one of its greatest selling points, but as the engine matures in its ambitions, so too does the risk of compromising its core mission, Riccitiello says.
“The tension within Unity is always how to deliver this performance that would otherwise yield more and more complexity, and do so really simply. It’s always a vexing problem and a problem with balance,” Riccitiello said.
Below is an example of one of Unity’s Adam demo, highlighting some of the engine’s more intensive, boundary-pushing capabilities at work.

Earlier this month at a virtual reality summit hosted by Unity, famed evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins came to the stage to offer his perspective on the worlds for which Unity is building its platform, saying, “Our perception of reality… it’s virtual reality, but it’s run by software in the brain.”
Unity may not be in the business of building for brains quite yet, but the prospects of virtual and augmented reality becoming widespread platforms have given the company new dreams to realize with its game engine, Riccitiello says. “Our ambitions are certainly far greater than they ever were before.”

I have to say, I really like e-paper. And it’s come a long way since the crude early Kindles — nowadays you have e-readers that are as high-resolution as the best phones and iPads. And they’re set to get even better if E Ink’s latest screens make it into a few products, as I hope they do.
It’s Display Week in LA, which is exactly what it sounds like: All the display makers get together and admire each other’s displays. This year there’s no doubt a lot of talk around the water cooler about OLED, but E Ink isn’t letting that get to them.
The company is showing off a few new screen types, collaborations with Japan Display Inc., that put to shame the best e-readers on the market today. Just so we’re clear, I’m talking about the fabulous Aura One and the Kindle Oasis, both of which have a display density of about 300 pixels per inch.
What would you say if I told you E Ink was showing off a display that’s… 400 PPI? Would you be impressed? Yes? Well then you’ll be happy to hear they’re also showing one that’s 600 PPI — twice that of its toughest competitors.
You can see in that (highly magnified) picture just how much more information can be fit on a higher-PPI screen, and how much less aliased angled lines are. Really, this will make type look fantastic.
Of course, its competitors are real devices and these displays are tiny strips at a trade show, but still, I get the feeling we’re going to see this tech trickle down to e-readers sooner or later.
The threat of minefields is an ongoing and horrifying one, and the duty of clearing them is as difficult as it is dangerous. All the more reason, then, that it should be done by robots! A new type of inexpensive, versatile bot modeled after turtles could be a great tool for this and other jobs.
Ben Amor and Dan Dukes of Arizona State University were interested in the problem of how to deploy robots quickly to environments where their means of locomotion isn’t necessarily the best. For instance, if your bot has pointy feet and walks like a quadruped, it may not be very effective in sand or rubble. The robot should be able to adapt.
The motion of the fin before learning (top) and after a few learning sessions.
The solution the researchers propose is a robot (the “C-Turtle”) with a simple crawling gait inspired by sea turtles’ movement in sand. A special learning algorithm tweaks the movement on the fly, and the robot itself is basically made from a single sheet of material and can be constructed or modified in a matter of hours.
“In contrast to the majority of reinforcement learning algorithms that potentially require many trials, our method needs only a small number of trial-and-error interactions with the environment to learn how to locomote,” Amor wrote in an email to TechCrunch. “Indeed, in most of our experiments the robot learned a new gait within 1-2 hours.”
It may be, for example, that the robot needs slightly longer or shorter “fins,” or that the motors controlling them need to be juiced up or rotated slightly. This information, Amor and Dukes write, can only reliably come from testing in the environment itself; lab tests with multiple materials can’t prepare the robot’s little brain for every possible combination of dust, dirt, sand and cruft.

Amor told New Scientist that swarms of the bots could be deployed to former combat zones where landmines are often found. A hundred or so would get used to the terrain, then spread out and, upon finding a mine, either notify a handler or… well, it might be obvious that it found one.
At around $80 per unit, they’re cheap enough to make en masse and simple enough that no special training should be required to assemble them. C-Turtle’s creators do plan to release the design at some point.
C-Turtle’s creators will be presenting their work at MIT’s RSS 2017 conference, then at Stanford’s Living Machines. Afterwards they plan to release the design and instructions so other roboticists or interested parties can make their own. You can check out more of the team’s work at ASU’s Idealab.

New data out of Stanford is lending credence to common wisdom that fitness trackers suck at counting calories. Heart-rate monitoring, on the other hand, fared surprisingly well in the school’s Medical Center studies.
The group of 60 volunteers was hand-selected to offer a broad range of subjects, factoring in things like gender, body mass index and skin color (optical heart-rate monitoring has a history of being a bit unintentionally racist). The 31 women and 29 men tested various combinations of the Apple Watch (first generation), Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn and Samsung Gear S2 while walking on treadmills and riding stationary bikes.
Those results were compared to data from medical-grade equipment for measuring heart rate and carbon dioxide in the breath, a commonly accepted measure for gauging energy expenditure. Turns out all of the devices other than the Samsung did a pretty solid job on the heart-rate front. The rest had error rates of under five percent, which qualifies them as decent candidates for medical uses.
They’re not going to replace chest straps in the lab any time soon, but the kind of day to day data they collect could be useful for doctors looking for a more complete picture of their patients’ health. At the very least, they could provide some interesting supplemental information.
“Five percent is approaching something useful in a clinical setting, which suggests that doctors may be looking toward this data when evaluating their patients,” graduate student Anna Shcherbina told TechCrunch. “If a doctor has average data on the patient as they’re going about their day, this could provide a more complete picture.”
Caloric information is a different story altogether. And it’s not surprising, really. Heart rate is a pretty direct reading. Calories burned differ hugely from person to person based on a variety of different factors. And the wrist isn’t the logical spot to start a search for caloric information. The system needs to do a fair amount of guesswork based on movements detected by the wearables’ built-in accelerometers.
The range of readings is pretty astounding. The best reading was off by an average of 27 percent and the worst by an appalling 93. To be of any real use for a medical setting, you’re going to want a number under 10 percent. So there’s a lot of work to be done here. Shcherbina says the Apple Watch and Fitbit Surge were the most accurate of the bunch; it was Finnish company PulseOn really missed the mark.
The team unsurprisingly got some pushback from PulseOn when it didn’t enter more precise information like a volunteer’s VO2 max level. In order to get a more accurate picture of the average user, the researchers didn’t enter information that most of us don’t have access to. I know I haven’t been on a treadmill with a VO2 measuring mask on my face any time recently. Perhaps I’m overdue.
Since the study began in 2015, there are newer versions of a number of the devices here. The team admits that, in the case of the Apple Watch, there may be some discrepancies between “active” and “total” calories burned, an issue that may be reconciled as it continues testing on the new version.
The team purchased all devices independently for the integrity of the study — but lead researcher professor Euan Ashley says they’re open to communicating with the companies involved to make sure there’s not some sort of proprietary secret sauce somehow being overlooked.
Both PulseOn and Apple have reached out with feedback, after the paper’s publication, and the team is open to future collaboration. “No concrete plans as of now,” Shcherbina explains, “but we are definitely open to this idea if the companies are interested in working with us. Obviously maintaining our independence/impartiality is key, but closer communication might yield valuable insights about most effective ways to improve fitness algorithms for wearables.”
Apple and Samsung declined to offer a statement, while Fitbit is clearly on the offensive here, sending along a big one. The wearable maker touches upon its “extensive, ongoing research and development,” but adds that the caloric estimates that trackers give are just that — estimates:
Fitbit trackers show an estimated total number of calories burned based on users’ BMR (basal metabolic rate) and activity energy expenditure (AEE). Fitbit uses a scientifically validated estimate of BMR based on height, weight, age, and gender information that users provide when setting up their Fitbit account.
The company also argues that there’s something to be said for the base-level motivation that simply wearing a tracker brings. It’s a fair point. If the sort of gamification that these devices bring does get more people off their butts, that’s probably a net positive and a big part of what’s driving the category’s success. I know plenty of people (myself included) who find the simple act of wearing one of these devices on their wrist cause to get off their respective butts.
Shcherbina agrees with the point, but adds that there’s a big downside for those who rely on such readings to make “very precise decisions about exercise and food based on that, then it might be off by quite a bit and they may not get the results they want and become frustrated.”
As more health providers look to trackers for data, the category is likely to come under increased scrutiny from regulators like the FDA. As it currently stands, however, that body doesn’t oversee any sort of claims made for these “non-medical” products.
“Our position is that ‘sunlight is better than regulation,’ ” says Ashley. “We would encourage the companies to make available their validation studies in the public domain so the public can see for themselves which devices are most accurate.”
At the very least, the study prompts some interesting questions about how companies collect and process the data that informs its health claims. The data collected may not be a perfect reflection of manufacturers’ intentions, but the study is a place to start the conversation.

Another one of the co-founders of online lending startup SoFi is leaving the company, the company has confirmed to TechCrunch. Dan Macklin, who served as VP of Community and Member Success at SoFi, announced internally that he’ll be stepping down from his position on June 6th.
“First of all, I would say it’s been a very difficult decision… To step away from SoFi — it’s a hard decision. I feel comfortable making that decision now given the shape we’re in,” Macklin told me by phone. “The company is in really great shape, so for me it feels like the right time to make the switch.”
Macklin will be staying on in an advisory role on the company’s “SoFi at Work” efforts. “We’re working with more than 700 employers to help their employees with all aspects of their financial health, but especially dealing with student debt,” he said. Other than that, we’ll be watching out to see where he lands next.
Along with SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, Macklin was one of four MBA students at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business who teamed up in 2011 to disrupt the way student loan refinancing was done at the time. Since then, the company has grown to offer a wider range of lending products, including mortgages and personal loans, and is expanding its financial services suite to include wealth management and traditional banking services.
It’s also grown pretty substantially as a business. After six years, SoFi now has more than 300,000 members and has underwritten more than $20 billion in loans, according to a person familiar with the business. It’s also raised nearly $2 billion in outside funding and has about 1,000 employees.
Most recently, Macklin was charged with managing the community and customer success at SoFi, which sees its member meetups and community events as a key differentiator against more traditional financial services businesses. Prior to that, he served as the company’s first VP of Business Development.
In a statement to TechCrunch, Cagney wrote: “I’m immensely grateful for everything Dan has contributed to SoFi since we founded the company together at Stanford, and he’ll continue to have a hand in helping us succeed in the future — including as a permanent ringer on the company soccer team.”
Of course, it’s not unusual for founders to leave after a period of several years, but Macklin’s departure leaves Cagney as the last remaining co-founder at the company. It also comes not long after SoFi lost Nino Fanlo, its longtime president and CFO. Fanlo left to take over the chief finance position at biotech firm Human Longevity, but Macklin is mostly just looking forward to some time off.
He told us that for the time being he would be taking the summer off. “It’s not coincidental that my kids are done with school a few days after I leave SoFi,” he said.
HBO confirmed today that Silicon Valley will indeed be returning for a fifth season, but one of its stars, T.J. Miller, who plays the ever moronic Erlich Bachman, will not be rejoining the cast.
The Emmy-nominated show chronicles the pivots and pitfalls of startup life in Silicon Valley with a style that’s always current and sometimes a bit too real. Real-life tech executives like Twitter’s former CEO Dick Costolo have worked with the show’s writers to refine its skewers on the tech industry.
Miller’s departure was confirmed by HBO to Variety:
“The producers of Silicon Valley and T.J. Miller have mutually agreed that T.J. will not return for season 5. In Erlich Bachman, T.J. has brought to life an unforgettable character, and while his presence on the show will be missed, we appreciate his contribution and look forward to future collaborations.”
No word on how exactly he’s going to be written out of the show, but in the world of Silicon Valley there are always ample opportunities for exits.
It was off to the races for Appian, which debuted on the Nasdaq on Thursday, soaring 25 percent on its first day on the stock market.
After pricing shares at $12, the company closed the day above $15, valuing the company at about $900 million.
The company helps its enterprise and government customers with app development. “Appian is the easiest way for companies to build their own software,” founder and CEO Matt Calkins told TechCrunch. He touted a “patent that allows us to interpret a set of objects for different devices.”
Appian has a lot of competition, including Salesforce, ServiceNow, IBM and Oracle. But they hope their approach makes it so that people can build applications with little coding required. The applications can be for PC, tablets, smartphones and wearable tech.
It was a long time coming for the Virginia-based company, which was founded in 1999, when Calkins was just 26. He said their business concept gained more transaction when apps were popularized in recent years.
Appian’s revenue is growing. They reported $132.9 million last year, compared to $111.2 million in 2015 and $89 million in 2014.
But they’re not quite profitable. The company incurred a loss of $12.5 million last year. Appian lost $7 million in the year before that and $17.1 million in 2014.
Calkins has the largest stake and Novak Biddle Venture Partners owned 21.5 percent prior to the offering, after investing just $10 million. New Enterprise Associates (NEA) owns 11.7 percent, due to a secondary transaction.
The company picked the right time to go public from a markets perspective. The S&P and Nasdaq saw record highs on Thursday. Tech IPOs have also performed well in recent months.
Binded aims to make it easier for photographers to protect their intellectual property by creating a permanent record of their copyright in a public database, namely the blockchain.
The startup was previously known as Blockai, but it’s rebranding today — the new name is meant to focus less on technology and instead emphasize the idea of creating a legally binding record. Put another way: As a company and product name, Binded probably sounds more appealing to people who aren’t bitcoin and blockchain nerds.
The startup is also announcing that it has raised an additional $950,000 from investors, including Mistletoe (led by Taizo Son, founder of gaming company GungHo and youngest brother of SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son), Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Vectr Ventures, M&Y Growth Partners, Tokyo Founders Fund and Social Starts. This brings Binded’s total funding to $1.5 million.
Binded CEO Nathan Lands suggested that bringing Japanese investors on-board is “is a step in the right direction” to become “the standard for copyright” globally.
Why is that kind of standard needed? Well, in the U.S., while your creative work is copyrighted as soon as it’s created, you need to register it with the U.S. Copyright Office if you want to file a lawsuit. Lands has pitched Binded’s platform as an intermediate step — less time-consuming and expensive than registration, but still creating an independent record that should have legal weight.
“We want to democratize copyright,” he said.
In fact, Lands pledged that the core Binded product will “always be free.” The plan is to add more services over time that the company could potentially charge for over time, like the ability to register with the Copyright Office.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard commencement speech centered around how we can improve life through big projects, equal opportunity and building both local and global community. He outlined a plan “to create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose.”
Rather than focusing on the opportunities for the Harvard students graduating in front of him, he urged the students to ignite opportunities for those less fortunate. And instead of shying away from the fact that technology is creating new challenges for the underprivileged, he said we need to address head on automation’s impact on employment.

Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard his sophomore year in 2004 to scale up Facebook as it rapidly grew. But today he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, apparently to the delight of his parents, and became the youngest commencement speaker in Harvard’s history.
Today’s speech gave Zuckerberg a chance to speak directly to the world about the philosophy of building community that he outlined in his 6,000 word “humanitarian manifesto” letter he published earlier this year. He describes this purpose as Facebook’s new mission after spending more than a decade trying to make the world more “open and connected.”
To grow his understanding of how to build global community, Zuckerberg’s annual personal challenge for 2017 was to visit and meet new people in every U.S. state he hadn’t already visited. Many have described the similarity of his tour to how politicians “shake hands and kiss babies” as they campaign for election, stoking speculation that Zuckerberg might run for president of the United States. Zuckerberg has repeatedly denied this is his plan.
Yet with 1.8 billion users, Facebook’s citizenship dwarfs that of the U.S., and Zuckerberg’s choices directly impact the way people socialize, organize and do business every day. Perhaps getting to know a wider swath of those users in person so he can serve them through Facebook’s product is plenty reason for the cross-country trek. The empathy he’s developed on his trip shone through in the narrative of inclusiveness wound through his speech.
Purpose
Zuckerberg began with a couple of corny jokes about how the students at “the greatest university in the world” had “accomplished something I never could.” And while he might have built Facebook in his dorm room, it was its predecessor “FaceMash” that had the biggest impact on him. That’s because the app almost got him kicked out of Harvard, and at the premature going away party his friends threw him, he met his future wife, Priscilla Chan.

Then the Facebook CEO launched into the meat of his talk about the idea of purpose — not just finding purpose for one’s self, but giving others the chance to have a true purpose. He broke down his strategy to achieve this goal into three parts.
Big projects
Putting a man on the moon seemed like an impossibly large challenge at first, but through the contributions of a legion of not only scientists, but support staff, politicians and tax payers, we accomplished that feat. It not only paid technological dividends, but created jobs, too.
Zuckerberg explained:
“Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars and trucks. But we have the potential to do so much more together. Every generation has its defining works. More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon. Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio. Millions of more people built the Hoover Dam and other great projects. These projects didn’t just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs, they gave our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things. Now it’s our turn to do great things.”
The biggest challenge with big projects is getting started, he says, but we must persevere. Climate change might seem like too large a goal to know where to begin, but Zuckerberg suggests we put people to work installing solar panels. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has put $3 billion toward ending disease, but he believes individuals can help by contributing their health and genome data. He even suggests us working to modernize democracy so we can vote online.
Equal opportunity
To maximize progress, everyone must have a role, not just the rich or those in the First World. And as artificial intelligence and robots improve, more and more jobs will be at risk.
Zuckerberg in his old college dorm room
Zuckerberg says, “Now it’s time for our generation to define a new social contract,” where we measure progress not by growing GDP but by ubiquitous participation with the economy.
“We can all make time to give someone a hand. Let’s give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose — not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great, we’re all better for it.”
Lending a hand can take many different forms. Zuckerberg says that universal basic income could unlock people’s attention to focus on solving big problems and contributing to society rather than merely trying to survive. Other suggestions he gave included affordable childcare so parents can continue working, flexible preventative healthcare so people stay healthy rather than generating more costs, prison reform to give low-level offenders a second chance and continuous education to make sure people stay employable as they age.
Building community
Finally, Zuckerberg believes that we need to foster a sense of community, both locally with our neighbors so we can build support networks for individuals, and between nations to unite the globe around giant collective problems like climate change.
“We get that our greatest opportunities are now global — we can be the generation that ends poverty, that ends disease. We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too — no country can fight climate change alone or prevent pandemics. Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.”
A survey found that millennials around the globe predominantly identify their generation as “citizens of the world,” but Zuckerberg stresses that change won’t be made at the U.N. Instead, Zuckerberg sees each generation expanding the circle of who we consider “one of us” by becoming secure enough to care about others.
Zuckerberg drew the battle lines, which squarely painted President Donald Trump on the other side of progress without naming him:
“We live in an unstable time. There are people left behind by globalization across the whole world. And it’s hard to care about people in other places, when we don’t first feel good about our lives here at home. There’s pressure to turn inwards. This is the struggle of our time. The forces of freedom, openness and global community, against the forces of authoritarianism, isolationism, and nationalism. Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and immigration, against those that would slow them down.”
Zuckerberg gets teary-eyed while concluding his speech
The gravity of this fight seemed to wash over Zuckerberg near the end of the talk. The infamously stoic Zuckerberg began to tear up, describing how a high school student he mentored feared he couldn’t go to college because he’s an undocumented immigrant.
Perhaps the most important thing that came out of the speech was Zuckerberg’s maturing perspective of how all this progress will be made. While his manifesto repeatedly offered deeper connection through Facebook as the answer, Zuckerberg never mentioned specific parts of the app he built in today’s speech. Maybe he’s realized that a product’s impact is defined by the virtues of those who use it. There’s plenty to fix within Facebook. But each of us must decide how wide we care to spread our circle of inclusion and opportunity.
Target has reportedly rolled $75 million into Casper, the direct-to-consumer mattress startup you may have heard about in all those podcasts. The funding is a good chunk of what should end up being a more than $100 million round, according to a source at Recode, which first reported the news.
Target has confirmed it gave a bunch of money to Casper but would not confirm the amount (sigh). We’ve reached out to Target for more and will update if and when we hear back. Update: Nope, Target does not want to comment.
The investment allegedly happened after acquisition talks fell through. Target had offered to buy Casper for $1 billion earlier this year, but apparently Casper wasn’t into the terms of the deal. The fast-growing mattress startup is an under-the-radar unicorn already, according to a TechCrunch source close to the matter, and a recent IOData report obtained by TechCrunch pegs the company at 39 percent of all mattress-in-a-box sales from 2014-2017.
Now Target will be the lead investor instead. Existing Casper investors Lerer Hippeau Ventures, IVP and NEA are also adding in some cash for this round.
The financing may be a good option for the retail giant as brick-and-mortar stores have struggled against online competition. Target basically confirmed that in a statement (if you can get past the PR jargon), saying it would benefit by working with Casper’s already established online brand:
“The strategic partnership offers Casper access to an established retail brand and gives Target an opportunity to work with a future-focused digital brand that is exploring an area that is meaningful for our guests — sleep and wellness. We’re looking forward to exploring the future together.”
Target is also hoping to pull in younger, digital-savvy customers by partnering with brands like Casper, and recently Bevel and the celebrity style blog WhoWhatWear, to hook in a new generation of online shoppers.
For Casper, the funding gives it some runway to continue dominating the field in an already crowded (but apparently quite lucrative) online mattress market as it competes against startups like Tuft & Needle and Purple, which both own their own manufacturing facilities and operate in much less expensive areas to keep operating costs low.
Ahead of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s commencement speech at Harvard today, the school’s much-lauded student newspaper had some… interesting headlines to share.
“BREAKING: Mork Zinkletink Zonks all over the Internet!”

The bogus headlines, first spotted by Business Insider, came from an unauthorized user according to a statement given to TechCrunch by Crimson President Derek Cho.
Earlier today, The Harvard Crimson’s website was altered by an unauthorized user. We are currently working to repair the breach. We regret any inconvenience to our readers and look forward to the rest of Commencement.
It’s all a bit fitting, given Zuckerberg’s own troubled past with The Crimson.

Back in 2004, while Zuckerberg was a student, he allegedly hacked into the email accounts of two editors of The Crimson to see a story ahead of press time written about claims of intellectual property theft made against his new website TheFacebook. He reportedly used failed login attempts from the editors on TheFacebook to guess their passwords and jump into their accounts.
The Crimson has currently returned to normal commencement fare, though Zuckerberg’s face will likely be returning to the site as he delivers his speech to the graduating class later today.

While some in Silicon Valley indulge in free meals, laundry service and egg freezing, an estimated 50 percent of the workforce won’t even have basic benefits by 2020 — and Virginia Senator Mark Warner wants to do something about that.
While legislators in Washington state have proposed a bill requiring a benefits program for gig workers, Warner has just proposed the first-ever piece of national legislation aimed at helping on-demand and other non-traditional workers without traditional benefits, like paid sick days or a retirement plan, have some sort of a safety net. The bill asks the federal government to set aside $20 million in funding for organizations to use to look at the types of benefits programs individual workers could take with them from job to job.
Set aside the current talk up on the Hill of taking away healthcare from millions of people for now. Thanks to mobile technology, 1099 workers have become a large (and growing) piece of the economy, set to reach half of everyone in our nation in just a few years — a staggering number to go without any sort of a plan for anything. However, these portable benefits plans would give the nice lady who just brought you a burrito for lunch, the kid who cleaned your house or the guy who dropped you off at work this morning options in helping them continue paying bills and take care of themselves should something happen.
“[Portable benefits is] that emergency fund,” Warner told BuzzFeed, which first reported news of the bill. “It might be a fund to take care of a disability if you get hurt. It might work with some existing retirement programs. Part of it would be, depending on what happens with Obamacare, an ability to help deal with health care expenses. I think there will be a variety of models.”
The funding wouldn’t be enough to cover everyone, of course, but if it gets the green light a draft of the bill indicates it would earmark $5 million toward grants doled out by Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta for organizations already looking into portable benefits and $15 million for new programs.
The bill already seems to have broad support, including from the former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, as well as such organizations as the Independent Drivers Guild (IDG), which represents about 50,000 ride-hailing drivers for startups like Uber and Lyft. “Gig economy workers and their families need benefits and protections just like traditional employees. Unions and government officials must not let these workers fall through the cracks,” an IDG spokesperson told TechCrunch.
Uber and other startups using the on-demand working class for labor also seem to support the idea of providing gig workers with some sort of a safety net, at least. Uber, for instance, just raised its rates in eight states by five cents per mile to cover the cost of injury insurance for its drivers, though that could be more to cover itself from lawsuits. We’ve reached out to hear how Uber, Handy and others feel about the newly proposed nationwide portable benefits legislation as well.
Many of these same startups have tried in the past to separate gig workers into a new class separate from 1099 workers who might also employ others, but that, so far, hasn’t gone anywhere. Senator Warner has also been thinking of the gig worker and the major shifts we’ve seen in employment over the last few years, thanks to technological advances. His bill doesn’t classify them as something new, but would at least be the first step into research on how to go about providing for these working Americans in what is already an enormous shift in the way many of them now make a paycheck.
Customer experience chatbot developer Rulai has launched a new “low-code” chatbot development tool and raised $6.5 million to roll it out.
The development team at Rulai, with offices in Beijing and Campbell, Calif., is helmed by the renowned University of California, Santa Cruz, computer science professor Yi Zhang.
Professor Zhang, the company’s chief technologist, and her team are launching a product that customer service managers can use to develop chatbots that will perform tasks based on customer conversations, and that can be created without a single line of code.
It’s an example of how software developers and artificial intelligence systems are writing themselves out of the application development process.
Specifically, the Rulai tool was designed for customer service managers. Using Rulai’s drop-down toolkit, managers can write scripts and create action items to customize chatbots that will perform functions based on their communications with customers.
In the demo I saw, Professor Zhang created a chatbot that could automatically respond to a customer and cancel and rebook their flights through a series of drop-down menus and an integration with a company’s back end.

The chatbots rely on natural language processing technology developed by Rulai, and the customization toolkit the company has built will let managers with no coding experience create their own scripts. Based on user’s responses, the bots will respond with actions that are also created by the managers.
Rulai is throwing its bot toolkit out into an incredibly crowded market. Everyone from big names like Facebook and Microsoft to startups like BotCube, Azumo, Api.ai, Chatfuel, blahblahbot, pandorabot and RoBotOverlord (I made the last three up, but you get the idea) are working on these things.
For Rulai, another point of differentiation it’s pitching is the strength of its AI technology itself, according to Zhang.
The company’s bot can escalate tasks to a human customer support system when needed; perform several rounds of communication with a customer and remember the context of the conversation; it’s based on mixed initiatives and mixed tasks technology, which means both the bot and the human can lead a chat; and it adaptively changes its approach based on real-time feedback.
Whether or not the company’s chatbot development toolkit is the future, Rulai has lined up some serious backers to finance its growth.
To roll out this new product, Rulai has raised $6.5 million in new financing from a slew of Sino-U.S. investment firms led by GSR Ventures, a huge player in the Chinese venture capital industry, and an established presence in the U.S.
With over $1.5 billion under management in U.S. and Yuan-denominated funds, GSR has backed some of China’s biggest new startups. Companies in the fund’s portfolio include DiDi Chuxing, Qunar, ele.me, Xiaohongshu, Inke, Shanghai DZH and ofo.
Additional investors in the round included the former venture arm of FIL, formerly known as Fidelity Growth Partners and now called Eight Roads Ventures China and Zhongwei Capital.

College dropout-turned-Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally got his degree today, and now he’s about to give Harvard’s 366th commencement speech.
You can watch him speak here now, where we’ll embed the Facebook Live broadcast on TechCrunch, and provide frequent updates on any news or insights he mentions.
For a deeper look at the substance of his talk, read our follow-up: “Zuckerberg tells Harvard we need a new social contract of equal opportunity” 
“I’ll share what I’ve learned about our generation and the world we’re all building together” Zuckerberg writes. “This is personally important to me and I’ve been writing it for a while.”

Live Updates From Zuckerberg’s Speech
Zuckerberg began his speech by calling Harvard “The greatest university in the world”, and cracking a couple corny jokes like telling students “You accomplished something I never could.”
He described how he met Priscilla Chan at the going away party friends through Zuckerberg when the university threatened to kick him out for creating Facebook-predecessor FaceMash. In a touching moment, he says because it led him to meet his future wife, FaceMash is actually the most important thing he built at Harvard.
Then Zuckerberg got into the focus of his speech: Purpose. He described how through his travels around the country, people have told him they’re trying to fill a void in their lives as jobs and community become less important in modern society. And that Zuckerberg foreshadowed how these problems could worsen as technology replaces jobs.
His first strategy for the world to find purpose is for people to make the hard choice to get started on big projects. For example, it might be tough to start fighting climate change, but we can put people to work installing solar panels, or we can start ending disease by getting people to contribute their health data and genomes.
His second strategy revolves around equal opportunity. He believes “it’s time for our generation to define a new social contract” where we measure progress by everyone having a role and a purpose. Zuckerberg suggested universal basic income, affordable childcare, flexible healthcare, prison reform, and continuous education as the ways to provide this equal opportunity.
Finally, he believes that we need to build community, both locally with our neighbors, and between nations to unite the globe.
To learn how Zuckerberg plans to fix the world’s problems without just saying Facebook is the solution, read our follow-up: “Zuckerberg tells Harvard we need a new social contract of equal opportunity“.

Nearly two decades after the release of the original Pokémon Red and Blue in the U.S., the Pokémon company has come out with another true masterpiece.
It’s called Magikarp Jump, which came out for iOS and Android earlier today. It’s about training Magikarp, the most beloved Pokémon in the universe, to jump as hard as it can and squash the hopes and dreams of its opponents. But Magikarp Jump can be a complicated beast to master, so here are some tips to get started:

Choose your pole carefully and be patient when fishing
Waiting for the best Magikarp is the first step to becoming a true Magikarp master.
Name it something original
Your Magikarp will eventually have a mid-life existential crisis. Make sure to nurture its individuality if you want to be a true Magikarp master.
Accept nuggets from strangers
Your Magikarp needs those nuggets and it can’t Tweet. Give your Magikarp the gift of nuggets if you want to be a true Magikarp master.

Skip the commentary
Your Magikarp doesn’t want to listen to the same announcer over and over, it wants to be a winner. Take your Magikarp straight to the ring if you want to be a true Magikarp master.

Demand a play review
There’s no harm in asking officials to review the jump. You’ll need to learn the best strategies as a coach if you want to be a true Magikarp master.
Spend your coins on upgrades and stuff
You aren’t going to collect interest on those coins. You’ll need to invest in your Magikarp’s future if you want to be a true Magikarp master.
Ignore the health risks of drinking soda
The internet wants to make you think that soda is bad. The truth is, your Magikarp loves soda, and you should feed it some if you want to be a true Magikarp master.

Be sure to give your Magikarp lots of praise
It won’t always max out that jump counter, but if you want to be a Magikarp master you’ll have to treat it with respect.
Always accept your achievement rewards
You’ll want to rake in that sweet, sweet cash after all if you want to be a Magikarp master.
Be sure to have your phone out when updating your computer
This is a good opportunity to train your Magikarp if you hope to be a Magikarp master.

Always grab the thing
No one wants a quitter; Magikarp masters take risks. Throw caution to the wind if you hope to be a Magikarp master.
Teach your Magikarp to respect its elders
You wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the Magikarp you’ve raised over the years. You must ensure that knowledge is passed to future generations if you want to be a true Magikarp master.

Buy lots of friends
Your Magikarp might get lonely. Buy it some friends with cash like any good coach will do if you want to be a true Magikarp master.

Check in with other trainers
You’ll want to know how your Magikarp is stacking up against other Magikarps. Learn from your peers if you want to be a true Magikarp master.

Let it do its thing
If your Magikarp wants some berries, let it have some berries. You need to trust its judgment if you want to be a true Magikarp master.

Don’t have any regrets
Fish die all the time. You’ll have to be ready to move on if you want to be a true Magikarp master.
Good luck, trainer!
Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ordered Thursday that Uber needs to hand over to Waymo, by the end of the day, the full, unredacted term sheet between Uber and Otto. Corley ultimately decided there was no basis for Uber to redact the information because there was no privileged information shared with Otto prior to the acquisition.
“I don’t see any basis whatsoever for those redactions to be made and for that information to be withheld from Waymo,” Corley said.
Since Google’s Waymo self-driving car unit first sued Uber in February, Uber has also refused to turn over the due diligence report it conducted ahead of the Otto acquisition, arguing that it can’t be disclosed because it involves confidential information between attorneys and clients.
As the case approaches trial, Waymo has argued that there is likely information inside the due diligence report that could answer a lot of the questions Anthony Levandowski — the engineer accused of stealing self-driving car trade secrets from Google and using them at Uber — has refused to answer as a result of him exercising his Fifth Amendment rights. Waymo is asking to see this due diligence report, which includes an interview with Levandowski. But Uber is currently arguing that this is protected by attorney-client privilege.
Update 12:15pm PT: Waymo has argued that the due diligence report, which Waymo has not seen, probably shows that Uber knew about the theft. If the due diligence report does indeed mention the theft of the 14,000 documents in question, that would mean Uber had a duty to return them, Waymo argues. But Uber argues that this is Waymo’s burden to prove, and that Waymo would need to prove that Uber was engaged in planning a criminal scheme.
On Wednesday, Judge William Alsup issued a notice that essentially said that the privilege logs Levandowski provided to the court were garbage and did not provide any useful information.
“To give just one example, entire pages of the spreadsheet in response to RFP No. 3 consisted of line items that identified ‘document type’ as ‘loose e-mail attachment’ and were otherwise blank,” Alsup wrote. “Similarly, dozens of pages of the spreadsheet in response to RFP No. 1 appeared dedicated to email attachments identified only by email account, time stamp, and otherwise wholly non-descriptive information. It would be wrong to suggest that any of those ‘privilege log’ entries could justify any claim of privilege.”
By tomorrow, Levandowski must provide further disclosures because Alsup did not find the privilege logs he previously submitted were sufficient.
Quick context: On April 12, Alsup ordered Levandowski to provide logs justifying his assertion of the Fifth Amendment, saying that it should not be a long document and that he provide Waymo “enough of the argument so that they can respond.”
Last week, Uber notified Levandowski that he either needs to deny that he downloaded and took any documents from Google, or to hand over the documents to Google. Otherwise, he would be at risk of getting fired from Uber. Uber has already removed Levandowski from working on any projects related to LiDAR technology.
Levandowski’s lawyers argued that the court’s order to Uber, as well as Uber’s threat to Levandowski, would violate his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination.
If you want more background around how the hell this whole thing started, be sure to check out TC’s ongoing coverage of the case here. I’ll be here all day, so be on the lookout for more updates.

Instagram’s Direct feature just got more generally useful as a messaging option, with support added for external web links, and the ability to send photos and video in their original portrait or landscape aspect ratios without cropping. The first is really far more important than the second, mainly because it means users have less reason to go seeking other messaging options outside of Instagram.
The links feature also includes inline previews for websites you paste the URL for, and the new photo and video treatment is much more in keeping with how people actually capture and view media on mobile these days. The updates are rolling out now to iOS users, and will arrive on Android soon. Links are supported on both platforms as of version 10.22.
Instagram Direct is a popular feature among the social network’s user base – there are 375 million monthly active users on Direct alone as of last count, a fresh number shared publicly in April. It’s a far cry from Facebook Messenger’s 1.2 billion monthly actives, but that’s still one of the biggest messaging apps in the world, and a product worth iterating on in order to help it capture even more market share.

The Trillion-Dollar Market To Remake Business Applications



Managed marketplaces (also known as end-to-end or full-stack marketplaces) have been one of the hottest categories of venture investment over the past several years. Recent examples of high-flying managed marketplaces include The RealReal, Opendoor, Beepi, Luxe and thredUP, which have collectively raised nearly a billion dollars. They garner a lot of press because the consumer experiences are often radically different than what’s previously been available in the market. 
But there is confusion over what a true “managed” marketplace is. It’s fairly easy to spot a true managed marketplace if you know what you’re looking for. Managed marketplaces typically adhere to the following characteristics:

A value-added intermediary (the “management” or “service”) that provides a superior experience versus more traditional peer-to-peer marketplaces, brick and mortar or even a legacy service provider.
An introduction of additional risk into the business model; examples might include pre-purchasing and holding inventory or via investing in services related to the buyer/seller that are an incremental, variable cost before any profits have been realized (money goes out before it comes in).
A take-rate (gross margin) that is a significant premium versus other buy/sell options in the market in order to offset the premium service level or risk transfer that has occurred.


It’s important to note that many of today’s ubiquitous marketplace companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Grubhub and others are “lightly” managed, by which I mean they invest resources in quality assurance, background checks and verifying reviews. But these services are typically a de minimis expense on the company’s overall operating cost structure — often even considered as part of the customer (or merchant) acquisition cost — and therefore do not classify as a fully managed service. 
For Airbnb, these “light” costs might include the costs related to verifying a user’s home address, or the customer service costs of resolving disputes. For Grubhub, the light management might include the costs related to updating menus, but they are not fully managed in that they are not taking ownership of the food or food prep themselves (although Grubhub has begun rolling out delivery, which would qualify as a managed service). This infographic shows the primary marketplace categorizations:

In order to build a successful, sustainable managed marketplace, the take-rate margins must be high enough to support that value-added intermediary and the subsequent amount of services and risk the marketplace is providing. What makes these marketplaces so powerful is that they can drop a comparable amount of contribution margin to the bottom line while investing the higher take-rate revenues into customer experience, reducing friction and product improvements.
Additionally, if, over time, these marketplaces can develop technology that significantly reduces or eliminates the costs of providing these value-added managed services, they can continue to justify higher take-rates and build high-margin businesses that are worth a premium to their traditional service provider comparables or peer-to-peer businesses.
As a primer, here’s a quick chart of take-rates in the re-commerce industry amongst both managed marketplaces and traditional marketplaces. Can you guess which ones are actively managed?
Value innovation and risk
Now that we’ve identified that managed marketplaces are effectively business model innovations, it’s useful to go through a few on a case by case basis to identify each of these innovations and be able to properly identify managed marketplaces in the future.
Opendoor is a managed marketplace in the real estate industry that is an on-demand tool for selling your home. They utilize numerous data sources to offer real-time bids on a home, typically without ever stepping foot in it. Basically: Click a mouse, sell a house. They charge the typical 6 percent brokerage commission plus a risk-adjusted service fee (about 2-3 percent extra, on average, up to 6 percent).
Value-Add Innovation: A consumer no longer has to wait to sell their home. They don’t even so much as have to engage a real estate brokerage. Opendoor reduces the friction of selling a house from possibly months (and multiple showings) down to minutes. The company will also perform all maintenance/changes demanded by a licensed inspector. 
Risk Innovation: Unlike brokerages such as RE/MAX or Century 21, which take zero capital risk on a transaction but collect 3 percent from each of the buy/sell sides of a transaction, Opendoor is buying inventory and holding it on their books. The effect of this is that they can offer an extraordinarily differentiated experience to their home sellers, who traditionally rely on peer-to-peer markets (typical MLS listings, with a realtor advising).
Take-Rate: To justify this level of risk (holding inventory) and service (managing maintenance), Opendoor charges a take-rate on average 50 percent higher than in a traditional real estate transaction. While a 50 percent premium may seem marginal given the delta in other categories, the large transaction sizes in real estate mean that the take-rate premium on a $500,000 house is $15,000 of incremental gross margin. That is a significant amount of money to manage maintenance and some risk.
Case in point is the below estimation of Opendoor’s revenue and cost structure on an average $220,000 home (their sweet spot) with a 9 percent brokerage fee, a 50 percent premium to market rates:
Source: Inside Opendoor: What 2 Years of Transactions Tell Us
For Opendoor, when all is said and done, their average net profit, $8,320, or 3.8 percent of the home’s original selling price, is still greater than the 3 percent an agent at a traditional brokerage earns. And, they are able to provide a substantially differentiated experience. It’s a powerful model. 
TheRealReal is a managed marketplace in the luxury consignment space focused on clothing, jewelry, handbags, even art. The experience differs from eBay, for example, in that sellers need to provide zero effort other than sending their goods to a TRR warehouse (no photography, no descriptions, no customer interaction) and buyers take comfort in TheRealReal’s quality and authentication services, which they fully guarantee.
Value-Add Innovation: Rather than having to post online listings and photographs of items, pay for a third-party authentication or even deal with shipping, TheRealReal simply collects an item from a consignor and sends them a check once it sells. For sellers, it’s a true “set it and forget it” experience and is multiples more convenient than dealing with online auctions (or even price comparing between local thrift shops).
Risk Innovation: In order to provide a frictionless experience for the seller and an aesthetic, trusted experience for the buyer, TheRealReal is forced to frontload all those costs into their own overhead. They expense per-item charges for photography, copy writing and logistics before an item sells. If the item fails to sell, TheRealReal is forced to eat those overhead costs. Therefore, if they inaccurately forecast demand for certain items, they could end up burning more money than they’re able to recoup on sales.
Take-Rate: In order to justify its cost structure, TheRealReal (and other comparable marketplaces) command take-rates of 30 percent, effectively triple what non-managed, peer-to-peer marketplaces charge as a commission to sellers.
Luxe is a managed marketplace for drivers that reduces all friction associated with parking: finding a lot, searching for a spot, returning to the lot, paying the cashier and waiting to exit. Operating as an effective always-on, mobile valet service, drivers are met at their destination by a Luxe agent who takes the keys and parks a driver’s car. Upon leaving, the driver requests their car in-app and are met by a Luxe agent who delivers their car at their exit point.
Value-Add Innovation: Luxe fundamentally reimagines parking by providing any driver with an on-demand valet who will meet them across a large radius of major cities. Unlike traditional parking or even mobile parking marketplaces such as SpotHero* (which require a driver to park their own cars), Luxe reimagines driving to be destination-focused: drive to your ultimate end-point, not a parking lot. In theory, its product could save drivers time and enable them to avoid inclement weather.
Risk Innovation: In order to provide uninterrupted, on-demand service, Luxe is forced to employ numerous valets across each geography in which it operates. Irrespective of what these valets are actually paid, it is a considerable human capital cost that Luxe is forced to bear ahead of any realized demand. This is in contradistinction to a sharing economy marketplace model such as Airbnb or Uber who are not burdened with human capital costs, but rather pay transactional commissions on any given home-owner or driver.
Take-Rate: In order to counter-act the considerable human capital expense of staffing valets across a city, Luxe should be forced to charge a material premium compared to average hourly parking rates in a particular city. It is therefore quite surprising that they advertise an average of $5/hour for their service, especially when the average hourly rate in NYC, for instance, is $11-15/hour. Several months ago, reports from San Francisco suggested that prior rates of $5/hour have now increased to $15/hour or a $45 daily maximum and, as of this month, they have suspended the valet service. Given the considerable variance in parking costs by neighborhood, it is hard to assess their exact take-rate premium, but I’d estimate it would have had to have been about 200 percent of traditional parking take-rates to be profitable.
Each of these companies is built on the vision that technology will ultimately be able to deliver increased automation and better margins. For example, that one day TheRealReal’s item authentication will be entirely algorithmic or that Luxe will be able to predict the real-time flow of drivers, thereby reducing its human capital costs. Because these representative companies are all still relatively young startups, those tech-driven narratives have mostly only begun to play out. 
Beepi versus Carmax
Beepi, a managed marketplace for used cars, recently closed its doors after burning through nearly $300 million in the span of two years. Unlike eBay Motors, which is a peer-to-peer experience, offering no concierge services (although it does offer some self-service options such as free Carfax reports), Beepi was a full-service platform promising rigorous inspections on cars, a 10-day no-questions return policy for a purchased car and, for sellers, a promise that if one’s car didn’t sell in 30 days, Beepi would buy it outright for the appraised value.
The seller fees for this risk-free service? Approximately 9 percent with Beepi… versus a $125 fee for eBay motors, or about 1.25 percent on a $10,000 car, nearly an 800 percent differential.
So with a premium 9 percent take-rate, how did Beepi fail?
The best insight into their failure may come from a similar model with considerable success. It turns out that the nation’s largest retailer of used cars is also arguably one of the most recognized managed marketplaces in the world: Carmax. Give Carmax 30 minutes to inspect your car and they will buy it, even if you’re not purchasing one of theirs, with a “no-haggle,” take it or leave it offer. Thirty minutes is pretty efficient, pretty darn close to on demand.
The extraordinary thing about Carmax is that the Company’s gross profit per used car sold basically doesn’t change even when the year’s average price per car sold moves up or down by 5 percent in any given year. Which means that Carmax is actually less focused on their take-rate per car, but instead focused on their profit per car; their commission is a function of the profit they expect to earn. 
Rationally, this makes sense as well — consumers value convenience but have a cognitive dollar limit they are willing to trade for that convenience. By inverting their take-rate to be a function of their profit expectations, Carmax is able to offer more for higher-end cars where a 10 percent difference between the car’s BlueBook value and Carmax’s offer would likely be too extreme for a customer to accept. For high-priced assets, a flat tax is fundamentally unlikely to work.
Used cars are curious assets in that they depreciate so quickly that even 60 days can have a demonstrable impact on value. This is where Carmax excels. In their most recent annual reporting, Carmax notes having sold more than 600,000 cars in the prior year with (then) present inventories at about 55,000. That’s a retail turn of about 11, meaning that a car moves off Carmax’s lot every 35 days or so, allowing them to more accurately price cars and make higher offers, being less exposed to the less predictable volatility of depreciation. 
In a post-mortem on Beepi, Carlypso founder Chris Coleman suggests that in addition to the noted reasons (depreciation effects, and cognitive pricing differential), the approach was inherently flawed from a customer acquisition perspective. Specifically, that while there are customers looking to simply sell their car for cash, most car owners are looking to trade-in a car, because they still need a car and there are tax benefits to doing so; a platform that has to pay marketing costs for both the buyer and seller in all transactions is at a significant disadvantage.
At the end of the day, a managed marketplace model for used cars does work. Carmax is only one of thousands of proof points: tens of thousands of dealerships across the country hold inventory, inspect cars and reap a profit. Beepi’s failings appear to be the result of poor execution, mispricings and maybe even some bad luck around a financing that fell through. 
Automation and Shutterstock
Because managed marketplaces involve a heavy “service” component to improve the overall experience, one of the expectations of the sector is that as artificial intelligence and automation continue to evolve, the human capital cost of providing the service will decrease if software can assume more of those responsibilities.
But an area of struggle with managed marketplaces is that very few digital managed marketplaces are actually public companies, reducing the visibility into their overall economics and processes — and making it hard to test the assumption that service costs should come down over time. Luckily, there’s at least one: Shutterstock (NYSE: SSTK), a marketplace for photographers to sell their images, bills itself as a “trusted, actively managed marketplace,” in that “each image is individually examined by [their] team of trained reviewers.” 
On the spectrum of managed marketplaces, Shutterstock is undoubtedly on the lighter end — with the financial risk from its active management being only the human capital cost of its QA reviewers. Nevertheless, it would seem like this hypothesis is an ideal one to test on a company such as Shutterstock, which isn’t dependent on an unproven technology such as self-driving cars to reduce their cost of providing a service, but could presumably leverage proven, inexpensive image recognition technologies to do much of the quality assurance, copyright detection and tagging that the human reviewers do. 
Yet, that doesn’t appear to be borne out by Shutterstock’s financials. To test the automation hypothesis, I decided to look at the company’s revenue versus the cost to generate that revenue. Shutterstock defines their costs of revenue as “royalties paid to contributors, credit card processing fees, content review costs, customer service expenses, infrastructure and hosting costs…and associated employee compensation.” I would assume that credit card processing fees as a percentage of revenue are relatively flat (if not slightly reduced year over year) and that cloud-hosting fees also scale mostly proportionately to demand (revenue). I’ve defined “True COGS” below as the aforementioned expenses to providing their service, minus the contributor royalties:
Surprisingly, rather than decreasing over time, these True COG costs appear to be increasing. Meaning that the same picture that used to take 10.5 percent of revenues to process now costs nearly 15 percent.
There are a number of possible explanations here. It’s certainly possible that these increased costs are because the company is investing heavily into automation, the effects of which simply haven’t been borne out yet while they streamline their QA process. It’s also possible that the number of photos the company maintains makes it more expensive to process each incremental picture — for any variety of reasons.
The learning from this Shutterstock case study, a company which is now 14 years old, is that it’s improper to simply assume that the substantial service-related costs that managed marketplaces incur in their early stages will decrease with “scale,” either through execution or software automation. As with any company, there is always room for improvement, but the above analysis of Shutterstock would imply that it’s nowhere near as easy as flipping a switch.
Takeaways
Managed marketplaces are a quintessential venture investment, allowing entrepreneurs to recast consumer experiences while leveraging venture capital subsidies to hold much of the risk inherent in these managed models. 
From a unit economic perspective, the potential automation of much of the service labor that goes into these platforms could be significant. Investors and operators need to remain sensitive that it is ultimately the technology, not heavy services, that will long-term cultivate highly desired business models and margins. But, that future automation could also lower the barriers and defensibility of these companies, allowing peer-to-peer players to launch a comparable offering with similar software. 
In my mind, the sustaining managed marketplaces will not only re-imagine the experience they’re approaching, but be focused from the outset on building a data moat around their product, thereby ensuring that they remain the platform of choice, even if software innovation begins to level the overall playing field.

There are only a few virtual reality titles that I’ve played where I need a bit of a “come down” period to regroup my thoughts and start thinking like a real human again.
SUPERHOT VR is one of those titles.
Today, the Rift-exclusive is finally coming to the HTC Vive natively via the Steam store, nearly six months after its launch on the Oculus Store. It’s been heralded by many as one of the best virtual reality titles out there, and I can say from first-hand experience that it’s my most-played game by far across all VR systems.
The entire game is a bit like a series of puzzles where you’re dropped in a room with a couple of weapons around you and a bunch of geometric assassins headed to kill you. Time only progresses as you physically move your body, so you have to decide the efficiency and order of your actions in order to take out the baddies before they take you out.

Things are simple enough when they’re holding bats or knives, but when three of them are shooting shotguns at you and you have to navigate some complex “bullet-time” maneuvers, it won’t be long before you’re performing some advanced yoga moves to avoid getting hit.
The title, which was partially funded by Oculus, is actually a port from a PC game, which feels bizarre, given how perfect the mechanics are for VR.
In March, the game was updated with the “Forever” update, which brought a variety of new modes that significantly extended replayability, letting you fight an endless barrage of enemies or fine-tune options so that you could play headshots-only or race through levels to beat personal best times.
Though the Vive has gotten a lot of exciting developer attention, Oculus has been digging deep into Facebook war chests to dole out hundreds of millions to content creators who are willing to launch exclusively on the Rift and Gear VR platforms. SUPERHOT VR and Robo Recall have been a couple of the most platform-defining games made, and they’ve launched as Oculus exclusives. This has led to some Vive owners downloading a piece of software called “Revive,” which allows them to purchase games on the Oculus store and play them on their HTC headsets.
With today’s update, the game at last comes natively to the Vive, allowing Steam users a simpler and legit route to get playing. The game is generally $24.99, but is $5 cheaper this week.
It’s a beautiful, badass title, and if you own a Rift or Vive and have never tried it, do yourself a favor and download it.
Robots may have the upper hand on math and science, and pretty much everything else we learn using computers, but when it comes to athletics, no one can kick around a ball quite like a human can.
In this installment of Judah vs. the Machines, actor Judah Friedlander heads to the University of Miami to see how the school’s RoboCanes robotic soccer team fares in a challenge against his own soccer abilities.
Friedlander met with Dr. Ubbo Visser, who works as a software developer on the RoboCanes project. In Visser’s mind, the soccer team project is focused on the broader functions of the limits in how robots think and how bipedal humanoids are able to move and work together.
“We’re playing soccer to identify how much new technology we need to create and we need to develop in order to have a fully autonomous team of humanoid robots and humanoid embodiments,” Visser told Friedlander.
It’s clear that these robots aren’t quite Boston Dynamics-level mobile, and it would probably take about 10,000 of these to even have a dream of taking out Sarah Connor. This being the case, Judah doesn’t actually suit up to play against the pint-sized, electro-competitors. Instead he grabs a gamepad and controls one of the robotic footballers against three AI-controlled opponents.
Check out the video above to see how Friedlander handles the responsibility of taking on robots as humanity’s all-star representative.

In an all-too-familiar Airbnb fashion, the home-sharing company has released a report touting how great it is. Airbnb says it helped travelers collectively save $12 million on Memorial Day weekend last year by offering them accommodations in homes versus hotels. This is based on Airbnb’s analysis of hotel prices versus Airbnb prices last Memorial Day weekend in 14 cities and seven common tourist destinations.
In San Francisco, for example, the average hotel room rate last Memorial Day weekend was $199, compared to an average room rate of $145 on Airbnb. On an individual basis, that was about $54 in savings per room. You can take a look at how Airbnb did its calculations below.

Clearly, this is a marketing scheme to convince people to book their accommodations via Airbnb versus hotels this Memorial Day weekend.
“For too long, hotels have had nearly unchecked power to raise rates and price gouge consumers at will,” the report states. “While more research into this matter is necessary, it is clear that Airbnb has given consumers more affordable accommodation options and left hotel industry executives deeply concerned about their ability to price gouge consumers in the years ahead.”

Google’s News Lab launched a new tool for making basic data GIFs today. While the Data GIF Maker is mostly geared toward journalists, anybody can use it to make some halfway interesting visuals based on all kinds of data.
But don’t get too excited yet. Not only does it take a bit of manual work to make these GIFs, the tool isn’t especially flexible either. This isn’t some GIF-centric version of the Google Data Studio. Instead, you can use it only to compare stats about two different topics over time (Trump/Hillary, iPhone/Android, etc.). It’s not going to instantly turn your next TED talk into a classic, either.

“We typically use the tool to represent competing search interest, but it can show whatever you want it to—polling numbers, sales figures, movie ratings, etc.,” the team behind this new tool explains in today’s announcement.
To get started, you pick your two topics, enter your data in a comma-separated list, write a few words about what your readers are looking at and then let the tool do its work in creating a GIF for you (which can actually take a while). And that’s it. Now go forth and make some data GIFs.
Amazon has officially begun operating its AmazonFresh Pickup locations in Seattle, letting customers order groceries ahead of time and then quickly grab them on their way home. The service requires as little as 15 minutes advance notice, without any minimum purchase requirements, and it’s a free service for any Amazon Prime members.
Amazon first revealed Pickup back in March, but it’s officially opening shop for general use as of today. The pilot is limited to just one market – Amazon’s home turf – to begin with, but if it works it’s likely to make its way to other cities, since Amazon has been chasing the fresh grocery carrot for many years now in hopes of finding a way to make it profitable at scale.
Lyft is getting into the higher-end ride hailing game with Lyft Lux and Lyft Lux SUV. These are black car offerings similar to the service that rival Uber originally launched with, and they’ll be available beginning in 20 markets with a gradual rollout starting now in five initial markets and continuing through mid-June.
Lux will roll out first in five U.S. cities where it makes the most sense to expect a demand for premium ride options, including Chicago, LA, NYC, SF and San Jose. On the driver side, the process of getting approved to drive Lux is obviously a bit more complex than the standard procedure for signing up to drive Lyft, and includes both a geographic requirement (you have to drive in a city where it’s currently offered), and a higher, more specific standard for vehicles.
Eligible cars must be at least a 2011 model year or above, have an actual black exterior paint job (in top condition), have leather or simulated leather seating, and be able to seat at least 6 riders comfortably if you want to drive the Lux SUV option, too. There’s also a specific list of car models and makes that you can use, which is available in full here.
Driving for Lux and Lux SUV will result in higher fares, of course, and will also cost more for users. It’s a good option for Lyft to make available if it wants to win over some of Uber’s more top-end customers, who are looking for a fancier ride during business travel or while hosting clients, for example.
Many looking at the future of ride hailing see the market continuing to evolve and serve a variety of different tiers – Tesla competitor Lucid Motors is even building a luxury EV sedan specifically tailored to ride-sharing and ride hailing usage. Differentiated service offerings like Lux will help Lyft better address this market maturation, should it continue to evolve along the lines of hotels and other aspects of the hospitality industry.
Two years ago payments startup Stripe launched a new product called Stripe Connect to serve a growing number of marketplace customers. Today the company is launching a new set of capabilities that will enable new marketplace categories and help companies sign up and onboard sellers and service providers to their platforms.
“When Stripe launched in 2011, very early on, one of  the fastest growing use cases we saw was companies not accepting money on behalf of themselves but accepting money on behalf of third parties,” co-founder John Collison told me. Those businesses included e-commerce marketplaces, crowdfunding platforms and 1099-style gig economy startups.
In each case, what they had in common was that they needed to build their own systems for managing payments coming in, tracking who earned what and then dealing with all the regulatory and tax implications of making payments out to sellers or service providers. The situation was even more complicated for businesses that operate internationally and need to deal with multiple regulatory regimes and payment endpoints.
Rather than having to each build their own in-house payments teams, Stripe Connect was launched to commoditize all the payments infrastructure needed to serve both sides of a two-sided marketplace. According to Collison, that included building a funds-routing engine, a
payouts engine, onboarding management, receipts verification, as well as compliance and platform operations for U.S. and international regulatory regimes.
With those problems mostly solved, Stripe Connect is looking to tackle some of the more complex issues its marketplace customers face. For instance, not every marketplace has just two sides of a transaction: Increasingly, customers are looking for ways to manage one-to-many payments and many-to-many fund flows. Meanwhile, other customers desired tools that would allow them to hold funds in an escrow-like state or provide direct account debits.
By offering new payment types within Stripe Connect, the company is providing more flexibility around the way payments are routed. Ultimately that will simplify the business logic of some existing customers, but it could also enable new business models to emerge.
The second big addition to Stripe Connect is a new onboarding flow called Express, which customers can use to get sellers and service providers signed up to receive payments. For businesses like Lyft or Postmates, where growing their supply of service providers is critical to providing a high level of service, reducing the friction associated with getting them paid can become a key differentiator.
With Express, those businesses no longer have to manually import their outgoing payment information into Stripe’s platform. Instead, Stripe Connect provides a landing page where sellers or service providers are asked to input their own personal and payment information, which is then connected to the business’ payment system.
That not only shortens the time it takes for service providers to get paid, but it also removes a step in the onboarding process for the marketplace company. “Very small improvements can represent very big gains down the line in getting a marketplace set up,” Collison told me.
For Stripe, that doesn’t just mean making customers happier — it also means driving more payments through its APIs and developer toolkit. And that, ultimately, means more volume and more money for Stripe.
Uber and Lyft had paused their operations in Austin, TX back in 2016, because local regulators imposed rules that both argued were overly taxing to running their businesses. The rules included requiring fingerprint-based background checks for drivers, as well as barring pick-ups and drop-offs in lanes on certain roads within the city. Both Uber and Lyft will resume operations because Texas state regulators have passed a bill that overrules local regulations regarding ride-hailing services.
State Governor Greg Abbot will sign the new bill into law on Monday, the same day that both will resume service in the city, as The Texas Tribune reports. The bill, offiically HB 100, essentially undoes the rules put in place by Austin municipal regulators, standardizing requirements for ride-hailing operations across the state, and requiring that they have a permit from the state licensing body, which incurs an annual operations fee. It requires background checks performed at the local, state and national level, but doesn’t require that these include fingerprinting.
Uber confirmed it will return to active operating status in Austin on Monday, and provided the following statement to TechCrunch via spokesperson Travis Considine:
Austin is an incubator for technology and entrepreneurship, and we are excited to be back in the mix. Our local team is focused on making sure that Uber works for Austinites and helping our driver-partners earn. We know that we have a lot of work to do in the city, but we couldn’t be more excited for the road ahead.

Twilio is getting into the serverless game today with the beta launch of Twilio Functions. Like other so-called “serverless” platforms, Functions abstracts away all of the tiresome server and infrastructure management and scaling and allows developers to focus on building their event-driven applications.
“Writing code is a creative endeavor,” said Patrick Malatack, Twilio VP of Product, in today’s announcement. “The developers and businesses building cloud communications apps should be focusing on the customer experience, not managing servers. Fueling the future of communications starts with unleashing developer creativity, and that’s exactly what Twilio Functions was designed to do. We can’t wait to see what developers build next!”
So instead of having to set up and maintain the infrastructure (or scale it as demand grows), developers can use functions to run their code on Twilio’s platform whenever a new SMS message comes in, for example. To do this, developers have to write their code in JavaScript and Twilio then executes it in a standard Node.js environment that runs on Twilio’s infrastructure.
To be honest, the term “serverless” is one of my least favorite buzzwords right now (it’s right up there with “hyperconverged”). While it captures the fact that it abstracts away all the underlying infrastructure, the programming model is more about triggering code execution based on incoming events.
The other promise of this event-driven model is that you only pay for the compute resources you actually use. For Functions, this means that the first 10,000 requests to Functions are free. After that, you pay $0.0001 for each request. You also can use the service to host static files. The pricing model here is the same, with 10,000 free requests and a price of $0.0001 per request after that.
All of this runs in the Twilio Runtime, which comes with helper libraries, API keys, preconfigured assets and debugging tools.
One of the problems publishers face today in making their content more readable on mobile devices is that there are multiple, competing formats available for this purpose. Facebook has Instant Articles, Google is spearheading the AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) project, and the Apple News Format optimizes content for iOS devices. Facebook is today taking a crack at a solution to this problem by rolling out support for both AMP and soon Apple News as a part of its open source Instant Articles software development kit.
The updated SDK will now include an extension that lets publishers build content that’s publishable in all three formats, beginning with support for Google’s AMP in addition to Facebook’s own Instant Articles. In the weeks ahead it will also include support for publishing to Apple News, though the company didn’t provide an exact launch date for when that feature would be added.
At a high level, the SDK will take the markup that’s used to build Facebook’s Instant Articles and use it to create the code that’s needed to build for AMP and Apple News. While the multiple systems aren’t identical, of course, Facebook says it will offer ways for publishers to apply the custom styling templates for the competing services – including the application of things like custom fonts, colors, and captions, which will be mirrored as closely as possible in the other formats.
The goal with this change is to offer a design once, publish anywhere experience – and naturally it’s one where publishing to Facebook is the first priority, in terms of getting things right.
The functionality will be made available through an extension to the Facebook Instant Articles SDK, which is found here on Github. (Documentation on its usage is on the Facebook for Developers site, here.)
The idea for the extension came about as part of the Facebook Journalism Project, a program that aims to connect Facebook with media publishers to help inform the company’s roadmap for upcoming news features on its site. The project’s other ideas include things like letting publishers offer free trials to their paid subscriptions via Facebook, hackathons with publishers’ development teams, digest packages that Facebook users can subscribe to, PSAs to promote news literacy across Facebook, tutorials for journalists, and more.
However, the extension’s launch also comes at a time when a number of high-profile publishers have begun to abandon Facebook’s format, due to its lack of monetization options.
In April, for example, it was reported that Forbes, Hearst, The New York Times and others have backed out of Instant Articles. Other major media organizations including Bloomberg, The WSJ, ESPN, CBS News, NPR, Financial Times, and VICE News have also been holdouts, running little to no content in Facebook’s format. Others who have used the format have been winding down their support; and last month, The Guardian pulled out of both Facebook’s Instant Articles and Apple News.
Publishers are generally unhappy with the deals the platforms are cutting on revenue sharing, and don’t like that the Instant Article format prevents them from having a more direct relationship with their readers. Sending visitors to stripped down, mobile-optimized pages may be a good experience for readers who don’t have to deal with pop-ups and other clutter, but it has historically meant that publishers can’t serve all the same advertisements as on the web, nor encourage donations, push paid subscriptions, promote their email newsletters or events, or make other connections with readers.
Facebook has tried to stem some of these concerns by tweaking the rules for Instant Articles – allowing them to show more ads, for example, or by rolling out new features, like call-to-action units in the articles that can promote email sign-ups or request Page Likes. It lets publishers push free trials and app downloads, among other things.
Now, by tying Facebook Instant Articles to AMP and Apple News, the company hopes that it can lure publishers back to its platform by making it possible to publish to all three major services at once. But without fully loosening its restrictions, Facebook may still have a hard time making the case for Instant Articles, if the format doesn’t match up with publishers’ larger goals.
Mogees, the London startup behind the Mogees Pro and Mogees Play contact microphone and machine learning-based music and gaming devices, has raised $1.1 million in seed funding — capital it plans to use to embed its “gestural recognition tech” into new products and applications.
Specifically, the company says it is developing new multi-platform hardware and software targeting IoT, gaming, VR, AR, “smart toys” and industrial applications.
Founder Bruno Zamborlin tells this will consist of an embedded/wireless version of the Mogees technology in the form of a tiny chip designed to improve third party products.
“What I think is great about our technology is that it is non-intrusive, incredibly sensitive and works well with pretty much any physical object an shape,” he says.
“We are now looking for further investors and partners interested in improving their products through machine learning. Clearly this news reflects our confidence that Mogees technology has applications beyond music and interactive entertainment with many obvious uses and benefits across a wide range of sectors”.
What those “obvious” use cases are, the startup isn’t saying and I’m clearly not smart enough to make too many guesses.
The company’s first product targeted musicians with a device that could work with both iOS and a Mac and professional MIDI/DAW software, such as Apple’s Logic Pro. It essentially turns any surface into a musical instrument and professional sound design tool.
The second Mogees Play product is more affordable and aimed at casual gaming and the education market, with an emphasis on being musical without much or any prior musical knowledge.
Meanwhile, Mogees’ investors include Elio Leoni Sceti (former CEO of Iglo group and previously CEO of EMI), Haim Perry (founder and board member of Hotels4U), and Eric Nicoli CBE (former Non-Executive Chairman of HMV Group plc, and also a former Chair of EMI Group, amongst numerous positions). A.I. Music Group, founded by Siavash Mahdavi, also participated in the seed round.
In other words, an investor list with a heavy bent towards music, retail, entertainment, in addition to tech.
Bike sharing has taken a turn in the U.S., following trends in China. The new mode is “dockless,” where companies distribute bikes around a city or campus to be rented per trip instead of dispensing them from one station. The bikes are tracked via GPS, and can be located by users, paid for and unlocked using their smartphones. Best of all, when riders are done with one of these bikes, they can park them anywhere that’s convenient (and legal).
As TechCrunch has previously reported, venture investors are pouring money into startups trying to make dockless bike sharing a success domestically. These businesses are facing fragmented regulations and competition from better-funded Chinese players coming to North America, as well as incumbents like Motivate Co., the kiosk-based bike-sharing company that has locked up agreements with cities across the country.
The latest to score a round of funding is Spin (incorporated as Skinny Labs Inc.), a San Francisco startup founded by veterans of the tech scene: CEO Derrick Ko, president Euwyn Poon and CTO Zaizhuang Cheng. Spin just closed an $8 million Series A round of venture funding led by Grishin Robotics, and joined by Exponent.VC, CRCM and angel investors Matt Brezina and Charlie Cheever.
Euwyn Poon said now that it has locked in a Series A round, Spin will ramp up hiring and embark on negotiations with different municipalities to bring its bike-sharing service across the country without ruffling feathers.
Dockless bike-sharing companies have stirred fears that bikes will clutter the sidewalks, posing a hazard to pedestrians and creating an eyesore. To keep their company in good standing with regulators and cities, Spin has enlisted Molly Turner, the founder of Airbnb’s policy team, as an advisor.
Spin co-founders in San Francisco
Grishin Robotics founder Dmitry Grishin said he believes cities will want to have Spin’s bikes around because of their potential to reduce pollution and traffic and increase users’ fitness. The investor said, “It has surprised me that ride-hailing apps have not significantly reduced traffic jams in places like San Francisco. Traffic is getting worse all the time. We need to add more systematic ways to solve short distance travel. Making bikes more accessible in cities will help. It’s very good for commuters, but also tourists. So it’s a huge market opportunity.”
Spin’s competition includes several other funded startups here. Social Bicycles, the first to offer kiosk-free bike sharing in the U.S., has raised $7 million, and has already reached profitability. Another early bike-share player, Zagster, closed a $10 million Series B round that it announced in January. And earlier this spring, LimeBike closed a $12 million Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz.
Derrick Ko, a former Lyft product manager, said Spin will differentiate its offering with bikes that are comfortable to ride and self-locking, and an easy-to-use app. While Spin allows users to pay with Apple Pay and Android Pay, or by inputting their credit card info into the company’s app today, the startup will look to integrate other payment technologies down the line.
Spin CTO Zaizhuang Cheng said, “One of our goals is to bring equitable bike sharing to all the communities who may not have credit cards and smartphones. We have seen examples of this in Taiwan. They make it easy for someone to take a train, and when they get off, continue their journey on a bike.” (It could prove convenient to be able to pay for a bike with the same card you used for the subway.)
Spin will roll out bikes in Seattle this June, the co-founders said. But they did not disclose how many bikes they would dispatch in that market, or other cities where they plan to operate this year.

Atlantic.Net, the Florida-based hosting provider, today announced that its users can now use Windows Server Containers on its platform to bring their existing Windows workloads into the cloud.
While many of the larger cloud providers like AWS and Google also offer support for Windows containers on their virtual machines and dedicated container platforms, Atlantic.Net’s more direct competitors like DigitalOcean and Linode typically only offer support for Linux distributions (though OVH, for example, does feature Windows Server support, too).
Atlantic.Net’s CEO Marty Puranik tells me that in order to enable this, the company is launching a container-ready image of Windows Server 2016 beside the standard Windows Server 2016 image. This means developers won’t have to go through PowerShell to download and install extensions to start working with containers.
Puranik noted that he’s mostly seeing demand from DevOps groups that want to move their Windows applications into the cloud and he expects that quite a few companies will also want to use this new service to quickly test and deploy containers on Windows Server 2016. He also tells me that his company may look at launching a dedicated container service if there’s enough customer demand for it, but for now, the company wants to give businesses a platform for deploying and scaling their Windows Containers.
“As a side note: because we deploy virtual machines much faster than AWS and have faster SSD Raid10 local storage the whole experience is much better — server is ready faster, it just does everything more snappy — and you get redundancy on the server storage as well,” Puranik noted. “So once people try our environment, they don’t want to go back.”
Windows Server hosting plans at Atlantic.Net currently start at $0.0208 per hour (or $14 per month).

Rackspace announced today it was purchasing TriCore, giving it an enterprise applications management play to go along with its cloud management services.
The announcement comes just one day after the company announced it was bringing a new CEO onboard, make it a busy week for the firm.
The companies did not share the terms of the deal, but Rackspace called it the largest acquisition in company history. To this point, it had acquired 8 companies, none since 2013 according to Crunchbase data.
The move gives Rackspace the ability to not only manage a company’s cloud services, but also move up the stack and begin managing complex applications from large enterprise software companies like Oracle or SAP, something Rackspace says customers have been asking for increasingly.
It also means that the company can move away from competing directly with public cloud providers, which is rapidly becoming a no-win proposition, Ted Chamberlin, an analyst for Gartner who covers cloud service providers told TechCrunch. Grabbing TriCore will give Rackspace access to new markets inside companies that don’t compete directly with the big infrastructure vendors.
“It’s evident that Rackspace, as well as most other IaaS providers, just can’t compete with the scale, pricing and rapid product development of AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. TriCore helps them get to more on-premise workloads for mid-to-large enterprises, an area that Google and AWS won’t touch,” he explained.
It also could give Rackspace deeper access inside large organizations beyond IT into business units. “They no longer are selling commoditized infrastructure capacity; they now can sell to the lines of businesses and support the core ERP applications like SAP, Oracle and JD Edwards that run entire companies,” Chamberlin said.
TriCore, a Norwell, Massachusetts-based company has been around since 1999 and boasts over 500 employees. It appears TriCore will be for the most part continuing to operate on its own while working together with Rackspace on cross-sales opportunities where it makes sense.
TriCore brings with it 275 customers and can work with customers on any infrastructure whether in the public cloud, a private datacenter, TriCore’s own datacenter or a co-location facility.
The deal is expected to close in June.

Back in the mists of 2014 we revealed how one of the UK’s most active venture investment funds operated. To this day Octopus Ventures continues to rub shoulders with the most active institutional VC funds at the early stage, even though it’s technically an evergreen fund attached to the stock market. It’s backed hits like LoveFilm, Zoopla through to IPO, Graze as well as Secret Escapes and SwiftKey which sold to Microsoft. Then there was Evi to Amazon, and Magic Pony to Twitter, and Rangespan (Google) and Vision Direct (Essilor). It’s even in that hipster music startup Sofar Sounds.
The twin combination of Alex Macpherson, who heads the Ventures team at Octopus, with George Whitehead running Venture Partners and chairing the AngelCo Fund has been pretty active. Macpherson says they’ve been “incredibly fortunate to back some truly outstanding entrepreneurs, many of whom come back to us time and time again with new ventures.”
It turns 10 this year and has ‘opened the kimono’ to put some more detailed figures about its business out there.
The current fund size is now £661m, with a portfolio of 55 companies. That’s not as much as the triumvirate of Index, Accel, Balderton (for instance) also out of the UK, but is highly significant. It tends to invest £100m a year. That translates into £250,000 to a potential £25 million in a first round of funding.
It’s now spread between London, New York and has Venture Partners based in San Francisco, Shanghai and Singapore, who are designed to help and support the Octopus portfolio as they grow.
Octopus Ventures is backed by evergreen funds in VCT, EIS and traditional LP/GP funds. These Evergreen funds come from retail investors, listed on the London Stock exchange. That means it can continue to raise funds from the public markets. It’s not quite the same as VC funds backed by pension funds or family offices, but it’s still a contender. It also means it can invest early to decent later rounds.

Productivity app maker Readdle is rolling out a new feature across its line of iOS applications that takes advantage of the iPad’s support for split screen viewing to make it easier to move files between apps. The move could encourage current Readdle customers to buy the software maker’s larger suite of apps in order to take advantage of the new functionality.
Split view is a feature available on select iPads, including the iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, and iPad Pro and later devices. It allows for a split-paned experience, making iPads work more like a traditional computer where you’re able to move between different windows, instead of remaining locked inside one app at a time.
Readdle’s support for drag-and-drop in split screen mode will work its mobile scanning app, Scanner Pro; PDF reader and editor PDF Expert; email app Spark; and file manager Documents. The latter is also getting an upgrade designed to make the latest version, Documents 6, more like a Finder for iOS devices.
The company is one of the first to fully take advantage of split screen multi-tasking on iPad for work productivity, with this release.

For example, you could drag a file you just scanned from Scanner Pro over to Spark, where it would become an email attachment, or copy it over to another app, like PDF Expert. Or you could pull in an email attachment from Spark over to PDF Expert where you could edit the file before sending it back. You could also grab multiple files from Documents, then drag them over the Spark to email them to recipients.
Readdle is able to make its support for split screen compelling because it has the ecosystem to support it. The company’s apps have been downloaded over 65 million times, and have millions of monthly active users.

Today’s developers often struggle to figure out how to upsell existing customers by encouraging them to download the company’s other apps, but this drag-and-drop feature makes a good case for iPad productivity users as to why to buy into Readdle’s whole ecosystem.
However, it’s possible that with a new release of iOS, Apple will offer a new API that requires developers to support drag and drop in their apps, by specifying what files can be dragged out and what file types their apps receive. This would enable drag and drop to work across iPad, and make for a more robust computing experience in general – something that could better rival Microsoft’s Surface.
If this were to roll out, it would limit the appeal of Readdle’s apps as files could be moved between any apps on the device. But until Apple implements such a thing, Readdle lets you preview what that experience would be like.
Microsoft’s live-streaming service Beam, which the company acquired last year shortly after it emerged as the winner of the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, is today getting a new name: Mixer. The name is meant to express the way the service brings people together, the team explains, but it’s not the only change rolling out today, as it turns out. Mixer is also launching new features including co-streaming, a mobile broadcasting app for iOS and Android, a new guide for finding what’s currently streaming across its service, and more.
With the launch of co-streaming, Mixer will now allow up to four streamers to combine their streams into a single page, where they’re displayed in a split screen view. This allows viewers to watch all the streams at the same time, while also participating in a centralized chat. While the feature could be used to broadcast a co-op session of “League of Legends,” notes the blog post about the new feature, it doesn’t have to be used to stream the same content.

Friends could be playing different games or even streaming something non-game related, like the music from a band or a multi-player board game.
Using a live streaming platform for more than gameplay is something rival Twitch has focused on in recent months, as well. The Amazon-owned company has added new channels for creative content, tools for vlogging, and ways for viewers to find streams related to non-gaming interests, as a means of broadening its user base beyond hard-core gamers.
This  co-streaming feature is rolling out today to all Mixer users and, in a few weeks time, Xbox One users will be able to invite friends to co-stream right from the Guide.
Mixer is also launching a new mobile app called Mixer Create into beta. The app will work on both iOS and Android devices, and currently allows you to self-broadcast. Soon, the app will allow to stream mobile gameplay directly from your smartphone to the Mixer service. When this launches, you’ll also be able to co-stream with friends who are broadcasting on PC, console, or mobile devices.
Also new is “Channel One” – a guide to what’s happening across the Mixer service. This aims to help viewers find something to watch by highlighting new releases, livestream events, tips and tricks, esports updates, and other content. The feature can also serve as an introductory guide to new users, who may not know exactly where to get started on the service, given the array of available content to watch.
The Xbox One dashboard will add a Mixer page, too, which will be another way of exploring what’s popular across the service.
While Microsoft hasn’t disclosed Mixer’s numbers, it’s clear that the company is heavily invested in bringing a cross-platform live streaming experience to users. Mixer (then called Beam) arrived on the Windows 10 platform through the Creators Update earlier this year, and hit the Xbox One at the same time.
With the added support for co-streaming and live broadcasting, Microsoft is also preparing a platform that can extend beyond just gameplay, offering streamers a way to live broadcast anything to their viewers, including their own vlogs.

In addition to all these updates, Mixer also announced a new digital production studio in the Microsoft Store in New York, called the Mixer NYC Studio.
The idea is that the studio will offer broadcast facilities and host gaming and esports events, which will go out live to viewers across the Mixer service.  Using a physical retail store for real-world events that showcase the company’s technology is something Apple is doing as well, most recently with expanded educational programming featuring artists, photographers and musicians.
The studio supports 2D and 3D graphic effects, a digital audio system bringing arena, concert sound quality, full interactive lighting control, an LED video wall, shoutcaster desks and player lounges, along with stage, audience and commentary setups, says Mixer.
Update, 6/1/17: Microsoft reached out to correct its earlier announcement and clarify that the mobile app is only currently available on iOS via TestFlight, not in the public app store. The beta is publicly available on Android, and the public release will launch on both platforms, iOS and Android, in the weeks ahead. 
Do you think you know cars?
Well, Blippar’s new machine learning technology is ready to take you on, as the augmented reality/visual search company is today announcing automotive recognition tech.
In other words, Blippar’s AI can identify the make, model and year of any U.S. car made in 2000 or after, as long as the car is traveling slower than 15mph.
Blippar originally launched as an AR platform for brands and publishers. Using a little tag (a Blipp), brands could identify content like a label of a ketchup bottle or an ad in a magazine that users could scan with their phones to reveal extra augmented reality content.
The company has since pivoted to focus on visual search. There are plenty of things you see in the real world that are difficult to describe via text in a Google Search, such as flowers or items of clothing or an unfamiliar animal.
The company has spent the last year building out that visual search engine to identify generic objects — a table, a chair, a cup, and so on — and has laid the foundation to dive into specific verticals for visual search.
That begins with this automotive identification technology.

The technology will live within the Blippar app for folks who want to play around with it, offering information around make, model, year, average review rating, and a 360-degree view of the car, both inside and out. But the larger play comes in the form of an API, also launching today.
Secondhand sellers and insurance companies can build in this automotive identification technology into their own apps and pay on a performance basis to enhance their own businesses.
The tech has over 97.7 percent accuracy in recognizing vehicles, and Blippar says the technology is beyond what most humans can identify by sight.

We can expect to see Blippar roll out this type of technology, and accompanying API, across a number of sectors over the next year. In fact, CEO Rish Mitra mentioned that fashion is coming soon.
Blippar has raised a total of $99 million in funding from the likes of Qualcomm Ventures and Khazanah Nasional, according to Crunchbase.
There’s a new official mobile Pokémon game for iOS and Android devices, and it’s all about everyone’s favorite floppy fish: Magikarp. If you’re a longtime Pokémon fan, then you probably recall grinding with a Magikarp in your party to get it to level 20, whereupon (spoiler alert) it would blossom into a the powerful and awesome Gyarados.
While it was great to get the dragon-like Pokémon from a strategic standpoint, it was always bittersweet to say farewell to the adorable, ineffectual Magikarp. That’s why it’s great that this new mobile game is focused entirely on the fish with very few skills.
The game focuses on one of Magikarp’s few strong suits: Jumping. Your task as the player is to catch Magikarp and then train them to jump the highest. That involves feeding it berries, training it in a number of different ways and then having it compete at the jumping league.

It’s adorable and fun, and free to play (with in-app purchases), so check it out if you’re a fan of the series. I’m curious to see if it’ll keep player interest longer than either Super Mario Run or Pokémon Go, but a lot of that could depend on how much you like Magikarp. For me, the answer is very much a lot.
After leaving his role at Uber as VP of Global Vehicle Programs in April, Sherif Marakby is back at Ford to lead its autonomous vehicles and electrifications program. Marakby’s new VP role was announced as part of a general executive re-organization revealed on Thursday under new Ford CEO Jim Hackett.
Marakby joined Uber in April 2016, coming from Ford where he worked for 25 years, most recently as Director of Global Electrical/Electronic Systems Engineering. When Marakby’s departure from Uber became public in April, he didn’t specific future plans or a reason for his departure.
In his new role at Ford, Marakby will be a VP reporting to EVP and President of Global Markets Jim Farley. Other noteworthy shifts in leadership from a technology perspective include Ken Washington stepping into the CTO role, and continuing as VP of Research and Engineering, and former CTO Raj Nair (who just spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017) moving to lead Ford’s North American operations.
The Tesla Model 3 is so close you could taste it (probably tastes like car) but we don’t yet know final specs on the vehicle. A new retail comparison chart surfaced at the Tesla Model 3 Owners Club forum (via InsideEVs) that offers some insight into what we can expect for specs, though it seems primarily designed to remind prospective buyers how great the Model S is by comparison.
In the diagram, we see that the Model 3 has a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 5.6 seconds, which is more than double the Model S best time of 2.3 seconds (which is achieved with the P100D variant operating in Ludicrous Mode). That’s in keeping with Tesla’s announced specs of “under 6 seconds” for the base model, which was made public in April, 2016.
The rest of the info from the chart was previously known, including a “215+” mile range from a single charge, and delivery time extending out beyond the one year mark, as well as pay-per-use charging at Tesla’s high-speed Supercharger stations. The trunk space detail also shows the value gap between the two cars – the smaller Model 3 has less than half the interior storage volume across both its trunk and its ‘frunk’ (front trunk).
While a 5.6 second 0-60 time isn’t going to break any records, it does put the Model 3 in comfortable company with the Audi A3 and near the BMW 330i, and it’ll definitely feel like a fast car, especially for sedan owners coming to electric from the first time from fuel injection vehicles.
The entrepreneurial spirit has never been stronger, so it’s no surprise that co-working spaces are so hot right now.
The Yard, for example, has recently secured a $15 million credit line to expand its coworking offering to startups in New York City.
Founded by Morris Levy and Richard Beyda, The Yard wants to be the more ‘grown-up’ co-working space, with opaque walls instead of glass between offices and better sound-proofing so members can get down to work without distraction.
“People don’t want to look at the mess in the office next door or worry about others looking at their computer screen,” said CEO Morris Levy.
He told TechCrunch that The Yard focuses on smaller spaces, which fosters a more tight-knit community, while keeping the space fresh with art that’s swapped out monthly. Of course, going for the more mature companies means no foosball, ping-pong or beer on draught, but Levy wants to be hyper-focused on deliverables.
“We’re not the biggest, but we focus on making the experience special,” said Levy. “It’s like when you go to a restaurant with a single-page menu instead of a six-page menu. You know you can close your eyes and point to something and it’s going to be delicious.”
Metaphors aside, The Yard has taken a slower approach to growth than competitors like WeWork.
The company was founded in 2011, with $30 million in funding from the co-founders and two other silent partners, according to Levy. Since launch, The Yard has expanded to nine locations in New York and Philadelphia, with five currently under construction.
The Yard has around 2,500 members right now, and expects to hit 5,000 by the new year.
WeWork, meanwhile, boasts more than 100,000 members and nearly 50 locations after raising $3.69 billion in equity funding.
That said, Levy thinks the measured approach is a smart way to deliver quality service, and a credit line instead of equity funding allows he and his partners to continue growing The Yard without selling off chunks of the company.
The Yard, which is priced based on location and space, also puts focus on back-end technology — the company calls their platform The Back Yard. It allows companies to access the building 24/7, book conference rooms, communicate with other members in their building and other members at other locations, among other things.
Levy comes from a real estate background, but the CEO insists that The Yard is a services business, not a real estate play. When asked about the greatest challenge:
“Temperature,” he said. “One office might be hot and the other cold, and you want people to be comfortable. The other is printers. Printers are always tough.”
Reali wants to change how people buy and sell their homes and now it has $5 million more to work on it, thanks to a Series A led by Signia Venture Partners. The company also today announced that it is expanding beyond to the entire San Francisco Bay area, including the cities of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, and that its app is now available on Android, too.
The service aims to take the hassle out of real estate transactions for both buyers and sellers and also promises buyers a full refund of the standard buyer’s agent commission. Instead of this commission, Reali charges a flat fee of just under $5,000. The seller’s commission is also reduced to 4 percent. Given the markets Reali is active in, those percentages can add up quickly (though in some states, including Oregon, Kansas and Tennessee, these kind of rebates are actually illegal thanks to the tireless work of the local real estate lobbies).
It’s able to do this thanks to a focus on tech (like installing smart locks and Bluetooth beacons for self-guided visits in homes so that a potential buyer can tour it without an agent having to drive out to the house).
As Reali co-founder and CEO Amit Haller told me, the company plans to use the new funding to invest in its technology platform, enhance its operational footprint and expand its market reach.

“With our expansion to the entire San Francisco Bay Area, we want to demonstrate the excitement, adoption and trust that we’ve experienced on the Peninsula and strengthen our leadership position in this very competitive market,” Haller said. “Once we’ve accomplished that successfully here in the Bay Area, we plan to expand into other major California markets, as well as selected regions out of state.”
Haller doesn’t seem to be all that worried about competing services like Redfin. “Many of the other online brokerages haven’t changed the fundamentals of the business,” he said. “They are still heavily based on the use of traditional real estate agents, and most of their technology has to do with lead generation and discovery platforms. Unlike other online brokerages, Reali has invested in and created an end-to-end transaction and collaboration platform.”
He also argued that his company’s business model means it can provide better customer service and still give them all the advantages of working with licensed real estate brokers.
A new accelerator program being run by Canada’s Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) is hoping to find technologists in the quantum machine learning field who want to become founders and give them access to cutting-edge equipment to make their projects into companies. The program will be run out of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, and will include investment from venture funds Bloomberg Beta, Data Collective and Spectrum 28.
Operating over the last five years, CDL has been focused on helping researchers with deep expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to build applications and create companies around those technologies. With that track record, CDL is looking to replicate its success in other universities while also focusing on specific applications and technologies.
The first application of that idea will be the CDL’s Quantum Machine Learning initiative, which aims to develop and support the world’s largest batch of quantum machine learning startups — and along the way maybe convince them to settle in Canada.
Bloomberg Beta, Data Collective and Spectrum 28 will provide funding to founders and teams that participate. Those who graduate the program will receive $80,000 in tranched funding in exchange for 8 percent of equity, which will be divided between those investors.
For the next cohort to be accepted, the CDL is adding a twist: In addition to the usual nine-month objective-setting program, which breaks product and application development down into a series of four eight-week sprints, those who are accepted will have access to and be trained on D-Wave’s 2000Q quantum computer, a cutting-edge piece of quantum computing equipment.
Participants will also receive coaching from a wide range of mentors, including William Tunstall-Pedoe, Barney Pell, Geordie Rose, Sally Daub, Anthony Lacavera, Ted Livingston, James Cham, Matt Ocko, Lyon Wong and Steve Jurvetson, among others.
The CDL is looking to accept up to 40 individuals or teams to its next program, which will begin September in Toronto. In particular, the team is hoping to find applicants with graduate-level degrees in physics, math, statistics or electrical engineering who also have some experience in machine learning.
It’s currently accepting applications for the program through July 24, and is hoping to attract talent from around the world. In addition to the funding from investors, the CDL will offer relocation assistance to international applicants and also provide assistance in obtaining a visa to participate in the program.

Oculus has a new update out for its PC software that brings roomscale tracking with three sensors out of beta, making it an officially and fully supported way of tracking a VR user in 360 degrees. The app update also adds improvements to multi-sensor tracking, including two-sensor 360, though that mode is still classified as experimental.
The update also now warns users when they’ve plugged their Rift into the wrong GPU on their PC, and you can also be made aware when your antivirus system or windows settings have stopped an application from completing installation. The UI for onboarding new users also gets a new short video about safety while using Rift and Touch, and you can optionally toggle health and safety reminders that display every time you enter UI – presumably this is meant to stop people getting bumps and bruises resulting from forgetting the real world exists while immersed in the virtual world.
Three-sensor tracking now also fully supports sitting and standing modes, too, so you can get the full range of VR experiences at a level of quality that Oculus feels comfortable no longer calling “experimental.” I’ve spent a lot of time using a three-sensor setup and can confirm that it feels pretty polished at this point, so this makes a lot of sense.
Red Hat, which has made its name as the enterprise Linux company, has been making clear in recent years that it sees the cloud and containerization as a significant part of its future. Today, it announced its intent to acquire San Francisco startup Codenvy to continue building on that strategy and give developers access to a cloud-based integrated development environment.
The company did not reveal the purchase price.
Codenvy is the company built on top of the open source project, Eclipse Che, which fits with Red Hat’s overall strategy to build commercial tools on top of open source projects. It offers a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDEs) for individual developers, teams or enterprises. IDEs are essentially workspaces for coding, building and testing apps.
In a company blog post announcing the acquisition, Harry Mower, senior director of developer programs at Red Hat made clear his company sees Codenvy as much more than simply a cloud IDE. “At the heart of Codenvy’s technology is a workspace management system that allows developers to get up and running instantly without the need to set up a local development environment,” Mower wrote.
Integral to that vision are containers, the ability to launch applications as discrete pieces of code or containers instead of launching a single monolithic application. Developers are using tools like Docker and Kubernetes to build these containerized environments.
Codenvy CEO Tyler Jewell sees the acquisition as a way to extend his company’s vision by combining resources with a much larger organization and building a much broader container vision than his company could have done alone. “The rapid adoption of containers makes orchestration standards the industry’s next step. We held the view that Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift are leading the way in this space. So when Red Hat shared their container vision, our decision to join them became a “no-brainer,” Jewell wrote in a blog post.
Red Hat has actually been telegraphing that a move like this could be coming for some time. For starters, Red Hat, Codenvy and Microsoft joined forces last year to in Red Hat’s words, “provide a common way to integrate programming languages across code editors and IDEs.” Red Hat went on to join the Eclipse Che community last year and began contributing code. A few weeks ago, the company announced Openshift.io, a set of cloud-based developers tools based in part on — wait for it — Eclipse Che.
TechCrunch’s Frederic Lardinois described Openshift.io thusly: “What Red Hat has done here, though, is tie together a number of existing open source projects like fabric8, Jenkins, Eclipse Che and, of course, OpenShift into a free service that provides developers with a similar experience, but with a strong focus on container-based applications.”
Given these previous moves, the next logical step would seem to be acquiring the company built on top of Eclipse Che. When the deal closes, Codenvy’s employees will be joining the Openshift.io team.
Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology have released a full report on a new attack vector that affects Android up to version 7.1.2. The exploit, called Cloak & Dagger, uses Android’s design and screen behaviors against users, effectively hiding activity behind various app-generated interface elements that lets a hacker grab screen interactions and hide activity behind seemingly innocuous screens.
The team, Yanick Fratantonio, Chenxiong Qian, Simon Pak Ho Chung, and Wenke Lee, have created proof of concept users of the exploit including a bit of malware that draws an invisible grid over the Android screen that exactly mirrors – and can capture – the onscreen keyboard.
“The possible attacks include advanced clickjacking, unconstrained keystroke recording, stealthy phishing, the silent installation of a God-mode app (with all permissions enabled), and silent phone unlocking + arbitrary actions (while keeping the screen off),” wrote the researchers on a dedicated website. They discovered the exploit last August.
From the paper:

￼Cloak & Dagger is a new class of potential attacks affecting Android devices. These attacks allow a malicious app to completely control the UI feedback loop and take over the device — without giving the user a chance to notice the malicious activity. These attacks only require two permissions that, in case the app is installed from the Play Store, the user does not need to explicitly grant and for which she is not even notified. Our user study indicates that these attacks are practical. These attacks affect all recent versions of Android (including the latest version, Android 7.1.2), and they are yet to be fixed.


The exploit depends primarily on Android’s SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW (“draw on top”) and BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE (“a11y”) to draw interactive elements over real apps. For example, in the image above, the team drew a reasonable facsimile of the Facebook password field over the real password field for the app. The user then typed in their real password into the seemingly real password field. However, when the Facebook app is closed you can see the remaining password field hanging in space.
The easiest way to disable this exploit in Android 7.1.2 is to turn off the “draw on top” permission in Settings>Apps>”Gear symbol”>Special access>Draw over other apps.

Fratantonio’s advice? “The usual: don’t install random apps, check the permissions they have (but it’s tricky: these permissions are treated as ‘special’ and the user needs to navigate to special menus. We added the instructions to the website).”
“As of now, I think these attacks are as powerful as they can get,” he said. “The ball is in Google’s court now. That being said, it seems the new version of Android O might address some of these, we’ll start playing with it right away and see how it looks. We’ll keep the website updated.”

Google writes:
￼”We’ve been in close touch with the researchers and, as always, we appreciate their efforts to help keep our users safer.  We have updated Google Play Protect — our security services on all Android devices with Google Play — to detect and prevent the installation of these apps. Prior to this report, we had already built new security protections into Android O that will further strengthen our protection from these issues moving forward.”
In partnership with TechCrunch, PathFounders is the exclusive, invitation-only, event for startup Founders at The Europas Conference & Awards. With this, Founders get a special ‘founders and investors only’ half-day, on the day before The Europas (which they also join, for the whole thing), where they have dedicated sessions on building their company, fund-raising and also get to pitch their company in front of some of Europe’s key investors.
Here’s the agenda:
PATHFOUNDERS
• PITCHES: Founders, short pitches with slides
• How to build your brand – Harry Stebbings of 20 minute VC
• Growth-hacking workshop – by Growth Tribe
• How to PR your company right!, by Collette Ballou of Ballou PR
• Raising money from Angels, by serial angel investor Jeremy Yap
• VC investor panel
• Designing Your Culture Workshop
• PathFounders Fun Activities
As well as all that: it’s fun! The event networks people together in a convivial, unstuffy atmosphere.
The event is by invitation-only. You can apply in two ways. Either through literally pre-purchasing a ticket prior to selection or simply this form. (This ticket is for investors only).
Here’s a taster:

Because the conference and awards are supported by TechCrunch all PathFounders will get deep discounts to TechCrunch Disrupt in Berlin, later this year.
The numbers at the event are purposely limited to up to 100 people, combined investors and entrepreneurs.
Included on PathFounders, is a ticket to The Europas Conference & Awards itself. Instead of thousands and thousands of people, think of a great summer event with 1,000 of the most interesting and useful people in the industry, including key investors and leading entrepreneurs.
• No secret VIP rooms, which means you get to interact with the Speakers
• Key Founders and investors speaking; featured attendees invited to just network
• Expert speeches, discussions, and Q&A directly from the main stage
• Intimate “breakout” sessions with key players on vertical topics

This static test fire of one of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy booster may not actually be sending any rockets to space, but it does put off a lot of exhaust. The bulk of that is actually steam, as SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk pointed out on Twitter following the release of the test fire footage – and there will be three times as much of it when the Falcon Heavy actually launches, since it’ll use three of these boosters to propel its considerable bulk into orbit.
The side booster test actually happened last week in McGregor, Texas, where SpaceX has a testing and development facility. It’s a key step as SpaceX prepares to launch the Falcon Heavy for the first time late this year, with a tentative timeframe of summer provided the Cape Canaveral LC-40 launch site is fully repaired and operational in time.

— SpaceX (@SpaceX) May 25, 2017



Falcon Heavy will be able to carry up to 46,700 lbs of cargo to geostationary transfer orbit when it’s ready to roll, and up to 140,700 lbs to low-earth orbit, though its max capacity will require configuring the rocket in an expandable configuration that won’t allow for reuse. As with Falcon 9, SpaceX will aim to reuse Falcon Heavy first stage rockes where possible in order to minimize the cost of launches.
If all goes to plan, Falcon Heavy will have the highest cargo capacity of any operational rocket today, which will put SpaceX in a very good position when it comes to its Mars ambitions and to being able to offer something unique to prospective commercial customers.
Meta SaaS is a product that helps you cancel other products. Like Cardlife and Cleanshelf, Meta SaaS looks at all of your software-as-a-service subscriptions and tells you which ones you use and, more important, which ones you don’t.
Founded by Arlo Gilbert and Scott Hertel, the product raised $1.5 million in seed from Mark Cuban with participation from Barracuda Networks, Capital Factory, Deep Space Ventures and Brett Hurt of Bazaarvoice. Gilbert created the first VoIP platform for iOS, iCall, and Hertel worked in Dell’s e-commerce division.
They are supporting 10,000 employees at six customers – including RetailMeNot – and they are managing millions of SaaS apps.
“We are focused on the mid-market and larger companies, where the SaaS license management issue creates meaningful financial impact, to the tune of millions of dollars wasted per year. Most early stage competitors are focused on smaller customers,” said Hertel. “Many other competitors get their data through third parties such as Okta, which means they are limited to tracking logins and shackled to a single platform.”
Gilbert created the company after realizing that he had been paying way too much for SaaS.
“As I was closing down the office after the sale of iCall in 2012, I realized I had 40 licenses for Salesforce CRM but had never had more than 20 employees total,” he said.
The product manages “phantom IT” – namely the IT tools that someone bought and forgot about. While this one weird trick of selling and forgetting is great for SaaS providers it’s awful for businesses and Meta SaaS is one of the first providers to tackle the enterprise and large business space.
There’s been much talk of ICOs — initial coin offerings — amid the rising value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Now the industry is about to see its first ‘big name’ move into the space after Kik announced plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency via a token sale.
Messaging app Kik is particular popular among teens and young people in North America. Overall the eight-year-old company, which is based in Canada, claims 300 million registered users. Kik doesn’t break out how many of those are active any given month, but we do know that growth has slowed over the past year.
Kik isn’t just the most used service to venture into ICOs, it is also the highest financially backed company. It has raised over $120 million to date, and its most recent fundraising round in late 2015 valued its business at $1 billion.
Most of the interest around ICOs has centered around it being a process that allows companies to raise money independently of so-called professional investors — such as VC firms — since any individual holding the relevant cryptocurrency can invest. However, Kik is emphasizing that, beyond raising capital, it is turning to cryptocurrencies to develop its own ecosystem for digital goods and services.
“The broader motivation is that it is really hard for independent developers to compete with huge companies,” Kik CEO Ted Livingston told TechCrunch in an interview.
“On one side, you see digital services, on the other they are being owned and controlled by fewer companies because they are the only ones to monetize at scale using advertising. You try to sell things but you are trying to sell to consumers who think everything should be free.
“Even if a few companies can break through, the giants turn to copy and crush. We think this is leading to a future with less choice and freedom for consumers [and] for the first time ever we can present a potential solution to change all that.”
Taking on Facebook
Reading between the lines, it is clear that Livingston is referring to Facebook — the world’s largest social network that operates Messenger and WhatsApp, the two largest chat apps on the planet (based on userbase) which compete head on with Kik and others.
The reference to copying applies across the board, since Messenger and WhatsApp have adopted common industry features well after other chat apps, but it is particular true for Snapchat — which has had its feature set copied by Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to the point of absurdity.
Livingston and Kik’s audacious proposal is to free developers from needing to fit inside Facebook’s ecosystem — and its focus on advertising — by creating its own environment that is powered by a cryptocurrency.
Livingston illustrated his point with a personal anecdote about a developer he knows who, despite catering to 600,000 users with his app, is “completely broke.” That, he said, is because of the ‘culture of free’ which consumers have become accustomed to due to the advertising model that, he asserts, is perpetuated by Facebook.

Kik CEO Ted Livingston
Kinship
Kik’s proposed coin is called Kin — that is apparently short for ‘Kinship:’ or family/community — created on top of Ethereum an ERC20 token. Kik is in the early stages of drawing up a plan to launch it and integrate it into its app potentially as soon as early “the coming summer”. Kik didn’t say how much it aims to raise, but it plans to release 10 percent of the total coinage in the first sale.
Next year, Livingston revealed, Kin will open up to third party developers for use where he hopes it will find an audience willing for a different approach.
“Our ultimate vision is for Kik to be one of hundreds or thousands of digital services for Kin,” he explained. “What if we got all these developers to integrate Kin, then, as a consumer, I can earn and spend Kin inside all these places?”
It’s ambitious, but perhaps not entirely new. Kik introduced its own virtual currency — Kik Points — three years ago in its first effort to monetize its service. Livingston said that May 2014 launch and June 2016, Kik Points was used in three times more transactions than bitcoin itself — although that applies to the total number of transactions not volume processed, where bitcoin would be far ahead.
There’s a long way to go before this theory can be a working concept. Kik is still fleshing out its advisory team and, for now, the company declined to name partners it is working with.

A new kind of ecosystem
While most people are aware that a token sale (or ICO) is used to generate funds, but what is often less understood is that holders of the coins that are sold gain ownership of the means of production, or indeed the total output of the decentralized system. That is where Kik believes it can build an ecosystem that rewards developers financially without having to resort to advertising.
Livingston explained he envisages a daily pool of rewards for developers if Kin can become established. At a market cap of $500 million — meaning that the total number of Kin coins reaches a cumulative value of that figure — Livingston explained that somewhere in the region of $100,000 would be made available to developers working within the ecosystem on a daily basis.
“Developers would take a percentage of the daily reward in proportion to the number of transactions their service was responsible for,” the Kik CEO explained.
“This creates a reward engine, a beautiful network effect, where the bigger the daily reward, the more services come into the ecosystem, which drives up the daily reward and more digital services. Very quickly this could become a very powerful economic force to bring developers to,” Livingston added.
In its announcement, Kik highlighted potential monetization in sticker sales, hosted group chats, and bots. Telegram, another chat app, and Facebook both offer payment support for bots, and Livingston himself recently said that adding payment options can help bots reach their potential.
But, those cases aside, this is all very much theoretical at this point. Kik is making the first move after it released a whitepaper outlining the plans at kin.kik.com. It has also created the Kin Foundation, a non-profit organization that will be responsible for managing Kin and its ecosystem.
Finally, in a move that Livingston hopes will show this is not a gimmick, Kik said it will open source all of its client and server code to show its commitment to a decentralized system.
“I’ve been hoping for this for years now,” Livingston said. “We started thinking about it in 2011 — we can spark an entirely new ecosystem of digital services.”
“We believe cryptocurrency is the next important business model innovation in tech,” Fred Wilson, partner at Union Square Ventures and a member of the Kik board, added via a statement. “Kik will be the first mainstream application to integrate a cryptocurrency. This could be a watershed moment for the blockchain sector.”
At a time when even the most knowledgeable experts are divided on how ICOs and cryptocurrencies will develop, Kik is putting even more emphasis on the space. Time will tell how that turns out.

Rocket Lab has made history today, launching an orbital-class rocket to space from a private launch facility for the first time ever. The launch took place at 16:23 NZST (9:23 PM PT) on Thursday, using one of Rocket Lab’s Electron rockets which took off from Rocket Lab Complex 1 in New Zealand.
While the launch got the rocket up in the air and on its way, the rocket itself didn’t make it all the way to orbit – Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck explained in a press release that things mostly went smoothly to that point, including the first stage burn, as well as fairing separation and second stage rocket ignition. The rocket made it to space, but it didn’t make it all the way to orbit, which was the goal, given Rocket Lab’s plan is to be able to offer commercial orbital launches to customers using its rockets and its private launch pad.

The purpose of the launches was to test, however, so even though the rocket didn’t make it all the way to orbit, it’ll give the team at Rocket Lab opportunity to find out what went wrong and hopefully correct the error in coming flights, with two more set to take place during this year. Eventually, Rocket Lab hopes to launch over 50 times per year when it achieves full commercial operation.
This test launch was delayed for three consecutive days after a launch window opened on May 21 due to weather, but conditions proved favorable on the fourth day of a total 10-day window. On the next try, which will take place sometime later this year, Rocket Labs says it hopes to successfully reach orbit, and to also load the rocket down with its maximum possible payload weight for testing purposes.
College is supposed to be a life-defining experience–but that doesn’t mean students always graduate with all the skills they need to build their lives. Paragon One, an online career coaching service and mentor marketplace, wants to fill in the gaps. The startup announced that it has raised $1.9 million in seed funding from Y Combinator, Foundation Capital, Learn Capital, University Ventures, Li Yuan Ventures, Altair Ventures, Jimmy Lai, the CFO of online English school 51Talk, and former Tencent CTO Jeff Xiong.
Paragon One, which took part in Y Combinator’s last batch of startups, works with all college students, but one of its biggest markets is students from China studying in the U.S. The site differentiates from other career coaching services with a recommendation engine that pairs students with mentors based on their backgrounds and personalities . That tech is key to Paragon One’s ability to grow and its seed funding will be put toward product development to make the system more scalable so it can handle more students.
The company was founded in 2015 by CEO Matt Wilkerson and CTO Byron Hsu, who met 15 years ago while studying engineering at MIT. They came up with the idea for Paragon One when a mutual friend who owned a test prep school in Shanghai started referring students to them for career advice.
“They were clueless about basic resume writing, how to interview, and it was really obvious to us that colleges and universities were doing nothing for them,” says Wilkerson. “I remembered back to college, that even though we went to a great school, we knew that we were completely lost by the time we graduated.”
During job interviews after graduation, Wilkerson realized he had a hard time nailing down exactly why he wanted to become an engineer even though he had majored in it. He ended up going into finance after college instead, while Hsu became an entrepreneur. The two started a mentorship organization at MIT to help students like them not only hone in on the right career, but also become competitive job candidates.
Matchmaking students, coaches and companies
Many of Paragon One’s students want to work in fields like data analysis, data science, consulting, market research, and software engineering. A coaching plan is developed after they take a career assessment and Paragon One’s recommendation engine matches them with professionals on the site’s marketplace, which currently has about 160 mentors (Wilkerson says there are 300 more waiting to join).
“Instead of the student picking who they want to talk to, we do it for them, so it’s an automated counselor laid over this marketplace, instead of the typical mentor marketplace, where you don’t know who is better or who is not good,” says Wilkerson.
Paragon One’s technology pairs students and professionals based on information like alma maters, college majors, hobbies and interests, and personality traits. They share career advice, help their mentees figure out what courses to take, and prepare them for interviews. After coaching, students are matched with interview opportunities from companies.
Paragon One works with smaller companies that, unlike Google or Goldman Sachs, don’t have their own internship and campus outreach programs. Companies participate for free, while coaches and professionals on its marketplace are paid per session (they can also chose to donate their fee to a charity).
The company’s network of coaches and companies builds on the connections Hsu and Wilkerson made while mentoring.
“Yes, there are alumni networks, but there was nothing holding students accountable for learning basic life skills,” Wilkerson says. “Think about the money you spend—$100,000 to $200,000—on colleges. But colleges think the end result is getting a degree and the truth is that most parents and students are looking at success as what they do after college.”
Parents whose offspring sign up for Paragon One are willing to spend plenty on their kids’ education and have probably already used other college prep services like Princeton Review or Kaplan. Wilkerson says the company usually requires a three-month subscription that costs about $2,000 to $3,000.
“The average parent won’t say I paid all this money for college, now let me shell out more money. Their assumption is that this should be taken care of, but more are realizing that the ROI on college is not really there,” says Wilkerson.

A new wealth management startup called Prumentum Group is coming to market with a unique value proposition, looking to combine the technology chops of a roboadvisor with the human touch of a registered investment advisor. To do so, the company has built a tech platform, raised $25 million in funding, and acquired a minority stake in a financial advisory firm.
Over the last 18 months, the team behind Prumentum has been working on a dual-track strategy to provide a mix of technology and human advice that it hopes will be able to serve a larger portion of users than other financial advisory companies.
On the one hand, the company has been working on a tech platform called BrightPlan, which is set to compete with the likes of Wealthfront and Betterment in the robo-advisory game. That platform was built by a team comprised of former employees from Silicon Valley firms like Salesforce and Cisco.
Meanwhile, Prumentum acquired a minority stake in Plancorp, a registered investment advisory firm that already has $3.6 billion in assets under management. Serving high net worth individuals, families and institutions, Plancorp has decades of experience helping a diverse range of clients reach their financial goals.
According to Prumentum co-founder and CEO Marthin De Beer, the company has taken an initial 40 percent stake in Plancorp, with the option to purchase up to 100 percent of the company through an equity exchange later.
With both pieces in place, the company believes its tech platform will enable Plancorp to help many more wealth management clients than it previously would have been able to serve. At the same time, working with an established advisory firm will allow Brightplan to go beyond just rebalancing and optimizing investment accounts through technology and offer a deeper level of financial advice to its users.
“We’re taking the financial planning methodology Plancorp has been using for decades… now we can bring it to anyone regardless of their net worth,” De Beer told me by phone.
Prumentum was founded by De Beer, a former Cisco exec who had run the company’s video and collaboration business, along with serial entrepreneur Robert Wallace.
Together they self-funded the company before raising the cash it used to take their stake in Plancorp. But when it came time to raise its Series A, the company turned to family offices like The Cynosure Group and Fremont Group instead of raising from more traditional venture capital firms.
“We’ve been very fortunate in pulling together a unique set of investors that represent some of America’s most successful entrepreneurial families,” De Beer said.
He also noted that the investment horizon of family offices were more aligned with the type of business he was hoping to build, as opposed to VCs that would expect some sort of liquidity event in a decade or less.
While Prumentum is coming to market with a hybrid strategy, it’s not the only startup to determine that wealth management customers increasingly are looking for a mix of technology and human financial advice.
Earlier this year Betterment announced that it would begin making financial advisors available to its users as a complement to its robo-advisory service. Meanwhile SoFi, which got its start in lending, launched a wealth management service that combines low-fee individual and retirement accounts with personalized advice from non-commissioned, licensed financial advisors.
Complex indoor environments such as airports and shopping malls can be a nightmare to find your way around. And while Google is eyeing smartphones with 3D sensors as one potential fix for places GPS won’t accurately reach, another approach is to kit out an interior with lots of Bluetooth beacons — giving smartphone users located-locked pings to fix onto to know where they are.
The UK’s second busiest airport, Gatwick, has opted for the latter approach to power an indoor navigation system it’s launching as part of a wider, multi-year transformation program.
It’s now finished kitting out its two terminals with around 2,000 battery-powered beacons so that digital map users will get a more accurate blue dot as they wander around. The beacon system will also be used to power an augmented reality wayfinding tool (pictured above) — so that mobile users will be able to be guided to specific locations within the terminals via on-screen arrows. The beacon system is slated as supporting positioning with +/-3m accuracy.
Gatwick is planning to integrate indoor positioning into some of its apps, and says it’s in discussions with airlines to tap into it for their own apps and services — giving example of them being able to send push notifications to warn passengers if they’re running late, or even make a decision on whether or not to wait or offload luggage so an aircraft can take off on time.
Retailers and other third parties will also be able to use the system for proximity detection of potential shoppers and push marketing messages and offers — at least to those who have opted in to receive them.
Gatwick says it will not be collecting any personal data via the beacons but says “generic information on ‘people densities’ in different beacon zones” will be used to help improve airport operations — such as queue measurement, streamlining passenger flows and reducing congestion.
The airport has worked with UK startup Pointr on the system. As well as developing software and managing the system on an ongoing basis, Pointr is providing an SDK with support for 3D AR wayfinding to enable third parties to tap into the functionality.
Tanium hasn’t had the best year, but a new stock sale is telegraphing that while the company may be down, it’s far from out. This morning, the 10-year-old, Emeryville, Calif.-based company, whose technology enables organizations to continuously scan all endpoints in a network to detect vulnerabilities and unmanaged devices, is announcing it has raised $100 million led by the private equity firm TPG.
The deal assigns the company a post-money valuation of  $3.75 billion, meaning Tanium is essentially priced the same as when it last raised roughly $150 million from investors in 2015 at a post-money valuation of $3.65 billion.
Tanium’s CEO, Orion Hindawi, says the company has $300 million in cash and investor capital in the bank and that it didn’t need to raise money.
The company nevertheless “realized there was an opportunity to do a secondary [sale]” that could provide early employees and shareholders with some liquidity, while also getting heavy-hitting TPG involved in its future success, he says. “I want institutional investors on our cap table who can help [do an eventual public offering] right,” Hindawi explains.
Hindawi says that none of the outfit’s previous institutional investors — including its biggest outside shareholder, Andreessen Horowitz — are selling any of their shares and that the secondary sale instead involves “friends and family” shareholders.
He also claims that Tanium has already conducted secondary sales “multiple times” in the past to “lessen the pressure” on both employees as well as Tanium, which aims to go public on its own timeline.
Certainly, Tanium isn’t the first Silicon Valley outfit to allow early investors and employees to wring real money out of their paper holdings while making its way toward an initial public offering. Facebook, Twitter, Groupon, Pinterest, Zynga and Automattic are among many companies that have enabled employees and early investors to cash out of some of their privately held shares.
Companies typically negotiate secondaries from a position of strength, because their shares are desirable to outside investors. Indeed, Hindawi claims that Tanium’s revenue has been growing 100 percent year over year, and that it’s seeing 150 percent “net renewals. When [customers] pay us $1 one year, they pay us $1.50 the next, not because we charge more for the same thing, but because we keep adding value” by introducing new features on a monthly basis.
Still, with Tanium’s previous secondary sales conducted so quietly, it’s easy to wonder why the company is today choosing to broadcast its newest stock sale.
The answer seemingly traces in part to a string of high-profile departures at the company, some of them highlighted last month in a stinging article in Bloomberg that characterized Hindawi as egotistical, abusive to employees and a cheat who, according to Bloomberg’s sources, has “fired workers before they could cash in their stock options—a practice that had the effect of fortifying his control over the company.”
It wasn’t a good look for Hindawi, who quickly responded with an “open letter” in his own defense, and who today calls Bloomberg’s allegations “repulsive.”
Of accusations that he unfairly terminated employees, he says there is “no correlation between [employees’] vesting dates and when we separated,” and calls Bloomberg’s report “provably untrue.”
Specifically, he says, even before Bloomberg published its story, Tanium’s board “ran an investigation [with the help of a third party] because we take this stuff very seriously . . . They didn’t find a whiff [of malfeasance] but rather former employees who’d left because they weren’t a fit, because of an ethics issue, or for cause.”
Asked about nine senior executives who’ve left the company in the last nine months — including Tanium’s president, its former CMO and its former chief of operations and finance — Hindawi acknowledges that the culture can be hard-nosed, but dismisses the departures as growing pains.
“Tanium isn’t a cuddly environment. We’re not a cuddly product. We’re at war with a cyber environment that’s really unfriendly to our customers; they’re asking for a solution that protects them against that existential threat. I don’t apologize for bringing in the best people to do that.”
Hindawi somewhat famously started Tanium with his father, David Hindawi, who is the company’s executive chairman. The two had previously co-founded an earlier company, BigFix, which they sold to IBM in 2010.
Last month, shortly before Bloomberg published its story, Tanium — which now employs 550 people — hired Fazal Merchant from DreamWorks Animation to be its new operations and finance chief. Hindawi says an “incredible pipeline of people” continue to gravitate to the company.
“People assume there’s something behind” transition at the company, but “companies change as they experience hyper growth and their needs change,” says Hindawi. “It doesn’t mean that [employees who’ve left] aren’t great people. In many cases, I’ve [served as a reference for] them. But our goal isn’t to keep people; it’s to serve our customers. We owe it to the 550 families that depend on us to do a great job and build the best company we can.”
Institutional Venture Partners joined TPG in Tanium’s newest round of funding. IVP is among the company’s earlier backers, which, in addition to Andreessen Horowitz, also includes T. Rowe Price, Franklin Templeton Investments, Geodesic Capital and Citi Ventures. The company has now raised $407 million altogether.
In addition to Bloomberg’s story, Tanium was called out last month by The Wall Street Journal for not seeking the approval of one of its clients, El Camino Hospital in Santa Clara, Calif., whose internal network Tanium showed externally for several years to prospective new clients as a way of demonstrating the efficacy of its own software.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tanium publicly disputed the Journal’s characterization of how it presents information to clients during its sales pitches. It also acknowledge that it “should have done better, anonymizing that customer’s data.”

Fresh from announcing the Mi 6, its latest flagship smartphone, last month, Xiaomi gone and unveiled another new phone. The Mi Max 2, announced today at an event in Beijing, will be available in China from June 1 priced upwards from RMB 1699, that’s around $247.
Xiaomi claims it sold over three million of the original Mi Max, which is headlined by its big screen. The main selling point of the second version is a gigantic 5300mAh battery which the company claims will last for two days per charge. It claims that the device can charge to 68 percent in an hour and that its full capacity will give a user up to 18 hours of watching video, or 57 hours of call time.
The Mi Max 2 packs a unibody metal design and comes it at the same 6.44-inch size. It is available with 4GB RAM with the option of 64GB or 128GB storage — that larger capacity option costs slightly more at RMB 1999, or approximately $290. The device packs a 12MP rear camera, with a five megapixel front camera, stereo speakers and a fingerprint sensor on the reverse. Under the hood, the party is powered by an octacore 2.0 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset.

On the software side of things, the home-baked MI UI includes a one-handed mode — not unlike Apple’s reachability for larger iPhones — while a split screen version is planned soon to provide multi-tasking options.
There’s no word on an international launch date but, given the popularity of the original Mi Max, you can expect that there are plans to sell this new version outside of China soon.
The launch of the Mi Max comes right after Xiaomi unveiled its newest flagship, the Mi 6, last month. As we said at that launch, these are challenging times for the company — which investors valued at $45 billion as recently as 2014.
In 2016, rivals Huawei, Vivo and Oppo were among the challengers that rose up with competitively priced phones and strong offline distribution reach to knock Xiaomi off the number one perch for smartphone sales in China. Lei Jun has promised to bounce back and expand Xiaomi’s offline commerce efforts, while he intends to continue its ‘smart device’ ecosystem push to increase customer engagement and generate increased revenue. Indeed, the Xiaomi CEO recently likened his firm to U.S. retailer Costco rather than Apple, the latter being a common comparison made in previous years.
Note: The original version of this post misidentified the original Mi Max. It has since been corrected, apologies for any confusion.
Google’s AlphaGo AI has once again made the case that machines are now smarter than man — when it comes to games of strategy, at least.
AlphaGo made its name last year when it defeated high-profile Go player Lee Sedol 4-1, but now it has beaten the world’s best player of Go, the hugely complex ancient strategy game. Today, it won against Go world champion Ke Jie to clinch a second, decisive win of a three-part series that is taking place in China this week.
19-year-old Ke Jie narrowly lost the first time, but this time AlphaGo forced its Chinese opponent into conceding. That’s despite Ke Jie playing “perfectly” at the beginning of the tie, according to AlphaGo’s analysis.
“I’m putting my hand on my chest, because I thought I had a chance. I thought I was very close to winning the match in the middle of the game, but that might not have been what AlphaGo was thinking. I was very excited, I could feel my heart thumping!” he said in a post-tie press conference.
There’s still another game to be played, but, irrespective of that result, AlphaGo has defeated the man universally acknowledged to be the best player of man’s most complicated strategy game. That’s another milestone to chalk up — even though there’s been plenty of controversy because the live-stream can’t be viewed in China.


#AlphaGo wins game 2. What an amazing and complex game! Ke Jie pushed AlphaGo right to the limit.

AlphaGo was created by London-based DeepMind, which was acquired by Google for around $500 million in 2014. Beyond winning showcase matches with the world’s top Go players, DeepMind believes its technology has practical and everyday uses that can “solve intelligence and make the world a better place.”
Things haven’t gone to panned out that way just yet. Instead, DeepMind has been mired by controversy. A data-sharing partnership with the UK’s National Health Service, initially heralded as having the potential to optimize medical care to reduce the number of preventable deaths, ran into issues when it was recently judged to have no lawful basis.
Critics have seized on the data transfer of 1.6 million patients’ medical records to the Google-owned company as part of the project. The original arrangement remains under investigation by the UK’s data protection watchdog, the ICO.

SoftBank, known for investing in ridesharing apps that aren’t Uber, has added another startup to its list. This time it’s a $100 million bet on 99, the largest ridesharing company in Brazil.
99 says this is an extension of a round for upwards of $100 million that it raised in January from Didi Chuxing, China’s biggest ridesharing app (and itself a SoftBank investment), and Riverwood. Softbank’s investment doubles its total to more than $200 million and also brings 99 deeper into an informal international alliance of ridesharing apps backed by SoftBank. In addition to Didi Chuxing, these include all of Uber’s major regional rivals: Lyft, India’s Ola, and Southeast Asia’s Grab.
For both SoftBank and Didi Chuxing, investing in 99 is a major step in deepening their presence around the world. Their support of 99 also makes Uber’s Latin American growth plans more complicated and represents another way that SoftBank and Didi Chuxing has thrown a wrench in their rival’s international strategy (after struggling to compete, Uber sold its China business to Didi Chuxing last year). Brazil is the world’s fifth-largest country with more than 200 million people and an emerging economy that, despite its current political unrest, remains an attractive target for investors.
99’s total funding so far is $225 million. Its other investors include Monashees, Qualcomm Ventures, and Tiger Global.
Its new funding from SoftBank will be spent on expanding its peer-to-peer ridesharing service, called 99POP, to more countries in Latin America. The company was founded in 2012 and currently claims more than 200,000 drivers and 14 million registered users on its platform.
In a prepared statement, David Thévenon, managing director at SoftBank, said “We see strong growth and a great outlook for the mobility solutions sector in Latin America. The 99 team has made impressive progress in Brazil, now operating in more than 400 cities and bringing positive changes to millions of users.”

Acko is an under-the-radar startup that wants to disrupt India’s insurance industry through a digital-only model. This week it stuck its head above the parapet and announced that it has raised $30 million to get started on its bold plan.
Founded by Varun Dua, the man behind insurance comparison site Coverfox, Acko is designed as a wholly digital take on insurance in India. The company is an independent general insurance provider that is wholly digital. Beyond operating online and without the expense of a brick and mortar footprint, Acko is aiming to unbundle insurance in India to make it both more affordable and relevant to consumers.
“India is a fairly nascent insurance market [with the same] traditional carriers that we’ve seen for decades,” CEO Dua told TechCrunch in an interview. “Acko will be the first internet-only carrier.”
Taking insurance in India online
Inspired by models such as Lemonade and Oscar Health in the U.S. and Direct Line in the UK, Dua sees a huge opportunity to tap into digital to take a shot at the current market — which is estimated to be worth over $10 billion annually — and reach a new segment of consumers who have been left out to date.
“The system of distribution in India does not provide information on the user at all. There’s not enough data to underwrite accurately on a real-time basis,” Dua said. “Sales are mostly offline and flat pricing, usually [insurance firms] don’t know much about a customer before underwriting him.
The Acko CEO believes his firm can offer a 30-40 percent discount on incumbents by pricing its policies more accurately by gathering information and data online. That’s in addition to cost savings by operating without a physical presence.
“We will probably start off taking away existing [insurance rivals’] customers,” he added. “It’s a relatively easier market because people are moving online year on year. That gives us the early pickings, [but we] will probably be launching smaller and unique products that don’t exist today later.”
In particular, he foresees opportunity around segment-specific insurance policies that can be sold online. That could include, for example, pregnancy insurance, or policies for ride-sharing companies. Beyond selling on the Acko website, the plan is to link arms with partners who already have relationships with consumers — for example an e-commerce store selling baby items, or the ride-sharing firm itself.
In a recent report, EY forecast that India’s insurance market is “poised for a strong growth” despite concerns around reaching new customers:
Despite strong improvement in penetration and density in the last 10 years, India largely remains an under-penetrated market. The market today is primarily dependent on push, tax incentives and mandatory buying for sales. There is very little customer pull, which will come from growing financial awareness and increasing savings and disposable income.
That’s a major focus for Acko.
“We want to make insurance so straightforward that consumers don’t need to talk to multiple people to get advice or fill up forms. Consumers should be able to access low prices in one click based on their risk profile, and be confident that at a press of a button — their claim will get paid in the fastest possible time,” Dua added in a statement.
Big name backers and big plans
To get started, Acko has raised $30 million from a range of top names that include VC firms Accel, SAIF Partners and Catamaran Ventures. Its angel investors include Venk Krishnan and Subba Rao of NuVentures, Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, Hemendra Kothari of DSP Blackrock, founder and chairman of Hexaware Atul Nishar, and ex-investment baker and Arpwood Capital founder Rajeev Gupta.
Beyond that, Dua teased that there are undisclosed “global insurance groups” that own a stake of the business. Their names won’t be revealed for another month or so, but their presence has helped give the startup credibility in an industry that values corporate institutions.
Acko has received an R1 license and is currently awaiting its R2 license which has been applied for with India’s insurance authority. Dua anticipates that the final nod should come within three months, leaving the company ready to open its doors and launch products for consumers before the end of September this year.
The initial plan is to be active in three or four cities until Acko has shown that “the claims pieces is something we able to control and optimize,” according to Dua.
The team, which is currently around 20 people, is likely to grow to 45-50 by the year end, to help Dua hit his ambitious targets.
“We believe we should do close to $40 million in premiums over first year,” Dua said. “On a five-year perspective, we would love to reach anything from $500 million in premiums.”

After a long journey as a private company formed in the dot-com boom of 1999, Virginia-based Appian is finally braving the public markets.
Appian announced Wednesday they priced their IPO at $12 per share, raising $75 million for the company. This is in line with the previously proposed price range of $11 to $13.
Appian provides app development software for its business and government customers. “With our platform, organizations can rapidly and easily design, build and implement powerful, enterprise-grade custom applications through our intuitive, visual interface with little or no coding required,” the company explained in their S-1 filing. 
Appian acknowledges that its biggest competitors are Salesforce and ServiceNow. IBM and Oracle are also in related spaces.
The company’s revenue is growing. They brought in $132.9 million last year, compared to $111.2 million in 2015 and $89 million in 2014.
“Although we have experienced rapid revenue growth historically, we may not continue to grow as rapidly in the future and our revenue growth rates may decline,” Appian warned in the “risk factors” section of its IPO filing.
The company also incurred a loss of $12.5 million. Appian lost $7 million in 2015 and $17.1 million in 2014.
Founder and CEO Matt Calkins has a 54.7 percent stake. He founded the company at age 26.
Novak Biddle Venture Partners has the next largest stake, owning 21.5 percent prior to the offering. New Enterprise Associates (NEA) owns 11.7 percent.
Appian raised more than $47 million dating back to 2008, but just $10 million of this was for the company. NEA’s $37.5 million investment in 2014 was technically a secondary transaction, meaning that they bought the shares directly from employees.
The company reportedly was valued above $1 billion last year, colloquially known as a “unicorn.” The IPO values the company closer to $700 million.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays are managing the offering. The company is listing on the Nasdaq.
The IPO window is widely considered to be open, but the month of May has been pretty dead for tech. Snap opened up a wave of tech IPOs, which carried through March and April. Companies tend to watch the performance of other debuts before braving the public markets.
The venture capital model is built around “exits,” also known as acquisitions and IPOs. These are the deals that fund the whole ecosystem. But the availability of late-stage capital has also meant that companies have been opting to stay private longer, because they can.

Have you ever taken a class at SoulCycle? Or better yet, Flywheel?
Spinning has turned out to be a big business, and there’s one brand that’s been gaining traction in the at-home fitness space. Peloton’s $2,000 bikes have developed a cult following, mainly because of its live-streamed classes, which are offered as an added subscription and can be displayed on the bike screen.
The price of the machines may seem steep, but investors are betting that this is a billion-dollar company. Wellington Management, Fidelity Investments, Kleiner Perkins and True Ventures led a $325 million Series E financing round, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. Other investors include GGV Capital and Comcast NBCUniversal.
“We are changing the way people engage in fitness,” said Peloton founder and CEO John Foley, in a statement. “This financing will allow us to expand our product and content offerings, open new showrooms across the country, and continue to innovate the experience we offer our members at every touchpoint.”
Noted Kleiner Perkins investor Mary Meeker was also quoted in the release about why she’s investing in the company. “Peloton is supporting especially broad subscriber engagement and growth. We believe Peloton is the leader in a new business that has significant potential, physical interactive media.”
I’ve taken a couple of Peloton classes at their New York studio and liked them. The high-energy instructors and the detailed metrics on the Peloton bikes were enough motivation for a productive workout.

Not everyone lives by a great spinning studio, so I can see how the at-home classes can be appealing. Peloton may be suitable for people who have the money and the space for the equipment. Once the upfront cost for the bike is paid, the class subscription is just $39 per month.
Hans Tung, managing partner of GGV Capital, told TechCrunch that they invested because they were “blown away by its stickiness, user retention and amazing user feedback.” It’s “off the charts.”
But competition or a new fitness craze could be roadblocks for Peloton. Flywheel recently announced that it plans to introduce bikes for the home.
And the high price point for the Peloton bikes will probably have to come down eventually, or their growth could slow. They will likely release updated versions, but it’s possible that they could run into the GoPro problem, where people don’t bother to upgrade.
Perhaps this is why the company recently launched its commercial business, and is selling bikes to gyms for $3,000 a pop. They say that the higher price is because these machines are able to endure more usage, but they’ve probably also found that some fitness studios are willing to shell out cash for upgrades.
This is a different kind of fitness hardware investment for the tech community. Most of the other bets had been on “wearable tech,” such as Fitbit.
Peloton is headquartered in New York and previously raised at least $119 million in financing since it was founded in 2012.

Sony’s mammoth 13-inch Digital Paper tablet, essentially a huge Kindle you can write on, is still a pretty rare sight, but I’ve always had a soft spot for it. So I’m glad the company is doubling down on this unique device type and making some significant improvements with a new model.
The DPT-RP1 replaces the DPTS1 — catchy names, right? — and makes some changes that its users will certainly appreciate. The screen itself, built with E Ink’s Mobius display tech, has been upped from 1200×1600 to 1650×2200, which should make text considerably clearer (206 DPI — pretty good). The increased resolution doesn’t seem to have affected the battery life, though: like other e-paper displays, it’s super-long, at least a week or two.
The touchscreen layer has been improved, as well, and the texture of the surface; e-paper displays aren’t very responsive, so anything that can be done to improve that experience is welcome. This has presumably enabled the new note taking and annotation features the device has.
And, of course, the hardware itself has gotten a fresh coat of paint: it’s the same weight, but the design has been cleaned up and the bezels are slightly thinner.
New one on the left.
Gives it a nice minimal look, I think. You’ll just have to find another place to keep your stylus, though.
One thing that hasn’t changed is that these suckers are expensive. But at $700, the new Digital Paper tablet is still cheaper than its predecessor.
Convertible computers like the Surface series and upstart e-paper products like reMarkable are looking to eat Sony’s lunch, though. We’ll try to get our hands on one of these things and tell you whether you should have a couple around the office.
The problem with tiny robots, if there can really be said to be one, is that you can’t put enough stuff on them. Cameras and motors don’t shrink down very well, meaning if you want your robot to grab something, you’d better come up with a new way to see it and hold onto it. And that’s just what Finnish researchers have done with this bio-inspired, super-small gripper.
The researchers, from Tampere University of Technology, designed the gripper along the lines of the Venus flytrap, which waits patiently for something tasty to trigger its grip. In the flytrap, it’s little hairs that set things off, while in the gripper it’s light.
That’s because the whole thing is really just a strip of a special, light-sensitive liquid crystal elastomer. A strand of optical fiber pierces the center, and blue light is shone through it. When that light is reflected back by something nearby, it causes the strip to flex forward, gripping whatever that object is.
Its simplicity, low power requirements and flexibility make it ideal for micro-sized robots that need to grab small, fragile things, for instance crystals in an experiment or bundles of cells being cultured.
“We are currently investigating ways of making the elastomer even smarter,” said Arri Priimägi, who leads the research group. “The next thing we would like to teach our flytrap is color recognition.”
The team’s work appears in the latest issue of Nature Communications.

Bulletin, the startup that describes itself as “WeWork for retail space,” is announcing that it has raised $2.2 million in seed funding.
The idea is to give businesses — particularly online brands — access to brick-and-mortar retail space without the cost or commitment of a traditional lease. Those businesses can rent sections of a Bulletin store on a month-to-month basis. Within that space, they get to decide which products get sold, the pricing and how they’re displayed.
The startup currently operates two locations, one each in New York’s SoHo and Williamsburg neighborhoods. The Williamsburg location was initially focused on home products, but it now houses Bulletin Broads, which co-founder and CEO Alana Branston said is selling “30 of our favorite female-run brands making products for and about women” — things like feminist T-shirts and pins and books.
Broads is run according to the same Bulletin model, where the brands rent space on a monthly basis and can also hold their own events, but co-founder and COO Ali Kriegsman said it allowed the startup to experiment with more of a “trending” approach, where the product lineup reflects the latest shifts in news and politics.
She said the result has been the Bulletin’s most successful store yet — and 10 percent of sales will be donated to Planned Parenthood of New York City.
“We’re able to create stores with timely, reactive content because of our flexible sharing model,” Branston added.

The seed round comes from Flybridge, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Afore Capital, Tim Draper, Kevin Hale, Y Combinator (where Bulletin recently graduated as part of the winter class) and Liquid 2 Ventures. The money will fund Bulletin’s plans to open five new stores in the next nine months — three in New York, followed by two in Los Angeles.
Branston said Bulletin also plans to improve its technology, making it easier for brands to rent space and to track how their in-store sales are doing.

Looking further ahead, Branston said Bulletin represents a way for the retail industry to respond to the fact that “consumers have fundamentally changed the way that they’ve shopped.” In order to avoid predictions of a retail apocalypse, Branston said stores have to focus on experiences rather than products — it’s something she argued Apple is also doing by expanding the programming in Apple Stores.
In her view, that focus on experiences is “baked into” the Bulletin approach, which is all about an ever-changing, curated group of brands, and where those brands are throwing plenty of parties and other events.
“We want customers to look at us as the store where they go for experiences,” Branston said.

Mercedes-Benz announced the price of its new electric 2017 Smart Fortwo: $23,800 for the hard-top coupe and $28,000 for the cabrio with a sliding canvas roof. The new coupe’s price is $1,200 less than the outgoing model, but the cabrio’s price is exactly the same.
Besides the price, there are some practical improvements for the new Fortwo EV. There are a few more batteries on board — 96 lithium-ion cells versus the old 93 — though the battery capacity stays the same at 17.6 kWh. The on-board charger is more powerful, so the charging time drops in half, to three hours or less. The range gets a little bump from 68 miles to 70-80 miles, enough for daily urban commutes.
The 2017 Smart Fortwo EV will be available in the United States this summer, but these tiny two-seaters have had a tough time finding a niche in America, the land of SUVs and wide roads. Parent company Daimler decided to discontinue sales of gasoline-powered Smart cars in the States this year to focus on the EVs. It also decided to stop using Smart cars in its Car2Go point-to-point car-sharing service, with Mercedes-Benz cars replacing fleets in the U.S. beginning in 2017.
Smart doesn’t intend to compete with SUVs and pickup trucks, so who is the competition? The Tesla Model 3, the forthcoming small (but not micro) car, will have a 215-mile range for $35,000. The Chevy Bolt starts at $37,500 and has a range of more than 200 miles. The Volkswagen e-Golf gets 83 miles per charge, which is similar to the Fortwo’s range, but it starts at about $29,000 before tax incentives are applied. The new Hyundai Ioniq has more miles per charge, at 124, but its price starts at $29,500.
So for shorter-range emissions-free commuting and errand-running, the Smart Fortwo is an inexpensive option. But for carrying more than two people — or if you have a near-crippling case of range anxiety — you’ll need to pay more for one of the other EVs.

Twitter launched a version of its service on Apple TV and other media player platforms last fall in order to deliver its live video content to the big screen. Today, the company is updating its Apple TV app with a couple of new features, including support for Periscope’s Global Map and the ability to watch live 360 degree videos.
The company notes that, with this launch, Twitter is the first Apple TV app to support live 360 degree video.
To try out the new feature, Apple TV owners will use the Siri remote to move around the video to view its content from different angles, offering a more immersive look into the scene.
To date, Twitter’s TV applications – which are also now available on Fire TV, Xbox One and, most recently, Roku – have been designed to feature Twitter’s live video content, much of it coming from the company’s numerous content deals. For example, Twitter earlier this month announced a series of new live shows, including those from the WNBA, BuzzFeed, Viacom, Live Nation, and others. With the additions, Twitter met its goal of being able to offer users live video 24 hours a day.
However, live video content on Twitter doesn’t just come from Twitter’s premium partnerships – there’s also user-generated video to explore, streamed through its Periscope app or directly from users’ tweets. The company says that during the first quarter of 2017, there were 77 million hours of live user-generated video broadcast on Twitter.
To stream live in 360 degrees, Periscope users can take advantage of tools like Periscope Producer, which works with the Ricoh Theta S or the Orah 4i; or they can use attachable smartphone cameras like the Insta360 Nano for iOS devices, or the Insta360 Air.
Apple TV users can also now explore the added Periscope map to find other user-generated content from around the world, including both 360 degree live videos and otherwise.

These new features are rolling out now to Apple TV devices through the Twitter app update.
However, the updated Apple TV app isn’t the only upgrade arriving today. Some users are seeing a new option to connect their Twitter app with Apple TV via the app’s Settings. Enabling this allows you see your Twitter account on the Apple TV.

You can hear the champagne corks popping here in Seattle as Boeing is awarded the contract to make DARPA’s cool experimental spaceplane. The company was competing with Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems to design the craft.
The XS-1, as it’s called, would allow for relatively cheap and simple trips to space for launching and testing satellites and all that sort of thing. The goal is to get costs down to as little as $5 million per launch all told, and be able to fly at least 10 times a year.
It’s meant to be a fusion of all the high-tech stuff from NASA, the Air Force and private sector aerospace, like lightweight cryogenic propellant tanks and super-strong and durable composite wings that can handle re-entry temperatures. It should be able to go at speeds up to Mach 10, and deliver payloads weighing up to 3,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit.
As is the usual case for these multi-million-dollar super-high-tech programs, there’s a demonstration video that looks like it was put together by a middle-schooler in 2005:

“We’re very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight,” said DARPA program manager Jess Sponable in a news release.
This second phase of the design process goes through 2019, during which time the design will be finalized and the propulsion system (a modified Space Shuttle engine) tested thoroughly. After that, a dozen flight tests are scheduled for 2020. The final trial will be to fly 10 times over 10 days going at least Mach 5.
You can follow the project’s updates and view more details on the testing and capabilities over at DARPA’s website.
International tourism to the U.S. is down, according to Foursquare location data.
Using data from 13 million users (who have opted in to always-on location trails), Foursquare can examine who walks in and out of 93 million public places across the globe. According to the firm, the U.S. market share of international tourism started to drop in October 2016, falling by 6 percent year-over-year. It has steadily dropped since, sinking as low as -16 percent in March 2017.
From October 2016 (the start of the decline) to March 2017, average decrease in U.S. tourism market share was 11 percent YOY. Foursquare says there is no sign of imminent recovery.

These statistics represent ‘market share’ and not absolute figures. In other words, it examines the U.S. as a destination versus the rest of the world as a destination. It’s also worth noting that Foursquare was specifically looking at foot traffic associated with leisure travel and business travel, focusing more on stops made at venues (convention centers, restaurants, museums, stores, etc.) by folks who are visiting from abroad, instead of looking at hotel and airport data.
There are some obvious reasons for this and other not-so-obvious reasons.
To start, however, we can’t ignore the election of Donald Trump, which came with divisive rhetoric during the election and attempts to forge equally divisive policies after taking office. The travel ban, policies on ‘extreme vetting’ at airports, etc. have made the U.S. seem like a less welcoming place, and the effect it’s had on the tourism industry is evident.
Of course, there are other factors that may have contributed to the decline in tourism share, such as the growing strength of the dollar (making U.S. travel more expensive) or the weakening euro (making Europe more financially attractive as a destination).
Still, the U.S. is losing tourist activity to foreign destinations, and business travel in the U.S. is also suffering. Although Foursquare reports that business travel is up 3 percent in the U.S. YOY, that is below the trend line for other world destinations, which is closer to 10 percent growth.
Foursquare also found that residents of the Middle East and Central/South America are visiting the U.S. less frequently than those from Asia and Europe, which may have something to do with Trump’s travel ban, border wall, and other policy issues like electronics bans on flights.
The major takeaway:
While international travelers generally make up 10.7 percent of visits to Foursquare’s leisure categories, it estimates the decrease in tourism over the last six months could result in a 1-2 percent drop in YOY sales for U.S. retailers. And the hospitality industry is sure to feel that hit much harder.

Imzy, the kinder, gentler online community platform, will be shutting down on June 23rd.
Company co-founder Dan McComas made the announcement in a blog post today, stating his apologies and explaining to the community Imzy just couldn’t find its place in the market:
Some of you have been here since our launch into beta and some are brand new. We’ve loved getting to know all of you and seeing you build communities and make new friends. Unfortunately, we were not able to find our place in the market. We still feel that the internet deserves better and hope that we see more teams take on this challenge in the future.
McComas and his partner Jessica Moreno left their jobs at Reddit and headed to Salt Lake City, Utah in the summer of 2015 to launch their idea for a more inclusive social board.
Imzy opened the platform to the public last fall and has since grown to tens of thousands of users with more than 6,000 Imzy communities. It was using the same kinds of threaded comments as found on a site like Reddit, but started out with basic rules on how people should treat each other instead of the haphazard way Reddit allowed certain more unsavory trolls to run rampant on its site at the time.
But it turns out that wasn’t something a lot of people were into, and now Imzy has to close up shop on its idealistic experiment in being nice on the internet.
On the bright side, McComas said users’ data would be protected and gave them a link to where they could request their data. He also mentioned the /Imzy community board would be open to allow everyone to post. “This seems like a good place for us to gather, share memories, and say our goodbyes,” he said.
Imzy had raised a total of $11 million, $8 million of which came in the fall of 2016. According to a source, the co-founders only recently came to the decision to shut down and wanted to do so with plenty of cash still in the bank — so they may have something else in the works. We’ve reached out to ask and will let you know if and when we hear back about that.
This is shocking news to us here at TechCrunch as we just visited the Imzy team a few months ago as part of our foray into Utah’s startup scene. You can see that interview with Moreno below:
Tech companies, and increasingly even non-tech companies, are struggling with the fact that there are not enough trained data scientists to fill market demand. Every company has their own strategy for hiring and training, but Airbnb has taken things a step further — running its own university-style program, complete with a custom course-numbering system.
Data University is Airbnb’s attempt to make its entire workforce more data literate. Traditional online programs like Coursera and Udacity just weren’t getting the job done because they were not tailored to Airbnb’s internal data and tools. So the company decided to design a bunch of courses of its own around three levels of instruction for different employee needs.
100-level classes on data-informed decision making have been designed to be applicable to all teams, including human resources and business development.
Middle-tier classes on SQL and Superset have enabled some non-technical employees to take on roles as project managers, and more intensive courses on Python and machine learning have helped engineers brush up on necessary skills for projects.
Since launching the program in Q3 2016, Airbnb has seen the weekly active users of its internal data science tools rise from 30 to 45 percent. A total of 500 Airbnb employees have taken at least one class — and Airbnb has yet to expand the program to all 22 of its offices.
Interestingly, Airbnb says it tried four times to build and scale a data science education program. Jeff Feng, product manager on the analytics and experimentation team, told me in an interview that there were three best-practices that really enabled this iteration to work:

Designing an accessible curriculum for everyone
Working with leadership across the company to set data literacy expectations
Finding ways to measure success

Feng hopes that other companies will adopt similar practices when designing their own internal data science courses. The program seems to take a page from Google’s internal classes that helped it differentiate back in the day. Google’s version includes both technical and non-technical courses, ranging from data visualization to beekeeping.
Airbnb rolled out its intro data science classes first, making a statement that the program was about more than just engineers, though the more technically inclined will be getting additional higher-level classes moving forward.
Attention, startups. The day you’ve been waiting for has finally arrived!
We’re stoked to announce that registration is now open for startups looking to display in Startup Alley or Hardware Alley at Disrupt SF 2017. To kick off the festivities, we’re launching a special extra early-bird offer that you’ll definitely want to take advantage of.
For a limited time, we’re throwing in an extra Disrupt ticket to startups that purchase tickets in advance, meaning you’ll get three tickets for the price of two.
You can get your ticket package here for $1,995. That ticket package gets you one full day of exhibition in either Startup Alley or Hardware Alley, plus three full tickets to the Disrupt conference.
But why should you participate in the Alley, you ask? Simply put, the Alley is perhaps the best way to get your startup out there in front of the people who matter in the industry. Startups that displayed in the Alley at Disrupt NY 2016 raised more than $35 million in seed and Series A funding post-Disrupt, with $4 million of that raised in just the first three months, according to Crunchbase.
In addition to the possibility of raising some needed funding, Startup Alley companies have the opportunity to win the chance to participate in the illustrious Startup Battlefield competition.
On each day of Disrupt, attendees will vote for their favorite Startup Alley company. The startup that gets the most votes wins a wildcard entry into the Battlefield, where they’ll get the chance to pitch our panel of judges in the hopes of winning the coveted Disrupt Cup and the $50,000 grand prize.
Even if you don’t win the wildcard, you’ll still make some pretty solid connections that could help take your startup to the next level. And you and two of your colleagues will get full access to everything that makes Disrupt great on the days you’re not hard at work displaying in the Alley.
We’d call that a win-win.
Of course, you won’t get to do any of it unless you have a ticket. And, because you’re totally going to get a ticket anyway, you might as well take advantage of our extra early-bird offer of three for the price of two.
So be sure to get your tickets now. You can get them here.
Disrupt SF 2017 takes place September 18-20 at Pier 48 in San Francisco. We can’t wait to see you there.

Rackspace today announced that its board has appointed Joe Eazor as its new CEO, effective June 12. Eazor will replace Rackspace president Jeff Cotten, who stepped in as the company’s interim CEO after former CEO Taylor Rhodes left the company about three weeks ago.
At the time, Rhodes said he left Rackspace to become “the CEO of a smaller private company.” That company, we now know, was the Chicago-based property management firm SMS Assist.
In a moment of unusual frankness — especially in this kind of context — interim CEO Cotten, who became Rackspace’s president in January, acknowledged that he had hoped to become the full-time CEO himself. “I don’t mind telling you that when I was named interim CEO of Rackspace a few weeks ago, I was hoping that I would be able to shed the first word of that title and serve as the long-term chief executive at the company that I love,” he wrote. “But my attitude was that if our board of directors could find someone better — someone with more relevant experience; someone I could learn from and collaborate with, I would be all for it. And that’s exactly what the board has done.”
Eazor joins Rackspace after stints at EarthLink, where he worked on moving the company from its focus on dial-up internet many moons ago to a new focus on cloud networking. Before that, he was at EMC, HP and EDS. Among other things, he led EDS’s Asia Pacific business and offshoring operations.
“I’m excited by the huge market opportunity that Rackspace has, as companies move out of their corporate data centers and into multiple clouds,” said Eazor in today’s announcement. “Rackspace is uniquely well positioned to take advantage of this trend, as the only provider who can deliver expertise and exceptional customer service for all the leading public and private clouds, along with managed hosting. Thanks to the strategy Rackspace adopted a few years ago, it’s got the early lead in the managed cloud space. My goal here is to build on that foundation and make us the world’s preeminent IT-services company.”
If art is a window into the soul, what does art discover when it peers deep into the inner workings of a robot?
In this installment of Judah vs. the Machines, actor Judah Friedlander tests his art skills against a robot designed to make visually appealing art in different artistic styles.
Friedlander met with Alex Reben, a robotics designer in Berkeley, Calif., who built a robot that can take images and recreate them with unique flairs. The robotic creation, called SeuratBot in honor of the French post-Impressionist painter, may not be pouring its heart and soul into the artwork it creates, but its technical skills make it a formidable competitor for Judah — who is obviously very passionate about the finer things.
Before jumping into a competition of artistic prowess, Friedlander took a tour of Reben’s home, or, as he saw it, the “haunted robo-mansion.” The place is filled with a bunch of weird zany knife-wielding robots and all-around weird things that seem very on-brand for Berkeley.
The art challenge was a doozy. With a model sitting in front of them, Judah and SeuratBot were forced to quickly sketch a portrait of her. After Reben gave SeuratBot a photo to work with, he instructed it to create a portrait in the style of pointillism.
A bona fide art critic was brought in to judge the art and, staying true to style, he was more impressed by the emotion embodied in Judah’s work than the cold unfeeling photorealism of SeuratBot’s attempt. Though the robot may just be a glorified printer mixed with some fancy photo filters, aren’t we all just printers operating off pre-conceived notions birthed from stimuli we can’t control?
Check out the video above for some more insight on art, AI and why Isaac Asimov didn’t know what the hell he was talking about.

Using stickers to decorate your photos is a common feature found in social apps like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and others. But today, stickers have started showing up in a more surprising place: Amazon’s mobile app. Following a recent update, Amazon has added support for stickers within its iOS app’s camera feed – the feature that allows you to search for products on its site by viewing real-world objects through your phone’s camera.
This is an odd, but interesting move by the company, which has been upgrading its flagship mobile application to offer more than just traditional shopping in recent months.
For example, Amazon integrated its virtual assistant Alexa into its app this March, allowing consumers to play music while they shop, ask questions, check the news and weather, control their smart home, and more. It also launched “Outfit Compare” in its shopping app around the same time – ahead of the launch of its Echo Look smart device, whose own companion app offers the same “fashion advice” feature.
Stickers integration, however, makes less sense.
While meant as another means of encouraging product discovery, it’s not clear how Amazon intends this feature to be used.

Amazon, after all, is not a social app – it’s a retailer. And the camera feature it offers is meant to be an alternative way of kicking off a product search, not a tool to take personal photos to share with friends. Today, in addition to scanning a barcode or typing in a search term, Amazon’s app can also identify objects through the camera, then suggest related products, similar to Pinterest and Google’s visual search products.
To use Amazon’s new stickers, you’ll still launch the camera as usual by tapping the camera icon next to the search box on the Amazon app’s home screen.
You’ll then see a new “Amazon Stickers” button on the bottom left of the screen, next to the camera app’s other features like Package X-Ray (scanning an Amazon package’s barcode to see what’s inside), uploading a photo, or viewing your search history.

 

The stickers themselves are organized into various categories, like “Top Picks,” “Fun,” “Home,” “Pets,” “Women’s,” “Gadgets,” and more. There are also curated collections like “Gold,” “Legos,” “Wood,” “Workspace,” and others.
If these stickers or those categories look familiar, it’s because they’re being pulled from Amazon’s “Interesting Finds” online shop. Launched last year, “Interesting Finds” offers a curated product discovery experience on Amazon, similar to the shopping service from the startup Canopy. Advertised today via a homepage banner, “Interesting Finds” is sort of like Amazon’s Pinterest – it gives you a way to browse the site to find fun items you might like, follow collections, and save items to your favorites.
The stickers mirror the styles used by “Interesting Finds,” and link to the same recommended products.

With the camera feed live, you can browse through the categories and tap to add stickers to the scene in front of you. Because there’s no selfie camera support, you can’t really virtually try on clothing with the feature, but you could perhaps use stickers to see how a home décor product would look in your room.
But the style of the stickers themselves – with their cartoonish, white jagged edges – doesn’t make this AR-like functionality all that practical in terms of visualizing your potential redecorations. (At least, not compared with more serious attempts at AR for shopping like Wayfair’s “View in Room” feature, for example.)
In addition, you can tap on the “i” (information) button on the stickers themselves to be taken to the product detail page.
You can also add multiple stickers to a single photo, resize them, delete them, then save the resulting image to your Camera Roll or share to social networks.


As if there weren't enough stickers in all the places, now @Amazon's iOS app has'em too! And they're shoppable products!! /tip @Techmeme pic.twitter.com/S2w32kd2XW

Chris Messina first spotted the stickers in the app yesterday, following the iOS update. But it appears that the feature was being trialed earlier this month, according to tweets from what appears to be an Amazon test account.
Amazon has yet to respond to requests for comment about the launch.
Currently, we’re seeing Amazon Stickers on iOS only, not Android.
Robo-advisor Wealthfront originally came to market with a product to automate retirement savings, but over time has expanded to provide other financial tools. Today, the company is announcing a new product aimed at helping parents save for their children’s college education.
Wealthfront’s college savings tool is launching as part of Path, the company’s automated financial planning app launched earlier this year.
With Path, users are able to connect all of their bank, credit card, mortgage and other accounts and get a holistic view of their financial health. It was created to help users see where they’re money is going and find ways for them to save more toward retirement.
But, of course, Wealthfront recognizes that building a retirement nest egg is just one goal for its users. There are other major life events they have to prepare for, and college tuition is just one of them.
For users who have children — or want them — Path provides a way to easily set up and contribute to a cost-effective 529 investment account. Designed to provide tax advantages for college savings, 529 accounts provide tax-free withdrawals for tuition, books and other education-related expenses.
Path walks users through the process of setting up an account and projecting the future cost of college. Users can select schools they would like their progeny to attend, and the app provides an estimated breakdown of costs however many years in advance. It also calculates expected financial aid, based on a user’s income and finances. Once all that’s calculated, Path gets users to set up an automated savings plan to reach their goals.
While other robo-advisors are trying to provide a more high-touch experience by bringing on personal financial advisors, Wealthfront is doubling down on its plans to use software to automate its users finances. With retirement and college savings as part of its suite of products, we will likely see other tools and use cases arise from Wealthfront and its Path app.
You’re vulnerable to bias and polarization if you only get your news from one source. So instead of highlighting a single news outlet when you click through to a Trending topic, Facebook will now show a carousel of the other most popular articles written about the subject by different publishers.
Meanwhile, Facebook is giving more exposure to Trending Topics on mobile. Rather than only show Trending topics in the drop-down when you go to search for something on Facebook’s mobile app, the company will test showing a box with the top three current Trending topics inside the News Feed. This way people will more likely discover Trending content on mobile when previously it was buried in an unintuitive spot.

Facebook tells TechCrunch that the Trending sources carousel isn’t personalized to purposefully show you publishers you don’t follow or that might have a contrasting view point to what you typically click and share. But by swiping through to different news sources that you don’t follow, the company says it could show you different view points on the same topic.
Of course that could backfire by showing you more biased sources than you’d normally read. Not every fact needs an “alternative” take. That can lead to misguided hot takes and senseless contrarianism. Facebook will have to keep an algorithmic eye on what publishers it shows in these carousels.
Since Trump was elected, Facebook has been criticized for widening the political divide in America. Instead of more generalist media, the News Feed allows people to create their own newspaper from the sources they prefer. But if someone is lured into following biased or sensational sources, and surrounds themselves with friends who do the same along the same political pole, they can have misinformed views reinforced.
Facebook tests a way to follow topics rather than specific publishers
Mark Zuckerberg likes to cite a study by Facebook from 2015 that showed 23 percent of users’ friends are of the opposite political affiliation, while almost 29 percent of stories in the News Feed display views that disagree with a user’s ideology. But having 70%+ of your feed stoking your existing beliefs can still be problematic. In Zuckerberg’s humanitarian manifesto, he wrote that one solution was “to show a range of perspectives, let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right.”
Facebook recently tried another approach to deflating these filter bubbles by letting people follow a topic and then see posts from a variety of publishers about it instead of just following individual publishers. Today’s update furthers that effort. Even if Facebook doesn’t truly believe filter bubbles are a massive problem, it needs the News Feed to be perceived as a positive fountainhead of information to stay at the center of people’s web browsing habits.
Serena Williams (yes, THAT Serena Williams) has joined the board of consumer survey startup SurveyMonkey, along with Intuit CEO Brad Smith.
This is the tennis superstar’s first venture into Silicon Valley and, according to a SurveyMonkey spokesperson, came about at the suggestion of fellow board member and Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.
Sandberg joined the board last summer after suffering the loss of her husband Dave Goldberg, who had been the company’s CEO before he unexpectedly passed away.
It’s easy to make the connection to the Valley through William’s fiancé and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. However, Sandberg and her husband had been longtime friends of Williams and SurveyMonkey was looking to change things up on the board.
Williams’ “voice on the board sends a strong message to our company, investors, and the industry,” said SurveyMonkey’s current CEO Zander Lurie. “We want change agents at our table.”
According to Fortune, Lurie and Williams started talking about the possibility of working together after meeting up at a dinner party at Sandberg’s house last fall. “Everything just came together easily,” Williams told the magazine.
Aside from being one of the top tennis players in the world and the highest paid female athlete, banking $77.6 million in her career from prize money so far, Williams has also launched several businesses around her extraordinary tennis achievements. She once had a special line with Puma and inked endorsement deals with Nike and J.P. Morgan Chase. She also has her own apparel line called Aneres (her name spelled backwards) and launched her own collection of handbags and jewelry on the Home Shopping Network (HSN).
Williams sees an opportunity to put those achievements to good use in the tech world, as well. “As a business professional, I’m constantly asking questions. I want to hear the positive and the negative to figure out where I can improve,” she told TechCrunch in a statement. “Like SurveyMonkey, I’m driven to ask what’s happening, and why. We also share a fierce commitment to letting all voices be heard.”
SurveyMonkey, which competes with online survey startup Qualtrics, gathers customer feedback from online surveys and, according to Fortune, the majority of Fortune 500 companies use the service to gain insights. But survey data depends on the types of questions asked and knowing what to ask. That unique insight can be hard to get in a room full of the same types of people.
Note also, Silicon Valley doesn’t have a great track record with women or diversity so far. Williams is a great get for the company’s board as she is able to add that fresh (and needed) voice, along with her outstanding career track record to help shape SurveyMonkey’s future.

Microservices, that is, breaking larger applications into small parts that communicate over APIs, is increasingly becoming the architectural style of choice for many developers (especially when coupled with containers). Managing this fleet of services introduces its own set of challenges, though. To help developers and DevOps professionals manage and secure their microservice-based applications, Google, IBM and Lyft today announced Istio, a new open platform that allows you to create a network of deployed services, and which includes tools for load balancing, service-to-service authentication and monitoring, among others.
It can do all of this without requiring any changes to the actual applications. That’s because Istio sits at the network level and uses a proxy to intercept all network communication between your microservices. At its core, Istio uses the Envoy proxy (which was developed by Lyft) and its built-in service discovery and load balancing tools, among other things.
“As monolithic applications are decomposed into microservices, software teams have to worry about the challenges inherent in integrating services in distributed systems: they must account for service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing for feature experimentation, and perhaps most important of all, compliance and security,” the Istio team explains. “Inconsistent attempts at solving these challenges, cobbled together from libraries, scripts and Stack Overflow snippets leads to solutions that vary wildly across languages and runtimes, have poor observability characteristics and can often end up compromising security.”
A company could standardize on a single library for managing the communication between services, but the team argues that that’s unlikely to happen, would leave out existing services and reduce flexibility.

Istio essentially provides developers with a single service mesh that provides the monitoring services to then implement the necessary load balancing, flow-control and security policies they need to keep their applications running even if the network isn’t reliable. Istio also allows developers to authenticate and secure the communications between different applications using a TLS connection (which means the developer doesn’t have to manage certificates, for example).
Given the fact that Google is involved, it probably doesn’t come as a surprise that Istio currently only supports the Kubernetes container orchestration service, though the plan is to support other environments in the future. The overall idea is to allow Istio to span various environments, no matter whether that’s a public cloud Kubernetes or Mesos, for example. Google also plans to bring Istio support to Cloud Endpoints and its Apigee API management platform (which it acquired for $625 million last year).
It’s worth noting that this isn’t all that different from linkerd, a similar project that is now part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the home of the Kubernetes project. Linkerd already offers support for Docker and Mesosphere’s DC/OS, among others, though.

At today’s media event in NYC, DJI announced its new Spark drone, destined for the entry-level market as an everyday portable solution for capturing aerial footage. To go with your shiny new Spark, DJI is releasing a new iOS control app, dubbed GO 4.
The new app features a new set of four automated flight modes, which allow you or I to pull off advanced flight maneuvers that would otherwise wreck a $499 toy. The GO4 app starts you off with ActiveTrack, allowing the Spark to focus on any moving subject within the frame; Pano, an automated stitching software tool that allows you to capture panoramas; ShallowFocus, an exaggerated depth of field shot; TapFly which hovers and tracks a target and finally, the Gesture mode which allows you to use simply hand gestures to take selfie shots or videos.

DJI is obviously including photo/video filters within GO 4, automated editing and exporting/uploading to YouTube, Instagram, Twitter or Facebook and other social networks.
All of Spark’s flight modes include full flight autonomy, thanks to a sensor cocktail of GPS/GLONASS, a 3D sensing system and what DJI is marketing as a vision positioning system for in-flight stability.
An SDK is also available for the Spark platform, which includes a partnership with Epson, including coding while using drones, or for use with the first-person view goggles, allowing developers to get a bit more creative with flight modes or capture features.
The DJI Spark drone is available for pre-order now starting at $499, with an expected shipping date on June 15th.
An impressive new exploit gives hackers the ability to control your desktop through malware spread by fake movie subtitles. The exploit, which essentially dumps the malware onto your desktop and then notifies the attacker, affects users of video players like Popcorn Time and VLC.
Checkpoint found that malformed subtitle files can give hackers the ability to embed code into subtitle files popular with pirated movies and TV. Because these subtitles are usually trusted by video players and users alike they were an oft-overlooked vector for hack attacks.

￼Our research reveals a new possible attack vector, using a completely overlooked technique in which the cyberattack is delivered when movie subtitles are loaded by the user’s media player. These subtitles repositories are, in practice, treated as a trusted source by the user or media player; our research also reveals that those repositories can be manipulated and be made to award the attacker’s malicious subtitles a high score, which results in those specific subtitles being served to the user. This method requires little or no deliberate action on the part of the user, making it all the more dangerous.
Unlike traditional attack vectors, which security firms and users are widely aware of, movie subtitles are perceived as nothing more than benign text files.

If you’re using Popcorn Time – and you know you shouldn’t be – you can download a fix here. Otherwise VLC, Kodi, and Stremio should be patched automatically. In the demo below we see the subtitles essentially activating a TinyVNC connection with the attacker’s machine, allowing full access for the desktop. It’s a pretty steep price to pay just to watch Logan Noir.

In the age of social media, you’re only as good as your last like, and today a startup has raised a sizeable round of funding banking that the same maxim applies to software. G2 Crowd — a Chicago-based company that has built a platform for crowdsourcing enterprise software reviews to help others make decisions on what to use and buy — is today announcing that it has raised $30 million in funding at an undisclosed valuation, bringing the total raised to over $45 million.
The Series B round was led by Accel, with participation from Pritzker Group Venture Capital and G2 Crowd’s founders Tim Handorf, Mark Myers, Matt Gorniak, Mike Wheeler and Godard Abel (who founded BigMachines previously and sold it to Oracle for $400 million). And, perhaps most uniquely, the investor group includes LinkedIn, the social network for professionals acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 billion last year.
LinkedIn typically doesn’t invest in other companies — this actually appears to only be the third time it’s ever done so — and in this case Handorf, who is the CEO, tells me it’s because the two work closely together and may well do more in the future.
One of the most obvious places where it’s partnering now is in logins: G2 Crowd requires users to register themselves via their LinkedIn profiles in order to authenticate themselves and to help control against nefarious reviews of software from competitors and trolls. LinkedIn doesn’t allow cross posting to users’ profiles, but allows authenticated users to share G2 reviews onto LinkedIn and have it show up in their feed.
“G2 Crowd is a highly respected company with great insights into the B2B environment,” a spokesperson said. “We occasionally invest in companies that can inform our long-term business strategy, and in this case, we believe G2 Crowd can help us better understand and address the needs of our customers.” Handorf declined to comment on whether the investment was part of an attempted acquisition but noted that the company has been approached by others in recent times.
G2 Crowd is part of a large group of entities that have sprung up online that provide reviews and competitive analysis about various software products. However, most of these, Handorf points out, are based around affiliate revenue models, where the sites make money whenever users click on the links of the companies listed in their competitive lists.
Instead, he likens G2’s business model more to that of Glassdoor’s, the company review platform: “We don’t have advertising or give preference to companies who pay us,” he noted, “and we don’t do lead generation.” 
Companies, as on Glassdoor, get free profiles and they can claim them to add in more information about what they do, downloads and so on. The other area where G2 Crowd is hoping to build out its business is in areas of analytics and research — competing against the likes of Forrester, Gartner and IDC for profiles and sector analysis — and also into other adjacent areas of products that businesses might need to buy, be it consulting or integration services, or perhaps even who the best company is to cater an event. 
So far the formula has been working. Last year, there were 75,000 reviews posted on the site — triple the number from the year before, and this year G2 Crowd projects 225,000 reviews posted on the site. 
Another area where G2 is quite compatible with LinkedIn is that both companies tend to have very strong SEO, meaning its results score highly on Google when you are looking things up (in the case of LinkedIn, people like “Ingrid Lunden”; and in the case of G2, things like “LinkedIn competitors.”)
This is a blessing and a curse: a blessing in that it brings a lot of visibility and traffic to the company’s services and potentially that will help feed in more reviews and drive more companies to claim and pay for their profiles. A curse because that leaves G2 Crowd somewhat at the mercy of Google, its algorithms and its longer-term ambitions of what it might want to do in various specific areas of vertical search. (Offering comparative software reviews and listings seems like a very obvious area for Google to tap at some point.)
For now, G2 Crowd continues to grow and meet the demands of a new landscape in the business world, where we collaborate and communicate as a matter of course.
“There is a paradigm shift occurring as B2B buyers increasingly behave like consumers, relying on authentic online reviews and social media to make purchase decisions and no other company is better suited to catalyze this market opportunity than G2 Crowd,” said Accel Partner, Arun Mathew, in a statement.  “Accel has a long history of investing in market leading companies like Facebook, Dropbox, Slack, and Atlassian, and G2 Crowd is no exception. The company’s rapid growth and customer buy-in from leading tech innovators lends an extremely influential voice to the industry.”
Microsoft today announced that virtually all of its engineers now use the Git version control system to develop its Windows operating system. The Windows Git repository includes about 3.5 million files that weigh in at about 300GB when you check them into Git. Git, however, wasn’t built for a project of this size, so Microsoft developed the Git Virtual File System to be able to get the benefits of using Git without having to wait hours for even the simplest of Git commands to run.
The code for the Git Virtual File system is now available under the MIT license on GitHub and open for community contributions.
The move to Git took about three months. Before this, Microsoft used Source Depot to manage the Windows code, though other groups with smaller code bases also still use Team Foundation Server. My understanding is that Source Depot is Microsoft’s fork of the Perforce platform and the company today notes that the Windows code was originally spread across more than 40 of these depots.
Over the course of the last three months, Microsoft moved some Windows developers over to the new Git repository to test the system. Then, in March, it rolled out Git for all 2,000 engineers that work on the Windows OneCore team. Today, about 3,500 of the roughly 4,000 engineers on the Windows team are on Git.
Microsoft also notes that it built a Git proxy solution for the Git Virtual File System (GVFS) to help manage the bandwidth issues that would inevitably arise given the distributed nature of the team.
As Microsoft also announced today, a number of Git vendors already support it (Atlassian) or are working on bringing support for it to their tools (Tower and GitKracken). To test GVFS, you can also create a repo on Microsoft’s Visual Studio Team Services (and you need a VSTS account to do this).

It’s been a little over a year since Fred Wilson and Tim Armstrong appeared onstage at Disrupt in New York to launch Tech:NYC.
The two titans of New York City’s tech scene were angling to create a new organization that would speak out for the interests of the tech industry in both city and state government while planting a flag for New York’s place at the forefront of innovation around the country.
With Julie Samuels at the helm as executive director, the organization has done more in that year than I think either Armstrong (my boss at… um…. Yahool, AOoo, Oauth, Oath) or Wilson could have imagined.

From battling back bills that would have hamstrung online marketplaces like hometown heroes Etsy, or marshaling the community to speak out against national policies that effect the technology industry, Tech:NYC has taken a leading role in policy discussions in city hall, the Albany statehouse, and as a beacon nationally.
“The biggest achievement is that we’ve been able to create a community,” says Wilson.
Indeed they have. Over the year, Tech:NYC hasn’t gone from just zero to one (thanks Peter) it’s gone from zero to over 400 members (technically it started with five founding members — the pre-Yahoo AOL, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, and venture firm Union Square Ventures).
But the organization’s reach extends beyond its sheer numbers.
For Wilson and the executive director Samuels, nothing exemplifies the kind of work that Tech:NYC can and should do more than its response to the Executive Order signed earlier this year that denied entry to immigrants, refugees (and even US citizens) from several countries from entering the United States without extreme vetting.
“Just getting the local community to stand up against what’s happening down in Washington was an achievement,” Wilson says. “We need to do it.”
For Samuels, the response to the executive order crystallized everything that the new technology organization can do, both locally and more broadly.
“It was an expression of New York values,” says Samuels, and something that the organization will continue to advocate. The coalition of signatories (and indeed the technology community in New York broadly) reflects the diversity of experience and background that Samuels believes will make New York one of the great technology centers in the world.
Part of that effort is also dependent on policy… another area where the Tech:NYC coalition came together to battle for its interests against what it viewed as bad laws coming from Albany.
Earlier this year, the state government floated a proposal for a marketplace tax that would, in essence, place unfair burdens on companies like Amazon, Etsy, and any other ecommerce company looking to do business in New York, according to the Tech:NYC arguments.
With a coordinated effort including education, and a well-placed op-ed in the New York Post, Tech:NYC was able to kill the proposal.
Finally, the organization is pushing an agenda that emphasizes gender and racial diversity in the New York technology industry and looking to encourage that through job training and primary education efforts.

Wilson has been instrumental in encouraging New York City to develop its Computer Science For All program, first instituted by current Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Tech:NYC is picking up the banner and encouraging the governor to expand the program statewide.
Given the current political climate, Wilson said, it’s important for the technology industry to stand up for its interests and, more importantly, its beliefs. Organizations like Tech:NYC enable companies to use their collective power to influence policy and have a voice in what their communities and cities look like.
Given its successes, it looks like the organization is well on its way to ensuring that the technology industry is well-represented in the discussions of what a future New York state looks like. And since New York is one of the wealthiest and most populous states in the country — its policy decisions can shape the national discussion.

Circle Media, the company behind Circle with Disney – a device that helps parents enforce their home’s internet rules and restrictions – has raised $10 million in Series A funding, the company announced this morning. The round was led by early stage venture fund Relay Ventures. There was another private equity investment in the round, but the parties didn’t want to be named.
The Portland-based startup had previously raised $800,000 in startup capital and $3 million in convertible notes. We had reported $1.5 million raised in November 2015, while fundraising was ongoing.
The A round included $7 million in new money from Relay and others, as well as the $3 million in convertible notes that changed from loan to stock. Counting this as additional new money, Circle has raised $10 million to date.
The idea behind Circle with Disney is to offer parents a simpler way of managing the devices on their home network, including when family members are allowed to be online, and what content they’re able to access. This is not a novel concept, to be fair – numerous companies have offered internet control software in the past, and several makers of network-attached hardware exist today that can do much of what Circle with Disney can, too.

For example, Circle’s device competes with newer kid-safe routers like Torch, as well as modern routers that include parental control features, like Orbi, Eero, Luma, and others. It also takes on services like OpenDNS’s family shield or even the newer parental control applications rolling out from larger companies, like Comcast’s new Xfinity xFi app, Amazon’s FreeTime, or Google’s Family Link.
Like many of these devices and services, Circle with Disney allows parents to set device time limits, device “bedtimes,” configure internet and app filters, track web usage, and pause the home’s internet.
In fact, Apple’s failure to address some of these parental concerns – like being able to disable internet access, or setting screen time limits – within its iOS software has left a hole in the market, allowing companies like this to emerge.

In addition to the basics, Circle with Disney offers ways to reward kids with screen time for doing chores, turn off distracting apps while teens are driving, and more through a “Connections” platform that works with third-party apps and services.
Circle with Disney’s other advantage – as you can guess by its name – is its partnership with Disney for use of its brand name and select assets. The device includes access to short-form Disney content, like trailers, video clips, games, social media postings, GIFs, emojis, promos and more. Dozens of pieces of content are added daily, so there’s always something new to see.
The $99 device is sold through Amazon, Best Buy, Target, DisneyStore.com, and Circle’s website, and it recently hit 3,700 Walmart stores in the U.S.
Circle founder Jelani Memory, a former creative consultant, photographer, and videographer, declined to say how many Circle devices have been sold to date, but noted that the expansion in Walmart doubled its retail presence.
Beyond the upfront purchase price, Circle Media also makes money by upgrading customers to its Circle Go subscription. This extends Circle’s feature set outside the home, including to mobile devices on cellular networks, for $9.95 per month.

However, for this to work on iOS, it requires the installation of a profile on the iPhone. This can be a little tricky to set up. And, because it connects the device to a VPN in order to work, some services may be unavailable or partially disrupted when it’s installed, including Netflix, Hulu, Pokémon Go, and Ticketmaster, the company says. Others may also perform inconsistently, like iMessage, Snapchat and Instagram.
This can make for a difficult upsell, obviously, and speaks to the broader issues with not having better iOS parental controls available from Apple directly. (Memory also declined to share details about conversions from device owners to subscribers.)
The company says it plans to use the new funding to continue to develop the product, expand to new markets, and pursue growth.
“With our current headcount at about 30 people, we have plans to double that in the next 12 months across all departments, specifically in our development teams,” notes Memory. “We’ll also be continuing to work on new product offerings that will be debuted later this year, as well as scaling into additional regions across the globe. We have currently availability in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden and seek to expand that. We’ll also seek to deepen our marketing spend,” he adds.
“We live in an era where parents need solutions to help manage their family’s persistent access to the internet,” said Kevin Talbot, managing partner, Relay Ventures, in a statement about the firm’s investment. “As a happy Circle customer I proactively tracked them down and decided to invest because their product simply works exactly as advertised.”
Over the last month, it’s been hard to miss talk in the media and on social channels about initial coin offerings, or ICOs. What are they? Where did they suddenly come from? Who’s investing in them?
When the popular investing platform AngelList announced on Monday that it’s jumping into the business of making ICOs easier to coordinate, attention reached a fever pitch, prompting my colleague Alex Wilhelm to yesterday tackle the question, “WTF is an ICO?”
Because this editor was still confused (I’m not proud), I talked yesterday with Stan Miroshnik, a UC Berkeley grad with an MBA from MIT who today runs L.A.-based Argon Group, one of the first digital finance-focused investment banks. Miroshnik nicely answered an array of questions about ICOs, including how these things get staged, how companies establish a value for their offerings, and more. If you’re still trying to get a handle of this latest investing trend, too, read on.
TC: ICOs are everywhere suddenly.  When was the first ICO staged?
SM:  You have to go back to around 2013, when Mastercoin, a protocol on top the bitcoin blockchain, raised $500,000. Then you had a number of other milestone token sales, such as Ethereum in 2014, then the DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which was built on the Ethereum blockchain and that stored and transmitted Ether and Ethereum-based assets and that raised the equivalent of $150 million last year.
Momentum began to build after that, as a smaller group of [these offerings] grew in size, and by last fall, some companies were raising millions of dollars in minutes. That really kind of made people stand up and wonder if this is a new funding mechanism.
TC: How many ICOs have there been to date?
SM: There were 64 last year that collectively raised $103 million, excluding the DAO. So far this year, we’ve seen 25 offerings raise a bit more than $163 million, and we’re on track to see more than $210 million raised by the end of June.
TC: The idea is that instead of raise traditional funding from a bank or investors, a company that sells tokens to its customers ensures those customers are better aligned with the company’s success. Is that accurate?
SM: Yes. If I’m buying your token, I am incentivized to help the company’s product and ecosystem expand, bring in other users, maximize the tokens’ utility, and I’m hoping that demand for the token will increase and it may become more valuable. You’re creating the network and virality effect with these monetary incentives.
The term ICO is really a misnomer for what are token sales or token crowd sales.
TC: So how do these ICOs work, practically speaking? 
SM: There’s a cadence to these things. You do the prep-work and get your project to a natural technical milestone. Then you pre-announce when you’re planning to have a token sale, describing some of the terms, and telling a story of the project and its goals. You publish a white paper and disclosure and give people a chance to read it and comment. There are also usually threads that develop on Reddit, Bitcointalk, Slack, Telegram and elsewhere, where people actively debate the merits of the product. Then, on the landing page on the aforementioned date, there’s typically a tool that enables purchasers to acquire the tokens in exchange for bitcoin or ether.
TC: These require digital wallets?
SM: [The issuing company] requests [the investor’s] source wallet and the wallet where the token buyer wants to receive the token. Once the company collects the money, the sale is concluded, the smart contract is deployed, the tokens are issues via the smart contract, and delivered to the token purchasers.
TC: How do companies establish a value for the tokens they’re offering?
SM: Typically, a company sets out of a goal, then in the sales process, they can either discover what the market is willing to pay, as with a Dutch auction, or they can stipulate the price themselves and explain what the use of the proceeds will be. The value of the token lies in its functionality and utility.
Token holders are effectively prepaying for a product or service. If I run a video game company, for example, I can sell you tokens that represent in-game purchases once the game is built. If you know you’ll buy swords and shields and things like that, you can just pay for them now. It helps me develop the game and gives me more capital to do it, and you benefit from the currency becoming more valuable over time, because there’s a finite amount of it issued. The currency will presumably appreciate because the game will become more popular, and you were going to participate in it anyway, but now you’re also supporting the game developers.
TC: Do people always buy these tokens with cryptocurrencies?
SM: For the most part, they do. Sometimes, token sales involve dollars or other fiat currencies.
TC: Does it matter?
SM: Companies mostly use cryptocurrencies out of an abundance of caution. When you’re using fiat currency, you start touching the margins of banking and money transmitter regulations, and using cryptocurrencies keeps you clear of them. It’s also the case that a lot of your audience – right now, at least – is part of the cryptocurrency world anyway. These are people who have [digital] wallets. It’s not hard for them.
TC: Is there a concern that U.S. regulators will crack down on these ICOs?
SM: Lawyers are relying on case law that defines what a security is. The most well-known case is the “Howey Test,” created by the Supreme Court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts. If they do, then those transactions are considered securities and are subject to certain disclosure and registration requirements. When tokens are structured basically as the sale of a service or product, they’re designed to make sure the various prongs of the test are not triggered.
TC: So the SEC hasn’t reached out to anyone about these.
SM:  The SEC and other regulators are engaged and aware of the developments in this market, but they’re taking a measured approach. It hasn’t taken a view publicly,  put out a paper, or taken an enforcement action in the space. Other regulators such as the CFTC, the OCC, and state-level bodies are watching carefully.
TC: Where are most ICOs staged?
SM: It’s really a global industry. Some are in the U.S. and structured through Delaware [where many companies are incorporated]. Some are structured in Switzerland, some in Singapore, which has a very token-friendly regime where tokens aren’t considered a security. Companies are coming from many countries.
TC: What types of companies are primarily using ICOs?
SM: It’s still a financing mechanism that’s very organic to the blockchain community.
It all started with protocols like Ethereum raising funding through this mechanism, and it has stayed close to related projects, like the distributed storage company Storj and Civic, a company that provides identify through the blockchain and is announcing its token sale this Thursday. A lot of these founders and token buyers are part of bitcoin forums and Reddit, and that’s why [certain companies] are able to raise these large sums fairly quickly; they’re reaching out to thought leaders and getting their support and generating buzz about their projects. It’s  basically the open source community, now with an open-source funding mechanism.
TC: For how much longer, do you think? ICOs are getting tons of attention suddenly, as you know.
SM: We’re definitely starting to see more and more companies that are outside this core space beginning to examine [this new financing mechanism]. But it’s early days.
TC: What happens when people want to sell the tokens they’ve bought?
SM: Well, first, you can use them in a company’s ecosystem. With Storj, maybe you buy storage. You can also accumulate these tokens over time, as a bet that with more enterprise demand for storage capacity, the coins will become more valuable, after which you can sell your tokens to someone else who needs to purchase storage space.
There are also a number of cryptocurrency exchanges where these tokens trade. In the case of Storj, you can sell or buy on Poloniex or Bittrex.
TC: Is there any kind of lock-up period, or can a token holder immediately sell that token if he or she wants?
SM: There hasn’t been a lock-up period traditionally, but over the last two months, a practice has started to develop [toward that end] as transactions are getting larger, because it clearly makes a lot of sense. In the case of Storj, some purchasers that committed early received discounts but were also locked up [from selling] for between 3 and 12 months. So I think we’re beginning to see the maturation of market [in a way that reflects] traditional dynamics.
TC: Should VCs be nervous about ICOs? You mention Civic, which is staging an ICO. Civic has also raised some venture capital previously. But plenty of other companies seem to be skipping the VC part.
SM: To some degree they should, but we’ve also talked with a lot of very smart VCs who are looking at this space, including August Capital, Tim and Adam Draper, Blockchain Capital. Many are doing the work to understand how to be involved and active in the space and the fundamental value of these protocols. Union Square Ventures has said it now has a mandate from its LPs to hold these assets.
For companies that raise funds through a token sale and that have had traditional angel or venture rounds previously, for example, their equity investors get to skip one or two rounds of dilution, which is great; it means their returns are hyper-levered.
TC: Is there a bubble forming?
SM: There is a lot of velocity, but it’s coming from the liquidity that’s coming into this industry. A lot of early bitcoin investors are [plugging some of their rewards from its run-up in price] into these projects where the team is technically strong and the product or protocol is robust and addressing a large or hard problem.
More, every day I talk with hedge fund managers who just stumbled across this space and recognize that a diversified portfolio that includes a non-correlated asset like bitcoin has been shown to raise their sharp ratio, so we’re starting to see more adventurous family offices and high-net-worth individuals participate in these token sales.
TC: These offerings largely center on projects and not fully formed products, if I’m understanding correctly. That makes some outsiders nervous. Do you worry about bad actors?
SM: It’s really early. This whole market is just a couple of years old. Many projects have been out for less than a year, so it’s too soon to tell. But this is a small community where people know each other, so there’s a lot of founder pride and reputations are at stake. Also, the companies post their white papers publicly, their code is up on Github, and their token smart contracts are often peer audited, so [potential buyers] have some transparency in terms of where a product is in its cycle and also the community’s level of buy-in.
As with everything, it’s buyer beware. You certainly shouldn’t be buying token in projects you don’t understand.

The big news at DJI’s “huge Seize the Moment” event in New York City is, as expected, pretty small. The world’s largest consumer drone maker cracked the code of portability with last year’s backpack-sized, folding prop Mavic Pro drone (soundly thumping former ally GoPro in the process) and now it’s back on the scene a little over six months later with the Spark, a palm-sized unit that makes the Mavic look downright massive by comparison.
The usually top-secret drone maker did a terrible job keeping things under wraps this time out. Honestly, there isn’t much we didn’t see ahead of the event, save, of course, for actually getting to see the damn thing in the air. Leaks showcased the tiny vehicle from pretty much every angle — fitting, really, for a space that’s been raising serious privacy concerns of late. And they even got the name right.
The drone starts at a surprisingly accessible $499. That was really going to be the big sticking point here — with most pundits considering anything under $1,000 a good play for the company’s generally high-quality but high-priced products. It’s still not cheap, exactly, giving the number of budget drones that have flooded the market in recent years, but with all of the functionality the company has jammed into the thing, the Spark could well be DJI’s first truly mainstream drone.

The notion that this was going to be some kind of racing drone turned out to have missed the mark pretty broadly. Like the Mavic and basically all of the company’s drones, this is very much a photo/video taking device. The company is positioning the drone as a “story-telling” product – a fact it hinted at with the recent teaser video it released a couple of days before today’s event. The company is essentially positioning this as the first drone you can really take with you and incorporate into your life — the same story it attempted to tell with the Mavic last year.
But aside from size (which let’s be honest, is the most important thing here), the Spark’s got some pretty impressive tricks up its sleeves. It can take off from the palm of your hands and land back in it with little hassle. The demo of the functionality went exactly as planned, which isn’t always the case at these sorts of events, especially given the swamp of cell phone signals that is Grand Central Station..text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

Even more impressive is a gesture-based control, about which the assembled press made audibly excited mumbled comparisons to Star Wars.  And yeah, there’s a selfie function, too. Smiling with you arms folded will trigger the picture taking functionality.

For more complex maneuvers, there’s a smartphone app that can be used to send the drone off in the air in various patterns, gathering some pretty impressive video footage in the process. And the company’s existing Go 4 app offers up quick video editing on the fly. The video looks pretty solid in the demos — it’s full HD, and the still camera is 12MP. So, no 4K, which, as you’ve no doubt guessed, means this is far from a professional device. It’s more like a flying smartphone. There are a number of photo filters on board as well, that add things like shallow depth of field to images.

The drone itself can reach speeds of up to 31MPH, and a 3D sensing camera, GPS/Glonass and an on-board vision positioning system help keep the system stable, even indoors when the signal is crappy, while the two-axis gimbal helps stabilize video while it’s shooting.
The on-board battery is swappable on the fly – a big deal for a drone this small. And, for good measure, there’s a microUSB port for recharging — not USB-C for some reason, but beggars can’t be choosers, I guess. Each battery promises about 16 minutes of flight time person charge. There’s also a remote for the drone. It’s an optional accessory, which explains why it wasn’t pictured in those original leaks.

The tiny drone is available for pre-order today and starts shipping next month in three different colors. Assuming, of course, that the company doesn’t run into the sorts of production issues that plague the Mavic. There are a number of accessories available for the drone, a number of which are jammed into the $699 Fly More deluxe version. And the thing naturally works with the first-person video goggles that the company debuted alongside the Mavic last year.
DJI also went big on the warranty this time out, after the Mavic ran into some issues with its own launch (not to mention our own birdhouse-related issues) and GoPro’s Karma started literally falling from the sky.
Every time DJI announces a drone these days, the company makes the promise of finally mainstreaming the still relatively emerging technology. And every time the argument sounds a little more convincing. Last year’s Mavic backpack drone made a pretty compelling case, at least as far as getting more of these devices into the hands of photo enthusiasts. And the camera body-sized Spark is even more tempting for those on the go.
With a palm-sized body and sub-$500 price point, the company is taking some pretty significant steps beyond just photographers and videographers. It’s still a pretty expensive toy at the end of the day. But with the number of features the company is tossing in here, the notion of a solid drone for the rest of us just became a little more real.
We’ll be getting our hands on one soon, a fact that no one’s more excited about than our videographer.

MIT researchers have invented a new type of workout material that can breathe using biological cells. The project, called bioLogic, is essentially a “breathable workout suit” covered in small flaps. The flaps are “lined with live microbial cells that shrink and expand in response to changes in humidity” allowing the entire outfit to act as a reactive sensor to let athletes cool off as needed.
The group released their findings in a new paper.
“These cells are so strong that they can induce bending of the substrate they are coated on,” said lead author and Wen Wang.
Opening and closing flaps isn’t the only thing this system can do.
“We use fluorescence as an example, and this can let people know you are running in the dark. In the future we can combine odor-releasing functionalities through genetic engineering. So maybe after going to the gym, the shirt can release a nice-smelling odor,” said Wang.
The material uses a nonpathogenic strain of E. coli that could swell and shrink in humidity and even fluoresce when you sweat, glowing green as you exert yourself. From the release:
￼The team printed parallel lines of E. coli cells onto sheets of latex, creating two-layer structures, and exposed the fabric to changing moisture conditions. When the fabric was placed on a hot plate to dry, the cells began to shrink, causing the overlying latex layer to curl up. When the fabric was then exposed to steam, the cells began to glow and expand, causing the latex flatten out. After undergoing 100 such dry/wet cycles, Wang says the fabric experienced “no dramatic degradation” in either its cell layer or its overall performance.
This suggests you will soon have bioluminescent and bioreactive clothing that can be washed, dried, and worn again. The suit works far better than traditional workout wear and the researchers found that “effectively removed sweat from the body and lowered skin temperature” when working out. They’ve added the technology to the running shoe which, obviously, will soon allow E. coli to keep your tootsies nice and cool.
Xbox One owners get a new reason to fire up their consoles on June 1: Xbox Game Pass, the download service Microsoft created to deliver subscription-based gaming with a library of Xbox One and Xbox 360 games in an all-you-can game model.
The service is similar to PlayStation Now, Sony’s PlayStation 4-based equivalent, and also to Nivida’s GeForce NOW streaming service for its Shield Android TV set-top box. The Xbox version will cost members $9.99 per month, and will be available to Xbox Live Gold members starting today, with access opening to everyone on June 1. The key difference is that Microsoft’s offering allows full downloads of titles available to play, meaning you can access them offline and don’t have to worry about having a high-quality broadband connection to ensure smooth streaming.
The catalog includes some pretty recent fan favorites, like Halo 5: Guardians and Lego Batman, but it’s mostly older releases, which is why they’re available in a bundle with limitless play for a monthly subscription, instead of one-off at $70 or more per title. Still, if you missed out on some premiere releases over the years (life gets busy) then this is a great way to catch up.
You need an Xbox One to use Game Pass, but you also get discounts on full purchases of games and on game add-ons for currently available titles on the console. Sounds like something that should come to Windows 10, too, eventually, provided it drives revenue for Microsoft.
When SoftBank announced the first close of its Vision Fund this weekend — securing an initial commitment of $93 billion from investors including Apple, Qualcomm and Foxconn — it also quietly disclosed it had taken a stake in Nvidia.
Bloomberg is today reporting the size of that stake is $4 billion, for 4.9 percent of the company, which it says would make SoftBank the fourth largest investor in the chip maker.
Albeit, not necessarily for much longer: A line in the PR for the Vision Fund close on Saturday notes that the Vision Fund will have the right to acquire “certain investments already acquired (or agreed to be acquired)” by the SoftBank Group — with Nvidia being listed as one of those investments, along with a 24.99 percent stake in chip designer Arm (which SoftBank acquired last year for ~$31 billion). Although SoftBank of course retains its own ties to the Vision Fund and the fund’s investments.
A SoftBank spokesman declined to confirm the amount of its investment in Nvidia or to comment on Bloomberg’s report.
As we wrote recently, Nvidia’s GPUs have arguably become the bedrock underlying the current AI market explosion. And AI is one of the core areas of focus for SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Indeed, CEO Masayoshi Son set out his personal conviction earlier this year that the next 30 years will see the rise of superintelligent AI — saying this underpins his “hurry” to raise the ~$100 billion fund. So a chunky Nvidia investment meshes with his view of tomorrow’s world.
Even so, SoftBank has been spreading a lot of cash around lately. Other recent confirmed investments include $1.4 billion in Indian fintech unicorn Paytm; lead investor in virtual reality Improbable Worlds‘ $502 million raise; $5 billion in China’s Uber-killer Didi Chuxing; and a fresh $1.7 billion in global connectivity company OneWeb, after also investing $1 billion last year.
Some of these stakes may well move into the Vision Fund imminently, as the Nvidia stake and a chunk of ARM reportedly have. The fund has also been linked to a potential investment in WeWork, among others.
Son has previously said the mammoth Vision Fund won’t be a “typical fund” — and indeed, in size it’s unprecedented. But its modus operandi is intended to be hard to ignore too. “Most of our investments will range between 20 and 40 percent, making us the largest shareholder and board member, in a position to discuss strategy with the founders,” he told Bloomberg earlier this year.
So if money can buy superintelligent AI, it looks like Son is going to be the one to try and prove it.

This is the last trailer we’re getting for Luc Besson’s Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets before it hits theaters on July 21, 2017. The bright, bold sci-fi epic looks like trademark Besson, which is to say it looks like The Fifth Element.
Valerian’s similarity to Besson’s previous sci-fi oeuvre is a good thing until proven otherwise, and I won’t hear any complaints to the contrary until this thing is out and available to watch. Plus, Clive Owen is in it and the world needs more Clive Owen.
While we wait to get more news on Microsoft closing a reported acquisition of Cloudyn, another report has emerged of one more enterprise startup that the software giant is buying in Israel. Calacalist reported earlier today that Microsoft is paying $100 million to acquire Hexadite, a cybersecurity company that uses AI to sort through and address smaller network attacks — which can run up to 10,000 a month for a larger organization — while identifying larger problems for security specialists to tackle.
The news comes about a month after reports that Microsoft would be paying between $50 million and $70 million to acquire Cloudyn, a company that monitors and optimises a company’s operations across multi-vendor cloud architectures.
Contacted for a response, Microsoft declined to comment on the latest report earlier today. And Hexadite and its co-founders Idan Levin, Barak Klinghofer, Eran Barak, did not respond to our questions.
For what it’s worth, a single source tells us that both the Hexadite and Cloudyn acquisitions are in progress, and the Hexadite acquisition will likely be announced in a couple of weeks, which is why we chose to re-report the latest rumor, and resuscitate the previous one.
Hexadite has to date raised $10.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase, with investors including HP Ventures, YL Ventures, TenEleven Ventures and Moshe Lichtman of Israel Venture Partners. Notably, Lichtman is a ten-year veteran of Microsoft, which could point to one connection between the startup and its alleged acquirer. Its last round, of $8 million, was raised last year.
If accurate, the Hexadite acquisition would be one of a series of security acquisitions that Microsoft has made in Israel. Past deals include Aorato, Adallom and Secure Islands.
Microsoft’s interest in Hexadite — whose customers include Nuance, Telit and IDT — points to how security remains a hot area in the world of technology and specifically enterprise IT. The rapid growth of connected services and devices has gone hand-in-hand with a rapid rise in cybercrime, with malicious hackers becoming increasingly rampant and sophisticated in their attacks on networks and the hardware and apps that run on them, with breaches leading to millions of dollars in costs and lots of stress.
This has led to an increasingly sophisticated landscape for security services, with companies covering every aspect of how we conduct business today and a huge amount of spending by organizations to try to prevent, stop, fix or mitigate damage. IDC estimates that enterprises will spend nearly $82 billion on security software this year.
Hexadite is part of what you might call the new guard of security companies, building solutions based on machine learning and AI modelled on “top cyber analysts” to try to tackle threats more like the smartest humans would.
Essentially what it does is provide a security remediation system: it identifies and stops smaller issues itself, and at the same time it weeds out bigger problems that need to be addressed by in-person security teams. By doing this, it prevents those teams from being overwhelmed by the smaller items. It claims to reduce the time it takes to deal with security issues, as a result, by 95 percent.
If you look at what Hexadite does, there is a connect between it and what Cloudyn is doing on the cloud management and optimisation front.
In both cases, the idea is to bring more automation to some of the more regular and recurring tasks of running a connected, cloud-based business. As Microsoft continues to hone its focus in the enterprise market, and on cloud services specifically, it is looking for more products and services to help differentiate itself from others in the field.
As more businesses are looking for ways to reduce mundane tasks and grapple with the sheer weight of network traffic and data that they face today, they’ll be looking for more solutions like these.
We’ll update this post as we learn more.

While Sphero has released a whole lineup of robotic, Internet-connected toys, it remains best-known for its BB-8 droid from Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Today it’s launching its next Disney tie-in — Ultimate Lightning McQueen.
This is a car that you can control from your iPhone or Android, based on the Owen Wilson-voiced character from Pixar’s Cars franchise. (Cars 3 is coming out on June 16.) Ultimate Lightning McQueen is available today for a price of $299.
“As our partnership with Disney has evolved, we’ve been able to start to look at further properties within the Disney portfolio,” explained Product Manager Jenica Watts. (Sphero’s initial connection to Disney was as part of the Disney Accelerator.) “One of the teams had the opportunity to build an amazing, lifelike Lightning McQueen.”



The idea of a remote-controlled car from Cars might not seem all that novel, but it looks like Sphero has put a lot of work into bringing the character to life. Probably the first thing you’ll notice is that his front windshield is an LCD screen displaying Lightning’s animated eyes. And he talks, too — Watts said this is the first time a speaker has been built into a Sphero toy, and there’s even an animatronic mouth that moves as he speaks.
There’s also a feature that Sphero calls “emotive suspension.” That means Lightning doesn’t just drive around — his left and right sides also twitch up and down with excitement, and he’ll speak and move in response to taps on his roof, hood and doors.

This was all supervised by Pixar’s Jay Ward, creative director for the Cars franchise, with advice from Bobby Podesta, supervising animator on Cars 3. The end result is that Ultimate Lightning McQueen has a real sense of personality — enough so that after we’d been charging him for a few minutes in the corner of the TechCrunch New York office, we had to put him to sleep because of his constant demands for attention. (To be fair, that’s probably what we should have done in the first place.)

 As for his performance on the road, the smartphone app offers an intuitive interface for driving him around at speeds of up to 6 miles per hour, with support for reversing and drifting. I’m not exactly an experienced remote-controlled driver (some of my friends would say that I’m not much better with an actual car), but even so, I enjoyed crashing Ultimate Lightning McQueen around the Sphero demo space, and then around our office.
The only real difficulty I had was in the initial setup, where it took a couple of tries before I successfully paired my phone with Lightning and downloaded all the needed updates.
There are other features that I haven’t had a chance to test out yet. For one thing, Sphero says you can watch the Cars films with Lightning and he’ll offer his own commentary (his microphone your smartphone will pick up the movie’s audio). There’s also a Pit Stop Panic game that you can play on your phone. And the company says it has created more than 150 animations for Lightning to perform, which users can connect together into scripts through an “acting studio” in the app.
Facebook announced today it’s expanding its online fundraising tools – basically, Facebook’s own take on a GoFundMe-type service – to include support for community fundraisers as well as those for sports teams. The company had first launched its personal fundraising tools in March of this year, allowing users to raise money for educational, medical or pet medical needs, public crises, natural disasters, personal emergencies, and funerals or loss.
That launch, however, was considered a beta test. Today, Facebook says the product is publicly available for all users in the U.S. who are over 18 years of age.
With the new supported categories, Facebook users are now able to raise money for things like  neighborhood services, community improvements, or environmental improvements, Facebook explains. Or, in the case of sports teams, people can raise money for equipment, competitions or team fees.
All fundraisers have to first go through a review process to ensure they meet Facebook’s policy and guidelines. Afterwards, users can promote their fundraising campaign by inviting friends to join and donate, or by posting the campaign to Facebook.

The launch of personal fundraisers follows a series of other efforts Facebook has made in the fundraising space. The company rolled out a Kickstarter-like feature in 2015 aimed at nonprofits, which allowed the organizations to set up a campaign page, explain their goals and collect cash. And in 2016, Facebook expanded its fundraising tools so individuals could collect funds on behalf of nonprofit organizations, too.
The company then moved directly into GoFundMe’s space this March, even undercutting its rival on the fee structure. Facebook’s personal fundraisers have a 6.9 percent + $.30 fee that goes to payment processing, fundraiser vetting, and security and fraud protection. GoFundMe, meanwhile, takes 7.9 percent + $.30 for personal or charity campaigns.
Facebook touts its lower price point as coming from a desire to encourage giving and good works on its network.
“Facebook’s goal is to create a platform for good that’s sustainable over the long-term, and not to make a profit from our charitable giving tools,” the company said in today’s announcement.
However, the fundraisers have another advantage for the social network. By giving to fundraisers, Facebook is encouraging more payment transactions among its user base – and payments is an area of its business that’s still under-developed today, despite Facebook having added support for person-to-person payments in Messenger.
Access to personal fundraisers are open to all as of now, and can be found via facebook.com/fundraisers on the desktop, or from the “Fundraisers” menu on mobile devices.
Bill Rossi, the new chief executive officer at Metabiota, believes that (unlikely as it seems) the insurance industry might be the key to stopping epidemic outbreaks worldwide — and that Metabiota would supply the monitoring tools to make the product work.
Rossi, who quietly took the reins at the San Francisco-based company earlier in the year, said that a new product is being developed by international insurance companies alongside global financial institutions to respond to pandemic risk.
The company’s chief executive said that the new policies will provide financing in the wake of deadly pandemics and encourage multi-national corporations and nation-states to invest in preventing the spread of disease.
Metabiota launched its insurance product last month and has been pitching its services to insurers, nations, and companies ever since. Indeed, Metabiota is partnering with the African Risk Capacity (ARC) agency, an agency of the  African Union (AU) to help nations respond to threats.

The former chief operating officer of Bidgely, an energy software company (backed by Khosla Ventures) that sold to utilities worldwide, and the former chief marketing officer at Enphase Energy, a solar monitoring solution.
Perhaps most relevant, Rossi worked at Google selling productivity apps to enterprise customers. A graduate from Dartmouth with an MBA from Harvard, Metabiota’s new chief executive is focused on juicing the company’s growth after 8 years selling to the relatively staid government market.
Rossi took over the executive role from co-chief executives Nathan Wolfe and Robert Mann, though Nathan still remains involved with the company.
“Most of its history was in government services,” says Rossi. “Government services is a good market, but if the goal is to make the world resistant to epidemic risk and [the insurance product] is one way to make the world more resilient.”
Interest in epidemic and pandemic risk insurance has been growing since the Ebola outbreak of 2014. Last year at the G7 finance summit in Japan, financial leaders from the world’s largest economies unveiled the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, a $500 million effort to make funds instantly available for curbing the spread of infectious diseases.
Those public funds are being complimented by work insurers are already doing to sell sovereign wealth insurance for epidemic risk, Rossi said.
There’s a potential for abuse in these kinds of policies which may provide a perverse incentive to governments which could conceivably profit on the back of insurance payouts in the event that a country is adversely affected by an epidemic (not to be too ghoulish about it).
Rossi insists that the insurance policies will encourage countries to establish better monitoring and management tools so that they can respond to outbreaks before they become severe global pandemics.
For Rossi and the team at Metabiota, it’s imperative that the governments of countries where these pandemics originate invest in early detection systems for when diseases begin to spread.
“These global health threats represent a pretty sizable disruption,” says Rossi. “We work with sovereign nations and also the insurers who have the financial wherewithal to ensure that policies are put in place to prevent the spread of disease.”
The threats aren’t academic. Earlier this month the World Health Organization confirmed an outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo. So far, three deaths were connected to the virus, and another 21 suspected cases are being investigated.
A two-year outbreak in West Africa which began in 2014 infected 28,000 people and resulted in 11,000 deaths.

Spider-Man: Homecoming is not that far away now, set for U.S. release on July 7. The movie got two new trailers early Wednesday, including a U.S. version (above), and the International trailer (below). I was worried this was going to be a game of spotting minor differences, but it very much is not, as you’ll see for yourself.
The domestic trailer focuses a lot on Spidey’s suit, which is a gift from Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) and which is filled with top-tier tech. The Spider-Man of comic book lore is mostly a DIY inventor type with lots of science acumen, but the suit depicted in this trailer looks like an Iron Man armor without the armor, instead of a high school kid’s prize-winning science project.

Meanwhile, in that second trailer, we get a much better picture of what evil plan Spider-Man is trying to thwart in the movie. Someone’s apparently hoarding weapons and tech that pops up around Avengers battles across the globe. We also get Spider-Man vlogging the fight where he made his debut in Captain America: Civil War, which I’m sure is designed to maximize the YouTuber appeal.
You may have feelings about a tech-heavy Spider-Man suit or other aspects of this interpretation of the character, but it’s still shaping up to be better than any Spider-Man depicted in movies in recent memory.
Have a robotic startup or project? We want you on stage at TechCrunch Session: Robotics this July 17 at MIT. We’re looking for students to demo and early stage startups to pitch. If selected, both will get free tickets and exhibit space at the event. Use this form to apply.
This opportunity will put participants in front of the companies, founders and engineers driving the robotics field forward. Pitch-off participants will get several minutes to make their case in a competition for a chance to exhibit their creation at Disrupt SF. Selected participants will reveal their company to the audience and a group of expert judges who will ultimately pick a winner.
Students should apply for the demo slots, which feature more time on the main stage to tell their story. High school students to grad students should apply. We’re looking for projects that can shift the industry. Please note, you must have a working robotic demo for this opportunity.
Over the last few weeks, TechCrunch has met with countless robotics companies in Boston, Pittsburgh and elsewhere. This event is going to be epic. The lineup of speakers and companies participating is amazing and there’s still an opportunity to get involved. Drop us a line with speaker and topic suggestions.
Our aim is to bring together the key players in robotics. That includes the investors and founders focused on building the next iRobot, Kiva and Intuitive Surgical. We’ll stir into that mix the technologists, researchers and engineering students working on the latest stuff, like soft robotics, collaborative robotics, undersea and airborne robotics and that welcoming, all-purpose robot you always wanted to meet you at the door with a cold beer.
Tickets for the event are currently available. Seating is very limited so don’t wait. Grab them while you can.
We are also happy to announce that MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) is a key sponsor. The event is absolutely global, but there is no better place to stage the gathering than Boston.

Stae wants to help local governments collect, manage and process data about their infrastructure. The company just raised $1.5 million from Story Ventures, Fontinalis Partners and Samsung Next.
I first covered Stae back in April 2016. The vision hasn’t changed much, it’s all about preparing cities for the future and upgrading infrastructure by making it more efficient through technology. But there are now a couple of cities using Stae for their digital strategy, making it a bit more real.
So far, Atlanta and Jersey City started implementing Stae with their existing services. You can think about it as a sort of GitHub meet IFTTT for infrastructure data.
“Cities are still thinking about data as archive files. They’re not thinking about streams of data,” Stae co-founder John Edgar told me.
So let’s take this step by step. First, cities already have many sets of data coming from utilities, public transport, ambulances, residence complaints, traffic cameras and more. Instead of exporting a CSV or Excel file every now and then to look at this data, Stae wants to turn this data into APIs. By doing that, Stae standardizes data sets and it becomes easier to manipulate them.
And Stae is not the only one thinking this way. New York City Council Member Ben Kallos just introduced a bill that asks city agencies to share their data using an API.
Second, Stae provides a single interface to access data and manage authorizations. For instance, you can share data with your citizens by turning some information into open data. The police department could also access some sets of data while the city could restrict access to other sets of data. It’s a good way to granularly manage your vendors.
Finally, Stae wants to link together multiple sets of data to analyze them and draw some conclusions. This is what I call the SimCity part. If you could combine traffic jam data with bike sharing stations in a couple of clicks, you could make educated decisions about future bike sharing stations.
“There’s a challenge trying to understand the relationship between those different sets of data,” Jersey City’s Chief Innovation Officer Brian Platt told me. “You know, it can be done manually. But in government, there’s not always the capacity or frankly the capability to do this.”
Jersey City is trying to turn Stae into the single repository of data. Getting everything in there is already a challenge by itself. When it comes to combining and analyzing data, this is going to take a bit longer.
“We hope to — We’re not there yet,” Platt said. “If we want to intersect bike sharing and weather and crime, we would have to manually analyze everything.”
In many ways, it all comes down to constrained budgets and resources. Jersey City doesn’t have a full-time data scientist, so the local government is relying on platforms like Stae to do the heavy lifting. Having a central repository is already a big change.
While many cities don’t have a big enough budget to upgrade their infrastructure, technology can already make existing infrastructure more efficient. Let’s see if Stae can help cities scale.
Dave Asprey, the man famous for encouraging Silicon Valley execs to put butter in his special blend of coffee, has raised another $19 million to keep on doing just that.
His company and lifestyle brand Bulletproof 360 claims to make coffee free of something called mycotoxins, which is, basically, mold and can make you very ill if ingested. Asprey says about 75 percent of other brands are full of these mycotoxins and they are affecting the brains and bodies of America’s leaders. But for $18.95 you can get a bag of Asprey’s “Upgraded” blend of zero mycotoxins coffee.
But that claim doesn’t seem to hold up. Mycotoxins are in a lot of things, including meats, grains, coffee and a bunch of other foodstuffs and are most certainly harmful in large quantities. However, most every coffee company in the world is aware of this cancer-causing mold and many use wet processing to clean the beans for that reason. Bulletproof says that’s not enough and that it has some extra special technique, but despite whatever that is, some have claimed to have found below threshold levels of mycotoxins in Asprey’s coffee anyway.
Also, according to a National Institutes of Health study Americans who drank more than four cups of coffee a day were found to have well below what’s considered safe levels of mycotoxins. Levels were so low after the normal coffee bean roasting process the NIH discontinued the study so it doesn’t seem like this should be a big concern for coffee drinkers anyway.
As for dissecting the other claims, like a special fat that makes you thin and reduces your cholesterol or that grass-fed butter has health benefits for your brain would make for a much longer post. However, there is some preliminary evidence that medium-chain triglycerides do help with weight loss.
There’s also something to be said for building a loyal following and a solid sales pipeline in the health and wellness field — something not everyone can do in such a crowded space. And Asprey’s own backstory lends to his credibility here. The man lost about a 100 pounds after spending $1 million of his own money in trial and error “hacking” his own body. But really, anyone who can sell something called FATwater (literally water with fat in it) deserves a medal in the sales hall of fame.
While we don’t know the year-over-year sales figures, Bulletproof seems to have done well enough at least to convince VC’s to hand over more money. CAVU Venture Partners led the round, along with previous investor Trinity Ventures (which also, incidentally, invested in Starbucks). Bulletproof previously took in $9 million in Series A, bringing up the total funding to date to $28 million.
Asprey, who just released his latest book, titled HEAD STRONG, also plans to expand to more retail stores this year, starting in New York City. His two existing Bulletproof Cafés are in Southern California.
Samsung announced today that it will begin selling its new 360-degree camera in-stores and online starting tomorrow for $229.
Across the pond, the phone had been available for pre-order for £219, or just over $283, so this is actually a smudge cheaper than some were expecting. Even though the company’s last iteration was priced at $349, those with a thrifty eye could easily find the device available for $170 new from certain online retailers.
Spec-wise the camera isn’t a huge improvement over the last. It’s gone from “near-4K” to “true 4K” video (2K while live-streaming) and its kept the 15 megapixel resolution for still photos.
The most notable shift on the latest model is that the device loses its spherical shape in favor of one that has a bit more of a handle that users can hold. Samsung highlighted the new model’s “pocketable design” when it briefly showed off the device at Unpacked this year alongside its latest Galaxy phones.
Speaking of the S8 and S8+, if you plan on picking one up in the imminent future, you’ll have the option of picking up one of these cameras for just $49. You’ll need to purchase the phone between tomorrow and  June 19, 2017 to qualify. More details here.
The device launching at a retail price $120 less than its previous iteration shows how aggressively Samsung is needing to price these devices in order to get them into people’s hands. Despite tons of startups and large companies getting behind 360-degree cameras early-on, there still hasn’t seemed to be quite that much consumer excitement. Even a form factor change like adding a handle, shows that Samsung is still very much learning how people fundamentally use these devices.
The new Gear 360 is available to purchase tomorrow in-store and online at Best Buy, Amazon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon and U.S. Cellular, Samsung and through the ShopSamsung app.
Need more controllers for your Nintendo Switch? If you already have some of 8Bitdo’s excellent Bluetooth, classic system-inspired game pads lying around, you’re all set thanks to a new firmware update. Even if you don’t yet have any of these, it’s worth picking some up since they’re very affordable, ergonomic and stylish.
The update to the controllers expands their versatility to include Nintendo Switch compatibility, but the controllers already work with Windows, Android, MacOS and Steam out of the box, too. With Switch, they don’t support rumble functions or motion controls, but they do pretty much replicated the native Switch Pro controller in terms of functionality, with exact button mapping possible on the NES30 Pro and FC30 Pro controllers from 8Bitdo’s lineup.

This is great timing because Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the most recent blockbuster first-party release from Nintendo for Switch, and you can play with up to four people on one console locally in multiplayer. You could of course buy up a bunch of official, first-party Switch controllers, but 8Bitdo’s option is great if you already have these or want a controller that works in more places beyond the Switch.
If you’re an existing 8Bitdo controller, go ahead and grab the firmware update for your device from their support site to get Switch compatibility enabled on your device.
Cloud-based communication and collaboration platforms are the name of the game today in enterprise software, and now one of the still-independent leaders in that space is announcing a significant round at a hefty price to ride the wave of growth. Smartsheet, the Bellevue, Washington-based startup that has built spreadsheet software that lets people set and manage tasks and work across teams of people, has picked up $52 million, in what CEO Mark Mader tells me was a pre-money valuation of $800 million ($852 million post-money).
The valuation, notably, is a massive, tenfold leap for Smartsheet. When it last raised money in 2014, the company was valued only around $75-80 million. This Series F, which brings the total raised by the company to $120 million, was led by previous investor Insight Venture Partners, with Madrona Venture Group and Sutter Hill Ventures, and new investor Summit Partners also participating.
Why the big jump in valuation? Part of it has to do with growth of the company itself, and partly with the current climate for socially-minded enterprise software.
Smartsheet, Mader said in an interview, has been growing at a rate of about 60 percent a year for the past five years, with a $100 million annual run rate, and intentionally run not for profit as it continues to grow. The company currently has about 70,000 businesses paying to use the product, ranging from SMBs through to large enterprises. This works out to around 550,000 licensed customers, and “a few million” people who use it free of charge, he said.
Smartsheet’s business model is, as with many cloud-based services, freemium. Everyone can access documents for free, and you only pay if you want access to edit or update a Smartsheet document. This low barrier to entry, where Smartsheet “monetises only those who are initiating and creating work on the platform,” as Mader puts it, essentially lures in many users, some of whom eventually convert to paying customers. (Tiers range from $14 to $25 per user based on your business size, or at a custom rate for large organisations.)
The drive to use Smartsheet is coming from a bigger trend in the market: there has been a large shift from using software hosted by a company itself, or installed directly on your device, to products that are sold, distributed and accessed in the cloud.
Smartsheet was an early mover in that space, opening up for business in 2006 as an alternative to the likes of Excel and other spreadsheet packages on the market, with a firm focus on offering a way for multiple people to collaborate in those documents to use them more dynamically.
In other words, if Excel found a purpose as a place where multiple people could dip in to monitor the progress of something, Smartsheet was created from the start with that in mind.
Fast forwarding several years, the cloud architecture that Smartsheet focused on early has become something of the norm in the business world, with companies like Slack — focused more on communication across teams and apps — and Dropbox and Box — looking at the storage component — now leading the charge and forcing the hand of much larger players like Microsoft to follow along.
“There are documents and communication tools and file synchronization and sharing in the cloud,” Mader said, “and we see automation and work tracking as the final domino in that space.” 
Today, Smartsheet integrates with several but not all of these: part of the funding will be used to expand that list from a current roster that includes the likes of Box, Dropbox and Teams from Microsoft, but not, for example, Slack. That integration is coming later this year, Mader said.
Many investors are racing to figure out what the next great breakaway enterprise collaboration business opportunity might be — there are a lot of contenders. And, by definition, that also means that there are a pretty wide range of competitors to Smartsheet, including Asana, Basecamp, Wrike, Teamwork, Workfront and many others.
Mader says that one of Smartsheet’s unique selling points amongst all these is its automation layer, which essentially incorporates AI to help lead people through tasks and the sheets themselves, rather than relying on people to be able to work everything out for themselves.
“We knew it was only a matter of time before Google and Microsoft would take the spreadsheet into the cloud, and that is what they have done, so we had to do something else,” Mader said. Interestingly, that too may soon become table stakes, with the theory (and evidence) that AI elements will soon be a part of all of our connected services. 
So far, the growth, product and market fit have been a strong combination for investors.
“Collaborative work management is now recognized as a key component of modern enterprise strategy, as companies look to move beyond the limitations of legacy tools,” said Ryan Hinkle, Managing Director at Insight Venture Partners, in a statement. “Since our initial investment with Smartsheet, we have seen an incredible amount of development and growth behind their capabilities. We are committed to continuing  this acceleration so that more companies can benefit from the unique value of Smartsheet.”
DJI is promising “something huge” at this morning’s “Seize the Moment” event in New York City. More than likely, that big thing will come in a small package. The often secretive drone company has apparently been leaking like crazy ahead of today’s big reveal, and we’ve gotten more than few looks at the rumored Spark drone, which is set to make the recently released Mavic massive by comparison.
The company hasn’t made anything official, but earlier this week, it did issue a video teaser that hinted at a device more focused on photos and videos than racing, as was suspected by some following the initial leaks.
The company has also registered the Spark name, lending some credence to that aspect of the rumor. Knowing DJI, it will also have a number of other goodies up its sleeve. At the Mavic event back in September, it also showed off its first-person video goggles, which, at the very least, ought to be getting more face time here.
We’ll have a team on the ground in NYC, posting news and videos from the event. But for those who’d like to watch whole thing unfold live, fixed propellers and all, DJI will be streaming the event for all to see, starting at 11:30AM ET/8:30AM PT.

GREE Ventures, the Singapore-based VC firm connected to Japanese games firm GREE, has closed its newest $67 million fund for early stage investments in Asia.
AT-II — the firm’s second fund — sees GREE Ventures spread its focus of deals in Japan and Southeast Asia to cover India for the first time. The fund has so far made 10 investments across Asia, which includes New Delhi-based PopXO, a media startup targeted at women in India. Typical check size is $0.5-$3 million for seed to Series A deals, and the firm prefers to lead rounds where it can.
Investors in the new fund include the SME Support Japan, Mizuho Financial Group and, of course, GREE itself. GREE Ventures was formed five years ago, and it has invested in more than 40 startups over that period. Its exits to date include Kudo in Indonesia (sold to Grab), Pie (sold to Google) and Luxola, which was bought by Sephora parent company LVMH.
While the GREE business is anchored in games, GREE Ventures is designed to invest outside of that focus to give its parent company reach and insight in new and upcoming tech sectors. That’s a different rationale to the $12 million fund that GREE launched last year to explore opportunities in VR and AR.

Consumers increasingly are going online to search for insurance, and when they do, PolicyGenius wants to be right there to help them find the right policy. To expand its offerings and support more customers, the company raised a $30 million Series C funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners.
PolicyGenius has built a marketplace for consumers who want to evaluate multiple insurance carriers and policies all in one place. People searching for a policy can answer a series of questions and find multiple options available to them.
By working with various insurance providers, PolicyGenius has built a quoting engine and allows consumers to compare policies they are eligible for side-by-side. The company also has an “insurance checkup” tool to help customers discover and close gaps in their insurance coverage.
Starting with life insurance, PolicyGenius has gradually expanded its suite of options to include health insurance, renters’ insurance, long-term disability insurance and even pet insurance.
Since announcing a $15 million round of financing in January 2016, the company has grown monthly revenues by 7x and doubled its employee base. With its new round, PolicyGenius hopes to expand its product lines to include property and casualty policies, and also to build out relationships with its partners.
PolicyGenius co-founder and CEO Jennifer Fitzgerald said the company selected Norwest thanks to its work with strong consumer-facing brands such as Casper, Jet and LendingClub. With the funding, Norwest partner Parker Barrile will join the company’s board.
To date, PolicyGenius has raised a total of $52 million in venture funding, from investors that include Revolution Ventures, Karlin Ventures, Susa Ventures, AXA Strategic Ventures, Transamerica Ventures, MassMutual Ventures and Fika Ventures.
Pinterest is adding another ad to its array of products, now allowing advertisers to publish video advertising that will automatically play in the home feed and search, as it continues to bulk up and woo advertisers with a different pitch from Facebook and Google.
Pinterest has had to make the argument to advertisers that its 175 million users behave differently on Pinterest when compared to Facebook and Google, or even Twitter and Snap. Pinterest users come to the site and dig through products and recipes, among other things, for ideas. They then search deeper into topics, save them, and then eventually in theory acting on them later — either by cooking the dish or buying a product. Pinterest’s pitch is that unlike Facebook and Google, which can offer a compelling ad product for one point of that part of a customer’s buying life, it can offer products across the whole timeline.
The ability to catch those possible customers early on and follow them all the way to the final buying process is something that might entice advertisers, but it still has to ensure it has the advertising products to back it up. Today’s announcement, which opens up autoplay video ads to all partners, gives it yet another argument that it can offer something competitive to Facebook — which has shown that video can have greater engagement and offers a potentially lucrative new source of customers.
“The main difference we notice is that some users watch more content direct in their feed,” Pinterest product lead Mike Bidgoli said. “Previously they’d see the preview, and now they’ll take that action. In general, video is a little higher up the funnel [generating brand awareness] activity. We’re trying to bend the curve between that discovery to [taking an action] on our platform.”

Pinterest may indeed have an additional edge in its pitch given that Facebook has had some problems in reporting its numbers. As newer ad products emerge it’s critical to build up that trust with advertisers in addition to showing that the ads can be effective. Pinterest is partnering with Nielsen and Moat to give its advertisers accurate measurements on their ads and the results that they can deliver. That’s going to be important as Pinterest tries to show advertisers that it can tap into multiple different kinds of user behavior on its service, like search.
“That’s a place where people have a lot of intent [to act],” Bidgoli said. “We think we have a shot bringing people both to top of funnel as well as bottom. That would allow us to play with some performance advertisers. They can pair a video with a set of pins that they want Pinner to take action on. That’s still a big part of it. The “do” component, people are on Pinterest to get inspired and then they do that.”
In general, autoplay is the direction that mobile video is headed as a default — and that will extend to advertisers as well. There’s the question around data consumption, but Bidgoli said even though the company obsessed about it initially but found through testing that it “wouldn’t rip any alarms.” Users will still have the option to turn autoplay off in settings if they see fit.
Video offers a new kind of engaging content that users can find when casually browsing around the app, but beyond that Pinterest is trying to diversify its range of products to tie the experience of Pinterest closer and closer to the real world. That might look like its Lens product, which allows a user to point their camera at a product to execute a search, to watching a video for how to cook a dish. But either way, the sum of all these products is an advertising pitch that is an effort to move the company away from those experimental advertisement budgets to a mainstay ad purchase with bigger brands.

Apple’s found a fair bit of success with Swift Playgrounds since launching it last year at WWDC. According to the company, the educational program has enlisted some one million users into its ranks. And while the dead simple offering is primarily aimed at youngsters, there’s apparently been a fair bit of interest across demographics.
Today’s announcement extends Apple’s Swift-based educational offerings to an older age set, namely high schoolers and college-age students. The company has teamed with a half-dozen community colleges across the country to bring its App Development with Swift program to life, in order to help students enter the work world with app development knowledge.
The very real “app economy” employs around 1.53 in the U.S., according to numbers offered up the company, making up a majority of the two million jobs its says it’s created in the U.S. Certainly it’s important for graduates to possess coding skills. And while Swift isn’t exactly an all-purpose language — designated solely for Apple products –there’s plenty of opportunity in those offerings and something to be said for learning the fundamentals of code, whatever language.
Swift is also designed to be simple, in keeping with the whole Apple ethos. When the company says the programming language was built with education in mind, that’s mostly what it means.
“The first thing Apple wanted Swift to be was approachable, “ Apple VP Lisa Jackson tells TechCrunch. “You don’t have to be a computer science type to interact and learn this language, so it can be a first programming language. But it needs to be powerful enough to write complex apps.”
The program, which is an outgrowth of Apple’s Everyone Can Code curriculum for K-12, is designed to be taught over the course of two semesters – a full school year. Though precisely how it’s broken up will be at the discretion of the individual school. The colleges are apparently getting a fair amount of freedom here.
Apple says it opted for a broad range of education partners to help cover a large gamut of nascent coders. “These are six schools in very different areas of the country,” says Jackson. “Some of them have more women than men. We have a lot of folks who are lower income or underrepresented minorities. A lot are interested in being a part of workforce development because they want to reach mid-development students.”
The app is available starting today for free through iBooks. And while Apple isn’t making any money on app sales, it’s pretty easy to see why it made the effort to develop and pilot the program. Getting Swift into the hands of upstart developers is a pretty clear win for the company, much the same way that Macs and iPads in the classroom helped the company gain a foothold for decades as those students graduated and starting making their own purchasing decisions.
If Swift can be the first a first coding language for young developers, the company will build itself a solid foothold into the future.
Prolific investment firm Naspers is making a push into bitcoin and financial services after it backed Philippines-based startup Coins.ph to the tune of $5 million.
Coins is focused on offering financial services for the unbanked in the Philippines and Thailand. It uses the blockchain as its underlying technology to facilitate transfers and remittances. It announced the new funding — which comes via the Naspers Ventures division — as an extension to the $5 million Series A round that it closed last October.
Naspers, meanwhile, needs little introduction: the South Africa-based firm specializes in e-commerce and consumer businesses in emerging markets across the world. Its investments include Tencent, Asia’s highest value tech firm, India’s Flipkart, and now-Amazon-owned Souq.com in the Middle East among many others. Its primary presence in Southeast Asia is via global e-commerce firm OLX, but it did put money into Singapore-based bitcoin startup BitX in 2015.
“Coins has done an excellent job of providing consumers with easy, cost-effective access to core financial services,” James Caviness, VP and CPO of Naspers’ PayU business, said in a statement. “We expect Coins to continue to grow and expand across Southeast Asia.”
As part of the investment, Caviness has joined the Coins board.
Expansion is exactly the plan, according Justin Leow, head of business operations for Coins. Leow told TechCrunch in an interview that the company is now looking to bring its services to new markets, although he declined to get specific on future destinations.
“The issues we are solving in the Philippines are quite prevalent in the rest of the [Southeast Asian] region,” he said. “Existing financial systems exclude people who don’t meet the income requirements. That issue is why we’ve had such a large unbanked population.”
The banking gulf is indeed huge. Southeast Asia as a region houses more than 600 million consumers. Its internet economy is forecast to reach $200 billion per year within the next decade but financial systems are a key requirement to make that happen. Currently, just 27 percent of the region’s population has a bank account, according to a KPMG report published last year, and that’s where Coins is looking to make an impact.
The startup currently offers a range of services that include credit, basic banking, bill payments, top-up and remittance payments, none of which require a user to have a bank account. Rather than offering services directly, it works with partners to serve users.
“We are really trying to build an ecosystem of services,” he explained, adding that companies like SoftBank-backed Paytm in India are an inspiration. “The goal is a wallet where people store money and can do everything with it.”
Coins claims to have more than one million registered users and support from over 100,000 merchants.

In partnership with TechCrunch, The Europas Conference & Awards, is a different kind of tech startup event which features smaller breakout sessions on key subjects for startups, as well as main-stage speakers and panels. It’s also very different, in that there’s no “off-limits speaker room” at The Europas, so attendees can mingle easily with VIPs and speakers.
What that means for early stage startup founders is that you can go right up to them and talk. And that’s going to be even easier than just looking for a name badge, because the dedicated networking app for attendees will also allow you to check what they look like as well as arrange meetings. You can grab tickets here.
Even better, there’s a special VIP event on June 12, PathFounders, specifically geared to fund-raising startups and investors. This day features special programming, and the chance to pitch your startup in front of angels and VC investors.
Because the conference and awards are supported by TechCrunch all attendees will get deep discounts to TechCrunch Disrupt in Berlin, later this year.
The Europas conference is followed by a glittering awards for the hottest startups in Europe, based on voting by expert judges and the industry itself. But key to it all is the people who come.
So here for you we present a list of just some of the investors who are down to attend either as a speaker or a featured guest. All the speaker bios and the agenda are on The Europas site.

Taboola, the startup that works with hundreds of publishers to provide a set of links at the bottom of pages directing readers to more content on the site and elsewhere, has long positioned Facebook as the big competitor.
Consumers scanning articles on Facebook, especially on mobile, are less likely to ever visit a publisher’s own site, even more so now with the introduction of Instant Articles that keep readers essentially inside the Facebook experience: hence the push to create more links at the bottoms of stories to try to keep readers engaged and in your own network sphere.
Now, in an ironic twist, Taboola is launching a new format that could be summed up as “if you can’t beat them, join them”. As an alternative to its existing grid of links, Taboola wants now to feature content recommendations in the form of a continuously scrolling list, its own take on, yes, Facebook’s news feed.
The new format is launching first with the New York Daily News before getting rolled out to other publications.
The new Taboola news feed essentially consolidates a number of widgets and links you already have on websites, specifically publishers’ websites, into a larger feed experience: alongside the links to other articles on your own site, and those of other publications in the Taboola network, you will see cards for other services like the weather, videos, and marketing cards for in-app purchases, sponsored content and more — additions that have in part been made possible by some of Taboola’s recent acquisitions like ConvertMedia and Commerce Sciences. 
The germination for adding a news feed comes from the fact that Taboola doesn’t feel like its set of links are a solution, as much as they are part of an ongoing problem. 
“Today, when you look at publishers’ sites, it’s a shitshow,” Adam Singolda, Taboola’s founder and CEO, said in an interview. “You have the right rail, at the bottom you have Taboola, you have newsletter widgets, and commenting and navigation bars. And in mobile it’s even worse.” He said that Taboola’s tests have found that the average user reads one article and then just goes back to Facebook. “Engagement becomes horrible because the experience is really bad.” 
In trying to figure out how to solve that problem, Taboola — which is based in New York but was founded in and still operates in Israel — has taken a page from the new guard of cybersecurity companies: the best way to combat a threat today is to put yourself (or your security system) in the mindset of that threat.
“Even though I have a lot of issues with Facebook they are doing something well, the news feed,” he said. “Scrolling down you are presented with different cards — images or posts or links or videos or ads — but it’s a consistent, ongoing experience. Users don’t have to get to know Facebook all over again each time something new is introduced, and so they keep scrolling, for an hour or more a day.”
The ideal, he said, is to get the 1 billion or so people who see and (potentially) click on Taboola links to spend more than 3 seconds on a page: to move them to three minutes, and perhaps one day to three hours. This is especially relevant in markets where mobile is the primary platform for media consumption and browsing. Singolda said that today in the U.S. and Western Europe, about half of the readers across its network are on mobile. In parts of Asia, that proportion is 90 percent.
Taboola’s news feed is not completely replacing the Taboola grid at this point, but this is Singolda’s long-term intention. It’s one more way to bring in more engagement, but it is also another way for Taboola to differentiate from its lookalike competitors. These include the likes of Outbrain, which has long been the subject of speculation that it will merge with Taboola. Nothing to report on that front yet, Singolda said.
Readers using the new feed will, for now, click out of a publisher’s page to go to a new page in the browser to read stories, with a small option to click back to the originating page. Singolda told me that the idea will be to introduce AMP pages into the mix over time to speed up the jumps, as Taboola is already an AMP partner.
I’ll be looking to see how that plays out, since AMP links currently mean no traffic for the originating or endpoint publications, with Google hosting the speed-up pages on its own URLs. Same, too, goes for the idea of bringing in infinite scrolls, which seem to pose their own kinds of unique challenges for publishers that want to keep readers engaged on their own properties, not floating away on an endless river provided by someone else.
Taboola has raised over $160 million, and Singolda said that it’s profitable and has $100 million of that funding still in the bank.
DocPlanner, the European online booking platform for healthcare appointments, has raised €15 million in Series D funding, just ten months after announcing a larger Series C round of $20 million (~€18m). Leading the round is existing investors Enern Investments, and Target Global, in addition to London-based One Peak Partners.
It brings the total raised by DocPlanner to approximately €46 million, whilst the company says it will use the new capital to open new offices in Brazil and Mexico over the next six months, and for marketing and sales in DocPlanner’s core markets in Southern Europe and Latin America.
DocPlanner operates both a consumer-facing marketplace, and cloud software for private healthcare providers, including individual doctors, dentists and other healthcare professionals (such as dietitians and psychologists), and for small and large clinics.
The medical professionals on the platform can use it to manage their professional profile, such as following and responding to reviews submitted by patients, and, crucially, take bookings through the site.
Behind the scenes, DocPlanner offers calendar management and various other clinic administration/office features, including a personal tele-assistant, and automatic appointment reminders. It claims to process 340,000 bookings per month, up from 200,000 in June last year.
At the time of the company’s Series C round, DocPlanner also announced it had merged with Spanish healthcare platform Doctoralia. The Poland-based startup has also not ruled out further acquisitions of “young, innovative cloud-based software companies” to accelerate the expansion of its SaaS capabilities “with the aim of providing more advanced solutions to doctor practices”.
Mariusz Gralewski, founder and CEO of DocPlanner, says in a statement: “We continue the process of integrating the DocPlanner and Doctoralia teams and have already developed a very coherent and well-functioning organisation with a common mission and strategy. We have been able to take the best practices and capabilities from each business to create something that is way beyond the sum of its parts.
“In addition to consolidating our presence in core markets, our goal with the new funding is to expand our offering to doctors by moving beyond the calendar management. This will also help us accomplish our global mission to ‘make the healthcare experience more human’.”
Emaar Malls missed out on a bid to buy Souq when Amazon picked up the Dubai-based online retailer for about $650 million in March. Now, the retailing giant of the Middle East is making another acquisition to step up its game in e-commerce. Today Rocket Internet — the Berlin-based e-commerce incubator — announced that it has sold 51 percent of Namshi, its Middle Eastern Amazon clone, to Emaar for $151 million.
The deal sets up an interesting competitive landscape in the region, pitting Emaar, the largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the Middle East operating properties like the Dubai Mall, against Amazon, which is now moving into grabbing more revenue and customers in the region via its acquisition of Souq.
Emaar Malls has long been looking to ramp up its presence on the web and said that it will use the new asset to expand its logistics and expand more brands to selling online.
This has also led its head, chairman Mohamed Alabbar, to make a number of other investments in recent months, such as taking a stake in logistics company Aramex; and buying a 49 percent stake in MEVP, a large VC firm based out of the Middle East. A source tells us that he is also planning to invest some $2 billion in all across a range of startups in the region, although this has yet to be confirmed.
Emaar earlier this month also acquired Dubai-based online marketplace JadoPado, and it’s also involved in a joint venture with Yoox Net-A-Porter to expand the latter company’s business into the region.
Perhaps one of Alabbar’s biggest bets has been putting $1 billion into Noon, a new soup-to-nuts e-commerce site that is meant to rival to Souq. Noon has yet to launch, though, and it’s not clear if Namshi will replace, complement, or operate completely separately from it.
(Looking at Emaar’s and Alabbar’s track record, I would not be surprised if Noon turns out to be an umbrella for everything else, or at least based on some of the acquired assets, since building something new from scratch is costly and hard at the best of times.)



“The acquisition of a majority stake in Namshi underlines our digital-driven strategy to leverage the growing e-commerce market in the Middle East and North Africa region,” said Alabbar in a statement. “Namshi offers a perfect fit for Emaar Malls in accelerating its focus on multi-channel retailing, and creating long-term value for its stakeholders.”
Rocket Internet said that it would continue to hold the remaining 49 percent as part of its larger Global Fashion Group operation — an entity it created back in 2014 to consolidate several of its many emerging market brands: Dafiti in South America, LaModa in Russia, The Iconic in Australia/New Zealand, and Zalora in South East Asia.
At its loftiest point, the GFG was valued at over $3 billion, but in 2016 it saw a massive markdown on that to around $1 billion. Today’s deal values Namshi at just over $300 million.
“We are very excited to welcome Emaar Malls as our majority shareholder,” said Hosam Arab, MD of Namshi. “We are confident that this partnership will unlock further opportunities and help accelerate the development of Namshi for the benefit of our customers. We would like to congratulate and thank our team for their tireless efforts in making Namshi the Middle East’s premier fashion ecommerce destination and we look forward to continuing this journey together with Emaar Malls and GFG.”
Namshi said that it was profitable in 2016 on revenues of 555 million UAE Dirham, equivalent to $151 million — the same as the stake Emaar is taking today. But the bigger picture is that Rocket Internet has been bleeding cash. In its last quarterly report, in April, the company reported a loss of nearly $600 million.
Unsurprisingly, to shore up cash, cut out the underperforming parts of its business, and capitalise on what has been working or is appealing to strategic investors, Rocket Internet has been gradually divesting some of its holdings in the GFG and other businesses across its portfolio.
In February, the group agreed to sell a 49 percent stake in Zalora Philippines to the Ayala Group, a conglomerate in the region. Previous to that, Alibaba took a $1 billion investment in Lazada. There are other units in the GFG also being sold off, as we’ve previously reported.
Ikea’s smart light bulbs will answer to voice commands starting this summer. The company announced in a Swedish-language press release that its smart lighting product line, called Trådfri, will work with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri and HomeKit.
Right now, Trådfri can only be controlled with a remote control or an app, but being able to integrate it into whatever digital assistant they already use in their homes makes Ikea’s smart lighting more appealing to tech-savvy people. Furthermore, as one of the largest furniture sellers in the world with 340 stores in 28 countries, Ikea has the power to introduce the concept of smart lighting to thousands of potential new users.
Ikea is notorious for its ability to lure shoppers into buying a lot more than they planned to and Trådfri’s pricing may be low enough to turn it into an impulse purchase, especially for people who are already splashing out on new furnishings and home renovations. Trådfri’s gateway, which is used to control its light bulbs, costs $29.99, about half of the Philips Hue’s $59.99 price tag, and its bulbs start from $14.99.
The retailer, which invests in tech startups through its venture arm GreenTech, also said it plans to launch more smart home products in the next few years. Because of Ikea’s presence around the world, affordability, and the broad appeal of its products, the store’s tech lineup (which currently also includes wireless chargers) can also serve as a forecaster of what in the Internet of Things will ultimately be embraced by consumers beyond just early adopters and have the potential to become as ubiquitous as Billy bookcases.
In Ikea’s announcement, Bjorn Block, the leader of Ikea Home Smart, said “With Ikea Home Smart, we are challenging everything that’s complicated and expensive with the online home. By ensuring that our products work with others on the market, we take another step to meet people’s needs and make it easier to interact with the products for the smart home.”
Unity Technologies, a 13-year-old, San Francisco-based company that makes development tools for video game creators, has raised $400 million in fresh funding from the private equity firm Silver Lake. A “big chunk” of the round went toward purchasing the shares of longtime employees and earlier investors, CEO John Riccitiello told Bloomberg earlier today, explaining that he thinks it “makes sense to let employees buy cars.”
The financing follows on the heels of the company’s last round, closed just 10 months ago, in which the company had raised $181 million from investors led by DFJ Growth.
Others of Unity’s earlier investors include China Investment Corporation, FreeS Fund, Thrive Capital, WestSummit Capital, serial entrepreneur Max Levchin, and Sequoia Capital, which remains its largest shareholder. (Roelof Botha, one of Sequoia’s most powerful investors,  sits on its board.)
Investors valued Unity at $1.5 billion last year, according to the New York Times. This new round reportedly brings the company’s valuation to $2.6 billion.
It’s easy to understand the enthusiasm around the company, whose game engine — code that handles games’ basic operations — radically speeds up the time it takes developers to produce a game.
Certainly, it boasts of a lot of very impressive metrics, among them that:  half of all new mobile games rely on its software for their creation; it powers 70 percent of all virtual reality and augmented reality experiences; its games and apps reach 2.4 billion devices quarterly; and that mobile developers using Unity’s technology generated $12.4 billion in net revenue over the last two years. (Undoubtedly, a big chunk of that derived from last year’s breakout hit Pokémon Go, which Unity somewhat famously powered.)
The company says now that the new funding will be used for what it sees next, including increasingly pervasive 3D visuals that will become more ubiquitous in our lives.
Unity does have competitors. Not one to pass up a potentially lucrative market, for example, Amazon last year introduced its own game engine called Lumberyard. Autodesk introduced its own entrant in 2015 called Stingray.
Meanwhile, Riccitiello is a rock star in the gaming industry. He previously spent five years at the helm of Electronic Arts. He was also an early investor in Oculus VR, another Unity customer.

Quiqup, a London-based delivery startup that operates a “shop on your behalf” app similar to Jinn in Europe or Postmates in the U.S., in addition to a growing B2B business, has raised £20 million in Series B funding.
Leading the round is Jobi Capital, a New York-based fund, with participation from Transmed, a leading distributor of fast-moving consumer goods, and existing investors.
The company says it plans to use the new capital to expand to other U.K. cities beyond London, and to “kick-start” international expansion.
It also will invest heavily in its tech platform, including recruiting more engineers and data scientists, to improve its algorithm. This will enable Quiqup to provide better delivery estimates and to anticipate demand patterns, co-founder and CEO Bassel El Koussa tells me.

Founded originally to let consumers order anything from its app for local same-hour delivery, and with an initial emphasis on food, Quiqup has since expanded its proposition to become vertical agnostic and to providing last-mile delivery to businesses, too.
The B2B offering takes the form of “Quiqdash,” a web app that allows smaller retailers to instantly order or schedule a delivery, or a full API integration service that incorporates Quiqup’s delivery service into large retailers’ e-commerce solutions.
The latter is currently being used by 25 or so Burger King restaurants in London as one of a number of delivery companies powering the takeout giant’s online ordering and delivery option.
Quiqup has also partnered with Whole Foods in London to be their sole online ordering option via the Quiqup app, as well as ventured into non-food verticals such as independent florists and pharmacists.
El Koussa says that the B2B side of the business now makes up around 45 percent, up from 40 percent in January. He also says there are a number of other partnerships with large retailers that he is unable to disclose at this point in time.
Adds the Quiqup founder in a statement: “As consumer expectations change, retailers of all sizes and verticals will be expected to offer flexible, efficient, and affordable delivery services. Time is a precious commodity for today’s consumer and Quiqup was created to help people make more time for what they enjoy most. Today’s investment brings us one step closer to our goal of bringing on-demand delivery to the mass market, and we’re thrilled to have Jobi and Transmed join us on this venture, as well as to have the continued support of our existing investors.”
Meanwhile, Quiqup says that since launch it has experienced 170 percent growth year-on-year — as meaningless as a percentage metric is — and has delivered more than 550,000 orders. The startup has a headcount of more than 110 employees, and more than 2,000 self-employed couriers, dubbed “Quiqees,” have signed up since the company was started.
As a reference point, consumer rival Jinn recently announced that it has surpassed 1 million completed deliveries since launching in late 2014. It also disclosed that 5,000 couriers are registered with the Jinn app and about 1,000 are active on a monthly basis.
Another high-up person at Uber has left the company. Jim Callaghan, Uber’s general counsel for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, recently stepped down, Recode reports.
His departure, which an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch is due to personal reasons, is the latest in a series of departures at Uber this year. In the last few months, Uber has also lost its VP of global vehicle programs, head of comms, president, head of AI Labs, VP of growth and SVP of engineering.
Callaghan’s departure comes a couple of days after Uber decided to promote Salle Yoo from general counsel to chief legal officer. Uber is actively looking for a new general counsel, who will report to Yoo once they come on board.
I’ve reached out to Uber and will update this story if I hear back.

Netherlands-based Minibrew has raised $2.8 million in seed funding after completing a successful $350,000 crowdfunding campaign to bring some smarts to the home-brew process.
The Minibrew is a little keg with a big brain. When we first met the company in 2015 they offered a whiff of high-tech to the brewing process, adding a monitored brew vessel and mobile app to the age-old technique of slopping a bunch of wheat, yeast and hops together until something tasty came out. Founders Bart van de Kooij and Olivier van Oord have partnered with multiple international breweries to offer recipes for the machine, and they plan on shipping the final product in Q1 2018.
The team is proud to be able to offer full control from wort to bottling.
“In terms of brewing machines that claim to deliver beer, such as ‘fully automated home brewery’ they both forget a critical step: fermenting,” said van de Kooij. “Although the others have a fermentation process, it is manual and not automatic as promoted. This might work for some who have knowledge and want to play with fermentation time and carbonation levels, but the brew quality will ultimately suffer in flavor and users will not be able to reproduce the same brew again.”
“We stumbled on the idea through experimenting a lot with brewing our own beers while working. We were seeing a massive upswing in do-it-yourself brewing, but discovered actually creating accurate and replicable beers was quite hard,” he said. “The current players out there were not fulfilling a user-experience to make quality beer. We thought it was time to change the beer space and bring the fun of discovering great taste back to get everyone into brewing.”
The system is also now far more automated and the team has slashed the price from a heady, hoppy €2,000 to €999, a welcome change. The kit can create multiple styles of beer, including wheat and IPA. The best thing? The kit turns into a portable keg once you’re done with the fermentation process.
Is $1,000 for an automatic keg still too expensive for you? Why not try simply carbonating some water and adding a little flavorless vodka to create Bud Light on the cheap? Home brewing, as they say, is easy!

It wasn’t very long ago that bitcoin felt nascent, laughable and small. In the ensuing years, bitcoin has matured, become far less risible and grown massively.
Underscoring bitcoin’s maturation, the currency set new price records this week as the value of a single coin crossed the $2,000 threshold. Since bitcoin was announced in 2009, and certainly since I first wrote about it in 2013, the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies has exploded.
Cryptocurrencies have expanded since the days bitcoin shared some of the media’s spotlight with litecoin and the silly-by-design dogecoin. It was a time when Mt. Gox ruled, cupcake shops could become media darlings by accepting the digital currency and pizza was a critical bitcoin-pricing metric.
Now, there are dozens of cryptocurrencies worth eight figures, and the birth pace of new entrants is accelerating.

In that particular milieu of freshly launched coins is a newly famous transaction type we need to understand called the “Initial Coin Offering” or ICO. An ICO is akin to an IPO, but in temporal reverse (sort of). Although confusing, it has recently acquired prominence as a favored way to launch a new cryptocurrency.
But as is typical of nascent cryptoproducts, there are legal questions and unethical players in the mix. So let’s explore what an ICO is in the current cryptocurrency market.
ICO basics
An ICO is a fundraising tool that trades future cryptocoins in exchange for cryptocurrencies of immediate, liquid value. You give the ICO bitcoin or ethereum, and you get some of Billy’s New Super Great Coin or the infamous CrunchCoin.
The Financial Times calls ICOs “unregulated issuances of cryptocoins where investors can raise money in bitcoin or other [cryptocurrencies],” which is accurate, especially if you underline the word “unregulated.” We’ll get to that in a moment.
Sticking close to the older financial publications, The Economist also took a look at the financing mechanism, describing what you buy in an ICO in the following fashion:
ICO “coins” are essentially digital coupons, tokens issued on an indelible distributed ledger, or blockchain, of the kind that underpins bitcoin, a crypto-currency. That means they can easily be traded, although unlike shares they do not confer ownership rights. […] Investors hope that successful projects will cause tokens’ value to rise.
The referenced value increase is critical to understanding the appeal of ICOs. These are not transactions of love. They are investments made in hopes of quick, strong returns..text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

Notably, not all ICOs are for cryptos that will maintain their own blockchain. According to the crypto-focused Smith + Crown research group, some ICOs are actually “launching ‘meta-tokens’ built on Ethereum, Bitcoin, NXT or others.”
After all, why not.
So ICOs can be coins on top of coins funded by the transfer of other cryptos to accounts in the hunt for what’s next. That might sound crazy, but it’s hot times in the crypto world.
And that heat is keeping ICOs bubbling. The same Economist piece, published in April of 2017, notes: “[n]early $250m has already been invested in [ICOs], of which $107m alone has flowed in this year,” a metric that it attributes to the aforementioned Smith + Crown.
That is a lot of money, making ICOs large in terms of their sheer dollar-scale. It’s therefore not hard to understand why more traditional business publications are paying attention. Following the money is their jam.
In short: ICOs are the new funding slingshot by which nascent cryptos are flung into the world.

Thieves, lies and laws
As with any boom, there are bad actors to be found in the land of ICOs. Given bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency world’s deep tradition of enduring bad behavior, it is not a surprise that ICOs are attracting humans of base intent.
ICO fraud and skullduggery is common enough that a quick search yields heart-melting headlines like “Ver Backed Qtum Founder Ran Previous ICO Scam,”  “To everyone that bought into the Matchpool ICO, it looks like it was maybe a scam…,” and “A Digital Currency Scam is Misusing the Rothschild Family Name.” All of the articles are from this year to date.
In the world of ICOs, fraud is never hard to find. Add in regular sums of incompetence that any new venture could fall prey to, and ICOs feel a bit Old West.
Laws
But what about regulation, you reasonably protest. Surely that must exist to protect consumers?
Returning to Smith + Crown, skirting usual rules concerning fundraising is nearly normal in the realm of ICOs — at least partially explaining why guard rails in crypto offerings may remain a homegrown affair:
Most ICOs today are marketed as ‘software presale tokens’ akin to giving early access to an online game to early supporters. In order to try to avoid legal requirements that come with any form of a security sale, many ICOs today use language such as ‘crowdsale’ or ‘donation’ instead of ICOs.
So regulation is out of the mix for now.
There is an argument to be made that a dearth of regulatory oversight is actually good, as it allows the ICO market to iterate and innovate quickly. It is a reasonable(ish) argument and likely technically correct, but that doesn’t mitigate the potential for unsophisticated investors to be preyed upon.
Caveat emptor and moral hazard are fine arguments in favor of no rules regarding ICOs and cryptos, but if the market wants to keep growing, it will need to do more to attract consistently larger pools of capital.
Bubble me this
Is there a chance that ICOs will slow? Of course, but the forces behind them run a bit deeper than we might have first guessed.
CryptoHustle makes the related point in a recent article that “ICO mania is likely due to early Ethereum adopters making serious returns after the last bull run.” Etherum’s run has certainly been staggering. If it is fueling the ICO craze, we could be in for a long cycle.
Regardless, the point doesn’t mean that cryptomarkets are as they should be. That ICOs would eventually get ahead of themselves and bubble like so many young technology niches was predicted at least since last October. How long the good times will last isn’t obvious. But the correction will come, as always, and when it does, we’ll see which cryptos have a real shot.
Take this away
The cryptocurrency market is hot once again. And while it continues to set new records, a host of altcoins will demand its slice of the market.

Then again, crowdfunding has similar risks and seems perfectly healthy. Your call.

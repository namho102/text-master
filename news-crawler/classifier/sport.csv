"There are ways of measuring competitiveness in sportspeople The most effective is getting them to play a sport that is not their vocation For the England cricketer Jenny Gunn, that sport is football",3
"She played for Notts County and was even called for England trials, only for cricket to put a fork in both at the age of 17 She has ambitions to play Sunday league when she calls time on a career that, so far, has given her 13 years at international level",2
" When Mark Robinson took over as England head coach at the end of 2015, he reinstated football to the warm-ups The squad, multi-sported, were thrilled Not Gunn",3
"Oh, it was ridiculous, she shouts Theres a no tackling rule How are we supposed to get the ball? You end up backing off and allowing them time and space You know what  Id rather not play My dad taught me: You go hard or go home",5
" Thats what his coach taught him Go into every tackle like you meant itHer father, by the way, is Bryn Gunn, a retired professional footballer who played more than 100 times for Nottingham Forest, winning the 1980 European Cup That coach? Brian Clough She spends the next 10-minutes doing her best Cloughie impression: laying into referees and mourning the modern game",5
"Its a passion at odds with Gunns humble demeanour: one that forms the foundation of 132 ODI, 95 T20I and 11 Test caps",1
" She sneaked to the top of the English one-day international wicket-takers list with 123 at an average 27 All with little fanfare Typically, she wants nothing to do with it: Oh, dont pay too much attention to that, she says Katherine Brunts only four away from beating me She deserves it",5
" The former England coach Mark Lane put it best on Gunn, a low-maintenance, uncomplicated individual: She has her tea at teatimeYet Lane also marked Gunn as his luxury player: a bowler of yorkers, a batter with a breezy cameo in the chamber and a gifted fielder",2
" During Lanes tenure, one of English crickets most successful, Gunn was his vice-captain",1
" In 2014, she was appointed MBE for services to cricket That she is preparing for her fourth World Cup, aged 31, is a testament to the wedding of natural aptitude and grit that doesnt lie far from the surfaceOver the last year, she has lost long-term team-mates in Charlotte Edwards and Lydia Greenway",3
" Surely Gunn was worried she was next? Oh yeah, theres always going to be that thought when a new coach comes in, she acknowledges Especially coming in from the mens game You dont really know what his views are But we sat down as a team early on and Robbo put my mind at ease with something he said: Ive got nothing about age If you can do it, youre old or young enough",5
" That relaxes you a bit And on top of other changes, you realise you belong and you can challenge yourself to get better",2
"Now she is craftier with the ball, variations plentiful and execution of slower balls at such a level that Robinson calls her a world-class spinner Tongue in cheek, sure, but a clear sign of endearmentShe laughs it off  People seem to love telling me how slow I am  but appreciates the sentiment",3
" She has been called worseAt the end of her England debut in 2004, in South Africa, Gunn was called into the umpires office You chuck it, said one of the officials",3
" Five years later, she was called while playing in Perth and banned from bowling in domestic cricket",1
"It is the timing of that call, months before the 2009 World Cup in Australia, in which the hosts biggest rivals were England, that Gunn finds suspicious: I think they were doing it to unsettle me",1
" And us as a side I really believe thatShe was allowed to bowl in the World Cup, provided she was not called while playing for England in the warm-ups",3
" As fate would have it, the same umpire that called Gunn was standing for their final game before the tournament As a result, she did not bowl that day and went on to take five wickets at an economy rate of 3",2
82 in Englands successful campaignWhen Gunn became the first woman accepted into the Nottinghamshire academy (she now plays for Warwickshire) most of her time off the field was spent as a lab rat To correct a quirk where her right arm comes out before coming past her ear  rather than the conventional wheel-like motion of most bowlers  she was ordered by coaches to run through the academy corridors and simulate bowling while pressed up against the wall,3
" This, they believe, would stop her arm from moving out It did not work",2
" It was the stupidest thing, she says In a normal situation, the walls obviously not there, is it? Great idea that wasWhen she was called in 2012 (then cleared within two months) she underwent tests at Loughborough and the University of Western Australia  an institution that has saved the careers of many, including Muttiah Muralitharan  carried out alongside match footage to ensure she was bowling completely",3
" It found that Gunns right-arm hyper-extended by 14 degrees Coupled with her initial outward movement, it gave the illusion of chucking",2
" The greatest flex in her action  when she bowls a rare bouncer  is 10 degrees, comfortably below the ICCs limit of 15At first it really gets to you, she freely concedes",2
" I mean, I couldnt change But after being tested I know Im nowhere near The footage of me bowling in super slow-mo, it makes me sick when I see my arm go back",3
"It doesnt bother me at all now, even when the crowd shout no ball Sarah Taylor always calls me Chucky",2
" Danielle Hazell has a go at me for wearing long sleeves, saying: All chuckers wear them",1
"Gunn accepts she will hear it more this summer from opposition fans and pundits alike You would think this down-to-earth, retiring type would be bothered Shes not",3
" It just makes me laugh, though If theyre doing that, I know Im one up on them",2
Englands women have taken over as the worlds top-ranked team following a convincing and fully deserved triumph over the Black Ferns,1
" The Red Rose forwards laid the foundations of a famous win, only Englands second over their opponents on Kiwi soil, which bodes well for the forthcoming womens World Cup to be held in Ireland in August",1
"Englands haul of five tries on a damp, murky evening at the same venue as the Lions fixture against the Maori was a fitting reward for a dominant effort up front",1
" Three of the scores were the product of rolling mauls to which the hosts had no real answer At least one touring team has cracked the secret of winning a major Test match in New ZealandIt was the Red Roses who seized the early initiative with a well-taken try from the centre Emily Scarratt in the left corner with barely two minutes gone The captain, Sarah Hunter, was a constant energising force from No8 and the home side found it hard throughout to establish any kind of territorial pressureGiven the opportunity to attack from long range, however, the Black Ferns are frequently as deadly as their male counterparts",5
 A gloriously skilful chip and chase score from their talented scrum-half Kendra Cocksedge levelled the scores before the pacy Portia Woodman intercepted an attempted pass from Scarratt to outsprint the retreating cover from 60 metres,1
"Remarkably, New Zealand could not score any further points until the 78th minute of the game as England took increasing control, thanks partly to their shrewd kicking game Abbie Scott was duly credited with the first of Englands close-range tries but, with the scores level at 14-14 at half-time, it was a contest still awaiting a decisive intervention",2
A key moment arrived within three minutes of the restart when a well-worked lineout move resulted in Katy McLean putting Lydia Thompson over in the right corner The all-action Marlie Packer soon claimed a fourth score before replacement Vicky Fleetwood touched down beneath a heap of bodies to record Englands fifth try,2
"New Zealand did claim a late consolation but could not prevent England securing their first victory anywhere in this fixture since 2012 A delighted Hunter revealed the forwards had talked before the game about emulating Englands men, who beat the All Blacks in New Zealand in 2003 prior to lifting the World Cup later that same year",2
" Were by no means the finished article but it does send a statement and well take confidence from coming to such a tough place and winning, said Hunter Everyone did their job from numbers one to 23",2
"Hunters own performance drew particular praise from Englands head coach, Simon Middleton, whose side have also defeated Australia and Canada in this months international series as they prepare to defend their World Cup title Shes a fantastic captain and a fantastic player, said Middleton",2
 Thats why shes world player of the year Were really happy and very proud,2

"Scotland consigned the Wallabies to a humbling 24-19 Test defeat in Sydney in front of a stunned crowd of 30,721 fans at Allianz Stadium who watched the visitors avenge two heartbreaking one-point losses to Australia in the past two years with a stirring victoryIsrael Folaus second tryscoring double in as many weeks couldnt save the Wallabies, as Scotland confirmed their status as world rugbys big improvers",2
" Up to fifth in the rankings, the Scots cashed in on a disjointed display from Michael Cheikas men",1
"As playmaker Bernard Foley admitted, the Wallabies were their own worst enemies during a dreadful first half",1
" They trailed 17-12 at the break, gifting the Scots all of their points through an early penalty goal, then an intercept try to centre Duncan Taylor and a charge-down effort from goalkicking five-eighth Finn RussellOnly Folaus two strikes kept the Wallabies in the contest Foley set both of them up for his NSW Waratahs team-mate either side of a stint in the sin bin for a late hit on Russell when Scotlands inspirational No10 broke free with some innovative counter-attack from his own quarterFirst, Foley found Folau with a long ball in one of the Wallabies rare forays deep in Scotland territory Then, on the stroke of half-time, Folau soared high above Scotland fullback Gordon Reid to reel in Foleys pinpoint crossfield kick to give the Wallabies momentum heading into the second section",5
"But despite being a man down with No8 Ryan Wilson yellow-carded a minute before half-time, the Scots refused to yield until Australia briefly snatched the lead in the 57th minute",1
" Foleys successful conversion of a desperate dive-over try from Will Genia earned the Wallabies a 19-17 advantageBut, a 50-metre try three minutes later to flanker Hamish Watson restored the visitors five-point lead and, despite several opportunities, the Wallabies were unable to find a reply to give Foley another chance to break Scottish heartsLast-gasp penalty goals from Foley had denied the Scots at the 2015 Rugby World Cup at Twickenham and again on the Wallabies spring tour last November",3
"After a moment of magic against South Africa from Zach Mercer, the captain, booked England Under-20s place in Sundays Junior World Cup final in Tbilisi, comparisons with their football counterparts were inevitable  they were not, however, wholly accurate Englands football team winning any form of World Cup understandably commands attention but this is a fifth final in a row for a side who set out without five players away with Eddie Joness senior side in ArgentinaOval ball success is sustained by England at this level and, while a rampant New Zealand stand between them and a fourth title in five years, the number of absentees makes their achievement of reaching the final in Georgia all the more impressive",3
" Mercers omission by Jones for the Argentina tour was surprising but the Australian still took with him Tom and Ben Curry, Nick Isiekwe, Joe Cokanasiga and Jack Maunder England have also suffered six injuries to their backs during the tournament in Georgia while Will Evans and Jamie Shillcock were ruled out before it startedIts that context that makes the achievement of this group such a significant one, says Dean Ryan, who took up the role of the Rugby Football Unions head of international player development last July",3
" Its that backdrop that makes it so significant Under-20 World Cups are normally framed around three or four key individuals, not a collective, but the collective of this group has been a huge success",2
" Against New Zealand, who unsurprisingly have a lot of very good individuals, this side has to be tactically very good and very collective but they have been all the way through",1
"After the footballers success, it was widely lamented that the pathway for those players to shine at senior level does not exist and while Ryan acknowledges it is also a problem within rugby, he points to the breakthrough of Tom Curry, Isiekwe and Maunder in Argentina as success storiesWatching Tom Curry last week was tremendous for us and the team here",2
" To watch him win his first cap, to watch Nick Isiekwe come on and win a lineout, Jack Maunder fire it along for [Denny] Solomona to score [the winning try]  thats fantastic for these lads because they can think: Thats how close we are",1
 Credit to Eddie for taking those playersPotentially jeopardising the current blueprint for success is a move by the Premiership to expand its A League rather than continue to send youngsters on loan to Championship clubs where they can cut their teeth against seasoned senior players,2
 The RFU is reportedly against the idea and Ryan is not convinced A League expansion is the answer,1
"Having a clear playing programme for this group is key, he says A lot of our guys have not played a huge amount of rugby prior to this World Cup The best of them are playing in the Premiership, thats great",3
 But what are the next group doing and where do they play regularly? Its obvious that some of the deficiencies is lack of game time,1
A second tier needs a combination of young and senior players You have to find something that combines that,2
" Any tournament format has to fulfil that There are times that the A League can do that, there are times that it cant",2
 The combination is key,1
"Back in the intensely hot summer of 2005, India and Pakistan played a six-match ODI series that wound its way from Kochi in the deep south to Jamshedpur in the east, before finishing in New Delhi via the western outpost of Ahmedabad With India 2-0 up in the series, Osman Samiuddin, whose The Unquiet Ones is the definitive work on Pakistans cricket history, and I took the train from Visakhapatnam to Jamshedpur",2
"One of our fellow travellers was a former India cricketer After a while, seeing the myriad emotions darting across Osmans face, he sighed and said: Go ahead, you can ask me",2
" Everyone does anyway That man was Chetan Sharma, whose decade-long career included 23 Tests, 65 ODIs, a 10-wicket haul at Edgbaston and a whirlwind ODI hundred against EnglandBut a decade after he quit the game, Sharma was remembered on the subcontinent and by fans in the diaspora for just one ball, to Javed Miandad in the Austral-Asia Cup final in Sharjah on 18 April 1986",3
" Miandad had navigated a tricky chase with some aplomb, whittling down the equation to four needed off the last ball",1
"Sharma tried for the yorker but could not land it Miandad smeared the knee-high full toss over midwicket for six, levelling the head-to-head ODI record between the two countries at eight wins apieceAt the time It was just one shot but, as the years passed, it became a festering wound in the psyche of Indian cricketers",3
" Matches against Pakistan were invariably lost, especially when they were finals played in the Middle East in front of capacity Friday crowdsIt took India nearly two decades to inter that particular ghost",2
" In March 2004, with cricket diplomacy taking centre stage, they set off on a first full tour of Pakistan in 15 years By then, the head-to-head record had skewed to 52-30 in Pakistans favour",2
" In an opening game at Karachis National Stadium, watched by millions across the globe, India piled up 349",1
" With a ball to go, Pakistan needed six to pull off the most incredible of victoriesIn one of those delicious ironies that sport often throws up, Miandad was Pakistans coach, watching like a cat ready to pounce from the dressing-room balcony",2
" But Moin Khan, the wicketkeeper who faced the final ball from Ashish Nehra, was no Miandad His wild heave did not even clear the infield In the years since, India have won 21 matches to Pakistans 20",3
"On these very pages, in the days before that 2004 series, the late Mike Marqusee had written: Cricket, like other mass spectator sports, is a magnet for meanings, a malleable metaphor And in the past, cricket between India and Pakistan has served as both a symbol of south Asian harmony and a prime example of what George Orwell called war minus the shooting",2
"The key words here are the past After the relative detente of the early years of this century, political ties have been Arctic frosty over the last decade Cricket, once seen as a builder of bridges between the two countries, is now hostage to political agendas on both sides, and there has been just one bilateral series  three ODIs in India in 2012-13  since Pakistan came to India in late 2007",3
"The current generation of cricketers has not played each other often enough to become steeped in the rivalry, or to form the sort of friendships that existed at a time when cricket showed the wayThis decade, India and Pakistan have contested just 10 ODIs (India lead 7-3) and six Twenty20 internationals  the majority of them in multi-nation tournaments such as the World Cup and Champions Trophy",2
"More than three decades ago, administrators NKP Salve, Jagmohan Dalmiya and Nur Khan fought the established order to move the World Cup out of England for the first time",1
" The dream was that India and Pakistan would contest the 1987 final at Eden Gardens in KolkataBoth teams duly topped their groups but Craig McDermotts five for 44 for Australia in Lahore and Graham Goochs 115 in Mumbai sent Imran Khan into a darkened room and a subcontinent into depressionGoing back to the World Championship of Cricket, hosted by Australia in 1985, India and Pakistan have met 12 times in 50-over tournaments featuring each of the worlds leading sides",3
" While the overall record stands at 72-52 in Pakistans favour, it is 10-2 to India in the games that matter, including 6-0 at the World CupOver the years, that statistic has come to have the same effect on Pakistani cricketers and fans as the Miandad six once did on Indians But having made the final against all odds, Pakistan, revitalised by the feisty leadership of Sarfraz Ahmed, have the look of destinys children",3
" Against a Virat Kohli-led India, who have the happy knack of finding ways to win marquee matches, they will hope that it is the spirit of Miandad, rather than the ghost of Sharma, that influences their performance",1
"Dileep Premachandran was editor-in-chief of Wisden IndiaI have always been interested in fighting sports I grew up obsessed with WWE, Fight Club is my favourite film and I remember watching Holyfield v Tyson, aged seven But, until savate (pronounced savat), I had never done so much as a kickboxing class",3
"I stumbled on savate by accident At the start of 2016, I had a lifestyle overhaul, gave up alcohol and cigarettes and started running more Soon, running wasnt enough",3
 I searched for kickboxing classes in my area and found the London savate club I had never heard of it The site called it an elegant kickboxing sport from France,3
 Kickboxing? Elegant? I was intriguedSavate combines French kicks  such as a fouett (a whip or roundhouse kick)  with English boxing,2
" There are two types of competition: combat and assaut Combat savate is full contact, in which you are looking to knock out your opponent In assaut savate, the kind practised in most UK clubs, excessive force is forbidden Yes, you aim to kick and punch your opponent, but you dont try to knock their head off, only to make contact You score points for touches and the winner is the fighter who demonstrates the best technique and control",5
 Not fearing for my face means I can think more strategically to anticipate my opponents attacks and work out how to counter them,1
" It is in equal parts a mental and a physical workoutThe fights range from three 15-minute rounds up to five two-minute rounds, with a minutes rest between rounds",3
" I was nervous at first, but when nervous energy mixes with adrenaline and becomes an exciting, fast-paced and challenging bout, it makes me want to come back for more",1
"Savate has given me some incredible opportunities In the past year, Ive passed my blue and green glove gradings, travelled to Ireland and Hungary for competitions, become a British vice-champion and joined the GB squad All without getting a single black eye",3
"How often do you train? I train twice a week, run twice a week and fit in a weights session if I can",1
 Favourite move? Fouett figure  a lovely French way of saying a kick to the head,1
"1 Find an authentic savate club Many martial artists put savate on their CV, but fewer have trained with bone fide practitioners or have ever got into the ring The Great Britain Savate Federation lists clubs with qualified instructors at savateorguk",5
2 Dont worry about being fit and flexible before starting Well-run beginner classes wont expect you to be Bruce Lee on your first night,2
 Training makes you fitter  it doesnt presuppose fitness3 Get in touch with a local savate club about watching a class to see what it is all about,2
"4 Boots are the most important piece of kit The word savate refers to the boot worn by practitioners of old It is hard to get hold of genuine savate boots in the UK, but a boxing boot without jagged edges or rough soles is similar",3
"5 Dont worry about getting your head smashed in on your first night Savate is a contact sport, but a good club wont ask you to spar until you are ready",2
"James Southwood, founder of London savate club and 2014 world championDespite only four wins, a poor percentage and three ordinary quarters against St Kilda, North Melbourne coach Brad Scott is still talking AFL finalsNorth managed only four goals in the first three quarters against the Saints on Friday night and Scott lamented they were never really in the hunt",2
"The 17-point loss, on the night they honoured club legend Brent Harvey pre-game, left the Kangaroos languishing with a 4-8 record and a percentage well under 100But they also remain just two games outside the top eight, in a year when upset results are rife",2
Its a strange season ,1
" well continue to play to win, Scott saidWere still in that group of a number of teams who still have genuine hope to play in September and thats our ambition from this point on",3
"So well keep trying to play footy thats capable of beating sides in September and well keep picking the team to win games to get enough wins to try and competeScott said the final score flattered North and they paid dearly for too many basic errors, adding they will change their training routine to work more on their skillsOne positive was second-gamer Declan Mountford, who put everything into his tag on Saints star Jack Steven and kept him quiet for much of the first half",3
"While Steven went forward late in the second term and kicked two goals, Mountford earned a big tick from Scott for his performance",1
"Scott was also pleased for ruckman Todd Goldstein, who was high among Norths best after a run of below-par formDespite failing to finish the Kangaroos off in the final term on Friday, St Kilda coach Alan Richardson was rapt with the performance",2
"They led by 42 points midway through the last quarter, but took the foot off Norths throatThe Roos kicked the last four goals to restore some respectability after only kicking that many up to three-quarter timeBut the 12",3
"17 (89)-1012 (72) win broke StKildas three-game losing streak and Richardson noted that, including the bye, they had gone a month without winningI was really proud of them, the fact they were able to play in that sort of manner, he said",3
"Our focus was not necessarily about getting our season back on track, that was an outcome of playing good footy",1
"What does our good footy look like? What does it mean for you as an individual? I reckon they had real clarity around thatNow we didnt get it done in the last quarter, but there were three quarters of positive footy, the way we want to play ",3
" theyll get belief from thatThe Saints are not yet out of trouble, but at 6-6 they remain in the top-eight hunt",2
"We definitely need to improve, theres no doubt about that, but it was a step towards getting our footy back and that was pleasing, Richardson said",1
"Veterans Leigh Montagna and Nick Riewoldt played key roles after having plenty of focus on them during the weekMontagna was nonplussed after commentator Dermott Brereton took aim at his form, while Riewoldt returned from two games out with a knee injury",2
"There is also ongoing talk about whether the former captain should keep playing beyond this seasonMontagna had a solid game off half-back, while Riewoldt was relentless with his hard runningAt the risk of sounding like a horse trainer, I think hell be better for the run, Richardson said of RiewoldtThe match review panel will look at an incident where Riewoldt lashed out in retaliation at Norths Scott Thompson and hit him across the back, but the Saints star should avoid suspensionIf Rory McIlroy was a racehorse, there would have been no logic at all in ranking him among the favourites for an event of equivalent significance to the US Open",5
" As golfs version of a performer who is lightly raced, McIlroy arrived at Erin Hills having played only 22 competitive rounds in 2017That figure increased by only two, McIlroys second-round 71 in the second major of 2017 proving insufficient to improve the damage caused by an opening round of 78",2
" McIlroy at least departed in reasonable spirits, his run of four birdies in six closing holes providing a glance back towards what the four-time major champion is capable ofIn practice I was really good, McIlroy said",2
 You play 54 holes around here before the tournament; I felt really comfortable,1
" I drove the ball well, my irons were good Everything was in good shape But you never really know until you put a card in your hand and youre under the gun a little bitRickie Fowler encountered pressure of his own, the first-round leader having reached the 11th on Friday without having dropped a shot in the tournament Fowler promptly bogeyed three holes in a row",5
" At six under, he is one from the halfway lead as held by four players Two of that group, Paul Casey and Tommy Fleetwood, are English; Brooks Koepka and Brian Harman complete the quartet Caseys prominence is remarkable given the eight he posted at the 14th in round twoThe investigative skills of Quincy are hardly necessary when determining why McIlroy missed a second US Open cut in succession This tournament has not been altogether kind to McIlroy aside from the 2011 occasion when he won it, let alone when the buildup was disrupted by fitness troubles",5
" The rib problem that upset his opening to the year provides perfect explanation for the appearance of rust at Erin Hills The equipment switch that was triggered by Nikes withdrawal from the market also inevitably adds an element of upheaval that McIlroy would ideally have done without These matters are all intrinsically linked; only by featuring at the business end of events can McIlroy perfectly attune himself to what new tools he has at his disposal, just as history shows he benefits from the confidence acquired from the very same scenarios",3
" McIlroy relishes the momentum he has thus far been denied for reasons beyond his controlIve been very light on competitive rounds, McIlroy said I think at this point in time I just need to play",3
" And I feel, even though its very disappointing to not be here on the weekend, these last two rounds will serve me well going into the summer Yesterday, coming off an injury, I was a little anxious going out there",2
" I got off to a good start but it sort of caught up with me as the round went on I think the more rounds I can play, Im hopefully going to get rid of all that stuff and hopefully strip it down to what you saw the last six holesHere is another reason for McIlroy cheer; no other player among the worlds leading group has recently embarked on a profitable run",3
 The 28-year-old is hardly lagging behind in a wider contextThe next part of the season is key for him,2
" Next weeks Travellers Championship begins a stretch of six events in eight weeks, including two major championships and one, the US PGA Championship, at the Quail Hollow venue he has previous for pulling apart Should success arrive within this period, the frustrations of the first part of 2017 will be readily forgotten Even when the major season concludes, McIlroy will not lack focus in respect of defending the FedEx Cup",3
"Im just excited to get a run of golf now, he added",1
" Im optimistic with where my game is Hopefully Ive got a lot of the bad stuff out of my system yesterday and some parts today And again, its just a matter of getting competitive rounds under my belt",3
 Im playing next week in Connecticut Ive got a nice run leading up to the Open Championship,2
" Ive got a busy summer, so Im excited to play a lot of golf I feel like thats going to help me to get back into contention and try to win some of these things",2
" Im hungry but Im not going to force it Im going to let it happen Im going to play The worst thing I can do is go and force it because thats not my gameThe key McIlroy problem on Friday was on the greens, leading to inevitable comment regarding his switch to a new putter in recent days",5
" I didnt think it was the putterIt was the guy on the end of it, he said Jason Day also failed to survive for the closing 36 holes Yet there was contrasting sentiment from the Australian Day was bemused by an aggregate of 10 over par",5
" I felt the most calm I have in a major in a long time this week, said Day after his 75 Unfortunately this didnt pan out The golf course is beautiful",3
" I just didnt executeLate on Friday, the world No1 Dustin Johnson completed a high-profile exodus from Wisconsin Johnson added a 73 to his Thursday 75, thereby missing the cut by three",3
" Only three months ago, an imperious Johnson appeared unbeatable He has since missed the Masters through a freak accident and, via different circumstances, now been forced to watch another major weekend on television I couldnt have shot any higher, Johnson said",3
 I couldnt possibly shoot any higher than I did I just struggled on the greens Its simple,3
"As McIlroy, Johnson and Day exited, Casey kept his dream of a first major win alive Its not every day you can enjoy a round with an eight on the card but Im a happy man, Casey said Casey has recorded three consecutive top-six finishes in the Masters but has only one top-10 in the US Open in 13 attempts, which came a decade ago at OakmontIt feels good, the 39-year-old said It shows what can happen if you get out of position on this course",5
 Even just trying to take my medicine is very difficult Its a good eight in the endAustralias Adam Scott also failed to progress to the weekend,3
"If Sir Michael Stoute were in better form, Id be tempted to accuse him of attempted robbery, running a proper Group horse like Thikriyaat (255) in a mere Listed contest at York today But in fairness to the Newmarket trainer, winners have not exactly been tumbling out of his yard in recent weeks; lets hope this proves a timely fillip for him ahead of Royal Ascot",3
"Ribchester was the only horse to beat Thikriyaat in his first five races, which also included a Group Three success at Glorious Goodwood He had a fibrillating heart when well beaten on his final run last season and surely needed his return to action in a handicapThere is more to come from him at the age of four and this return to a sound surface will help",3
1,1
"50 York Hurdling did not work out for the ex-Italian Azari but a return to Flat racing showed him in a pretty good light in a Wolverhampton claimer the other day Having since moved from Paul Nicholls to Tom Dascombe, he looks like he belongs at this level and has one of the better riders involved",2
2,1
"05 Musselburgh The handicapper is probably right to rate Zac Brown a better horse on sand than on turf but he still has possibilities on grass, as he showed when winning at Goodwood last time Charlie Walliss gelding faces a stiffer task here but could be up to beating the penalty2",3
"20 York Shady McCoy is of interest, now that hes back in a big field, but a wide draw is no help Heavens Guest also loves a big-field handicap and has dropped to an enticing mark His most recent effort hinted he might be on the way back and he went close from 9lb higher over this course and distance in May last year",3
"240 Sandown Tim Easterbys team seem to be running their way into form and this doesnt feel like the time to desert his Copper Knight, the winner of his last two starts He made all to defy a mark of 95 in a York handicap last time and it seems a gelding operation has made quite a difference to this one, a flop in last years Windsor Castle when with Hugo Palmer",3

10 Majestic StoneThe British & Irish Lions have called up six replacements to join the tour party in New Zealand as cover for their final midweek fixtures The players  four Welsh and two Scots  will help to bolster the bench against the Chiefs in Waikato on Tuesday,2
" That will allow the coachs first-choice 23 to prepare properly for next Saturdays first Test against New ZealandWarren Gatland indicated as long ago as September he was considering calling up additional players and has decided to move before this weekends Test matches involving the home unions are completed The choices of the scrum-half Gareth Davies, the lock Cory Hill, the tight-head prop Tomas Francis, the hooker Kristian Dacey, and Scotlands centre Finn Russell and prop Allan Dell have, however, received some criticism from the England coach, Eddie JonesWith the suggestion that the Lions calls have been influenced by geography  Wales and Scotland are currently in Australasia, while England are in Argentina  Jones told the BBC: My only comment would be I would like to see it picked on merit rather than geographical proximityWith Stuart Hogg invalided out of the tour and with Owen Farrell and Courtney Lawes unavailable, the Lions would otherwise have had to ask several of their potential Test 23 to double up next week, had they stuck with only their existing tour members",5
"Several replacements were also summoned in the later stages of the 2013 tour, with one of them, Alex Corbisiero, going on to score a try in the decisive third Test win against Australia in Sydney In addition to the game against the Chiefs in Hamilton, the Lions are due to face the Hurricanes in Wellington between the first and second TestsAny suggestion an influx of new players will merely widen an existing split between Test players and the rest of the squad, however, has been flatly denied Steve Hansen, the All Blacks coach, said this week he felt the touring team had already divided into midweek and Saturday sides but the Saracens lock George Kruis insists that perception is false Hes entitled to his opinion and hes obviously a well-respected coach but he doesnt know whats going on inside the camp, Kruis said",5
 He can have his opinion but weve bonded pretty well,1
The precise length of Farrells recovery period remains unclear but grade one quadriceps strains like the one he sustained in training usually take between seven and 10 days to recover,1
" That leaves him touch and go to feature at Eden Park but the Lions do have one advantage in the shape of Phil Morrow, Saracens performance director, who is part of the strength and conditioning team on this tour If anyone should know how to get Farrell back to fitness it is the Ulsterman and Kruis also confirmed the fly-half will do everything in his power to be involvedHe is professional and hed do whatever it takes",3
" Phils dealt with him for the last five to six years now so hell know what will get him goingIf Farrell fails to make it and Jonathan Sexton picks up a knock against the Maori All Blacks, the Lions could well be down to their third choice No10, Waless Dan Biggar",2
" That possibility lends a further layer of intrigue to the fixture, although Gatlands players are determined not to panic",1
"I dont know if it will be a major blow to the squad, said Sean OBrien, looking forward to underlining his own claims for a place in the starting Test back row [Farrell] has a lot of experience, has been playing very well and hes a good leader He will obviously be a loss but theres other lads there to fill that voidThe Maori All Blacks will provide no respite as they seek to repeat their 19-13 victory over the Lions on the 2005 tour They possess a good lineout threat and have as lethal a backline as the visitors will have experienced on this expedition to date",5
" The Lions aggressive rush defence is not always easy to outwit but their opponents will have the skill and pace to test that theory with artful little chips in behindUltimately this tour is all about belief and OBrien, for one, still says New Zealand should be wary despite their warm-up rout of Samoa: I dont see an aura in terms of them being unbeatable Theyre a group of guys exactly like us who play rugby",3
" Anything can happen on the dayThe Lions will also be keen to impress the referee Jaco Peyper, who will preside over the first Test at Eden Park, too",2
Judy Murray and Heather Stanning are among the leading sporting figures to feature in the Queens birthday honours list,1
"Murray, the former Great Britain Fed Cup coach and mother to the Wimbledon champions Andy and Jamie, will receive an OBE for services to tennis, women in sport and charityI do what I love and I love what I do, so I feel very lucky to have been given this honour, she said Ill keep working hard to grow tennis and to promote womens sport across the UK She is the third member of her family to be honoured after Andy was knighted in the new year, while Jamie also received an OBE in 2016The double Olympic rowing champion Stanning, who announced her retirement from the sport after successfully defending her title in Rio last summer, is also upgraded to an OBE",5
" Stanning had been awarded an MBE in the wake of her first Olympic triumph, at London 2012The Ireland rugby union captain, Rory Best, who won his 100th cap for his country late last year, is another recipient of an OBE, for services to rugby The 34-year-old is currently touring New Zealand with the British and Irish Lions, and offered his thanks to the scores of coaches, team-mates, friends and family he believes deserve to share in his honour",3
"Im just so surprised and humbled; its such a massive honour, Best said To be recognised for contributing to a sport, for someone to feel Im worthy of being nominated, and then to be deemed worthy, its quite incredibleDick Greenwood, the former England rugby union captain and coach, receives an OBE for services to national and international rugby The 75-year-old made five Test appearances between 1966 and 1969 and later took over as head coach from 1983 to 1985Greenwood said: Its something that crops up out of the blue and Ive got a lot of people to thank for it",5

" It is a great team game, so I am above all a team player, and my debt is to all my team-mates who have supported me through the yearsJohn Conteh, the Liverpool light-heavyweight who held the WBC title between 1974 and 1978, is awarded an MBE for his services to boxingConteh, who has played an active role with charities and the London ex-Boxers Association in retirement, joked: I never even thought about the possibility of getting an honour  where I grew up the only letters you got were from the DHSS",3
" Its an absolute privilege and an honour and Im so grateful to all the people who supported me and put me forward for this awardScott Hann, the gymnastics coach who guided Max Whitlock to his double gold achievement at the Rio Olympics, is also given an MBE",2
" Hanns work at the South Essex club has been crucial in the remarkable recent success of the sport in Britain, which culminated in a total of seven medals in BrazilObviously it is recognition for all the hard work and commitment and dedication but it is never something as a coach you expect to receive, Hann said At the end of the day I stand on the shoulders of so many giants, and I am privileged to get the chance to work with Max and so many other great athletes",3
"The Northern Ireland football captain, Steven Davis, is another recipient of an MBE, having led his country to the last 16 at last summers European ChampionshipsThe 32-year-old Southampton midfielder captained his country in France at their first major finals in 30 years and helped Michael ONeills team to the knockout stages Davis said: I was shocked and taken aback when I was told about it",3
 I thought it was a joke at first,1
"It was just something that had never registered with me, that I might receive something like this Now, however, I think its unbelievable",2
" To get recognition like this when Im still playing is a massive thingBrian Noble, the former Bradford Bulls and Great Britain coach who is the current director of rugby at Toronto Wolfpack, receives an MBE for services to rugby league and charityJennie Price, the Sport England chief executive since 2007, receives a CBE for services to sport, specifically for her work increasing levels of female participation",3
A record 185-run fifth-wicket partnership between Samit Patel and Steven Mullaney guided Nottinghamshire into the Royal London Cup final with a five-wicket win over Essex at ChelmsfordNottinghamshire reached their target of 371 with three balls to spare  the highest successful run chase in a domestic List A competition  and they will face Worcestershire or Surrey at Lords on 1 JulyThe pair came together after Brendan Taylor fell for 62 after putting on 100 with Patel for the fourth wicket and Nottinghamshire still had work to do at 180 for four just before the halfway mark,3
Mullaney brought up his first List A century from 71 balls with a fifth six before he fell with victory in sight for 111 after striking six sixes in his 75-ball inningsPatel saw Nottinghamshire home with an unbeaten 122 as they overhauled the record chase of 359 from Hampshire against Surrey in 2007,2
"Alastair Cook hammered his third century in the competition and Ryan ten Doeschate his second as Essex closed on 370 for five The former England captain hit 133 from 128 balls with 16 fours as Essex rattled up their highest total in the competition this season It was his 12th one-day century and took him past 1,000 runs for the season in all competitions, 636 of them in this competition",3
"Ten Doeschate joined Cook in the middle at 173 for three in the 29th over before Cook drove Harry Gurney for four to bring up his century off 95 ballsTen Doeschate took four successive boundaries off Mullaney as he raced to 50 off 40 deliveries but Cook fell shortly after, top-edging Patel, and Chris Read claimed the catch running back Ten Doeschate then took three sixes off the penultimate over from Gurney and brought up his own century off 64 balls to take Essex past 350Nottinghamshire started positively but three wickets from Jamie Porter left them on 80 for three in the 10th over After a period of consolidation, Taylor kick-started the innings with a chipped six over long-on off Neil Wagner",5
" He brought up his half-century from 39 balls with five fours and that six but when he had reached 62, he called for a sharp single from the bowlers end, finished up at the same end as Patel and Porters throw was gathered by Simon Harmer to complete a simple run-out",1
Patel reached his 50 from 60 balls soon afterwards and then Mullaney took over,1
" He cleared the ropes with a straight drive off Harmer and then hit four fours in the spinners next over on the way to his highest 50-over score as he and Patel took Nottinghamshire to a superb victorySergey Kovalev is convinced he did enough to defeat Andre Ward when they met for the unified light heavyweight championship in the autumn but this time he is determined to sprint through the tapeThe Russian nicknamed Krusher dumped Ward to the canvas early on and dominated the first half of their November fight but he faded just enough to allow the Olympic champion from Oakland to escape with a narrow, controversial unanimous decision All three judges scored it 114-113 for WardThe rare match-up between two undefeated champions in their prime somehow managed to live up to the billing, offering fans everything but a definitive conclusion",5
" So they meet again on Saturday night in Las Vegas as Kovalev tries to wrest back the WBA, WBO and IBF titles he surrendered in his first professional setbackIt is the best fight that can be made in boxing today: Ward and Kovalev enter at No1 and No2, respectively, in Ring magazines pound-for-pound ratings And there is antipathy between the fighters and their promoters that has lent further intrigue to the proceedings",3
"I just have one goal, to beat Andre Ward and beat all the shit from him because he doesnt deserve the belt and the status of a champion, Kovalev said I want to put him back in his place",2
"The 34-year-old (30-1-1, 26 KOs) believes he overtrained for the first fight, describing the doomed combination of three-a-day workouts and daily half-marathons with a conditioning coach who was afraid to tell him to dial it back This time he has enlisted a new strength coach in Aleksandr Mikhailovich, whose training philosophy is said to centre around his robust work with biathletes",2
"They seem to work well together, Kovalevs trainer, John David Jackson, said this week",1
" If Mikhailovich did his job, then Sergey will be fine For the first fight Sergey was running 14 miles a day and I asked him why",2
 I told him he was going to wear his legs out,1
 He is still running but not nearly as much He is saving himself this time around,2
"Ward (31-0, 15 KOs), a longtime champion at 168lbs who all but cleaned out the division, went 114-5 in an extraordinary amateur career that culminated with a gold medal at the Athens Games, which remains the last time an American has topped the podium in mens boxing",1
 The last time he lost a fight was against John Revish at the 1997 National Silver Gloves tournament in Baton Rouge when he was 13,1
"Tactically I obviously want to have a better start and Im going to have a better start, the 33-year-old American said Thats really what got me in my hole: the start Im sure hes made some adjustments and hes going to come harder but Im ready Ive done everything Im supposed to do When you prepare the way youre supposed to, and all the boxes are checked, its time to go to work",5
"Ward, who is promoted by Jay Zs nascent Roc Nation Sports, has been guaranteed a minimum purse of $6m",1
" Kovalevs contract has yet to be filed with the Nevada Athletic Commission but its said he is due a 75% share of the overall take for Main Events, his longtime promoter, in lieu of a base purse That means his compensation is in direct proportion with ticket sales and pay-per-view revenue, which many believe will be compromised by Wednesdays headline-grabbing announcement of the August novelty match between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Conor McGregorThat likely explains why Kovalev stormed off stage before the end of Thursdays final press conference, declining to participate in interviews and the traditional stare-down photoshoot",3
" His frustration is understandable, but theres no doubt a reversal of Novembers cruel result would offer swift consolationAt this point in the rugby cycle teams from all over the world have a rare chance to work on their strength in depth but also to brandish it This weekend the World Rugby Under-20 Championship reaches its climax in Georgia, while the best of British and Irish lock horns with the Maori, broadly analogous to a New Zealand second or third team Next weekend the Lions take on the All Blacks themselvesMeanwhile, on a third continent, what is left of England, with 30 of their best players unavailable, are wound up in a special bubble preparing to clinch a two-Test series against Argentina, who will be there again in two years time when the pool stages of the World Cup get under way",5
" Having blooded 10 new caps in a remarkable 38-34 win last Saturday in San Juan, the convoy moves directly east across the country to Santa Fe",1
"While the eyes of the rugby world arent on us right now, I think thats a good thing, says Dylan Hartley, Englands captain, who will move into third place on Englands list of caps winners Our eyes are on us and we are continually developing and trying to get better",2
 I think English rugby is in a very strong place at the momentHe may think the eyes of the rugby world are not on him but the benefits of a terrestrial showcase meant that 1,2
"8 million viewers watched the exhilarating scenes from San Juan last Saturday  versus the 600,000 who saw the Lions And in Santa Fe there is little sign of a drop-off in interest Hartley and Eddie Jones joined their equivalents from Argentina and a few other local dignitaries at a top-table press conference on Thursday night in front of an audience of hundreds",3
Jones is relishing the old-school feel of this tour of the provinces,1
" It is good to see Argentina bring rugby to the regional centres One of the unfortunate things of professional rugby is that that has died out in a lot of other countries, because money drives the game This tour has brought a bit of that back",3
"Argentina are thriving on the back of their closer assimilation into the fabric of world rugby, even if they are on a horrible run of 10 defeats from their last 12 games The blend of speed and furious power with which they play the game will surely develop into something special, possibly the equal of their vintages who finished in the top four at two of the last three World Cups Which should give those in their pool pause for thought, at least",3
"If England are not at full strength here, neither are Argentina, who continue to exclude those playing overseas We are expecting our European players to return [by the time of the World Cup], says Daniel Hourcade, Argentinas coach",2
" As much as it is a political decision, it is also a rugby one Its important that they come back and play in Super Rugby, because thats what were aiming for",2
"England squad members can barely move from A to B without being asked about the prospect of Argentina hosting a Lions tour or a World Cup, either of which, incidentally, the country would be perfect for But, for now, it is England who are in town, albeit this curious but vital blend of youth and exuberance with cool experienceLast Saturdays game was one for the ages, Argentina taking the initiative with a pace that Jones described as 10% higher than anything they encountered in the Six Nations Jones was delighted with the test it posed his youngsters  and how they came through it  but he expects a different one again on Saturday, the dry, high heat of San Juan morphing into the close and sticky Santa Fe, nestled low among the slow tributaries of the Parana riverI think it might be a bit of a slugathon, says Jones",5
 It is very rare that you get two games the same It is like drinking a beer,2
" The first beer never tastes the same as the second beer, and the third beer never tastes the same as the second one Rugby is the same The second game is generally never like the first game If the first has been open the second has been tighter, so we are prepared for bothThe return of Chris Robshaw will help with that flexibility, and the new cap Sam Underhill ought to add a level of physicality, albeit of the 20-year-old variety, which these days need not mean the side is compromised",5
" In the backs, Piers Francis comes in at inside-centre for his first start Having been rejected by English rugby in his teens, he has been schooled in New Zealand and returns quite the complete player",2
"England and New Zealand, the coming together everyone wants to see For now, across various continents, they continue their development towards the 2019 World Cup",2
" This tour has increased Joness pool of blooded players to more than 60; a second win in Argentina would leave him as satisfied with where England are as he could possibly have hoped to beFormer two-times UFC welterweight champion Matt Hughes was airlifted to a medical facility on Friday after the truck he was driving collided with a moving train around 70 miles northeast of St Louis, an Illinois state police spokesperson told the GuardianHughes, 43, was traveling in a pickup truck eastbound on Beelers Trail in Illinoiss Montgomery County approaching a railroad grade crossing marked with crossbuck signs at around 10:45am when he crossed the tracks directly in front of an oncoming train and was struck on the passenger side, officers said",3
"Police said Hughes was seriously injured and transported to a Springfield hospital by an Arch Air Medical Services helicopter ambulanceUFC president Dana White told ESPN that hes been in contact with Hughes family, who are traveling to the facility where the Illinois native was taken",2
"Apparently he has head trauma, White told the network",1
 His family is traveling to him nowThe Illinois state polices traffic reconstruction unit was still investigating the crash on Friday afternoon Officials said no further information was available,3
Our thoughts are with Matt Hughes and his family pictwitter,3
"com/TF6BaHSa85Hughes had two as stints the organizations welterweight champion from 2001 through 2006, during which time he was considered among the best pound-for-pound fighters in mixed martial artsHe was inducted to the UFCs Hall of Fame in 2010 and formally retired from competition three years later, though he was reportedly mulling a comeback as recently as this yearMagnus Carlsens career is in crisis and this week Norways 26-year-old world champion has been on the brink of losing the No1 ranking he has held without a break for almost six yearsCarlsen was in joint last place in the Altibox Norway elite event at Stavanger, with a pack of eager rivals within one game of usurping his No1 position, but he was saved, at least for the moment, when his old rival, Russias Sergey Karjakin, blundered a drawn position in Thursdays penultimate round to give the beleaguered champion a windfall point Carlsen then drew with Indias Vishy Anand in Fridays ninth and final round to total 4/9 in next to last place with just a solitary win, six draws and two defeats",5
"After seven of the nine rounds Carlsen had not won a game, giving a drab performance and losing twice to major rivals Levon Aronian beat him in a truly brilliant game with a sophisticated version of the ancient Greek Gift bishop sacrifice, then Russias former champion Vlad Kramnik also saw further than Carlsen in a tactical sequenceCarlsen has often said he values being top of the rankings even more than his official world crown and at his zenith in July 2014 his rating was an all-time record of 2882, 50 points ahead of his nearest rival Since then he has suffered some losses to weaker players as well as an increased ratio of drawsHis rating gradually dropped some 70 points and he retains the No1 spot only due to his earlier achievements",5
" Taken alone, his 2017 results would put him outside the top 10 The live ratings after his win on Thursday show him at 2823 with five rivals, including the rampant Aronian, above 2800 and thus within striking distance",2
"Final scores from Stavanger were Levon Aronian (Armenia) 6/9, Hikaru Nakamura (US) and Vlad Kramnik (Russia) 5, Wesley So and Fabiano Caruana (both US) and Anish Giri (Netherlands) 45, Magnus Carlsen (Norway), Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) and Vishy Anand (India) 4, Sergey Karjakin (Russia) 3",2
"5Exactly why Carlsen, who was widely expected to prove himself alongside Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov as one of the greatest world champions, is having such a prolonged slump in form is unclear",2
" A grandmaster in his mid-20s is normally near his playing peak, because his ambition, creative energy and physical stamina for long games are all in good shapeCarlsens special skill used to be to take on a long endgame with little or no advantage and grind the opponent down by incessant pressure His opponents have got wise to that and more of his games now feature level positions where his well-prepared rival halves easily",3
Kasparov thinks Carlsens play has stagnated and that his avoidance of mainstream opening theory blunts his edge,1
" He spent weeks preparing for Stavanger, yet his repertoire included tame Italian openings In contrast Aronian, who beat Carlsen brilliantly and won the tournament, came without a coach to help him prepare The Armenian explained: It is important to be responsible for your own preparation and to take it more seriously",3
" You know, when there is no one to expect help from, you will be working more concentrated and determinedAronians win from Carlsen was a remarkable mix of two classical tactical themes He sacrificed first a pawn, then rook for bishop, to put the world champions queen in danger of being trapped",3
" The pawn was a rook pawn, whereas in the Poisoned Pawn Sicilian, where Boris Spassky once famously beat Bobby Fischer, White gambits the b2 pawnTrying to rescue his queen, Carlsen left his king short of defenders and allowed a version of the Greek Gift bishop sacrifice There were still mistakes on both sides until Aronian broke through to win one of the most original games of recent years",3
"The game showed that 11 a3! was a poisoned pawn, so Blacks safest was 11",3

The 32-year-old feels he is being singled out for disproportionate treatment after prosecutors accused him of defrauding the authorities of 14,1
"7m A source close to the player claims the outraged Portugal international feels great indignation following the public speculation about his tax affairs and a sense of injustice at the allegations  which he contests  and he has made a decision to leave the countryRonaldo, who signed a new five-year contract in November, has made no secret of his affection for United  the club he left to join Madrid in 2009 after six years at Old Trafford  and Jos Mourinho, who shares the same super agent Jorge Mendes, would relish his return as he seeks to build a team capable of a title challenge and a successful campaign in the Champions League",3
"United remain one of the clubs with the financial muscle to offer a competitive package for Ronaldo  they are predicting record revenues of up to 570m this year  and his return would be a dream commercial moveHe has a 1bn (880m) release clause in his current Madrid deal and United  now without Zlatan Ibrahimovics wages on the books and the potential to lose Wayne Rooneys financial burden soon  would be able to meet Ronaldos wage demands of around 400,000 a week",2
 Paris Saint-Germain could match Uniteds offer but the Old Trafford move presents Ronaldo with his fairytale moment and a far grander stage on which to perform,1
 The potential availability of one of the worlds most marketable players will also naturally alert the Chinese Super League clubsReports that Ronaldo wanted to leave Real were sparked on Friday in the Portuguese newspaper A Bola It claimed his decision was irreversible and that he has already told his Madrid team-mates that he wants to leave,3
"The root of Ronaldos anger stems from Spanish prosecutors lawsuit against the player, accusing him of defrauding tax authorities of 147m by hiding his image rights income between 2011 and 2014 Ronaldo has categorically denied any wrongdoing Real backed that assertion, saying they were confident the Portuguese forward had acted legallyFollowing the tax allegations, Ronaldo posted a picture of himself with his fingers to his lips on Instagram with the caption: Sometimes the best answer its to be quiet",5
Earlier this week Ronaldos agency Gestifute released a statement which read: There is no tax evasion scheme ,3
" There has never been any hiding nor any intention to hide anythingRonaldos frustrations at his treatment come after leading Real to three Champions League titles, scoring twice in last months final against Juventus in Cardiff as they became the first club to retain the trophy He also became only the second player to score in three different finals and remains the competitions record goalscorer with 105",3
"Barcelonas Lionel Messi took a similar stance in threatening to quit Spain in 2014, also claiming he had been singled out for special treatment, when he was accused of concealing 41m from the authorities The Argentina international was found guilty and subsequently lost an appeal against a 21-month prison sentence  under Spanish law sentences under two years are usually suspended  and a 2",3

"8m) fineThe tragic scenario attached to one of Augusta Nationals founding fathers, Clifford Roberts, may be well known but the similarly grim circumstances which form a backdrop to Erin Hills have barely featured in the buildup to the US Open For obvious reasons, perhaps; this tale of money problems, homicide and a lengthy jail term is hardly in keeping with an upbeat major championship narrativeImagery of Roberts remains a constant feature during any Masters week In September 1977, aged 83 and a year after standing down as the long-term Augusta chairman, he committed suicide on the very premises he played such a major part in establishing",5
"The scenario around Steve Trattner is even more troublesome because it involves others and criminality As Erin Hills stages its first major this week, Trattner has watched via television in a nearby jail He is serving a 35-year sentence for the murder of his wife",3
" And, make no mistake, from the Waupun Correctional Institution, Trattner is observing every shot",1
" Im going to be watching every minute of the tournament, he said in a recent interview with Sports Illustrated For so many years, that place was my home away from home",2
"Trattner, a former software engineer, clearly had an architects eye While living a seemingly unremarkable life on the outskirts of Milwaukee, married and soon to be a father of two, he had a dream to build a public golf course",2
" Such a concept is fanciful without identifying appropriate land; in itself an infamously tricky business But Trattner did it, just as he convinced multi-millionaire Bob Lang to fund the projectOnly two people, Bob Lang and I, experienced the day-to-day transformation of the property, explained Trattner",3
" All the ups and downs, challenges, hundreds of conversations about tweaksThe $2",2
"5m land deal was pieced together in 1999 and at the last minute, with the farmer who owned what is now known as Erin Hills on the verge of removing the land from the market Trattner became project manager on a salary of $2,000 a month I would have done it for free, he claimed",3
" He was fulfilling a long-term dreamBy 2005, a year before the facility opened, Trattner was concerned by Langs increased spending on the golf course The formers marriage to Sin Lam was also in trouble owing, mainly, to Trattners addiction-like approach to Erin Hills",3
" I was going to be the general manager and that would have been heaven for me, he later saidThe upshot instead was altogether different",2
" After a domestic dispute on 3 January 2006  Lam was intending on filing for divorce  court papers reveal Trattner threw his wife against a cabinet, banged her head against the floor and performed strangulation",1
" He covered his wife with a blanket, dragged her into the living room and went to bed before taking his children to school the following morning as if everything was normal That afternoon  after meetings at Erin Hills  Trattner called police, sleeping pills having been placed at Lams side to imply suicideTrattner went on to plead guilty to first-degree reckless homicide",3
" He is currently in the midst of an appeal, on the basis he was not properly advised or represented during courtroom hearings",1
 Trattner now claims self defence was key to his actions,1
"If youre a judge, sitting up there with this guy sitting in front of you, and you see his wife who was supposedly strangled to death for no reason, youre not going to care about some golf course that nobody knows about, admits Lew Wasserman, Trattners lawyerIs this a case of perfect self-defence? Maybe not But thats not the issue",3
" Were not dealing with a jurys verdict Were dealing with whether he was properly advised to enter a plea for first-degree reckless homicideIts sadly ironic because without Steven Trattners efforts, there wouldnt be an Erin Hills",3
"Having become more smitten with the dream than was healthy, Lang found himself at the bottom of a fiscal hole",1
" Spending had spiralled out of control The businessman, who attended this weeks tournament, sold the site in 2009, before the US Open dream became reality I had a come-to-Jesus with myself, he said",3
 I had no choice,1
 I had to sell,1
" The price was listed at $10m, less than half what Lang reckons he had spentOn Wednesday, the United States Golf Association hosted its annual pre-event media conference",2
" The golf course is a championship venue that will make history, said the USGA president, Diana Murphy",1
" And we also want to say thank you to its owner Andy Ziegler and congratulations Ziegler stood up, waved and took recognition from the floor",2
"During correspondence with Sports Illustrated writers, Trattner expresses regret over Langs financial blow At times I definitely wish I never wouldve pursued and started Erin Hills, he said I cant help but feel guilty and awful for how it devastated Bob and his family",3
It is the US Open storyline that will not feature in any guidebooks That does not prevent it from being both fascinating and horribly sad; any golfer falling agonisingly short at this major is not the key component in a tragedyMike Tyson has an interesting new book out called Iron Ambition,3
" In it he talks about his violent childhood, explores his relationship with his late coach, the great Cus DAmato, and kicks the whole thing off with a passage about wandering around his old Brooklyn neighbourhood, marvelling at the gentrification, tourists and, above all, the sight of people taking selfies all over the placeLike many other grouchy middle-aged men Mike hasnt, you sense, fully engaged with the selfie craze",2
" Imagine trying to do that with the people I was hanging out with in Times Square, he writes Hey man, lets take a selfie! Motherfuckers would start beating on you and leave you in a coma in the street We can never go back, of course",3
" But in many ways, happier, wiser timesThis is not, yet, the most famous Tyson quote That comes instead from his time rampaging around the heavyweight division when he was asked by a room of journalists about an opponents plans to dance inside, hit and run and generally pick him off Everyone has a plan, came the reply Until they get punched in the mouth",5
"It is a cool quote, albeit perhaps a little misunderstood, with an assumption among those who perhaps didnt see Tyson in his prime that saying this marks him out as a force of untutored aggression, all front-foot brutality",1
" Read the book and you realise the phrase has strong echoes of DAmato, a brilliant strategist who talked first of all about not getting hit, and whose triumph was to turn Tyson into a counterpunching technician, saving his most ferocious attacks for when hed just slipped your best shot",1
"What Mike and Cus were saying was: you may have a plan but ours is better Just as all trainers and indeed football managers work relentlessly on defence, the flaws in their opponents attack and disrupting first of all whats coming back at them",2
"Can you feel it yet? Can you feel Jos Mourinhos hard, flat, insolent gaze glaring out between these words? This week another fascinating set of quotes has been doing the rounds, this time from Mourinho, extracted from remarks he made at a Lisbon university about his preparations for the Europa League final against Ajax",1
" These were picked up by the newspaper Tribuna Expresso and translated by the football analyst Tiago Estvo Again the talk was about strategy and, above all, about getting your retaliation in firstThe first striking thing is the level of detail in Mourinhos prep for Ajax, the way he really does visualise the game in advance, reaching his horrible hands through his opponents rib cage and gouging his nails into the vital organs",3
"The second striking thing was the response on social media to this insight, reflecting a certain acerbic reaction to Mourinhos first season at Manchester United, the tendency to hold a perfumed handkerchief to the nose, to splutter about anti-football, to suggest that setting out a team defensively is in some way cynical or disrespectful And beyond this, the idea a club like United should instead be imposing its own freewheeling, tousle-haired will, leaving the washing-up, romping about like cosseted puppies and all the restThis still feels a bit baffling to the neutral",3
 Looking at Mourinhos notes it is hard to see anything but complete respect for his opponent and indeed for his sport Hes not mucking about here Mourinho watched eight Ajax matches before Stockholm,3
" He had a clear plan, a set of counter measures that worked so well that with 10 minutes gone he was already telling Rui Faria we have them in our pocketsThe first stage of this was to create instability by hustling Matthijs de Ligt, Ajaxs usual conduit from the back, forcing Davinson Snchez to take the ball forward instead Snchez is hugely talented and shut Marcus Rashford down on the night but hes not as good on the ball as his partner",3
" So in one move a strength became a weaknessCarrying the ball forward, Snchez looked up and found stage two: United matched Ajaxs midfield man for man, leaving no real option but to pass long",2
" Which he did By the end Snchez had made 35 more passes than De Ligt, including nine long balls, and every part of the Ajax machine had been very slightly jiggered out of place Everybody has a plan  until they get hustled into a series of unplanned movements by a master of the pre-emptive smothering tweak",3
"Mourinho also had his defence under strict orders Chris Smalling, who can  lets face it  at times look like hes playing in a pair of oversized square-toed cow-poke boots, was told to pass long every time, to make no attempt to link with his midfield, thereby negating Ajaxs powerful high pressThey followed the drill",3
 Uniteds back four played 25 long balls,1
 Smalling and Daley Blind didnt pass once to Paul Pogba,1
" A team of stars man-marked a 17-year-old novice defender And United won a European final at a guarded canter by the horribly subversive pragmatism of not giving the ball to their 90m record signing For me beautiful is not giving our opponents what they want, Mourinho sneered in Lisbon",3
" I wasnt there but, lets face it, he sneered it, maybe even cackled it And hes right This is in its own way deeply beautifulSo why the snorts of unhappiness? Clearly defensive football isnt everyones idea of fun It doesnt look good on the telly",5
" Pogbas willingness to fit the plan is admirable but his own extreme talents may get more of an airing elsewhere Similarly Mourinhos love of the system, his ability to wrench out an opponents circuit boards, have seen his greatest triumphs arrive at clubs just below the top tier, turning a B-list European power into a snarling, spitting, brilliantly obstructive championBeyond this it is hard to avoid the idea that people make the mistake of conflating Mourinhos tactics with his toxic and infuriating public persona: the sneakiness, the tedious jibes, the sight of him stalking the touchline haggardly in baggy grey shell suit trousers with the look of a man dragged from his static caravan in the wee hours and forced to walk four miles down the hard shoulder in search of a canister of butane gas, only to find hes forgotten his wallet, lost one of his flip-flops in a gorse bush and is being taunted by a busload of primary school children",3
"For all that, the notion this is somehow beneath Manchester United seems a bit odd The later Sir Alex Ferguson teams were hardly buccaneering free spirits swinging from the hip Chewing through a third manager in three years, United have now won two Cups",3
" This feels like progress, an ice pick lodged in the cliff face",1
Mourinho may be a counterpuncher He may be Floyd Mayweather rather than Roberto Durn,2
" But even in a nation where an academic, systems-based approach has so often been jeeringly dismissed, the obsession with team, with winning by first of all preventing defeat, has its own kind of refined mathematics, even its own kind of poetry",1
"Aidy Boothroyd admitted his England Under-21 side were rescued from a disastrous defeat in their opening match of the European Championship by super goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as the new 30m Everton signings penalty save nine minutes from time secured a point against the holders, SwedenBen Chilwells reckless challenge on Linus Wahlqvist looked like condemning England to a defeat that would have left their hopes of reaching the semi-finals hanging by a thread, only for Pickford to deny the same player from the spot with an excellent right-hand saveIt ensured England will go into their second match against Slovakia on Monday knowing there is all still to play for, although Boothroyd acknowledged they will need to improve drastically if they are to end a desperate record of failing to get out of their group at the last three tournamentsIt was a fair result in the end and we can certainly play better than we did, he said Sweden gave us problems which we dealt with",5
" It was disappointing to concede a penalty  Im not sure it was  but it was given, so it was Of course we have our super goalkeeper that keeps penalties outPickford, who became the third most expensive goalkeeper in history on Thursday, had little to do in the first half as England made a decent start but Sweden gradually imposed themselves on the match and could have gone ahead when Pawel Cibickis curling effort from just outside the box cannoned back off the crossbar",3
"Chilwell also struck the woodwork from long range via a heavily deflected effort soon afterwards but could have little complaint about the penalty award after diving in when there appeared to be little dangerWahlqvists penalty was poorly struck but Pickford, after his initial stop, was on hand again to save the substitute Carlos Strandbergs weak follow-up and enable England to hang on to the drawI waited longer and held my ground and got to the penalty; thats what you do, the goalkeeper said",3
"Sweden killed our tempo a bit, they had a game plan to let us have the ball at the back and now we move on to Monday",1
 The main thing is not to lose the game The first game is always tight and we came away with a draw,2
 Its down to us to win the next two,1
"That will be no easy task despite Slovakias and Polands poor records at this tournament, with only the Group A winners guaranteed a place in the last four in the newly expanded format of 12 teams Watched by the senior team manager, Gareth Southgate, and the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, England came into the game with the unwanted record of having conceded more goals at these finals than any other nationMore than 5,000 Sweden supporters made the atmosphere in Kielce feel more like Stockholm than southern Poland, although at first it seemed as if this was Englands game to win Tammy Abraham was unlucky to see his acrobatic effort just before half-time miss the target after an excellent flick-on from Alfie Mawson following a throw-inBoothroyds side also made a strong start after the break but were hampered by a disappointing end product from both flanks, with the Everton right-back Mason Holgate culpable at times",5
" Lewis Baker struggled to make an impact from his No10 role as Nathaniel Chalobah and the captain, James Ward-Prowse, were frequently overrun in midfield and it seemed almost inevitable Sweden would secure victory as they poured forward as the clock ticked down",1
"Strandberg was particularly dangerous on the break and only a last-ditch challenge from Holgate prevented him from having a one-on-one with Pickford just before the penalty was concededBoothroyd was philosophical about his sides chances of progressing but, having seen Pickford complete his move to Goodison Park while away on international duty, admitted his admiration for the way the 23-year-old has handled the pressureHe has had quite a week, he said",3
" Most people would struggle to deal with whats happened and have some sort of dip but, touch wood, he doesnt I thought he was excellentWe want to qualify for the semi-finals and in order to do that we have to win games but its also really important we didnt lose, added Boothroyd",3
"Well look back at it and say its a defining moment, I hope It is important when we dont play well we dig in and make sure we dont get beatenIm not satisfied because I want to win every game but, when you get to this level, you have to be realistic that you cant win every single game",3
" Whats important is you keep focused and dont get beaten and make sure you qualifyThe card game bridge is hardly the most physically strenuous of activities But according to a judgment by one of the European court of justices most senior lawyers, the game should be considered a sport  for tax purposes at least",3
"The recommendation is the latest salvo in a longrunning legal case brought by the English Bridge Union (EBU), which argues that entry fees for its tournaments should be exempt from VAT, as is the case with all activities classed as sport",1
"The EBU lost its initial claim against HM Revenue and Customs, which says sports should have a significant element of physical activity",1
" But the EBU appealed to the upper tax tribunal, which referred the case to European judgesThe player-funded organisation maintains that preferential tax treatment for sport was intended to benefit activities that provide either physical or mental health benefits to regular participants It argues that bridge  a game played by four players in two competing partnerships  helps stimulate the mind, particularly in older peopleOn Thursday the advocate general Maciej Szpunar argued that sport should be understood as something that involved the training of mental or physical fitness in a way that is generally beneficial to the health and wellbeing of citizens, and recommended that bridge be exempted from VAT in the UKHe also noted that the International Olympic Committee was among organisations that expressly include mental sports or endorse activities without a physical element, having classified bridge as a sport in 1998",5
"The case will be reviewed by ECJ judgesin the autumn If they uphold Szpunars recommendation, the EBU will no longer have to pay VAT and may be eligible for a rebate While the recommendation is not binding, judges usually follow the advice of advocate generals",3
"This will have huge benefits as it will allow us to invest further in the game, and make entries to EBU competitions cheaper, thus allowing more people to enjoy playing bridge, and enabling more to experience the social and mental benefits that playing bridge offers, the EBU said in a statementJeremy Dhondy, the EBUs chairman, said the finding was a vindication of our view that bridge should be regarded as a sport with all the advantages that brings both for bridge as a game and also for our members and prospective membersWe want our game to play its full part as an activity to promote social inclusion and welcome the judgment of the European court, he added",3
"Different countries have different opinions on whether bridge is a sport In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France and it is classed as a sport for tax purposes, but in Ireland and Sweden it is notThe 2011 Charities Act adopted a definition of sport as activities which promote health involving physical or mental health or exertion, which specifically included mind sportsHowever, in 2015 the high court ruled that bridge was not a sport eligible for lottery funding, with lawyers acting for Sport England telling the court that the game was no more a sport than sitting at home reading a bookOn Wednesday it was announced the finest boxer of his generation, unbeaten in 49 paying fights and 26 world championship contests with titles in five weight classes, will fight a scheduled 12-round boxing match against an opponent with no professional boxing experience",5
 It doesnt take an expert to know how this one will play out,1
"But we groundlings love a sideshow and always have, making us susceptible to promotional stunts like these for as as long as anyone can remember There was Muhammad Alis risible fight with the Japanese pro wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976, widely regarded as the most embarrassing moment of the Greatests career There were Jesse Owens lamentable match races against thoroughbred horses, a humiliating comedown for the Olympic hero who had stared down Hitler in Berlin There was the much-ballyhooed 150m race between Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson at Torontos SkyDome to determine the title of worlds fastest man, a made-for-TV event that went down 20 years ago this monthOccasionally, one-offs have positive consequences, like the Battle of the Sexes between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973, which altered the perception of womens sports in many doubters eyes",5
" But far more often they leave their participants debased unless theyre forgotten altogether: George Foreman, still nursing the psychological wounds of Zaire, taking on five hopelessly shopworn opponents in one night in 1975",1
" Or the cringeworthy one-on-one match at the Trump Taj Mahal between NBA greats Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Julius Erving, retired quadragenarians both, that aired on pay-per-view for $1995 a popFloyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor are hardly the first to prey on PT Barnums target market, but theyre certain to scale the tried-and-true formula to dizzying profits that would have left the old carnival barker doubled over in laughter Showtime boxing czar Stephen Espinozas straight-faced assessment on Wednesday night offered an understated taste of the bluster to come: Weve never seen a combat sports event, or even a sporting event, of this magnitudeOver the next 10 weeks, the combined promotional heft of Mayweather Promotions and the Ultimate Fighting Championship will attempt to seduce you into believing the outcome is anything but the foregone conclusion it is",5
" Hell, some of our most visible thought leaders are already biting Youll hear plenty about Floyds age",2
 Youll hear about his struggles with left-handed opponents and the strides McGregor has made with his boxing,1
" Later there will be race-baiting on both sides, the same cynical tactics that lifted Jack Johnson v James J Jeffries and Larry Holmes v Gerry Cooney and Mike Tyson v Peter McNeeley to record-breaking profitsThats the thing with one-offs: everyone involved knows they only need to fool the customer once",2
 Its not bad for boxing Its not bad for MMA,2
" Its not anything except a quick-strike money grab with no enduring significance Its an exciting fight until it actually starts and it will be forgotten the minute its over, unworthy of a chapter in either mans memoirsNo amount of salesmanship, misdirection or promotional razzle-dazzle can alter the obvious: McGregors chances under the unified rules of boxing that will govern the 26 August meeting are so infinitesimal theyre hardly worth discussing Its simply unfathomable that a man with zero fights will defeat any elite boxer, let alone one of the greatest defensive technicians to ever take up the gloves Just as Mayweather would stand no chance in a mixed martial arts match",5
 Shame on the thirsty Nevada Athletic Commission for sanctioning this circusHardened skeptics pooh-poohed Mayweathers summit meeting with Manny Pacquiao for happening far past its sell-by date and were partially vindicated by a one-sided fight that left customers feeling let down and ripped off,2
" That outrage almost feels quaint now At least Floyd and Manny, in the anxious moments before the opening bell, were staring across the ring at the most decorated opponent either had ever been in withMcGregor? There are 20-year-olds in boxing gyms right now that would light him up like a Christmas tree",3
" Thats at least whats suggested by the infamous footage of the Irishmans sparring session last year with Chris van Heerden, a former welterweight belt-holder from South Africa Sure, theres reason to believe his clumsy, plodding approach could improve with a training camp devoted completely to boxing But theres simply no way he can catch up to the fistic aptitude of Mayweather, whos been drilled in the mysteries of the sport since childhood",3
 Theres no such thing as a crash course for a lifelong craft,1
Remind yourself what Mayweather did to some of the greatest boxers of his era,1
" Were not even talking about the destruction of Diego Corrales, a fight where Mayweather entered an arguable underdog, before he surrendered his power by climbing in weight to chase the bigger money",1
" Even late-period Floyds brittle hands didnt keep him from making the likes of Juan Manuel Marquez and Canelo Alvarez appear as if they were stumbling around in the dark trying to find the light switch If that lot couldnt even find let alone hurt Mayweather, what hope does our Conor have?Making this fight required the improbable reconciliation of warring interests But Mayweather-McGregor was inevitable because whenever theres enough money on the table, people find a way to make things happen",3
 You cant blame the fighters for taking the payday The only reason its happening is because they dont merely think youre gullible enough to buy it,2
" Theyre certain of itOn Saturday night, Andre Ward and Sergey Kovalev will meet in a rematch of their terrific unified light heavyweight title fight in November It is, at least by one metric, the best fight that can be made today: Ward and Kovalev are rated the two best prizefighters in the world, pound for pound, by Ring magazine",3
" As a genuine sports experience, it will be a hundred times better than Mayweather-McGregor and, especially after Wednesdays announcement, is doomed to receive one-hundredth of the attentionWere poorer for that, but we get what we deserveMino Raiola, the cheeky so and so, is insisting on inserting a 44m (50m) clause into Gianluigi Donnarummas new contract",3
" The 18-year-old was set to sign a 77,000-a-week deal at Milan but the infamous agent is not playing nice The Mill isnt one for telling Milans suits to do their job, but 44m sounds cheap for the next big thing, especially if Jordan Pickford costs 30m The Sunderland goalkeeper is coughing for the Everton doctor, who has flown out to the England Under-21s camp in Poland",3
"On the red side of Merseyside, Liverpool have finally found some coin and are throwing it at Piotr Zielinski",1
" Twenty-five million quid, to be exact, although that is well short of the Napoli midfielders 61m release clause Tottenham are also said to be interested in the Polish international, just in case Barcelona swoop for Christian EriksenLeicester City are set to offer Harry Maguire 80,000 a week in the hope it can convince him to leave Hull City, for a five-year contract worth more than 20m Thats after paying a 17m transfer fee, too Leicester were keen on West Broms Jonny Evans, and floated a 10m offer, but were apparently told to get lost",5
Were all set for another thrilling season in Scotland after Celtic had a 1,1
"3m bid accepted for the only non-Celtic player to feature on the shortlist for PFA Scotland Player of the Year, Jonny Hayes The Ireland international  who, fun fact, has 18 stitches in his arm after being bitten by a dog  helped Aberdeen to second place last season, scoring 11 times",2
" Who knows, he might get a winners medal next yearEmmanuel Adebayor is back, baby",2
" Thats according to the Mirror, who report that Swansea are keen on doing some kind of swap deal for Baftimbi Gomis Why Swansea wouldnt want to keep the Frenchman, who scored 21 goals in 33 games for Marseille last season on loan, is another story, but Adebayor is apparently keen for one more round of the Premier League",2
 The Togo striker is with Istanbul Basaksehir and helped the Turkish club finish second to claim a Champions League spot,1
" TidyRemarkably, were staying with Basaksehir, who have another jewel in their ranks by the name of Cengiz Under",2
" The 19-year-old signed from Altinordu for 600,000 only last summer but has since gone on to make his debut for Turkey, scoring twice in three appearances, including on Sunday against Kosovo Manchester United and Tottenham are keen but Lille appear to be in the driving seat for a player now thought to be worth 13m",2
" Several clubs have been scouting Cengiz, said Basaksehirs vice-president, Mustafa Saral",1
" Lille have held direct talks with us, we have held talks with a few teams that have been mentioned",1
" Our response has been the same, it is an honour to receive so much interest but we feel it is in his best interests to spend one more season here and then leaveFootball and theatre can both range from farce to bloodbath But the tepid response to Patrick Marbers The Red Lion, set in a lower-league changing room, exposed the problem that plays on the subject tend to include too much football for people who like theatre and too much theatre for people who like football",3
" More successful works have used fans as metaphors for tensions in society: Peter Tersons Zigger Zagger and Sing Yer Heart Out for the Lads by Roy WilliamsSo, it is sensible that two new football-related productions  consisting, with thematic neatness, of a one-act play lasting 45 minutes and a two-act show that blows the whistle after 90  focus on what the sport means and does to places and people",2
"Helping fans fill the difficult summer weeks when there are no fixtures, Northampton Towns Sixfields stadium is hosting The Twelfth Player, an immersive theatre piece based on a tour of the ground And while the stands of Birmingham City and Aston Villa are empty, supporters can head to the Birmingham Repertory theatre for Stadium, a community play about the teams rivalry (It is unclear whether the box office will agree not to seat fans of one team next to those of the other lot",3

" A blind West Bromwich Albion supporter describes the last goal he saw, 50 years ago, before losing his sight There is a choreographed wheelchair football game between young supporters of the Villains and the BluesThe show properly reflects the tendency of football to be a proxy for other concerns",3

"twittercom/KhW0u3jRftThere has been no shortage of critics of the fight between UFCs biggest star and a 40-year-old who hasnt fought since September 2015 Last month Mayweathers former rival in the ring, Oscar De La Hoya, said the fight would harm boxing",3
"With each passing day, it looks more and more likely that the circus known as Floyd Mayweather v Conor McGregor will be coming to town in the near future, said De La Hoya As undercard fights start to take form, athletic commissions give their blessings in exchange for millions of dollars, and the fighters start counting even more cash, one group will eventually be left to make sure this farce doesnt occur  we, the fans, who are the lifeblood of our sport  Our sport might not ever recover",5
"There are a lot of sports writers and fans who are adamant that its impossible to compare sporting teams across seasons and eras Taken literally, thats a truism, because every sport evolves, and what worked for a great team in, say the 1980s, might not work  or even be within the rules of the game  todayStill, if asked to identify some of the best AFL teams of recent years, most would almost certainly include the 2000 Essendon, 2011 Geelong, and 2012 Hawthorn teams",3
" We all have, if nothing else, some intuitive sense of relative team abilities across time",1
"As imperfect as it is, one way of quantifying a teams relative ability is to apply mathematics to the results it achieves, adjusting for the quality of the teams they faced Adjustment for opponent quality is important because, were we to use just raw results, a 90-point thrashing of a struggling team would be treated no differently in our assessment of a teams ability than a similar result against a more talented opponentThis notion of continuously rating individuals or teams using results adjusted for opposition quality has a long history One version of the method can be traced back to Arpad Elo, who came up with it as a way of rating chess players as they defeated, drew or lost to other players of sometimes widely differing abilities Its still used for that purpose today",5
"In sports like football, Elo-style rating systems can be expanded to provide not just a single rating for a team, but a separate rating for its offensive and defensive abilities; the former is based on the teams record of scoring points relative to the quality of the defences it has faced, and the latter on its record of preventing points being scored relative to the quality of the offences it has facedIf we do this for the AFL we can quantify the offensive and defensive abilities of teams within and across seasons using a common currency: pointsThere are many ways to do this, and a number of websites offer their own versions, but the methodology well use here has the following key characteristics:Applying this methodology generates the data in the chart below, which records the offensive and defensive ratings of every team from seasons 2000 to 2016 as at the end of their respective home-and-away seasons Teams that ultimately won the flag are signified by dots coloured red, and those that finished runner-up as dots coloured orange The grey dots are the other teams from each season  those that missed the grand final",5
"We see that teams lie mostly in the bottom-left and top-right quadrants, which tells us that teams from the modern era that have been above-average offensively have also tended to be above-average defensively, and conversely that below-average offensive teams have tended to be below-average defensively as wellThe level of association between teams offensive and defensive ratings can be measured using something called a correlation coefficient, which takes on values between -1 and +1 Negative values imply a negative association  say if strong offensive teams tended to be weak defensively and vice versa  while positive values imply a positive association, such as we see in the chart",3
"From the correlation coefficients for team ratings in the current and previous eras we see the degree of association between team offensive and defensive ratings has been at historically high levels in the modern era In fact, its not been as high as this since the earliest days of the VFL",2
"In other words, teams offensive and defensive ratings have tended to be more similar than they have been different in the modern era",1
"By way of comparison, heres the picture for the 1980 to 1999 era in which the weaker relationship between teams offensive and defensive ratings is apparentNote that the increase in correlation between teams offensive and defensive abilities in the modern era has not come with much of a reduction in the spread of team abilities If we ignore the teams that are in the lowest and highest 5% on offensive and defensive abilities, the range of offensive ratings in the modern era span about 31 points and defensive ratings span about 34 points",3
 For the 1980-1999 era the equivalent ranges are both about two points larger,1
"One plausible hypothesis for the cause of the closer association between the offensive and defensive abilities of modern teams would be that coaching and training methods have improved and served to reduce the level of independent variability in the two skill setsThe charts for both eras have one thing in common, however: the congregation of grand finalists  the orange and red dots  in the north-eastern corner This is as we might expect because this is the quadrant for teams that are above-average both offensively and defensivelyOnly a handful of grand finalists in either era have finished their home-and-away season with below-average offensive or defensive ratings In the modern era, just two teams have gone into the finals with below-average defensive ratings  Melbourne in 2000 and Port Adelaide in 2007, both of which finished as runners-up in their respective seasons",5
"Melbourne finished its home-and-away season conceding 100 points or more in four of its last eight games, and conceding 98 and 99 points in two others Those results took a collective toll on its defensive ratingPort Adelaide ended their 2007 home-and-away season more positively but probably not as well as a team second on the ladder might have been expected to  an assessment that seems all the more reasonable given the grand final result just a few weeks later In that 2007 grand final, Geelong defeated them by 119 pointsThe chart for the modern era also highlights a few highly-rated teams that could consider themselves unlucky to have not made the grand final in their years  the 2016 Adelaide and St Kilda teams in particular, though that Saints rating was somewhat elevated by its 139-point thrashing of the Lions in the final home-and-away game of that season",5
"Based on the relatively small sample of successful teams shown in this chart, its difficult to come to any firm conclusions about the relative importance of offensive versus defensive ability for making grand finals and winning flags, and impossible to say anything at all about their relative importance in getting a team to the finals in the first placeTo look at that issue we use the ratings in a slightly different way",2
" Specifically, we use them to calculate the winning rates of teams classified on the basis of their offensive and defensive superiority or inferiority at the time of their clashThose calculations are summarised in the table below, which also groups games into eras to iron out season-to-season fluctuations and make underlying differences more apparentThe percentages that are most interesting are those in the column furthest on the left in each block",3
 They tell how successful teams that have found themselves stronger defensively but weaker offensively than their opponents have been,1
"What we find is that, in every era since the second world war:We should note though that none of the percentages are statistically significantly different from 50%, so we cant definitively claim that, in any particular era, defensive superiority has been preferable to offensive superiority in the home-and-away season or that the opposite has been true in finals Thats the clear tendency, but the evidence is statistically weak, so the differences we see might be no more than random noiseIn any case, the effect sizes we see are quite small  around 1% to 2% points  so practically it makes more sense to conclude that offensive and defensive abilities have been historically of roughly equal importance to a teams success in home-and-away games and in finalsSo, where do the current crop of teams sit? The chart below maps each of the 18 current teams ratings as at the end of round 12 and the ratings of all 34 grand finalists from the period 2000-2016 as at the end of round 12 in their respective yearsAdelaide stand alone offensively, with a rating almost as good as the 2000 Essendon team who were 12-0 after round 12 having averaged just over 136 points per game in a season where the all-team average score was 103 points per team per game across the entire home-and-away season",5
" The Dons scored then at a rate just over 30% higher than an average teamThis year, Adelaide are averaging just under 119 points per game in a season where the all-team average is just under 91 points per game, which is also about 30% higher They are, clearly, a formidable team offensively, though theyve yet to impress consistently defensively",3
"The 2017 Port Adelaide and GWS teams come next, both located just outside the crop of highest-rated grand finalists, and having combined ratings a little below Adelaides",1
" This weeks loss to Essendon had a (quite reasonably) significant effect on Ports rating, as did GWSs loss to Carlton",1
"Geelong, Collingwood, Sydney, Richmond and the Western Bulldogs are a little more south-east of that prime flag-winner territory, and would require a few above-expectation performances in upcoming weeks to enter that area The Bulldogs in particular would need to show a little more offensive ability to push into the group, though they had a similar rating at the same point last season, so whos to say they need to do anything much moreCollingwoods relatively high rating might raise a few eyebrows, but they have, it should be noted, generated more scoring shots in their losses to the Western Bulldogs in round one and Essendon in round five, and generated only four or fewer less scoring shots in their losses to Richmond in round two, St Kilda in round four, Carlton in round seven, GWS in round eight, and Melbourne in round 12",3
" Theyre currently ranked seventh on combined ratingEssendon, Melbourne and St Kilda form the next sub-group  rated slightly above average on combined rating but below almost all previous grand finalists at the equivalent point in the seasonNo other team has a combined rating that is positive or that exceeds that of any flag winner at this point in the season since 2000",3
" As such, the remaining seven teams would make history were they to win the flagStill, theres a lot that can happen between now and the end of the season, as we can see in this final chart, which shows 2017 team ratings and the ratings of all non-grand finalists from the seasons from 2000 to 2016",2
"There are plenty of sides in the chart that rated highly at the end of round 12 that never got as far as grand final dayFor example, the Geelong 2010 team was 10-2 after 12 rounds, one game clear at the head of the competition ladder with a 156 percentage",2
" That team went 7-3 over the remainder of the home-and-away season to finish runners-up in the minor premiership before being eliminated by the minor premiers, Collingwood, 120-79 in a preliminary final",1
"And, in any case, in a year where results have constantly surprised and where two wins currently separates fith from 17th on the ladder, no team can reasonably feel assured of progressing into September, let alone to the MCG at the end of that monthEven the best-laid plans can be instantly scuppered and the British & Irish Lions are suddenly on red alert over the fitness of Owen Farrell A thigh strain sustained in training has ruled the fly-half out of the match-day squad to face the Maori All Blacks on Saturday and time is not on his side before the first Test against the All Blacks one week laterFarrell is reported to have a grade one quadricep tear, which is at the lesser end of the scale but the last thing the Lions need is a kicker and playmaker with a bad leg For all the attention given to Peter OMahonys selection as captain against the Maori, the two names uppermost in Gatlands mind are currently Farrell and the tour captain, Sam Warburton",5
" If neither start the first Test for reasons of injury and form respectively, the Lions stock of on-field leaders will be conspicuously depletedAs yet there is no official indication when Farrell may be fit again, with Dan Biggar coming on to Saturdays bench, but even more pressure now rests on Jonathan Sexton, whose best chance of starting the Tests at No10 had previously rested on Farrell playing at 12",2
" Barring a swift recovery for the Saracen, this weekends midfield combination of Sexton, Ben Teo and Jonathan Davies are on standby to feature against New Zealand as wellGatland, one suspects, was planning on Farrell, Teo and Davies forming a 10-12-13 partnership in Auckland and hoping a late rush of form from Warburton would secure him a place ahead of OMahony or Sean OBrien",2
" The two Irishmen and Taulupe Faletau were so impressive as a back-row combination, however, in last Saturdays win over the Crusaders that Warburton may find the first Test arriving a few days too soonGatland, by his own admission, is currently tempted to leave the trio intact With OMahony also set to remain the on-field captain even when Warburton comes on, the ground is certainly well prepared for the Test skipper and the tour leader to be separate individuals",3
" He [Warburton] is well aware of the competition at the moment, confirmed Gatland He fully understands that loose forward trio went outstandingly well against the Crusaders",2
" But one of the reasons we selected him as captain of the squad is because this tour isnt about Sam Warburton, its about putting the squad first So if hes not involved in the first Test because of the performance on Saturday night, he will fully understand thatLittle room for misinterpretation there Similarly, before Farrells fitness issues emerged, Gatland did not mince his words about Sexton: I think Johnny needs some more rugby I thought he was really good coming off the bench the other day but Johnny knows his last two games before that werent his best games of rugby",5
" He was down a little bit on confidence but, at the moment, hes got a bit of his mojo backIn almost the same breath, even so, the head coach left the door ajar for a second-half renewal of the 10-12 axis that went well in Christchurch after Davies departed early with a head knock That combination was pretty seamless, agreed Gatland, emphasising the need to have different variations up his sleeve",3
 Weve got to make sure were not fully showing our hand,1
" Weve got to keep some combinations back and keep the All Blacks guessing a little about what the final squad might be The way things are going that might not be necessaryGatlands opposite number, Steve Hansen, will certainly expect to see most of this side trotting out at Eden Park",3
" Anthony Watson, for now, appears to have jumped ahead of Liam Williams on the wing while the No15 jersey looks to be Leigh Halfpennys to lose Teo might not have been everyones Test inside-centre before the tour but has looked more comfortable there to date than Robbie Henshaw",2
" Maro Itoje has also been invited to prove he can offer more than Alun Wyn Jones; Gatland will be inclined to revert to the Welshman alongside George Kruis as his starting Test lock combination but that could yet change should Itoje has a stormerRhys Webb and Dan Cole, assuming full fitness, must also be contenders to replace Greig Laidlaw and Kyle Sinckler on the bench, although the latter is proving one of this squads most engaging, enthusiastic members If Ken Owens and Jack McGrath are to leapfrog Jamie George and Mako Vunipola respectively, meanwhile, they are going to have to buck the evidence of this tour so farOn a beautiful sunny day beside Lake Rotorua, Vunipola was also prominent on the list of suspects after the backs finished their session to discover some mischievous forwards had either tied together their training shoe laces or removed them completely Smiles were soon wiped off faces, though, when the NZ Maoris squad was unveiled a couple of hours later",5
" With the quicksilver Chief Damian McKenzie at fly-half, Nehe Milner-Skudder and the equally elusive Rieko Ioane on the wings and the dangerous James Lowe at full-back, the Lions will be in for a breathless afternoon if they allow their opponents any time or space McKenzie, even if closely policed, has the pace and skill to outwit the most aggressive rush defence with a clever chip or two The Lions cannot hold too much back if they want to emerge victoriousBritish & Irish Lions L Halfpenny; A Watson, J Davies, B Teo, G North; J Sexton, C Murray; M Vunipola, J George, T Furlong, G Kruis, M Itoje, P OMahony, S OBrien, T Faletau Replacements K Owens, J McGrath, K Sinckler, I Henderson, S Warburton, G Laidlaw, D Biggar, E Daly",5

"The Sunderland goalkeeper, in Poland on England Under-21 duty, had wanted to postpone a decision until after the European Championship but Everton have moved swiftly to seal what would be a record transfer for a British keeper",1
"Having agreed to meet Sunderlands asking price for the 23-year-old earlier this week, with add-ons taking the fee to 30m, Everton sent members of their medical team to Poland to complete the next stage of the transferPickfords arrival will be part of a significant outlay by Everton this summer, with Ronald Koeman also close to adding fellow Dutchman Davy Klaassen to his midfield Everton are understood to be at an advanced stage of negotiations with Ajax for their captain and are interested in the Burnley defender Michael Keane, Swansea Citys Gylfi Sigurdsson and Malaga striker Sandro RamrezEvertons director of football, Steve Walsh, has travelled to Italy to discuss potential arrivals from Serie AGareth Southgate has given a bleak assessment of Englands status on the back of their demoralising defeat by France and made it clear there is no magic wand to help the national team back to a position where they can cope against eliteopponents",5
"Southgate, reflecting on only three wins from eight games in charge, said every part of the team needed improvement and admitted the 3-2 defeat at the Stade de France, against a side who had to play with 10 men for virtually the entire second half was the first time since taking the job he had been angry with his players in the dressing roomThere was no point raising my voice but equally you cant sugarcoat what happened in that final 30 minutes, Southgate said",2
 I dont think that does any harm,1
" I think they know anyway, they are a very honest group of players Its a big challenge",2
" I played the last time we won in France, 20 years ago, and actually we got battered for a lot of that game and scored a goal on the counter",1
Thats the reality of where we are as a country,1
" We have some young players coming through who have really good potential and can be exciting but there is no shortcut I am afraid there is no magic wand but we are recognising where we are short, we are recognising where we can exploit teams",2
" Weve had some joy doing that but our game, in all areas, without the ball has to improveSouthgates wins have come against Malta, Scotland and Lithuania but the manager said he did not regret choosing difficult opponents for the friendly fixtures",2
" His team have already been beaten by Germany, with a return game planned for Wembley in November, and drew with Spain during his spell as the caretaker managerSouthgate was also frustrated by the 2-2 draw against Scotland at Hampden Park on Saturday but the defeat in Paris represents the biggest disappointment of the new era, not least because he noted some of the teams old flaws once Raphal Varane had been sent off England, he said, had become anxious as soon as they had the extra man",3
"I am bitterly disappointed to be 2-2, with them down to 10, and not at least take a draw, Southgate said But I am not shocked I saw France a lot last summer [during Euro 2016] I know the power and athleticism they have and the speed I also know where we are as a team and the hard work that lies ahead to try to bridge the gap between the three teams weve played",5
"The only way we can understand the gap is by playing these teams If wed played lesser teams and won maybe we would all be getting excited and thinking we are better than we actually are The reality is to find out exactly where we are against the very best Weve had two matches away and one at home and for long periods weve acquitted ourselves well But we have a bit to do and I think its important, as a group of players and a group of staff, we recognise that",5
He added: If wed lost to lesser teams then that would be a bigger concern,1
 I know we are improving and I know the players are receptive but I also know thats not going to happen in the space of two or three months Ive got to keep that at the forefront of my mind I want the players to feel disappointed because they have to recognise the moments when they have an opportunity to get a really good result,3
"Southgate had used Tuesdays friendly to experiment with a 3-4-3 system but a bad night for England does not necessarily mean him reverting to an orthodox backfour I dont think the goals we have conceded are anything to do with either system, he said",2

 The 55-year-olds position had been the source of speculation and rumour for some time with a section of Saints supporters displeased with their teams style of play and results under the Frenchman,1

"We wish Claude well for the future The search for a new management team is underway We are confident we will find the right fit in line with the long term vision of the clubHaving arrived last June as the successor to Koeman following the Dutchmans departure to Everton, Puel led Southampton to eighth in the Premier League and to the final of the EFL Cup, where they were somewhat unlucky to lose 3-2 to Manchester UnitedDespite the positivity around Southamptons Wembley appearance in February, they lost 16 league games to slip down the table after Koeman had delivered sixth place before moving to Goodison Park",5
"Saints also suffered early exits from the FA Cup and the Europa League Come the final game of the season, a 1-0 home defeat to Stoke, fans appeared to have turned against Puel, chanting You dont know what youre doing and booing the managerRumours of player unrest have continued into the summer and, on the day which saw the 2017-18 fixtures released, Puel has departed just 12 months into a two-year contract Southampton start the season at home to Swansea on 12 AugustThose in positions of authority may be soft targets for vociferous abuse but nobody has matched the United States Golf Associations fuelling of such fires",5

" Twelve months earlier, the worlds best players had erupted in fury regarding the dreadful condition of greens at Chambers BayGolfs governing body in the US was embroiled in further chaos in April, a womens major having descended into farce after a ruling based on contact from a television viewer; 24 hours earlier",2
" And there is more; at the conclusion of the USWomens Open of 2016 the USGAs president, Diana Murphy, continued a propensity for erratic speech-making by continually calling the winner by the wrong name Pieced together, this is like professional sport meets Eldorado",2
"In their traditional, eve of tournament address at the US Open, the USGAs leading lights were not 100% convincing over whether a repeat of the Johnson scenario will be avoided",1
" There has, at least, been an admission that things went badly wrong in Pennsylvania and a move to improve on archaic processesSomething like the last couple of years affects our whole organisation, Mike Davis, the USGAs executive director, said Any time your competency comes into question that affects the people who are dealing with the history of the game and helping to grow the game Of course, we want to avoid these things but sometimes things happenSpecific issues at Erin Hills are partly within the USGAs control and partly not",5
" A huge property  some capital cities are smaller  will inevitably lead to tediously long rounds The USGA slashed back areas of thick fescue rough early this week but deny that was a response to widespread complaints from players It is not as if we dont listen to feedback from players, Davis said",3
" But in this case it had absolutely zero to do with what the players were saying We look at some spots and said, simply: This is not going to play properly",2
"The great unknown comes in the form of weather, which is infamously changeable at this time of year in the Midwest Early predictions suggest heavy rain will have an impact, most notably on the first round",2
"Almost a fortnight has passed since Phil Mickelson informed the USGA he likely would not participate in the one major thus far absent from his CV, with the left-hander keen to attend his daughters high school graduation on Thursday lunchtime in San Diego Davis  with a straight face  claimed it was pure coincidence Mickelson was given a late time for the first round, thereby keeping alive the possibility of competing should a significant weather delay ariseThis situation is not particularly impressive, with the clear inference the pin-up boy of US golf is being assisted in a manner that would not be forthcoming towards others Given the timescales involved, and in avoiding uncertainty for others, Mickelson should have been told either to commit to playing or notJohnson arrived in Wisconsin on Tuesday afternoon, his partner having given birth to the couples second child a day earlier",5
" Glory at Oakmont was sufficient for Johnson to finally endorse underlying talent He is now established as No1 in the world; a course where long, straight driving will be essential is surely of benefitJason Day and Rory McIlroy retain precisely the same weapon, with the latters performance after an injury absence of particular intrigue",3
 It is a curious truism that none of the worlds best players enter this major in particularly striking form,1
" The expectancy is of a lower winning score than has been typical over the past 20 years, provided the course is set up in a sensible mannerWe want to afford players a completely clear stage to perform and do their job, Murphy said",2

" Azhar Alis 76 and 57 from his opening partner, Fakhar Zaman, broke the back of the run chase, with Mohammad Hafeez sealing their place in Sundays final at The Oval when he pulled Ben Stokes for four in dominant fashionMorgan pointed to his side failing to adapt to a slow, low pitch that was used 48 hours earlier when Pakistan won their final group game against Sri Lanka  something he felt brought their eighth-ranked opponents into contention",2
"I dont think there was any home advantage, Morgan said We were not over-confident",2
 Knowing we were going to play on a used wicket potentially brought Pakistans game closer to their home [conditions],1
 So it was a big challenge and one that was too far for us,1
"We left ourselves short adapting to conditions Its a big frustration because I think weve played some great cricket in this tournament and we werent anywhere close to it today Fair credit to Pakistan, they played brilliantly",3
"Asked why Pakistans batsmen thrived where his did not, Morgan replied: I think the explanation is they played two days ago on itEngland collapse was not a quickfire horror show of old but rather a slow suffocation that from 128 for two in the 28th over saw them lose eight for 83 Having struck 95 boundaries in their three group stage wins, they passed the rope only 15 times against Pakistan with the impotence summed up by a 64-ball 34 from Stokes made up of ones and twos",3
"Pakistans bowlers must be given their dues, having reacted to Mohammad Amirs late withdrawal because of back spasms with a performance of nous and skill",1
" Hasan Alis three for 35 from 10 overs shone brightest, earning him the man of the match award and taking him to 10 wickets for the tournament and the top of the bowling charts Each one has been met with the slippery seamers now trademark chest-thumping celebrationI think the pitch was very good, said Sarfraz, whose side have defied all expectations since their opening defeat against India",3
" It was good for both teams We played very good cricket, thats why we won",2

" Weve got a long way to go until we reach the level we want to get to and a level I believe were good enough to get toWarren Gatland, look away now After preparations for the Test series against New Zealand were dented, if not derailed, by a second midweek defeat, the size of the task awaiting the British & Irish Lions has come sharply into focus with Steve Hansen naming the strongest All Blacks side available to face Samoa on Friday",3
"Aaron Smiths selection at scrum-half, in favour of the in-form TJ Perenara, is perhaps the most eye-catching choice considering his slump last year while the Barrett brothers  Beauden, Scott and Jordie  may make history as the first set of three siblings to play in the same New Zealand side, if the latter two come off the bench",1
" What strikes most about Hansens side, however, is the heavy artillery it contains It is ostensibly a fixture for New Zealand  who have not played together since last November  to get rid of any lingering rust but increasingly, and considering the Lions have lost two of their four matches so far, it presents the opportunity to make a statement",2
"Kieran Read, Dane Coles and Ryan Crotty are all absent through injury  though Read and Crotty are expected to be fit for the first Test  but Ben Smith captains the side from full-back, having missed out on the Highlanders win against the Lions on Tuesday Sonny Bill Williams plays his first international since the 2015 Rugby World Cup final alongside Anton LienertBrown in the centres while Israel Dagg, the top international tryscorer in 2016, keeps his place on the right wing despite the form of Waisake Naholo against Gatlands side in Dunedin Julian Savea will start on the opposite flank",3
"Up front, Joe Moody, Codie Taylor and Owen Franks reprise the front row that came off second best for the Crusaders against the Lions  in the eyes of the referee Mathieu Raynal at least  while Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock again combine in the second row Jerome Kaino makes his first appearance since April following knee surgery  his performance will be of great interest to Hansen  while Sam Cane is at openside flanker and Ardie Savea is named at No8",2
"In total, it is a match-day 23 with 871 caps  Jordie Barrett and the back-rower Vaea Fifita are due to win their first from the bench, where they are joined by the Highlanders fly-half Lima Sopoaga, Nathan Harris, Charlie Faumuina, Wyatt Crockett, Scott Barrett and Perenara Sopoaga gets the nod with Aaron Cruden nursing a knee injury but he is another expected to be in contention next weekHansen rarely resists the temptation to throw a few barbs in the Lions direction but the fact that New Zealand have even arranged this match  they rarely bother with warm-up games before a series  can be considered a sign of respect",3
" The opportunity to blow away the cobwebs outweighs the danger posed by a fired-up Samoa leaving a mark on any of Hansens playersWhilst we asked for this game to help us prepare for the Lions series, once it became a reality, it then took on its own importance, this is a Test match against a quality and very capable opponent, he said Samoa are about to kick off the qualifying stage of their Rugby World Cup campaign, so this will make them even more dangerous",3
 The Samoans are always a challenge and will play with a high level of physicality and skill,1
" At the very minimum, we will need to match thatThis [training] first week has been about bringing together the players from the five different Super clubs and reintroducing them to the All Blacks way Weve had a good week and are really looking forward to this match",3

" Even better, they say the sun is going to make an appearance as well A fitting climax to the tournament is in prospect",2
"Pakistan may not have taken on the role of cornered tigers, a description Imran Khan as captain coined so effectively in the 1992 World Cup in Australasia but Sarfraz Ahmeds motley side are putting up a good fight Back then a Pakistan team far more intrinsically gifted than this one were on the brink of being knocked out of the tournament but everything clicked just in time and they went on to beat New Zealand and England in the semi-final and final respectively",2
"When Pakistan were thrashed by India in their first game there was little prospect of them making the semi-finals but two victories, albeit scrappy ones, against an out-of-sorts South Africa and a butter-fingered Sri Lanka, means Pakistan are two games away from lifting the trophy That would be quite a heistAfter the defeat of Sri Lanka, Sarfraz, a resourceful captain and batsman (and probably the slowest runner between the wickets in the tournament), quickly remembered beating England in Cardiff in September last year, which was Pakistans solitary victory in a five-match series",3
" It was not so difficult for him to recall that game since he scored 90 and was the man of the match Thanks to Sarfraz, Pakistan chased down Englands 302In this tournament Cardiff has tended to produce lower scores than the other two venues and that might well suit Pakistan",3
 Not so long ago England were the team better suited to low-scoring ODIs Their strength was reckoned to be in the consistency of their pace bowling and their solid rather than swashbuckling batting In this country they are adept at knocking off totals like the 237 required by Pakistan on Monday,3
Now their approach has changed England have become a good-wicket team,2
 They possess batsmen who can devastate on the benign batting surfaces they now prefer rather than Test style technicians With all those players capable of delivering pyrotechnics they are well-equipped for high-scoring matches on flat pitchesPakistan prefer to play like old England,3
" They do not possess a string of batsmen who can clear the ropes regularly Most of them, with the exception of Fakhar Zaman, like to take their time but they also possess quality pace bowlers such as Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali and Junaid Khan, who is looking a far more effective operator than the man he replaced, Wahab Riaz",2
" This trio can exploit the little bit of uneven bounce and seam movement that has been more evident in Cardiff than at Edgbaston and The OvalNow the sun is coming out, Pakistan may consider recalling their young leg-spinner, Shadab Khan, for the semi-final in place of Fahim Ashraf, who made a useful debut against Sri Lanka",2
" There is a certain paranoia about playing two spinners in Cardiff because of the short boundary at the Taff end but this may be balanced by Englands traditional hesitancy against wrist-spinners (not that they have been that tentative in their recent dealings with Adam Zampa and Imran Tahir) Expect England to keep the bowling personnel used in their past two games, which means selecting both spinners",2
England will start as the favourites after avoiding the rain and romping to three straightforward victories in the group games The advantage of playing at home in the middle of the domestic season means they have more batsmen down the order capable of contributing Many of the other sides have struggled badly once four or five wickets have fallen The lower middle orders have been as rusty as abandoned old bikesIndia are even stronger favourites to win their semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday,5
 They have lost to Bangladesh only five times in the 33 ODIs between the two and this record has been achieved without home advantage India have not had a match on home soil against Bangladesh since 1998,2
" These games have not been regarded as great TV revenue creators, which may explain Indias reluctance to issue an invitation on more than three occasions",1
In the last series between the sides  in Dhaka in 2015  Bangladesh won 2-1,1
" Their team have long shed any inferiority complex and are brimful of gnarled old pros two of whom, Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah, shepherded them to victory against New Zealand at Cardiff last week quite brilliantly Nonetheless it would be astonishing if they could do that at EdgbastonThe most important person on court when the Golden State Warriors won the NBA title again was the man who wept",3
" Sometimes its easy to forget how much their dynasty is because of Steve KerrCould it last without him?For all the talk of the Warriors as the NBAs super villains with two MVPs, four of the games top 15 players and a fleet of role-fillers who would be starters on most other teams, Golden State may be the happiest team in pro sports",2
 They win with joy,1
 How many other great champion teams have said contentment was their top motivator? Michael Jordans Chicago Bulls  of whom Kerr was once a part  never claimed love as the key ingredient in hoisting a trophy,1
"But the Warriors who went 16-1 this postseason, beating Cleveland 129-120 in Mondays Game 5 of the NBA finals, are unlike any other sports empire",1
 They dont motivate with anger They dont belittle one another They win because they like who they are,3
" They win because of culture, thats what makes them so hard to beat",1
" And as long as Kerr stays at Golden State they will remain the leagues best teamWarriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser, who played college basketball with Kerr at Arizona, explained this well when he told me last year: Steve is incredibly important and keen at handling situations where hes able to get what he wants from the players without offending them, without getting into a screaming matchFraser added: Sometimes Im thinking: Hes got to jump these guys, this is not good And the next thing you know he comes in and says something either really positive or very honest and from his heart and articulate and all of a sudden they have turned that problem into something goodThe obvious reaction to Durants signing with Golden State last summer was that he was jumping on the float at the front of the parade",5
" But Durant, who has always been more contemplative and soulful than other superstars, wanted something bigger than a gaudy ring when he joined the Warriors",1
 He had watched the happiness with which they played and he wanted to be a part of it,1
The winning just followed,1
"Few outside the NBA understand how much Kerr matters to the Warriors How could they? With players like Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green how could Golden State lose? The assumption is anyone could coach them to a championship",2
" Didnt Luke Walton lead them to a 39-4 start last year and Mike Brown go 11-0 in these playoffs when Kerr was out with back issues? But as brilliant as Walton and Brown were, the foundation that allowed those wins to come was Kerrs",1
" The aura around the team is hisWarriors general manager Bob Myers, the man who hired Kerr in 2014 didnt fully grasp this himself until the middle of the 2015 finals, when at a tense point in the series he walked into a practice in Clevelands arena and found players blasting music from speakers, kicking soccer balls and laughing as they threw half-court shots Instead of pressure there was euphoria",3
" The Warriors werent fuming under a dark cloud as any other team would in such a situation, they were practicing to be themselvesSitting in the stands I had this epiphany, Myers told the Guardian last year I said: I get itLate last night, after Golden State had won their second title in Kerrs three years with the team, Myers laughed off the label of his team as the NBAs Death StarWere still the same guys, he said",5
 Kevin Durant is a great guy Hes a nice guy,2
 Steph Curry is one of the nicest people you will ever meet I dont think we were ever that I think [with] our personalities people kind of embraced it in a funny kind of way,3
" If thats what they want to call us thats not really who we are I think were just a great group of people that want to play team basketball and dont care who gets the creditKerrs style works because much like San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich  a Kerr mentor  he doesnt make the team about himself He hates being the celebrity coach, grabbing the spotlight, rambling on about his theories It was telling that during Monday nights celebration, ESPNs Doris Burke had to plow through the players celebrating on the stage to get the coach to talk about his teams victory",5
 Most coaches would have made sure to be her first interviewThats why the greatest threat to the Warriors empire is not LeBron James and the Cavaliers or the Spurs or the Celtics or any of the leagues rising teams,2
" The greatest threat to Golden States continued dominance is Kerrs fragile back He has been in pain since his surgery after the first title in 2014 with the spinal cord fluid leak that forced him off the bench the first three rounds of the playoffs being the latest in a string of agonizing incidentsI dont know if he can do this very much longer, a Kerr associate recently told The Veriticals Adrian Wojnarowski",3
 Two weeks ago Kerr himself told the San Jose Mercury News his situation is unprecedented and said We have to figure everything out this summer,1
"Its hard to imagine Kerr pushing through the hurt, twisting his body into airplane seats and running up and down the court in dress shoes 100 nights a year If the pain persists he will have to leave and when he goes, the string that holds the Warriors together goes too That isnt to say Brown cant take Golden State to more championships He is an excellent coach But his way isnt Kerrs way",5
 No ones is,1
"The Warriors culture is like none in the NBA Its still amazing to see the ease with which Durant slipped into a team that had just set a record for wins in a season Kerr is lucky to have superstars such as Durant and Curry who put the team above themselves, but he is also the coach who gives them their joyWithout it they are just another team with a lot of good playersIf a second midweek defeat of the tour has brought the Lions down to earth, there is equally no need for Warren Gatland to panic",5
" There were positives in the 23-22 defeat in Dunedin  they outscored the Highlanders three tries to two after all  but many of their failings against the Blues returned It was a breathless match, the best so far, but the Lions were found wanting in the final stages Should Owen Farrell rather than Greig Laidlaw have kicked at goal considering it was his first involvement? Should Elliot Daly have allowed the clock to run down by lining up his long-range penalty? And why did the Lions not attempt to drive over from the late lineout? Both midweek defeats have been inflicted in the final six minutes when, as history has repeatedly shown, New Zealand are able to raise their game",3
 The Lions must at the very least not allow theirs to fall apart,1
The back row was always going to be complicated  Taulupe Faletau may be nailed on at No8 but flankers are proving more difficult Sam Warburton did not have a good first half but he made significant improvements thereafter,2
" It is hard to see Gatland leaving him out but Sean OBrien was simply superb against the Crusaders He could go to blindside but Peter OMahony is another in the frame, as is CJ Stander, who like Warburton, grew into this match",2
" Justin Tipuric has shone in patches but the fact he was given 13 minutes in a contest tailor-made for him shows how desperate Gatland is for Warburton to prove his fitness Considering the Lions struggled in the collisions and at the breakdown on Tuesday, OBrien and the Warburton of the second half would seem the right blend but Gatland must be ruthless if his captain is not up to speed",2
"Defence and discipline, so pivotal against the Crusaders, were considerable blots on the Lions copybook The penalty count was 12 as the Highlanders often got the better of the breakdown",2
 George Kruis and his fellow forwards were effective at cleaning out rucks in Christchurch but that was not the case in Dunedin,1
" The line speed was there but the Highlanders saw it coming and continually kicked, using a mixture of chips, crossfield kicks and grubbers",1
 It did not always work  Tommy Seymour scored an intercept try from a Lima Sopoaga kick  but it caused the Lions problems and the All Blacks fly-half Beauden Barrett is the best in the world kicking from hand,1
" One poor pass aside, Sopoaga looked assured and while Steve Hansen needs no reminder of Waisake Naholos qualities, he showed what a threat he can beThat the scrum toiled will be a source of great frustration for Graham Rowntree and it cannot all be put down to the fact the referee, Angus Gardner, officiates on the Super Rugby circuit That no doubt played its part  Dan Cole was furious with one scrum penalty against the Lions  and so Rowntrees anger will be tempered by the fact two of the Tests will be refereed by Frenchmen",3
" Nonetheless, it is a worry, particularly as the scrum got worse as the game wore on The Highlanders pack isare underrated and contained only one All Black but if the Lions front-row replacements are supposed to be one of their biggest strengths, it was certainly not the case in Dunedin",2
"Courtney Lawess premature departure meant Alun Wyn Jones entered the fray earlier than Gatland would have wanted and that may give Maro Itoje the chance to stake his claim for a Test spot by playing against the Maori All Blacks on Saturday There were not too many who advanced their hopes of featuring against New Zealand, other than maybe Kyle Sinckler and Rhys Webb, who seem destined for a bench role In terms of front-row and back-three starters, no one is ahead of the chasing pack and while Jonathan Joseph caught the eye, he also made mistakes Robbie Henshaw was better but it is hard to look past Ben Teo if Gatland wants muscle at No12 Most telling will be whether Jonathan Sexton and Owen Farrell start together on Saturday",5
" It would potentially allow Gatland a 6-2 bench split, with a bit more heft in someone like Iain Henderson, who showed his true colours against the HighlandersAs part of Tom Jenkins series of films the Guardian spoke to Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations",2
" Ever since he assumed the position in August 2015 the sport has been mired in crisis  from allegations of deep-rooted corruption during the tenure of his predecessor, Lamine Diack, to state-sponsored doping and a battle to engage a new generation of participants and viewers Even as the popularity of running has boomed, the status of athletics has declined in inverse proportion and a sport that once commanded peak-time viewing is among those battling for its life in the face of myriad challengesGuardian Sport: How do you begin regaining trust in your sport?SC: You have to start somewhere",3
 My instincts were that we had to start by rebuilding the foundations The first year was not a page turner but we moved the dial a long way very quickly,2
" In the course of a year we rewrote the constitution of the sport, we created the integrity unit and that is up and running It doesnt answer the next question, which is OK, thats fine but how does that really manifest itself in terms of a return to trust? I tend to think of a triangle  you need trust, you need good leadership and you need relevance The one crucial asset my sport has is that more people globally do what we do than any other sport The first advantage we have is more people run than cycle or swim or do triathlon",5
 We have to make sure the people doing that in their millions feel an affinity with what is going on in the sport and feel this is a movement they want to be part of and not a movement that is taintedYour sport has been brought to its knees by a succession of crises Is it not fatally undermined?SC: I dont want to remotely diminish the importance or the challenge of those various crises,3
 But I do draw comfort from sitting in the crowd at meetings,1
" I do compete in Parkruns, I do compete in 10ks  albeit at the back of the field  and Ive not found there has been any loss of excitement or ambition about being involved in the sport People have been able to separate their own enjoyment of being involved in the running movement without it being undermined by the fragilities elsewhere We dont like those fragilities, they have hit us hard and they have damaged us",3
 But they are not stopping people wanting to be part of our sport There was no sign last year of a diminution of the gates at our stadiums,2
"But wont it reach a tipping point?SC: Weve got to do everything we can as quickly as we can to make sure we dont reach that tipping point Rio as a sporting event, particularly for athletics, was the best event weve had We had more records than ever before, more countries competing than ever before and more countries winning medals than ever before Poor leadership doesnt impact on performance, because the athletes repeatedly punch through the fragilities weve hadBut clearly there must be a link between the evaporation of trust and whether parents want their children to take up the sport or watch it?SC: When I set off on the path of reform I had two groups absolutely at the top of my list in order to protect and preserve and create confidence",5
" The first was the clean athletes  if were in a system where no one cares if athletes are clean or not, then were in the knackers yard The other group are parents",2
" They have a huge impact on the sport their kids take up We cant have parents and grandparents thinking: Hmm, maybe athletics isnt the sport for us because there is going to be a risk that at the age of 16 or 17 youre going to have an unscrupulous coach or a chancer agent saying there is a shortcut to doing what most of us have done cleanly for most of our athletics career They were the two groups those reforms were absolutely aimed atIn todays fragmented world with so many choices open to young people, can athletics ever be among the top three or four sports in the country again?SC: I dont know If Im being honest maybe not",5
" But there is a great deal we can do to restore support and trust in the sport We have to be more innovative, we have to be braver and more creative in formats The first thing I said when I became president was that we have to think differently",3
" The Australians did They came forward with Nitro Its not going to be the universal panacea You might not see elimination miles in London this summer or the Olympics in 2020, but there are some clues there There was better athlete engagement, the event was over in just over two hours, the stadium didnt look like a car boot sale",5
" You were focusing on one event per moment and young people seemed excited In a country hemorrhaging athletics support, we had full stadiums",2
 Are we going to get back to the point where the Nine OClock News breaks into a world record attempt of mine in 1981? Possibly not But there is a lot more we can do to be more relevant and more exciting,2
 Weve got to be brave about itWhy hasnt the sport evolved?SC: The sport has been too beltway,2
 Weve spoken to each other I won the English Schools title 44 years ago and the format hasnt changed Im pretty much watching the same format over the same period of time,3
" I cant think of any sport thats remained inviolate to change for that amount of time Twenty20 has done it well, look at Rugby Sevens",2
 Look at Formula-E,1
" Even watching Chelsea the other day, I noticed the player of the match was selected by the fans To say Usain Bolt, probably the most recognisable athlete on the planet, doesnt get into the top 30 on Snapchat or Instagram is pretty insightfulHow can you cope without Usain Bolt?SC: We need to work harder to make sure that the Wayde van Niekerks, the David Rudishas and the Valerie Adamses are being given the horsepower to help fill the void But there is going to be a void, no doubt about it No one immediately found a replacement for Muhammad Ali but plenty of great boxers came along in his wake",5
" There isnt going to be another Usain Bolt for some time but there are things we can do to lessen the impact of that lossThese are practical things What about the more philosophical impact of the cynicism that now surrounds your sport and others? Has it gone too far?SC: No, it hasnt",3
" Sport has gone through what global financial organisations have been through, the Church, the royal family",1
 Thats what sport has been through and we have to adjust to it,1
 What sport hasnt properly understood is that the basis of power has changed,1
 My federation was founded in 1912 and I only had five predecessors It will come as huge relief to my family that I dont intend to be there for 31 years I think what sport hasnt properly understood is that the average CEO probably only stays for five years You need oxygen and you need change You need a churn of people coming in and you need outsiders coming in,5
 Sport doesnt have the monopoly of wisdom and it does need to reach out,1
 Were not too far down the road to make sure we put the right things in place to hold on to the upper ground,1
The London Stadium will be sold out this summer for the world athletics championships But a lot of the great things about London 2012 have been undercut by cynicism,2
 Do people feel differently about cycling and athletics than they did then?SC: They probably do,1
" But I dont think thats a permanent shift The point Id make more broadly is that, yes, people want higher standards in sport People want higher standards in business, in schools, in politics, probably in their own families most of the time",3
 Thats a natural human instinct But I alsothinkpeople are capable of saying that by a distance sport has more to offer than the challenges confronting it,2
" We do something in society that no other area doesDoes it matter if someone feels differently about Mo Farah or Bradley Wiggins, given the allegations against them?SC: I would rather people felt complete comfort that what they are watching is legitimate The only thing Id say is that they have, with some justification, should have a greater confidence in what theyre watching than 20 or 30 years ago Systems are better We are discussing it and we wouldnt have been 20 or 30 years ago",5
" We can go back 10 years and take medals off people If you dont go fishing, you cant catch fish Id rather have the embarrassment of some high profile positives and uncovering some uncomfortable things than sitting there in gentle decline",3
" Id rather encounter it front onWhen were back in the Olympic Stadium this summer, will you reflect on the difficulties of the Olympic legacy?SC: We are making a difference I went to the Olympic Park the other day to watch one of my daughters play in a schools hockey tournament",3
" The place was heaving The stadium was being used, the swimming pool was full, there were queues of people trying to get into the velodrome, you couldnt get a court at the tennis centre and there were schools playing on the hockey pitches",2
" Affordable housing, families, life in an area that didnt have that",1
" Inspire a generation wasnt just getting more people to participate, it was about improving elite level sport",1
 We go from London to Rio as the only city that has gone on to secure a bigger medal haul four years later,1
 That has clearly inspired a generation,1
"The British & Irish Lions tour is approaching the rugby equivalent of Amen Corner Negotiate the trips all-important middle fortnight successfully and anything becomes possible down the closing stretch Get it wrong and, as with professional golfers who drop shots at Augustas pivotal holes, it can be hard to restore sufficient equilibriumHence the reason the penultimate midweek game against the Highlanderson Tuesday, before the first Test on Saturday week, carries more significance than might seem obvious at first glance The Lions badly want to maintain the momentum generated by their victory against the Crusaders and numerous examples exist of spirited dirt-trackers playing key roles in successful tours",5
"It is particularly true in New Zealand, where every Lions performance is mercilessly picked over, whether it involves a second-string team or not Memories of the 1993 Lions heavy midweek defeats by Hawkes Bay and Waikato still linger and Gavin Hastings team also lost 37-24 against Otago in the build-up to the first Test Martin Bayfield, Will Carling and Scott Hastings were all injured and the Test series ended in frustrating defeat",3
"If there is one key difference today it is that the Lions management are conscious of the mistakes of past expeditions With two more demanding fixtures against the NZ Maori and the Chiefs also preceding the first Test with the All Blacks at Eden Park, Warren Gatland has made a point of ensuring every player feels at least vaguely in the frame for Test recognition His assistant coach, Andy Farrell, has also emphasised the need to maintain a positive outlook, rather than be simply remembered as whingeing tourists",3
"With so little time to prepare and so much to cram in on the training ground, the Lions made a pact before flying out not to be dragged down by negative factors they cannot control",1
" The one thing we discussed before we left is that there is no bitching or moaning about anything, Farrell said This is the schedule and you get on with it",2
" That is what touring is all about You have to embrace it Preparation is never ideal but there will be no whingeing about it on this tour We will not accept thatInstead they have listened to local complaints about scrummaging, refereeing and dull tactics with quiet enjoyment and Farrells nonchalant response  They have to talk about something  sums up the squads collective view that deeds rather than words will define this tour",5
" That applies, from Farrells perspective, to the midweek team every bit as much as the Test side",1
 We enjoyed Saturday and what I would have felt if I was sat in the stand watching is a sense of excitement I would want to get out there and build on it,2
" Its about making sure we are going in the right direction and improving until we get to the Test matchesBeneath the fixed roof of the Forsyth Barr stadium  the atmospheric modern replacement for the old, forbidding House of Pain at Carisbrook  the priority will be to counter the Highlanders fast-tempo style which bears similarities to what awaits in the Tests",2
" Weve got to be in control of how we want to play the game and be ready for them to hit us at breakneck speed, said Farrell, who helped to mastermind Irelands victory against New Zealand in Chicago last autumn This is the type of test we want because thats exactly what the All Blacks are fantastic at We want to keep the ball rolling",3
"A key element against a Highlanders team who have been scoring an average of four tries per game will be the Lions proactive defence, with Farrell still on the lookout for on-field lieutenants capable of constructing an even more impregnable wall",1
" It aint about just sprinting off the line, its about adapting to the situation, Farrell said Its about numbers on feet and covering space I thought our decision-making was very good last SaturdayIm still looking for defensive leaders I think everyone should be a leader in defence because, if somebody messes up, everyone pays for it",5
 Im still looking for people to grab hold of the system and take it forward Well see who steps up,2
"The Lions are keen to underline their attacking ability on a hard, fast track but over the next fortnight much will also hinge on keeping their own try-line intactBritish & Irish Lions J Payne; J Nowell, J Joseph, R Henshaw, T Seymour; D Biggar, R Webb; J Marler, R Best, K Sinckler, C Lawes, I Henderson, J Haskell, S Warburton (capt), CJ Stander",2

"They won by three wickets when chasing a modest target of 237 but they needed an unbroken 75-run eighthwicket partnership  aided by dropped catches by the Sri Lankans  from the captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, and Mohammad Amir to secure their progress in the tournament The last time Pakistan played England in Cardiff, in September 2016, they won so Sarfraz declared confidence is high before the semi-final",2
England are a worldclass team They have been very good for the last two years,2
" So we must play more positively against them, he said Today our bowlers did very well at crucial times, Im concerned by our middle order but we will sit down tomorrow and sort those problems out",2
"All credit goes to the bowlers, Junaid [Khan] and Amir played very well Im very impressed with Fakhar [Zaman], too",2
 He is a good prospect,1
 Sarfraz is a relatively new captain but is relishing the task,1
" Im really boosted by my innings [61 not out], he said",1
"Pakistan were expected to defeat SriLanka but they will not be favourites against an in-form England and Sarfraz implied that this would offer his side more freedom as the underdogs Sarfraz will be free to take on the tournament hosts despite being fined 20% of his match fee, while his team-mates were fined 10% for their slow overrate against Sri LankaAn Argentina side boasting a midfield trio of Juan Romn Riquelme, Esteban Cambiasso and Pablo Aimar and a defence featuring Walter Samuel won their second consecutive Under-20 World Cup, using Jos Peckermans floating 3-5-2 formation to devastating effect in Malaysia Argentinas top scorer, Bernado Romeo, despite playing alongside future Serie A, La Liga, Champions League and Copa Libertadores winners, did not enjoy such a distinguished career, managing four caps for the national side in a career that came to an underwhelming end in 2012 at San LorenzoA far cry from the golden generation of Spanish footballers that would dominate the late 2000s, the teams attack was led by Pablo Couago, a man more closely associated with the Tractor Boys than tiki-taka",5
" While Couago now plies his trade at the Spanish fourth-tier club Alondras CF, his then team-mates Xavi Hernndez and Iker Casillas boast seven Champions Leagues, 13 domestic titles and 300 caps between them to go alongside World Cup and European Championship winners medals Couago never received a Spain call-up",2
"Javier Saviola won the Golden Ball and the Golden Boot, following a record 11 goals in seven games",1
" The youngest player on Pels list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004, he won league titles in Spain, Portugal and Greece as well as a Copa Libertadores at his boyhood club, River Plate",1
" Portsmouth fans may remember his team-mate Andrs DAlessandro, who played for the club on loan from Wolfsburg",1
 Both went on to star in an Argentina side who claimed gold at the 2004 Olympic Games and finished runners-up in the Copa Amrica of the same year,1
"In a team featuring Dani Alves and Fernandinho, Dudu Cearense was arguably Brazils oustanding player, scoring four in seven games in the United Arab Emirates Dudus journeyman career has taken him to Japan, France, Russia and Greece, while Alvess career at Sevilla, Barcelona, and now Juventus has led many to consider him the greatest fullback of all time",2
" The Golden Ball went to the UAEs Ismail Matar, who has spent his career in his homeland with Al-Wahda (bar a twogame loan at Al-Sadd in Qatar)Following in a proud tradition of Argentinian attacking talent, this tournament gave a glimpse into the future superstardom of Lionel Messi",2
" Like Saviola before him, he claimed the Golden Ball and Boot as La Seleccin continued their dominance of the competition With a record five Ballon dOr victories, Messi has more than lived up to the hype Maybe there is hope for 2017s Golden Ball winner, DominicSolanke",3
"Another victory for Argentina and another player secured the Golden Boot and Golden Ball double, this time Sergio Agero The striker, having played 84 minutes in the previous tournament, delivered with aplomb, scoring six times, including the opener in the final Whereas Agero has developed into one of the worlds most feared strikers, the other goalscorer in the final in Toronto, Mauro Zrate, has seen his career stall following a series of poor transfersBreaking the South American monopoly, and claiming Africas first and to date only Under-20 World Cup title, Ghana were powered to the title by Dominic Adiyiahs eight goals in seven games and overcame a much fancied Brazil on penalties in the final Adiyiahs career has been a case of could have been but never really was",5
" A move after the tournament to Milan, for whom he failed to make a start, was followed by a rapid decline as he failed to score for four clubs A move to Thailand has seen Adiyiah return to the score sheet, with 38 goals in 58 games for NakhonRatchasima  a far cry from the San Siro",2
"An Oscar hat-trick in the final inspired Brazil to their fifth Under-20 World Cup victory, one shy of Argentina Although the former Chelsea man impressed in that game, Fifas player of the tournament was Henrique with five goals in seven games As seems to be the case with non-Argentinian Golden Ball winners, though, Henriques career has been disappointing",3
" He has played for eight teams at the age of 26, his only prolific spell coming in 2015 at Coritiba, where he managed 12 in 20 Danilo and Casemiro have gone on to great success at Real Madrid and Alex Sandro has proved to be the perfect foil for Alves at JuventusA team containing Paul Pogba, Samuel Umtiti, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Kurt Zouma ensured France were the first nation to win all five Fifa tournaments in mens 11-a-side international football",3
" Pogbas performances came a year after his free transfer to Juventus, where he would become one of the worlds most sought-after midfielders, before returning to Manchester United for a record fee Pogbas career is in stark contrast to that of Paul Charrau, who is on loan at Ligue2s ParisFC",2
"An unfancied Serbia defeated a Brazil side containing Gabriel Jesus, delivering a first success to the Balkans since the breakup of Yugoslavia",1
" The goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic and midfielder Andrija ivkovic secured individual honours, with the former claiming the Golden Gloves award after Serbia conceded three goals all tournament and the latter winning goal of the tournament for his free-kick against Mexico",1
" Zivkovic is the next great hope for Serbian football, holding the record for the youngest player to represent his country and recently winning a domestic treble with Benfica Rajkovic has established himself at Maccabi Tel Aviv",2
Heres an argument for the office this week: this is the most unpredictable and engrossing season of AFL football ever Discuss,2
" If we limit the frame of reference to the weekend just gone, it is an easy argument to makeUsually come winter the herd begins to thin, but after a weekend where Brisbane dismantled Fremantle, Essendon humiliated Port Adelaide and the 17th-placed Carlton wrung out a win and a great deal of fun against second-placed Greater Western Sydney, evaluating anything this season can be done just as effectively by shaking a Magic 8 Ball as it can be by watching hours of filmIn the twilight of Saturday, two days after re-signing forward Josh Schache, the hitherto unloved Brisbane Lions played like a club set free from heavy chains  although Dayne Zorko has hardly been bound this year, metaphorically or otherwise Through 12 weeks, the Brisbane best-and-fairest winner is the only player not named Dusty or Dangerfield to have averaged more than 25 possessions, five clearances and a goal a game By half-time on Saturday, hed already racked up 19, eight and one respectively",5
"In the traditional football states, the 5ft 9in Zorko is like one of those slightly distorted airport announcements you dont quite catch but suspect might be important There is no doubting his importance to Brisbane, just as there is no doubt that to break through for a thumping 57-point win after a run of nine losses matters to a young group like the LionsAt some point in time you need to get some emotional nourishment for the group and we were able to get that tonight, said Brisbane coach Chris Fagan",3
" Weve still got a long way to go, but thats the brand we want to playOne club that knows a little about brand is Essendon, and on Saturday they went some way to re-establishing their on-field reputation with a dominating performance against Port Adelaide that only the most partisan Bomber fans would have seen coming  and even most of them would not have anticipated what they saw from Cale HookerHooker won Essendons best-and-fairest as a defender in 2015, but has been a point of fan frustration and online forum contention this year due to John Worsfolds persistence in playing him forward It cant have been much fun for Hooker going from the key man down back to being the support act up forward, but after five first-half goals, there was no doubting who was the star among many at Etihad Stadium on Saturday nightBut there is something of Sisyphus in Essendon",5
" Jobe Watson, Zach Merrett and Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti play in an exciting, daring fashion that delights the football world, and then their fans boo Port Adelaides Paddy Ryder every time he touches the ball",1
"Having initially expressed a desire to remain with the Bombers during the supplements saga, the scrutiny eventually wore Ryder down and he requested a trade at the end of 2014",1
"That Ryder served a 12-month ban last year along with 33 of his former team-mates shouldve been enough to provide some perspective to those Essendon fans that booed Then again, if a concern raised last week by former Bomber Nathan Lovett-Murray over the health of his daughter (who was conceived after the Bombers 2012 supplement program) was not enough to provide a sympathetic disposition, than the cause is likely a lost one",2
"Sympathy and the Carlton Football Club have been strangers for some time, but in the dying light of Sunday afternoon, even neutral football fans were willing them to a win against Greater Western Sydney",1
"In most sports there exists a proxy war between proponents of the high-octane offence practiced by the Giants and traditionalists who insist that such systems inevitably falter to a superior defence The traditionalist line of thinking isnt as easily marketable for a club in the early days of a rebuild, but just because its not an easy sell doesnt mean that its not worth buying  and the Blues players and supporters have bought inThe primordial game style from which the Carlton reinvention is evolving is built around a defensive structure (of which former Giants, Lachie Plowman and Caleb Marchbank are important pieces) that could one day see Brendon Bolton receive Queens Birthday honours for his work as footballs foremost civil engineer",3
" Although it must be said that Carltons defensive structure is built on one of the games most fundamental of principles  the spare manOn Sunday, the Giants midfielders won almost twice as many clearances and blew Carltons doors off for inside 50s",2
 Yet the Blues were able to absorb just about everything the Giants threw at them and then swing to attack through the agency of Sam Docherty That Docherty is regularly spoken as an All-Australian half-back-flanker is of no surprise to those whove watched his progress during the past two years That Liam Jones was spoken of as an influential defender is a surprise,3
" In a list of adjectives likely to be ascribed to Jones, influential falls somewhere well below flakey",1
" After an indifferent career as a forward and navy blue whipping boy, Jones was impressive at reading the play, flew confidently into packs and at hit a target with all but one of his 14 possessionsBut if any one player personified the passion in Carltons gritty one-point win, it was 150th-gamer Matthew Kruezer And if there was one play that personified the man those at the club call Tractor it was the one with 11 minutes to go in the last quarter when he barrelled over his opponent, followed up and kicked the ball off the ground 40 metres into the arms of Dale Thomas who set up Matthew Wright for what would prove a crucial goal It was another example of how Kruezer plays football as though it is the central trouble of his life  so much so that you suspect the feeling he gets from busting through packs will stick with him like a phantom-limb sensation long after his football career is over But given the 28-year-old is in career-best form, you suspect theres a fair bit of football to play out yet",5
And theres plenty to play out in this most unpredictable of seasons,1
" Wins on the weekend from Carlton, Brisbane and Essendon were less an act of footballing rug pulling than an alteration of perspective There is no such thing as a certainty in such an unpredictable season  and Mondays game between Melbourne and Collingwood in front of more than 70,000 at the MCG provided further proof of that",2
"In what was undeniably one of the games of the season, Melbourne seemed headed for a listless defeat that played into every tired ski-season stereotype before kicking six goals to two in the third quarter to set up an anxious final quarter",1
" It also set the stage for Jack Watts to once and for all exorcise his debut demons from the same game eight years ago, when the Pies targeted the physically and mentally ill-prepared first draft pick Paul Roos, the coach who Watts credits for his decision to stay at Melbourne, still believes Wattss debut was not one of merit, but by virtue of a marketing stunt  one that backfired not just for the club, but for arguably a large part of Wattss oft-criticised careerWith 90 seconds to go and less than a kick in it, Watts grabbed the ball just outside Melbournes 50-metre arc, took a bounce and calmly kicked the sealer from an angle acute enough for Melbourne supporters to ride every one of its 25 metres with hearts in mouths",3
" Having played the role of Melbournes unlikely saviour, Watts extended his arms with an emotion that the confines of the English language could barely do justiceIt was a fitting finale to a round that was, yes the most unpredictable and engrossing  the latest instalment in a year of AFL football that has been illustrative of the broader context of our times, which are for want of a better term, an uncertain and unholy mess",2
"Rafael Nadal made an observation in Paris about his philosophy on life that sounded innocuous enough to dip below the radar of those who were correctly more concerned with the history he had just created but it describes perfectly why he is playing some of the best tennis of his careerHis words reveal, too, that the 31-year-old Spaniard, who has suffered more injuries than is good for his long-term health, is not done just yet",2
"Very organised people, very proactive people, know exactly what theyre going to do next, Nadal said after looking about as organised as is possible on a tennis court in demolishing Stan Wawrinka in three sets to win his 10th French Open I do things as they come Right now, I dont really know",3
" Im just going to keep on playing as long as it makes me happy If one day I get up in the morning and Im no longer motivated to go train, well, I guess that day I will put an end to my career",2
 You know what? Im not worried Im a happy person,2
"Like his oldest rival, Roger Federer, he is playing with the sort of freedom known only to the very young and those who have seen it all",1
It is a joy that might carry Nadal to his first Wimbledon final in seven years He might even win for the third time there,2
" Or, as he admits, he could just as easily fall early if his unreliable knees do not adapt quickly to the peculiar demands of grass, as they did when he lost to the world No100, Lukas Rosol, in the second round in 2012",1
"Nadal, more than most players, has endured extended periods of struggle, when his love for the game has been tested",1
 He almost expects them to returnIn 2005 his emotions were dragged in all directions,2
" He met his long-time girlfriend, Maria Francisca Perello, and won the first of the 10 French championships that set him on his journey to La Decima on Sunday, as well as an unprecedented decade of winning at least one slam every yearHowever, 2005 was also the year that structural weaknesses surfaced in his feet and knees and they have plagued him, to a great or lesser degree, ever since He has been struck down in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2014",3
In 2013 he came back from nearly eight months out to heal ruptured patellar tendons and won two majors among 10 titles and posted 75 match victories,1
" It was an astonishing achievement Bjorn Borg, no slouch on the dirt, was moved to call him the greatest clay-court player to ever play",2
" Carlos Moy, who has since joined him as eventual coaching successor to uncle Toni, described him as a warrior Jimmy Connors remarked at the time: His passion and the way he grinds is really something specialBecause he can play no other way it is easy to take this commitment for granted, without wondering about the price he pays",3
 Last year he had to quit the French Open after two quick wins because of a wrist injury Only this season has he begun to resemble the old Nadal If he looks commanding and fierce on court  so deep in the zone Nadal rarely reacts to extraneous activity  he sometimes appears uncertain of himself,3
" Eight times in one answer on Sunday evening, he used the word doubts",1
" For a long time he had pronounced it doobts He knows how to say it now and he has a proper grasp of its essenceI have been very honest with you all the time, he said",3
" I have doubts every day If you have no doubts, probably [it] is because you are too arrogant I dont consider myself arrogant",3
"What might surprise Nadal, however, is that there is a groundswell of worthwhile opinion saying he can win Wimbledon again It would be on a par with Federers win in Melbourne this year, when he beat Nadal in the final",2
" Even so, nobody  not even uncle Toni or his understudy Moy  would previously have suggested Nadal could conquer the All England Clubs grass againHe told the English-speaking press on Sunday: I love grass, everybody knows, and its a surface that I really enjoyed a lot playing there",2
" However, he said to Spanish reporters later: Grass is not my speciality, but Im very motivated",1
"He nonetheless reminded everyone when beating Wawrinka 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 that clay fits the script for a natural clay-courter who has rediscovered his killing top-spun forehand and now owns a backhand that is nearly as lethal If he stays fit and healthy, he could win another two or three titles in Paris, putting him beyond reach in the record books That might also haul him alongside Federer on 18 majors  although there is no sign the Swiss has finished collecting big silverware",3
" If Nadal rules clay again, Federer likewise is ready to retake his Wimbledon crown",1
 What a story it would be if the draw kept them apart until the last Sunday,1
"It is nine years since Nadal won possibly the best final in the history of grand slam tennis, when, over five sets of almost unbearable intensity, he deconstructed Federers elegance with the sheer power of his will, it seemed",1
"Before they arrived at that 2008 Wimbledon they played in the final at Roland Garros Nadal won 61, 63, 60 It was one of the most humiliating experiences of Federers career",3
 Now Wawrinka has felt the French heat of Nadal before Wimbledon,1
" It would be foolish to predict the Spanish master could not do that double againThe debate over whether medals have been prized over morals in Olympic sport has been escalated by the revelation that talented young women training with a view to sporting glory now allege they were sexually abused in pursuit of their dreamBritish Canoeing and the police are currently investigating the claims These were sportswomen who put their trust in a coach who they claim took advantage of them in the most deplorable way Once more it gives rise to serious questions about duty of care for athletes, a discussion which will reignite on Wednesday with the long awaited publication of the independent report into the culture at British Cycling that was sparked by claims of bullying and discrimination first made by the cyclist Jess Varnish",5
"It has been 14 months since Varnish claimed the then performance director Shane Sutton cruelly advised she get on with having a baby after she was ditched from the high performance squad He also remarked her bottom was too big to ride certain roles on the teamThe affair took a further twist when an independent British Cycling review that cleared Sutton of eight of nine charges was itself found to have sanitised the findings of its grievance officer by a leaked UK Sport commissioned report, the final version of which will be released this week",3
"Disabled riders said they had been referred to as wobblies and gimp, with the six-time Paralympic champion Darren Kenny claiming he felt so bruised by his experiences with British Cycling that he could not bear to display his medals publicly at home Sutton denied the claimsBut Kennys sadness in the face of enormous success raises a potent point about whether the joy of sport was lost in a relentless clamour for more shiny metal to wave around",3
" And of whether UK Sport, the funding body that allocated millions of pounds of exchequer and lottery money, should have asked robust questions about safeguarding, mental health and athlete representationThe independent report is expected to make uncomfortable reading for the governing body, British Cycling, discovering over the course of more than 90 separate interviews that many riders and staff felt bullied and discriminated against",2
" But it is also expected to criticise the funding agency UK Sport for failing to demand accountability, missing opportunities to identify management shortcomings at British Cycling years earlier and to spare much heartacheIt is not just cycling and canoeing, two of Britains best funded Olympic sports  in receipt of more than 50m between them over the last four-year cycle  conducting internal investigations British Swimming is looking into claims of bullying made by Paralympic athletes",3
" An elite coach was alleged to have belittled and criticised athletes, leading to a culture of fearMeanwhile medical staff at GB Taekwondo raised concerns with UK Sport over coaches practices with regard to concussion, weight loss and training loads, including suggestions that athletes were asked to train in saunas According to UK Sport, an independent review found insufficient evidence to support the allegations",3
It is not overblown to say UK Sport is in the midst of a crisis,1
" The contrast with medal-based success is stark In Rio British athletes had their best ever medal haul While there is clearly much good being done behind the scenes  world-class facilities, coaching and an enviable attention to detail in training and competition  there is a case for the no compromise model to be reviewed entirelyThe idea of no compromise was minted by Peter Keen, who set in motion the marginal gains led transformation at British Cycling in 1998 and five years later oversaw its introduction to Olympic sport as a whole It was enormously successful",5
" Great Britain catapulted up the world standings, from 36th place and a solitary gold at the Atlanta Olympics of 1996 to second behind only the USA last summerThe accompanying lottery money allowed athletes to devote themselves entirely to their training, paying for accommodation, food and a range of support services, from physiotherapy to sports science and nutrition",2
"Alongside that a performance director culture took hold, whereby one individual was given power to run his or her programme with relative autonomy Varnish said it was a case of a select few at the top of British Cycling having ultimate power to decide on the future of athletes",2
" She maintains the decision not to renew her contract was personal rather than an objective assessment of ability and potential, while there was scant opportunity for recourseBaroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, an 11-time Paralympic champion, conducted a government-ordered year-long review into duty of care which was published in April",2
" It had seven broad recommendations, one of which was to create a Sport Ombudsman with the power to hold national governing bodies to account for duty-of-care failingsIt also suggested that the British Athletes Commission, an organisation which supports athletes who feel they have no route for making complaints to their own governing body, be independently funded by the government",2
" It is presently funded by UK Sport which presents its own, perceived if not real, problems of conflict of interestIf Grey-Thompsons proposed reforms are acted on, it will go some way to making sure athlete welfare has the same gold standard as Great Britains Olympic performanceIt rains on a ticker-tape parade to remind Englands Under-20s that it will be easier to conquer the world than the obstacles that litter their path to regular Premier League football but they can take comfort from the roots of their triumph in South Korea Sundays World Cup success, Englands best return on the international stage since 1966, repaid a willingness of the Football Association and Premier League to act on concerns over youth development in this country A change in attitude at Premier League clubs could bring further reward",5
"Lewis Cook, the England captain, had only just hoisted aloft the Under20s World Cup following victory against Venezuela in Suwon when the debate began over the future prospects for Paul Simpsons players  with a tone of inevitable, understandable forebodingThe 13 players who featured in the final for England ran up a combined total of 1,094 minutes in the Premier League last season, roughly the equivalent of 12 matches, with Cook having the most, with 431 minutes in the Bournemouth midfield",2
" The match-winner Dominic CalvertLewin, only the third Englishman to score in a World Cup final, comes next with 346 minutes for Everton followed by his club-mate Ademola Lookman on 287 The time then slips away to Josh Onomahs 17 minutes for Tottenham Hotspur while seven of those who played on Sunday did not play a single minute of Premier League football last season",2
"The suspicion that the final could have been as good as it gets for some in the England team deepened when the goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, fresh from making a fine and crucial late penalty save, admitted that his future at Newcastle United was uncertain having spent last season on loan at Kilmarnock in the Scottish PremiershipThose playing statistics are indicative of a league where financial pressures and incentives do not encourage patient development and risks on young talent; and of a competition where some owners are more concerned with grabbing additional money from the broadcasting revenue pool than the international fortunes of what to many is a foreign land But the efforts to clear the pathway for homegrown talent in the Premier League cannot be dismissed with England the world champions at under-20 level, even if the long-term benefits are yet to be seen at senior level",3
"For the FA victory in South Korea rewards its decision to bring uniformity to England coaching at all age levels, to seek greater cooperation with Premier League coaches and to improve team cohesion via their St Georges Park base",1
" Six of Sundays squad featured in Englands European Championship success at under-17 level in 2014 with four  the Golden Ball winner Dominic Solanke, Jonjoe Kenny, Woodman and Josh Onomah  starting against Venezuela More recent and arguably more important changes have taken place within the Premier League as it attempts to counter accusations it is to blame for Englands lamentable recordEngland has not had a problem in the past producing talent that can deliver up to under-18 level",3
" The problem, articulated by a procession of Premier League managers, is the lack of competitive opportunities for players in the 18-21 age bracket",1
" Spain are developing men at that age while Englands players become overprotected, said one There appears little to no chance of the Football League allowing Premier League B teams into its midst, as in Spain, but competition has improved at that age level following consultations with leading coaches in recent years",2
"Last season brought the introduction of Premier League 2 as a replacement for the under-21 Premier League, exposing youngsters to competition against under-23s, relegation and promotion between the two divisions and play-offs in the second tier It was not a cure-all by any means but a start and one that ended with Everton winning the title before sending five players off to the Under-20 World Cup There was also a 20% increase in playing time for homegrown debutants in the Premier League last season, 716 minutes on average, compared with 596 minutes in 2015-16",3
"David Unsworth, Evertons under-23s coach, played for England when they finished third at the 1993 Under-20 World Cup and was one of four from that squad to graduate to the senior side",1
" He was a rare voice in support of the much-criticised Checkatrade Trophy last season, arguing that any competition that heightens pressure on academy players should be embraced But ultimately, he insists, it is individual quality that will determine how many of Simpsons squad establish themselves in the Premier League",2
"They have to enjoy this moment because it can be once in a lifetime, said Unsworth",1
 They should enjoy it and go away and rest,1
 Then they need to come back flying for pre-season  and Im sure they will All five of them are great lads and are desperate to be part of what is going on at our club They have to keep proving themselves Just because they have come through our ranks it doesnt mean they have a divine right to play in our first team They need to prove it every single day in training and they need to earn their places,5
" Theyll all give it their best to get thereIt encourages Calvert-Lewin, Lookman and Kenny, whose performances in South Korea showed Everton do not need to enter the transfer market this summer to sign cover for the injured Samus Coleman, that Ronald Koeman was prepared to trust the clubs young talent last season The same goes for Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham but it needs many more to follow suit for Englands world champions to build on their achievement",3
" English football people say you have to look out for young players, that maybe they can play 15 or 20 games but not more, Koeman said last season",1
 They are afraid,1
" Sunday offered an alternativeThere have been higher-quality games of cricket in this tournament but none yet with such a taut finish Beyond the dropped catches (there were plenty of those) and the overthrows and the wanton strokes there was at the end of Cardiffs sunniest day so far the wonderful tension that knock-out cricket can generateAt the end of it all Pakistan scraped to a victory that should have been so much more straightforward They won by three wickets but they needed an eighth-wicket partnership of 75 between their captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, and Mohammad Amir to get them over the line",5
 Sarfraz produced a captains innings of 61 not out but he was badly dropped on 38 and less culpably on 40 as Sri Lanka faltered in the field in the closing oversThis victory means that England will meet Pakistan in Cardiff in the first semifinal on Wednesday They may be happy about that for the surface here seems to suit some of their team (their bowlers if not their batsmen),3
There has not been much encouragement for bowlers in this tournament but the likelihood of some lateral movement for the fast men has been greater in Wales than in England There may not be much pace in the pitches in Cardiff but good bowlers have sporadically found some movement,2
" In earlier games Tim Southee, Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood have gained some assistance from grass, which Eoin Morgan has described as thatchy",1
"Pakistan, especially with the introduction of Junaid Khan as a replacement for the volatile Wahab Riaz alongside Amir and Hasan Ali, now have a triumvirate of pace bowlers who seem adept at exploiting any help",1
 Hence they may be more dangerous opponents for England than Sri Lanka might have beenTheir pace trio were effective on Monday,2
 Between them they took eight wickets with the debutant seamer Fahim Ashraf also picking up two,1
" Such conditions favour Pakistans style of play They are not so well equipped to chase the mega-totals as their batting lineup may be described as old-fashioned  with the exception of the newcomer Fakhar Zaman, a left-hander who wastes no time But mega-totals in Cardiff are not guaranteed",3
"On a cloudy, mercifully dry day Sri Lanka were restricted to a modest total of 236 Amir and Junaid combined to puncture the Sri Lankan effort, taking four wickets for six runs in four overs Hence the innings subsided to 167 for seven and beyond significant restoration even though Asela Gunaratne and Suranga Lakmal managed to raise the target to 237",3
"Sri Lanka looked to be on target for many more After the early loss of Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis combined to add 56 enchanting runs One ramp over the wicketkeepers head by Dickwella off Junaid was a shot of startling impudence and skill; Kusal Mendis oozed quality in a more orthodox mannerHowever, Mendis was defeated by a lethal in-ducker from Hasan Ali and Dinesh Chandimal dragged his second ball on to his stumps Now Angelo Mathews expertly resuscitated the innings alongside Dickwella so that Sarfraz summoned up his opening bowlers in tandem",5
"Mathews, maybe surprised by extra pace from Amir, was bowled off the inside edge; Dhananjaya de Silva nicked a beauty from Junaid, a fierce introduction to the tournament for a man who has only just been called up as a replacement for Kusal Perera Next Dickwella was brilliantly caught by Sarfraz from an inside edge; the Pakistan captain was swamped by his colleagues in their excitement and in their recognition that this was an extraordinary one-handed take Thisara Perera soon followed as the heart was ripped out of the Sri Lankan innings",3
The Sri Lankan attack does not possess the same potency but theirs is a team of granite resolve When Pakistan were 74 without loss in the 12th over the game seemed over,2
" But some spirited bowling and panicky Pakistan batting soon put a stop to that notionAt the start of the chase Fakhar, who has a licence to swing, drove lustily, taking three fours from a Lasith Malinga over with Azhar Ali a more watchful partner Fakhar reached 50 from 34 balls and was promptly caught on the boundary",3
 No matter; the older grafters would surely take Pakistan to their destinationIt is never that simple,2
 Those grafters contrived to spoon and nick catches and the Sri Lankans under the calm leadership of Mathews started to believe Pakistan plummeted to 137 for six with Sarfraz alone suggesting permanence,2
 In came Fahim for his first international knock and the cricket acquired a technicolour tension,1
" A bouncer from Malinga was hooked into the crowd by Fahim to get off the mark; another was top-edged wide of the long leg fielder He was starting to enjoy thisPerhaps the uncluttered novice would do the trick, as 25 runs were added rapidly",3
" Then a firm straight drive from Sarfraz flicked the fingers of the bowler Perera before hitting the stumps Fahims bat was over the line but not touching the turf and his dream was overSarfraz and Amir stayed cool; Perera at mid-on then dropped a sitter after Malinga had duped Sarfraz, the biggest and most decisive mistake of an error-strewn yet rather magnificent match",3
"Mark Wood is revelling in his role as Eoin Morgans bubble-wrapped strike bowler and heads into Wednesdays semi-final in Cardiff with chest puffed out from the faith that his captain is showing in himEnglands near peril-free passage to the knockout stages of the Champions Trophy, one that sees the management mulling over just a single spot as Jonny Bairstow prepares to replace the misfiring Jason Roy, has owed much to a n on-song bowling attack that boasts Woods game-breaking 90mph missilesA career-best four for 33 against Australia on Saturday included the wickets of David Warner and Steve Smith, with two thirds of his deliveries dot balls, and was reward for a bowler who has battled back from a chronic ankle injury and whose pace and trajectory provides a point of difference in Morgans right-arm seam attackIts a nice feeling to have the confidence of the captain, said Wood, who set up the group-winning performance against New Zealand with the wicket of their key man Kane Williamson Subconsciously I dont know if it makes me try a little bit harder, but at the moment I seem to be getting some of the best players out",5
 Its a nice knack to have and hopefully I can keep it up,1
"You lift up, push your shoulders back, puff your chest out a little bit, you feel like the captain really needs you and you want to be the man who changes the gameWood has returned this summer after three bouts of ankle surgery but with both pace and enthusiasm seemingly undimmed Like Simon Jones in 2005  another skiddy and hostile fast bowler, if more strappingly built  there will always be fears over his longevity but the player himself has reported few ill-effects in this comeback My body is holding up really well, the backroom staff have been fantastic since Ive come back, said Wood, who has made subtle changes to his delivery stride and wears specially-designed boots to minimise pressure on his left ankle They roll me in sellotape and wrap me in bubble-wrap between games and hopefully Ill be ready for the semi-final",5
"Wood, along with Ben Stokes and Liam Plunketts role as a splice-thudding battering ram with some added smarts, is a reminder of the national teams debt to Durhams cricketing conveyor belt of talent",1
"Its great the north-east lads are the ones carrying the team at the minute, said Wood, with a hint of mischief thrown in Theres always north-east pride Being the only county a distance away from the others, weve always considered ourselves a tight-knit group at DurhamBut this England group feel just as tight and together as that one Everyone wants each other to do well, the lads who arent playing are pushing you to keep in the team and they genuinely want you to do well",5
" Weve got one hell of a team and I absolutely love being part of itWood has always spoken with a refreshing honesty and where some players may claim not to look too far ahead, the second Ashes-winning son of Ashington, after Stephen Harmison, is open about targetting this winters tour to Australia and the defence of the urn that was recaptured in 2015 when he detonated Nathan Lyons stumps at Trent BridgeAm I thinking about it? Of course I am, said Wood, who won the last of his eight Test caps on the 2015 tour of the UAE before the ankle was deemed in need of surgery",3
" If I can do well in a white-ball tournament like this, and then back it up by being consistent with the red ball [for Durham], Id love to get back in the Test team",1
"The expected absence of the side-strain afflicted Chris Woakes for the first two Tests against South Africa next month  and with Jimmy Andersons fitness not yet guaranteed following a groin tear  there will be a vacancy in Joe Roots first side as captainEngland are clearly pondering Wood here, having made him available for just the opening fixture of the three-match Twenty20 series against the Proteas in Southampton on 21 June as part of a 16-man squad that has five uncapped players and sees Root, Stokes, Adil Rashid, Moeen Ali and Jake Ball all restedRoot and cos next cricket will be the floodlit County Championship round that begins on 26 June and provides both a return to the four-day groove before the first Test at Lords on 6 July and some valuable time playing time with the pink ball before Englands first day-night Test against West Indies later in the summer",3
"Mason Crane, the Hampshire leg-spinner who broke into the New South Wales team during the winter, has earned his first senior call-up along with the Lancashires thunderous batsman, Liam Livingstone Craig Overton, the Somerset seamer, will replace Wood in the squad for the last two games at his home ground of Taunton and CardiffBairstow will play in the first two matches before returning to Yorkshire, while the uncapped Middlesex left-hander, Dawid Malan, earns a second squad place after going unused by England in their Twenty20s last summer but, like Livingstone, impressing for the Lions",3
"Tymal Mills, the left-arm quick who is the one short-form specialist, misses out due to his restrictive back complaint, with Surreys Tom Curran the fifth newbie as England look to widen their white-ball selection net at a time when the sun is already shining on the first team",1

 Officials at Ascot believe she has not missed a single days racing at the meetings since her coronation in June 1953,1
"The five-day meeting begins on Tuesday and any one of the first four days could now be the new date for the state opening of parliament, when the Queens speech to both houses of parliament, setting out the governments plans for the new session, is the centrepiece of the ceremony",1
"Ascot racecourse never comments in advance on any issues that concern the Queens attendance However, there is an obvious precedent for next weeks possible clash of engagements, as the state opening of parliament took place on the second day of the royal meeting in 2001 The Queen attended a rehearsal for the state opening on Tuesday and then delivered her speech the following day, before travelling to the racecourse by car and arriving in time for the first race",3
"The royal procession down the middle of the course in horse-drawn carriages, which normally takes place about half an hour before the first race at 2",1
"30pm, did not take place on either afternoon as the horses involved had taken part in the ceremonies at Westminster",1
" However, this years state opening is due to take place without the horse-drawn carriages, so a mid-morning slot for the Queens speech, which is in any case expected to be shorter than normal, could allow her to perform the ceremonial duties in the morning and a more recreational role in the afternoonAt present the Queen has only two horses entered at next weeks meeting: Call To Mind, an outsider, in the King Edward VII Stakes on Friday and the strongly fancied Dartmouth, who is priced at around 9-2 to win the Group Two Hardwicke Stakes on Saturdays closing card for the second year runningJenny Pitman, who saddled two Grand National winners during an outstanding training career, and the former leading Flat jockey Philip Robinson are among the 23 members of the British Horseracing Authoritys new Disciplinary Panel and Licensing Committee, which will be responsible for hearing disciplinary cases and imposing penalties where necessary from early next month",3
"Pitman and Robinson both responded to a call by the BHA for former trainers and jockeys to put themselves forward for the new panel, the formation of which was recommended by Christopher Quinlan QC in a review of the regulators disciplinary and licensing procedures last year",1
"Ive worked in racing all my life and hopefully we can bring something to the table, Pitman said on Monday If people are unfortunate enough to find themselves in an inquiry, Im hopeful they will be satisfied with their treatment and the decisions that are madeIve worked with owners, stable staff, jockeys, vets, feed merchants, I was on the Lambourn Trainers Association committee and Ive done a lot of stuff since I retired from training",3
" The panel members who have done it from the grassroots, weve done it and didnt read it in a book, so hopefully well all be an asset to the panel in general I havent got a legal brain but Ive got common sense",2
"Quinlans review was commissioned before the protracted disciplinary case involving the trainer Jim Best, which finally concluded in December last year when Best was banned for six months for ordering a jockey to stop two horses in races in December 2015 He had initially been banned for four years in April 2016 after an earlier hearing of the case, but that result was quashed when it emerged that Matthew Lohn, the chairman of the disciplinary panel, had accepted paid work for the BHA on non-disciplinary mattersSeveral QCs, both current and retired, are also included on the new panel, including Patrick Milmo QC, an owner for many years, who also represented Jack and Linda Ramsden and their jockey Kieren Fallon in a successful libel action against the Sporting Life newspaper in 1998 Jodie Mogford, a former jump jockey and now an assistant trainer at Graeme McPhersons yard, is also on the panel, but will not sit on any cases which involve a licensed trainer or in which McPherson, a QC who regularly acts for racing clients, is involved on either sideJohn de Moraville, a former racing correspondent for the Daily Express who has been a handicapper for the BHA for nearly 20 years, will join the panel in November 2018, while Simon Rowlands, a form expert and the current chairman of the Horseracing Bettors Forum, also survived a selection process which involved 138 applications and 53 interviews",5

"15 WotadollEssex, without a title for a quarter of a century and in their first season back in the top flight, lead the County Championship",1
" Having taken full points in thrashing Surrey by eight wickets at Guildford  after the hosts dominated the first day, Essex ran every session, despite missing Matt Quinn with a back spasm  they have won half their six games, and are the only unbeaten team in the league Ducks have taken to water with greater difficultyThe elegant Tom Westley completed this win the same way he finishes every stroke: with a flourish",3
" His stylish unbeaten 108 helped his side reach 253  a target Surreys captain, Gareth Batty, said was as simple as 160 on other grounds  without alarm This is a theme: in Essexs wins, Westley has 337 runs, a pair of centuries, and red ink in two chases",2
"That target had been set up by some efficient final-morning bowling The industrious Neil Wagner returned and forced Stuart Meaker and Ravi Rampaul into loose shots, then Mark Footitt witlessly ran himself out seeking a second run Ben Foakes, stranded on 65, looked furious, and with good reason; since that fine first day, Surrey had batted poorly and passively",3
" Mark Stoneman, who was the reason for their early dominance, will on Tuesday receive a maiden call-up from England Lions",1
"For the second time in the match, Westley came to the crease when Alastair Cook fell on the stroke of lunch, this time for 31 He shared 95 with Nick Browne, whose form returned with a 77 full of attractive drives, and 104 with Dan Lawrence When set, Westley hit 38 from his last 25 balls, including three successive boundaries off Scott Borthwick, then a pulled four off Stuart Meaker to bring up his 17th first-class century",3
" Like Stoneman, he is ready should England call It is the smoothness with which players such as Westley and Lawrence have adjusted to life in Division One that will most please EssexGoing top is not a big thing, said Essexs captain and first-innings centurion, Ryan ten Doeschate But the way we have gone about winning this game, missing Quinny on the first day, the effort that was required to find a win on a very good wicket with two out and out seamers is very rewardingThis was a seismic day in the shaping of the season and if the promoted side are leading the charge for the title, the champions are looking more like candidates for relegation than retention",5
" Middlesexs unbeaten run was terminated after 21 games, by Lancashire at Southport, with eight wickets the emphatic margin of defeat The second day was lost to rain, and still Lancashire chased down the 108 they required shortly after lunch on the final day, with  pleasingly for England  Haseeb Hameed unbeaten on 38, his highest score since the opening game of the season Middlesexs tail had wagged to set up the target  they were still behind when they lost their sixth second-innings wicket",3
" Stephen Parry took his first Championship five-wicket haul as they were bowled out for 236; such a paltry target, even on a sporting pitch against a batting lineup prone to scares, was never going to be enough",1
"The most thrilling finish was at Taunton, where Somerset fell four runs short of their first win of the season, against Yorkshire when Jamie Overton  having shortly before hit a six  turned Adam Lyth to midwicket The debutant Adam Hose and Steven Davies, who made his first 50 of the season, put on 118 for the fifth wicket, but both were gone with 63 still required",2
" RyanSidebottom then took three wickets with the old ball to finish with eight in the match, before Lyths late intervention dramatically curtailed the lower order resistance Only Warwickshire are below Somerset, while only Essex sit above Yorkshire",2
"In Division Two, Sussex waltzed to their second consecutive win following their tricky start to the season ",1
" They had a tricky start to the game, away at Leicestershire, too With nine of their first innings wickets gone, they were 139 behind Leicestershires 340, but ended up by winning by five wickets",2
" Their last pair put on a record 83, then Jofra Archer took six wickets (to go with five in the first innings) to bowl Leicestershire out for 175 Luke Wells led the chase for 232 with a composed, unbeaten 90And Nottinghamshire were unable to take the nine Gloucestershire wickets they required on the final day on a lifeless pitch at Bristol that, according to the Notts assistant coach, Paul Franks: makes a mockery of what good cricket should be about",3
" Harry Gurney took two early, but Chris Dent (71) and Graeme van Buuren (88 not out) ensured Gloucestershire earned a draw five down Nottinghamshire, who travel to Taunton Tuesday for a One-Day Cup knockout, remain top of the division, by 16 points over Kent, who have played six games to Notts sevenThe Oyston family, owners of Blackpool, have been accused at the high court of treating the football club as the familys personal cash machine",3
"Lawyers for the Latvian millionaire Valeri Belokon, the clubs president, were launching what could prove to be one of British footballs most expensive legal actions Andrew Green QC alleged on Monday at the start of a five-week hearing that Owen and Karl Oyston, owner and chairman of the Lancashire club, had improperly extracted millions of pounds from its funds following promotion to the Premier League in 2010 and used the money for their own benefit",2
"Belokons company VB Football Assets, a minor shareholder in the club, was excluded from key decisions, information and any share of profits, Green saidVB Football is pursuing a claim against the Oystons for unfair prejudice against shareholders The claim is also against Blackpool FC Ltd itself and Blackpool FC (Properties) Ltd, a company with family links formerly known as Segesta",3
" The Oystons are vigorously denying the claims in what has developed into a bitter legal battleGreen told Justice Marcus Smith, sitting in London, that as a result of the Seasiders reaching the Premier League, the club received 106m",2
" The unprecedentedinflux of cash over five years included 48m in respect of the 2010-11 season, followed by 58m in parachute payments after Blackpools relegation at the end of the seasonGreen said: Owen and Karl Oyston have treated Blackpool Football Club as the Oystons personal cash machine The QC said the familys case was that at all times they had been transparent and open in relation to payments made out of the club Our case is this is simply inconsistent when you consider the documents There was, in fact, the adoption of a deliberate strategy by the Oyston family to take cash out of Blackpool Football Club and do so in a way VB Football Assets and its nominated directors could do nothing to stop what was the antithesis of transparency",5
Belokon won a court case in Manchester in February this year in a dispute with the Oystons over his share of profits after he provided 47m in July 2008 to develop the south stand and south-west corner of the clubs stadium,2
" That case was brought by JSC Baltic International Bank, owned by Belokon, against Segesta Ltd, the holding company for the clubs assets",1
"In March, the club announced Belokon was being suspended from its board as a result of a judgment in the Paris court of appeal related to disputed allegations of money laundering involving two banks founded or owned by him",1

" Joe Hart is in this rather ambiguous bracket And rather than have his Mr 15% actually do his job, Honesty Joe decided that the best thing to do was to put all his cards on the table which, as Theresa May will tell you, is the worst possible thing to do if you want a good dealI would love to give you a poker-straight answer as to where Ill be next season but Ive got nothing at the moment, Honesty Joe conceded, continuing the card analogy",3

The answer is, of course, France in 1994 in a match best remembered for Jean-Luc Sadournys try from the end of the worldContrast that unforgettable moment in rugby union history with Dan Coles quip last week that, the quickest line to the tryline is a straight line",3
"Considering he once went 60 Test matches without scoring a try, Cole is perhaps not the most qualified member of the Lions squad to pass judgment on the subject but his pithy assessment is accurate, if showing disregard for aesthetics",1
"The fact remains though that the Lions have managed just two in three tour matches and while it is a cause for concern, rather than panic after restricting the Crusaders to just a penalty, it can be said with certainty that they will not end the All Blacks unbeaten run at Eden Park without scoring tries Sam Warburton has said the Lions need to score at least 20 points to beat New Zealand but in their last four defeats the All Blacks have averaged 33 points against and while the 12-3 win over the Crusaders has alleviated the pressure brought on by the Blues defeat, the attack needs refinement",2
"Warren Gatland has accentuated the positives  whereas chances against the New Zealand Barbarians and the Blues were minimal, the Lions created openings against the Crusaders and would have at least doubled their tally for the tour with slightly cooler heads Gatland has also pointed to the 13 line-breaks in Christchurch while their try in Whangarei was taken with a simplicity  Anthony Watsons sharp spin and finish notwithstanding  that belies their subsequent scoring problemsBut it is CJ Standers try against the Blues that should be more instructive as to how the Lions can improve their scoring rate, in a manner in keeping with Coles analysis",3
" For whether it is a lineout drive or a dazzling, length of the field score such as Ihaia Wests, they are still both worth five points and the rolling maul ought to be among the Lions most potent weaponsAgainst the Crusaders, on more than one occasion Farrell kicked aggressively into the corner but the Lions were unable to capitalise",2
" The home sides defence takes its fair share of credit for that but with Jamie George and George Kruis linking so well at the lineout, as they do for Saracens, the Lions inability to drive over the line was surprisingIndeed, it has been said that the Lions would be well advised to copy Saracens style  an argument given added currency after the way that they strangled the Crusaders with Owen Farrell to the fore and a pack containing three of his club-mates, with Maro Itoje coming off the bench But perhaps a more effective blueprint for scoring tries would be that of Exeter",3
 The Premiership champions scored 86 tries last season and they finished the regular campaign with a record eight consecutive bonus-point wins,1
" There is also no side in the country more effective than scoring from a driving lineout that the ChiefsAdd in the fact that while Crusaders followers have vented their fury with Mathieu Raynals interpretations of the laws, the Lions are confident of at least parity at the scrum against the All Blacks  as Gatland says: Our scrum will be very strong by the time it comes around to the test  and the Lions will hope to have ample opportunity to kick for the corners It may not be as eye-catching as, say, Wests try but it should not be confused with negativity",3
" When it was decided that Farrell would kick at goal in Whangarei rather than to the corner, it was a negative decision, only compounded by the fact he struck the upright It was the wrong choice and a wasted opportunity to fine-tune their driving lineout",2
"For while Gatland and his coaches have sporadically hinted that the Lions are holding aspects of their attacking game-plan back for the Tests, it is a stretch to suggest that is why the maul, in a try-scoring sense, has not been used to any great effect as yet More likely, as with their inability to finish when Watson burst through against the Crusaders, or when all Jonathan Davies needed to do was find George North outside him, it requires polish and as frustrating as those missed opportunities were last Saturday, perhaps the most disappointing chance to go begging was the late lineout against the Blues",2
"The Lions face the Highlanders on Tuesday under the Forsyth Barr Stadium roof and so it will be the hardest, fastest pitch that they encounter throughout the tour, against a side who will be hell-bent on breaking the shackles imposed on the Crusaders",1
" For Tommy Seymour, who starts on the wing, it is an opportunity to cure the Lions white line fever Once these passes stick weve got individuals that can create things out of nothing from 80 metres let alone finish from five metres out, he said",2
 Sometimes it can be a bit like a tidal wave and they all come after that,1
" He is no doubt right to say that the Lions will find their try-scoring rhythm sooner or later but it would pay to remember they do not all have to come from the end of the EarthEven before National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman appeared at ice level on Sunday night in Nashville to award the Stanley Cup to the Pittsburgh Penguins, fans in the Bridgestone Arena were already chanting Bettman sucksMost likely, the hatred spawned most directly from the fact that the Predators, who lost 1-0 to the Penguins in what was to be the decisive Game 6, would have been up by that same tally from early on, had it not been for a mystifying call by one of the referees",3
" Early in the second period, a Predators shot deflected off the glove of Penguins goaltender Matt Murray, and Predators centre Colton Sissions tapped it in But for whatever reason, the play had already been whistled dead, and the goal was disallowedNO GOAL",3
The refs blew the whistle before the puck crossed the line,1
" #StanleyCup pictwittercom/Hg9etK1EAaIt was a weirdly fitting bookend to the series, though an unfortunate one for the Predators In the first period of Game 1, Preds defenceman PK Subban scored to put Nashville up 1-0 on the defending champions But the Penguins utilized a newly-introduced feature to the NHL, the coachs challenge, and after review it was determined that the Predators had been offside",5
 The goal was called backNothing is to be taken away from the Penguins in all this Pittsburgh are now the first team in the post-salary cap era in the NHL to win back-to-back Stanley Cups,3
" The victory also ends another amazing season for the teams captain, Sidney Crosby Crosby started the season leading Canada to victory at the World Cup of Hockey; he finished it with his second Conn Smythe trophy, awarded to the most valuable player of the postseasonYet, for all the stories there are to tell about Pittsburgh, and for all the other, smaller, stories there are to tell about the 2017 Stanley Cup final  including whether Subban, the leagues most interesting player had, thanks to some post-game chirping, unnecessarily provoked Crosby into a career performance  the story this year belongs to NashvilleAnd because it belongs to Nashville, at least some part of it belongs to the man Predators fans booed mercilessly when he did finally emerge Sunday night  the man responsible for bringing them a team in the first place: Gary BettmanThere are many reasons Bettman is generally disliked by NHL fans, and why booing him as he presents the Cup every year is an annual tradition that Nashville took on with gusto",5
" It is under Bettman, for example, that the league has undergone a number of game-play changes, including 3-on-3 in overtime, and the hated shootout It is under Bettman that the coachs challenge was introduced It is under Bettman that the NHL has had two recent lockouts",3
 And it is Bettman who obstinately refuses to admit a connection between concussions and CTEBut atop the list of reasons why fans like to boo Bettman is that it is under his watch that the league has morphed into something many still fantasize that the NHL is not: a big business,2
" When you ask hockey fans what annoys them most about the NHL, the answer is often that it is simply too big Specifically, many fans decry more teams in places where there should not be teams  places in the southern United States such as Florida, Georgia, Arizona and (coming soon!) Nevada  and fewer teams in places where they think there should (Markham, Quebec City, Hamilton and Seattle)Expansion, it turns out, is the harshest word in hockey",3
" Unless, of course, it works",1
"In announcing the NHLs plans to expand into Nashville and Columbus, as well as to return hockey to Atlanta and Minneapolis-St Paul, in June 1997, Bettman told the Associated Press that the moves would position the league for significant growth and stability as we head into the next century He was wrong when it came to Atlanta He was wrong for a long time about Columbus",3
" But he was right about Minnesota And, as is now clear, nearly 20 years since the Predators first took to the ice, he was eventually pretty much right about Nashville",2
You know when somebody says something to you and it just rings in your head; it just seems right from the start? That was the beginning,1
" This, apparently, is how the idea for Nashville, Tennessee as a hockey town began, according to an account from the teams original owner, Craig Leipold",1
" Nashville ticked the boxes for Bettman: a stadium awaiting a major league franchise, either NBA or NHL; potential ownership; and the right kind of market Still, [i]t was more than just a straight statistical thing, he told Leipold All the economic indicators were there, and I believed that it could sustain a franchise But, Bettman said, there were intangibles, also My gut told me that this city could do it, he said",5
"It almost didntThrough the first nine seasons, Leipold lost $70m, and in 2007 there were rumours he was set to sell the team to tech billionaire Jim Balsillie (who wanted to move the team) Despite putting together consistently competitive squads, the Preds saw their average attendance fall to just over 13,000 per game in the 2006-07 season, and had as few as 9,000 season ticket holders But the deal with Balsillie never materialized, and in the meantime, a Tennessee-based ownership group came to the fore and managed to keep the team in NashvilleBut its not as if there werent hockey fans around  even if they werent initially Predators fans",5
"In 1990, General Motors opened its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, a then-tiny town about a half hour drive south of Nashville, to manufacture its Saturn line Six thousand employees from Michigan were relocated at the same time",2
" When some of them heard, a few years later, that Nashville was getting an NHL team, those among them who were Red Wings fans were lured in by a chance to see their former hometown team play But, as Jordan Ritter Conn chronicled recently at the Ringer, some of those fans eventually morphed into honest-to-goodness Predators fans",2
And Nashville eventually gave those displaced hockey fans  as well as plenty more Nashville natives who adopted the team  a new place to call home: Smashville,1
" Frank Glinsky came up with the term  a town where the big hits of hockey met the smash hits of country music  and when the Predators were searching in 2002 for a new slogan to give season ticket sales a bump, he submitted it The concept  relaunched in 2009 by marketing firm GS&F  was one that placed the Preds in the centre of a city-wide party",2
" It was the Smashville attitude writ large that showcased the towns embrace of the team, and made the Predators run so special Every game night, thousands of people have filled the streets around the Bridgestone Arena Inside, the party was taken to another level  as if it were perpetually last call at the local bar",3
" NFL football players chugged huge beers together in the box seats; the mascot drove an ATV across the ice; a different country star sang the national anthem each night; catfish, thrown from the stands, occasionally littered the ice",1
"Veteran Canadian broadcaster Bob McKenzie described it simply as: a Cup final like no otherBut the 2017 finals did more than cement Nashville as a legitimate hockey town; they marked the end of yet another chapter of the NHLs expansion story Before the month is out, the league will hold yet another expansion draft, this time in aid of creating a team for Las Vegas",3
" The Golden Knights, yet another southern team, will take to the ice to start the 2017-18 NHL season Shortly after the league announced its decision to grant Vegas a franchise, Gary Bettman told Sports Illustrated that having a team in that city will enhance the league as a wholeThe people of Las Vegas  the people who live and work there  are going to embrace this team, Bettman said",3
" Perhaps the only way well ever know if he is right this time is if, one day, the Golden Knights are where the Predators found themselves Sunday night, and Gary Bettman takes to the ice in Vegas to be roundly booedA familiar American phenomenon has been in full force during the rise of Christian Pulisic this past year  for every US soccer fan or writer proclaiming Pulisic as the real deal, theres been another one fretting about Freddy Adu, and the dangers of too much hope, too soon, being placed on the shoulders of the 18-year-old",2
 Its a familiar US pastime,1
" And as Pulisic broke open a tense game against Trinidad & Tobago with two goals on Thursday night, the cautionary takes were as abundant as the hyperbolic onesBut nobody within USMNT circles is pretending that Pulisic is anything other than their brightest: Bruce Arena called him a big boy now Against Trinidad, Pulisics urgency in reaching the ball ahead of Clint Dempsey for the first goal had a symbolic feel Pulisic vs Dempsey is not a zero sum choice, but its become clear in the last few games, that its impossible to give both players any sort of roaming brief Dempsey is still dangerous, and capable of driving some games in those fits of self-righteous fervor, but his relevance to the national team will depend on him adapting to Pulisic rather than the other way around",5
"And if Pulisic was quieter against Mexico, there was a reason Along with his team-mates he was absorbing pressure for much of the game, so that the moment two minutes from the end where he cut inside to shoot, and for a second dangled fresh levels of hype in front of us, was a standout rather than the rule Theres a place for that kind of performance too, when it comes to assessing Pulisic Eighteen or not, caveats about his age dont really have a place any more The team have pinned their hopes on Pulisic  if the fans do too, hes ready to take it",5
"WHAT A GOAL (Via @FOXSoccer) https://tco/essdEgwgt6 #MEXvUSAThe opening few minutes of the Mexico game had already seen a couple of wild elbows, some unexpectedly bold US pressing, and had yet to settle into a pattern when Michael Bradley made his move",5
"In keeping with that aggressive US start Bradley had stepped up to win the ball, and then with a directness we rarely see from him, hit the most exquisite, shallow-arced chip over Ochoa in the Mexican goalThe clamor and intensity and occasional downright ugliness of the opening minutes made the sweet flight of the ball off Bradleys boot seem even more, well, beautiful, by contrast  and perhaps mixed in with the surprise of it was that the ball was hit by Michael BradleyBradley had been shunted up and down the center of the formation for so long by the end of Jrgen Klinsmanns tenure, that the sight of the US captain moving dutifully but awkwardly into position to play yet another cautious square pass had come to feel like his sole possible contribution",3
"The last time the US played Mexico, Bradleys most memorable first half contribution was running to the sideline in a break in play to consult with a lost looking Klinsmann as Mexico ran the US ragged in Columbus On Sunday night there was no confusion Direct when he needed to be (and nearly stealing the winner with another shot off the post in the second half), marshaling the midfield line of defense more often, Bradley reminded us of his virtues against Mexico",3
 And when he hit that shot he even made Bruce Arena smile,1
"The record used to speak for itself, with the long list of US losses at the Azteca suggesting an inferiority complex deepening for the visitors with each defeat",1
" US teams used to appear beaten at the point of the first setback, if not before they took the field in the first place But now, with a win and two draws in the last three visits to the stadium, Mexicos advantage has been diminished",2
"When I was working on a story on the effects of altitude recently, in anticipation of this game, I spoke with Colorado coach Pablo Mastroeni, who knows a thing or two about the phenomenon He suggested that past defeats may have as big a part to play in the outcome of the game as any consequence of the thin air",2
"The impregnability of the Azteca was diminished during Mexicos struggles in World Cup 2014 qualifying, but even in the formidable run put together by Juan Carlos Osorio this time round, its been easier said than done to make the Azteca a fortress again Part of the reason of course is that these days Mexicos players are just as susceptible to the conditions as their opponents  most play their soccer in Europe",2
"Mexico will qualify comfortably for the World Cup But even as they ended the Dos a Cero sequence up north, they couldnt regain the historic dominance of the US when the series switched down south Theres been talk of future national team games being moved away from the Azteca, and the more results like this happen, the less unthinkable that prospect seems",3
Bruce Arena might have wondered why he bothered to come back after he saw the reaction to his appointment,1
" The most experienced American coach in the game was treated as an underwhelming choice when he was announced as Klinsmanns replacement Even the arguments about him being a safe pair of hands, for what had suddenly become a World Cup qualification emergency, seemed to damn him with faint praise",2
"There were advantages to that too, of course With the bare expectation that the team get points on the board, Arena did not have to deal with any of the existential questions about the overall trajectory of the program that Klinsmann had dealt with (and frankly, invited, with his dual role as technical director)",2
 Points for wins and draws were all that mattered,1
" Style was irrelevantAnd yet even in the exceptional circumstances of preparing a roster for two games on a three-day turnaround at altitude, there were signs of an Arena manifesto for this US team Theres the growing clues as to Arenas preferred midfield, with the integrations of Kelyn Acosta alongside Bradley",3
" Acosta replaced Dempsey against Trinidad, and Arena told me after the game that the purpose of that was to get Pulisic closer to goal But it also beta-tested a defensive midfield screen ready to face Mexico, and that would in the event perform admirably Add in the faith in Darlington Nagbe, rewarded by the midfielders directness in helping break the deadlock in Colorado, and there are real signs of Arenas preferred side",3
 And with qualification looking more and more likely the bigger picture of where Arena is taking this team begins to become more of a question So far hes answering the question confidently,2
"DaMarcus Beasleys latest adventure involved playing 90 minutes against Mexico in the Azteca, in whats now a record-breaking fifth World Cup qualifying cycle",1
" Beasley did not particularly disappoint as one of seven changes Bruce Arena had made from the Trinidad game, even if he was the player Carlos Vela went past to score the equalizing goal",1
" But his presence was a reminder of the USAs ongoing inability to find and stick with a first-choice left-backJorge Villafana did well enough against Trinidad But when weve seen natural center backs like Tim Ream and Matt Besler tried out there, its apparent that theres no specialist in that position who has distinguished themselves from the crowd And thats going to be a headache in the coming yearJohn Stones is under consideration for a defensive midfield role as England explore their options in the build-up to the World Cup finals next summer, with Gareth Southgate seeking solutions for what he perceives to be a shortfall of talent in the position",5
"The England manager has experimented with Stones, long considered to be the best ball-playing centre-half at Englands disposal, in a midfield brief both at StGeorges Park last week and, since Sunday, at the teams temporary base in Croissy-sur-Seine While the 23-year-old is still expected to start his 18th cap against France on Tuesday in a more familiar role in the middle of a back three, Southgate believes the Manchester City defender boasts the attributes to thrive as a holding midfielder at some stageWell, I think he could do that [role], said Southgate, who will begin for the first time with Tom Heaton in goal with Jack Butland to earn his first cap for 16 months in the second halfWe had a look at that in training last week, in fact I also think we want defenders who can bring the ball out and show composure",5
" I think he could do either of those jobs Youve asked me if hes an option there, and I think he is Hes a player whos very comfortable receiving possession, and has all the attributes and capabilities to play as a holding midfield player",3
" He obviously hasnt done that yet, really, so thats a decision we have to make But do I believe he can play that role? AbsolutelyStones was an unused substitute in the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on Saturday after injury restricted him to only 13 minutes of first-team football at City in the last six weeks of the campaign",3
 He will start in a back three as Southgate switches system from that employed at Hampden Park,1
"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is likely to start in central midfield, alongside Eric Dier, though Stones could push up into the role at some stage during the match The visitors will be captained by Harry Kane in a friendly for which video assistant referees  the Italians Marco Guida and Massimiliano Irrati  have been appointed to review major decisionsThere will be a debut for Kieran Trippier, as well as that first start for Heaton with Joe Hart, Southgates first-choice goalkeeper, having always been earmarked to be rested for the fixture",3
" Joe is the No1, Southgate said But next season we dont know who will be playing at which club, who will be in form Tom has had an outstanding season and weve got to maintain the squad environment and make sure people feel involved",3
" Equally, Jack is coming back off a long lay-off and was No2 before that We think he could also challenge for the No1 slot moving forward We want competition for places",3
"Didier Deschampss hosts will also experiment with their selection, with a first start anticipated for Thomas Lemar and his Monaco team-mate Kylian Mbapp, employed up front alongside Olivier GiroudThe likes of Ousmane Dembl, Samuel Umtiti and the full-backs Benjamin Mendy and Djibril Sidib are expected to start Southgate expects a stern test from Frances talented young side",3
" But the key is we learn something from the game, hesaid We dont have many opportunities to try things, to try players, so we have to take these chances We need flexibility as a team",3

 Its great to be able to do it,1
"Hornqvist scored off Nashville goalie Pekka Rinnes left elbow to end the scoreless game Nashville challenged for goalie interference, but the goal was upheld",2

WHAT A,2
 GOAL,1
 (Via @FOXSoccer) https://t,1
"co/essdEgwgt6 #MEXvUSAObviously it gave us an advantage early on, Bradley told Fox Sports 1 They had a lot of the ball but tactically the game went the way we expected  any time you get a point here its great, the mentality and the commitment from every guy was really good Bradley almost scored again from distance inside the last 20 minutes with a thunderbolt that clipped the outside of a postCarlos Vela scored Mexicos goal, but a point was most welcome and fully merited for the US after an obdurate display in Mexico City against the side that leads the qualification standings The US moved level on points with Costa Rica, who are second, although the Americans have played a game more",5
"Since Mexico won the previous meeting between the teams, the outcome also stands as a yardstick indicating improvements since Arena became coach We had let a lot of little things drop and I think Bruce has come in and done a really good job, Bradley said in his post-match interviewMexico beat Honduras 3-0 last Thursday and - in stark contrast to their turmoil four years ago - have looked impressive in this qualifying campaign under their coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, a Colombian who is a former coach of the Chicago Fire and New York Red Bulls and a one-time student in LiverpoolThey also looked good a year ago in the Copa America Centenario before the bizarre blip in the quarter-finals when they lost 7-0 to eventual winners Chile Here they were missing the injured Rafael Marquez, Miguel Layun and Andres Guardado, though Carlos Salcedo made an unexpected recovery from a leg injury",5
"Starting off the final Hexagonal round of Concacaf qualification, Mexico beat the US 2-1 in Columbus, Ohio, last November thanks to a late Marquez goal It was an occasion freighted with political as well as sporting import, three days after the election of a certain former failed sports franchise owner to the White House",2
"The outcome ended the Americans 30-game home unbeaten run in World Cup qualifiers as well as the dos a cero scoreline streak When the US lost to Costa Rica a couple of days later, Jurgen Klinsmanns tenure as head coach was doomedArena had said after the win over Trinidad & Tobago last week that he would change the team; he transformed it, with seven new names in the starting XI Perhaps most surprisingly, the in-form Tim Howard, who played in the Americans only win at the Azteca, a 1-0 friendly victory in 2012, was rested and replaced in goal by Brad GuzanGeoff Cameron, Bradley, DeAndre Yedlin and Christian Pulisic were the only four to retain their places; left back Jorge Villafana was injured",5
" The energetic 21-year-old, Kellyn Acosta, of FC Dallas, came in to act as a midfield disrupter in a formation that was a 3-4-3 in possession It is the sort of dramatic rotation that, were Klinsmann still in the dug-out, might have inspired insinuations about his competence and/or sanity But Arenas pedigree, demeanour and the current performances of the team inspire more trust in his judgmentThe short rest between games was undoubtedly one factor; another, perhaps, was that with three points collected against T&T, Arena could afford to experiment at a venue where avoiding defeat felt likely to be a long-shot no matter who he pickedWhile Arena understandably fretted about the potential physical effects of the Aztecas high altitude its factor as a competitive advantage risked being exaggerated; only two of the Mexico line-up play their club football in the country",5
" The pace of the game hardly dipped as the night wore on, with both teams seeking a winner",1
"The 18-year-old Pulisic has become the USs get-out-of-mediocrity free card, as he was in the fitful 2-0 win over bottom side T&T in the Denver suburbs last Thursday, scoring two second-half goals",1
" On Sunday, though quieter, he made an adroit run and pass to set up a chance for Yedlin late in the first half, and an audacious attempted sand-wedge of a pass over the back line that was clearedPulisic had boldly predicted victory ahead of this game He had the opportunity to make his prophecy come true with two minutes remaining as he fashioned an enticing chance, but shot wide from the edge of the area This time, for once, he would not be the headline-makerIt was the kind of intense occasion that would have benefitted from firm officiating",5
" But in the first three minutes, Salcedo was lucky to escape a booking for an elbow on DaMarcus Beasley, and seconds later, ought to have been sent off for another flailing arm that caught Bobby WoodThen came Bradley: it was the Toronto FC midfielders second international goal since July 2015 and a rare moment of adversity under Osorio; only the second goal Mexico had conceded in six Hex matchesChicharito should have levelled after 20 minutes when set clear, but with the ball bouncing, mishit his lob over Guzan and injured himself colliding with the goalkeeper, though he played on The contest was tied soon after On the counter-attack, Beasley  in his US-record fifth cycle of World Cup qualifiers  was unable to stop Vela cutting inside and dribbling along the edge of the penalty area, giving him enough of an angle to lash a low shot beyond Guzan",5
" The US defender Omar Gonzalez fluffed a free header inside Mexicos box as both teams looked dangerous, but went in at the break locked at 1-1More direct than Mexico  who worked the ball from side to side in search of space that the visitors mostly closed down effectively  the US were spirited in the second half and created a couple of half-chancesStill, Mexico almost scored again with 20 minutes left as Hector Herrera cannoned a free kick off Guzans crossbar",3
" Then came Bradleys effort that hit the post As rain fell in Mexico City, the Americans held on amid late pressureWith a goalscoring turn from one of his stars and solid displays from lesser lights, Arenas choice of players was vindicated and suggests a degree of depth that will give him the kind of selection problems that all managers relish as the US heads into this summers Gold Cup feeling good about making it to Russia",3
"Harry Kanes late, late intervention was not to prove the final weekend blow landed on Gordon Strachan even if it was the most shuddering one I am absolutely shattered, Strachan said",2
 That is probably the most emotional I have ever been after a game,1
"Slovakias Group F victory in Lithuania on Saturday evening means Scotland remain fourth in the section, four points adrift of second and three from third World Cup qualification remains a long shot, even if the pulsating boost afforded to Scotland by Leigh Griffithss outstanding double against England gave Strachan reason tobelieveI wouldnt be here if I didnt, the manager insisted",3
 If I didnt believe it I think it would rub off on the players The players can sniff that,2
"Strachans own situation has, of course, been intrinsically linked to struggles which preceded the March win over Slovenia and briefly stirring events of Saturday It now seems certain the 60-year-old will see out the campaign, which apart from anything else will be commercially and practically useful to the Scottish FA in terms of sourcing a replacementI have got a way of dealing with it, Strachan said regarding speculation",3
" What makes me strong is those players and everybody I have met this week People come up to you and say: Keep it up, keep it going That energises youYou all know that I do keep a barrier between myself and the media It is nothing against you guys",5
" I can get on and do my job, then it doesnt affect me",1
 If it affected me then it would affect the players,1
 You have seen the performances over the last couple of years I have got no problem with that,2
" Funnily enough, somebody said: Would you go back to full-time [club] management? I said: Yeah, with that group I wouldI actually get excited when its time to get together with them I just love working with them",3
" We have faults, we all know there are faults  but thats not their fault, thats the Scottish gameThat widespread chasm between Scottish players and their English counterparts is not lost on any sane observer, albeit Strachan has regularly been guilty of underplaying what talent is actually at his disposal Teams with less to pull upon have fared better than the Scots under Strachans guidance",3
"A case in point relates to Griffiths, whom Strachan showed a real reluctance to play until recently The manager will claim it was a simple mistake but pointing towards Christophe Berra as a player at a Hearts team who finished sixth in Scotland was disingenuous; they did not, just as the centre-back was virtually an everpresent player last season for Ipswich Town in the Championship, a division from which Strachan has always drawn heavily Berra was actually one of Scotlands best players on SaturdayListen, we have to improve, Strachan said But thats a different story",5
" We could sit here all night and talk about things that we have to do to make us better as a group In general, we still have to improve a lot as a whole, Scottish playersWhat you cant say, though, is can you improve on your work rate",3
 Unless you stand out there in that tunnel with these [English] guys and then get knocked down you dont know what its like,1
 Its like in rugby when you come up against a pack and that pack keeps knocking you back It drains you Thats what happened with these guys It drainsyou But they kept finding an energy from somewhere,5
"Scotland would now be helped in part by England maintaining their imperious qualifying form against other teams in the group I hope so, Strachan said Thats 35 games unbeaten [in tournament qualifiers] and its the closest theyve been to losing that record",3
We had a moment in the day that a lot of us in football wont forget We will remember the noise after the second goal forever,2
 It could have been the best ever,1
 If you can leave memorable moments then you have given something to the gameGriffiths was so close to becoming a national hero,2
" His international manager drew comparisons to David Beckham and his memorable free-kick goal for England against Greece in 2001 Some people can do it after 20 minutes when theyre fresh, Strachan said For Leigh to dig out these two lateon was incredible",3
" I actually thought the second one would go in as well, I really didHarry Kane has spoken of his pride at captaining his country but insists England boast plenty of leaders in their ranks as Gareth Southgate contemplates who will wear the armband on a permanent basisThe Tottenham Hotspur forward, who does not captain his club side, became the fifth captain of Southgates sevengame tenure after Wayne Rooney, Gary Cahill, Joe Hart and Jordan Henderson at Hampden Park on Saturday and seized his opportunity by scoring the teams 93rdminute equaliser",3
" That timely intervention, just moments after two free-kicks by Leigh Griffiths had taken Scotland to the verge of a first win in this fixture in 17 years, maintained Englands unbeaten qualifying campaign at the top of Group FI have said before I would love to be England captain, said Kane, who had previously been denied the chance to represent Southgates team by injury and whose goal was his first for the national team in 13 months",2
" Obviously, I dont know what the gaffers feeling is on it",1
" He gave me the armband on Saturday and I went out there and gave it my best When you are on the pitch, not much changes",2
" We have got leaders in the team, and it is just that I am wearing the armbandI still play the same way",2
" I still talk, I still shout in the same way",1
" That is what is good about this team People look at one player now to drag them through, but we have plenty of leaders in the team to try and change the game",2
" For me it was great to get that goal and be captain, but whoever the gaffer chooses long-term, there are plenty of leadersIt was quite emotional to be given the chance The manager told me just before training on Friday He said he sees me as one of the leaders in the team, that was it Nothing about it being permanent",5
" I am sure he will make that decision when he is ready, but I was delighted to lead that team out There were a lot of emotions, lots of proud feelings, and my family were delighted",2
" It was something I have always dreamed about, as most kids do So to be given that opportunity by the gaffer and how the game panned out, to manage to score in the last minute was a very proud moment",2
"It was probably the most special moment, personally, of my career so far",1
" I did not want to lose my first game as captain, that is for sure  especially against Scotland So to score that goal  it has been a while since I scored a goal for England",2
" It was a special feeling for meKane took his first steps at international level under Rooneys leadership, having broken into the Spurs first team with Hugo Lloris  Frances first-choice captain  wearing the armband A good captain leads by example, on and off the pitch, the Spurs forward said",3
" You have a responsibility off the pitch with the media, and to kids coming through, and being a role model",1
 I am quite a calm character Im not someone who gets too irate or too low,2
" I have a steady mind and I know my ambitions, I know what I want to do, and this team has great ambition I am one of many who could be captain",2
"When I first came into the England squad, Wazza was great with me",1
 He talked to me Even as I was doing well with my club he was giving me a little phone call or text to say: Things could change for you as you play more and get bigger,2
" He was great with that, giving me his experiences of what he had gone through",1
"I played under Hugo Lloris, Frances captain, who I will see on Tuesday He is totally different",2
" He is very calm, you respect him Ive had great captains in my career so far and if I can take anything from any of them I will be happyJoe Hart has admitted he has no idea where he will be playing his club football next season with no firm offers having been lodged for his services, but is confident Manchester City will not price him out of the market as he seeks a fresh start this summerThe England goalkeeper, who will sit out the friendly fixture against France in Paris on Tuesday with Gareth Southgate expected to offer Jack Butland a first appearance in 15 months, was a high-profile early victim of Pep Guardiolas tenure at the Etihad Stadium and has just completed a season-long loan at Torino in SerieA The Italian club are not seeking to make that transfer permanent, with the coach, Sinisa Mihajlovic, suggesting they cannot afford Harts 110,000-a-week wages, but Hart has not spoken personally to anyone at City since rejoining the ranks",5
"The club have since signed the uncapped Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica for 35m to leave Hart in no doubt that he has no future at the club he joined 11 years ago No clubs have crystallised their interest as yet, and it may be that Hart has to accept an opportunity outside the elite bracket, and potentially a pay cut, at the likes of West Ham United, Everton, Newcastle United or Crystal Palace if he is to secure a move to another Premier League sideSomethings going to happen, one way or another, but its almost in the hands of the businessmen now, he said",3
" They have obviously signed the new keeper, and I get the direction [in which they are moving] There is no real need for me to talk to them",2
 Im lucky enough to have management who deal with that side of things I think they spoke to my agent,2
" There is no animosity between the two teams; they are going about their business, and we are going to go about oursLook, I would love to give you a poker-straight answer as to where Ill be next season, but Ive got nothing at the moment",2
" Id love to be withholding information about my future, but I dont have the information to withhold People are focused on international duty and respecting that players are focused on international duty Come Tuesday night, after that is when conversations can be had and people can start being real My personal situation is interesting, and patience is going to have to be the keyCity have now spent more than 50m on Ederson and Claudio Bravo since Guardiola determined Harts distribution from the back was not of the standard he required, and that pair are now competing for the No1 jersey at the Etihad",5
" Asked if he knew what the clubs asking price for him would be, Hart said: I dont know exactly Its hard to say what is realistic Football is a business, at the end of the day You cant judge, realistically The millions and zillions of pounds that get paid for someone to come and play football for you, in the real world, is strange",5
" In the business world, the football world, its not",1
But I certainly dont think they are going to try and price me out of a move I think theres enough respect between the player and club to work together Theres no point in working against [each other],3
 There is no animosity between the two They are going in their direction and I need to go in mine,2
" Its about what is considered to be market value and what gets agreed between the two clubsYet Hart, who kept five clean sheets in 36 games for Torino and was criticised by the club president, Urbano Cairo, who claimed to have been surprised at the number of mistakes the goalkeeper made, has conceded his departure will have to be on a permanent move If the switch is what needs to happen, and thats key, then we all need stability in our life, he said Im not a kid any more I cant just pack my stuff, like a 17 or 19-year-old, and go on loan",5
 I am a 30-year-old man with stuff I need to organise,1
 I like stability,1
"There is an ideal situation to come out of this but nothing is perfect Its a short career and football is crazy, so I have to be prepared for anything I just want to play football",3
" I love football Its what I live and breathe, and I want to play football at the highest possible level I can play Thats the plan",3
"The England goalkeeper was beaten by two late Leigh Griffiths free-kicks at Hampden Park on Saturday, before Harry Kane salvaged a point in stoppage time, and his absence at the Stade de France will be one of a number of changes to Southgates side Butland has not represented his country since fracturing his ankle in a friendly win in Germany in March 2016 and is likely to start, with Fraser Forster and Tom Heaton also in the squadIt was difficult, listening to Joe Harts version of events, not to suspect he was putting on a front at a time when there has to be a legitimate debate about whether someone in his position  no future at Manchester City, no idea where he might end up next and, perhaps understandably, little of the old assuredness  still warrants his place in the England team",3
"Hart had just been through the videos of the two free-kicks Leigh Griffiths had put either side of him during that wild finish to Englands 2-2 draw in Scotland and there was no indication that a goalkeeper with 71 caps, nine years at this level and more clean sheets than anyone in that position other than Peter Shilton and David Seaman, considered himself to be at faultAs a goalkeeper, you set your wall up, and sometimes theres nothing you can do, was Harts take",2
" Hes produced two bits of quality They werent sidefoots, they werent curlers, they were what I call heavy  my boring goalkeeping technical term",2
" He put them over the wall, then they picked up pace and sometimes you have to say well doneI went over to him at the end to say well done because thats my personality, hate it or love it",2
" I wanted to congratulate him and talk about it because I was interested about his thought process, too",1
" To do it twice in a few minutes, after not really having a sniff the whole game, was a big moment for him He took one with a minute to go in the game at Wembley and used a different technique Its a free shot from 25 yards and unfortunately his training has paid offI asked my wall to jump but not excessively because people are clever now and they go underneath, but Ive seen it again and we would have needed four or five Peter Crouches in that wall to make a difference What else can you say? Sometimes you just have to say well done",5
"And he was right, to some extent, bearing in mind the lopsided amount of attention that has been paid to Harts goalkeeping rather than the elegance of those strikes  first to his left, then his right  from the Scotland strikerUnfortunately for Hart, these are not the first moments that have left the clear impression he is not the goalkeeper of old and the truth is neither free-kick was aimed fully into the corner of his net From that distance, an elite goalkeeper would not normally be beaten twice and nobody could really take issue with Gareth Southgate if Englands manager is concerned about the way Harts career, at the age of 30, appears to be driftingAs it turns out, Southgate will remove him from the team to play France in Paris on Tuesday, a decision that Hart did not seem to have been notified about as he talked about devoting time to studying the free-kick techniques of Dimitri Payet and Paul Pogba That, however, is not Hart being dropped, even if Southgate is aware it might be perceived that way",5
"Our intention was always to give someone else a game, Southgate said However it looks, I will have to ride that out I am seeing a headline that says Hart is not safe but the fact is we need competition in every position Who knows who will be fit and available [in the World Cup]? Too many times we have got to a tournament when a key player is not fully fit We cannot rely on one or two players",5
"All of which makes perfect sense now Jack Butland has recovered from his broken ankle, with Tom Heaton and Fraser Forster also in better form than Englands established No1, and not forgetting the credentials of Jordan Pickford, currently preparing for the Under-21 European ChampionshipSouthgates tone was supportive, on the whole, but Hart is in a state of limbo, back at Manchester City after a patchy loan arrangement with Torino but acutely aware he has no future under Pep Guardiola, the manager who fast-tracked him out of the club",2
" In the circumstances, with zero offers from other teams, it is probably no surprise that Hart has never fully regained his best form since the ordeal of Euro 2016I am sure he will be playing at a high level, Southgate said He has had an important experience abroad His contribution [for England] has been high and without his save against Slovenia we would be worse off in the qualifying group For me, the goals were two moments of high quality, but we will look at them",5
"Southgates hope is that Harts club situation will be resolved by the time England resume their World Cup qualifying programme against Malta and Slovakia, GroupFs second-placed side, at the start of SeptemberIn the meantime, the former England captain Terry Butcher was among those calling for Southgate to change his goalkeeper and there was at least an acknowledgement from Hart that he was vulnerable",2
" This shirts not mine, he said Its not nailed-on mine, its noones",2
" Weve got high-quality goalkeepers and I will have to be playing at a good, well, at the top level, to the maximum of my ability, even to get in the squadI am not a robot Sometimes I do have thoughts about it [the uncertainty]",3
" But there is nothing to get down about Its another exciting adventure, another move, the next step in my career, the next challenge for me personally",2
 I love personal challenges,1
" I have never shied away from one and I dont intend to nowAfter San Juan there should be no need to talk up Santa Fe Argentina and England put on one of the more exhilarating matches of modern times, a try-laden festival of dynamic rugby that twisted this way and that right up to the last, when Denny Solomonas brilliant solo score tilted the balance one final time in favour of EnglandIt was an extraordinary exhibition of skill and nerve by an England side shorn of 30 players Ten new caps were blooded, the most by England since 1956",5
" By any rational measure they ought to be well satisfied, the second Test next weekend no more than a bonus opportunity to play a bit more rugby before a well-earned rest at the end of a long season",1
 But Eddie Jones does not do satisfied Already he has defied his put-upon youngsters to seize this last opportunity if they want to stand a chance of making the 2019 World Cup,2
"This next Test is really important for these players, he said They have to understand they may get only one game to have the opportunity to show they are good enough to be in contention for the next World Cup You can always get those X-factor players who suddenly come through",3
" We have seen a few now who previously we didnt have on the radar You always want that to happen But, generally speaking I would think 80% of the [World Cup] squad will come from the next 45-man squad [announced in August]",3
"When Jones speaks of X-factor he might as well be holding up a portrait of Solomona, whose debut here was just about as wild and unpredictable as he could have dreamt it would be and, as such, a neat microcosm of the match He came on in the 50th minute and within three minutes had missed three tackles, conceding two tries in the process Englands six-point lead had transformed itself into an eight-point deficit  and Solomona must have been wondering what he was doing in this strange land, this strange sport",3
"I think he was just so nervous, Jones said",1
 The big occasion got to him But the great thing is he bounced back He had one opportunity to carry the ball and it was a fantastic carry,3
"In the 79th minute England finally worked the ball to him  and then he remembered spectacularly what he was all about, smashing through, stepping around and streaking away from a variety of hapless defenders for the winning tryIts unreal, he said",2
" I think that is the best and worst debut I have had in my life! It is definitely different, a lot more intense than I thought",1
 I cant remember the build-up to the try I just remember putting the ball down and being overwhelmed with joy and pride I made a couple of mistakes but hopefully redeemed myself,3
"As with Solomona, so with England The error count in the first half in particular was high  from both teams  but Argentina, with a good deal more experience, even if they are without a host of world-class talent themselves, looked as if they might administer the kind of lesson no one enjoys having to endure In the Pumas case the absentees are voluntary, their policy of selecting only home-based players as strict as that of the All Blacks, but they retained enough quality to dominate England at the set piece And their reputation for running rugby is well earned, with Martin Landajo, Nicols Snchez and Matias Moroni dazzling at times They fielded a new cap of their own, Emiliano Boffelli, a strapping winger who scored the games first try",5
" The names are worth remembering They are in Englands World Cup pool and will be lethalBut they made mistakes, too, and England punished them as ruthlessly as Argentina did theirs",3
" Mark Wilson had a fantastic debut on one flank and will not surrender his shirt lightly with Chris Robshaw back in contention this week On the other Tom Curry, 19 this Thursday, gave promise of a long career, mixing the fearless with the dextrousSurpassing them all, though, was George Ford, who had his best game in an England shirt, pulling the Pumas defence into all manner of uncomfortable positions and racking up 25 points",3
" Hes a young stand-off, Jones said",1
" Hes 24, still learning his trade and I thought it was certainly a good performance He kept in the game and kept in control and gave the team what we needed",2
" He definitely kicked wellThe show moves on to Santa Fe, via Buenos Aires where England are basing themselves Robshaw has recovered from his ankle injury but more new caps can be expected as Jones extends those precious opportunities to outsiders to convince him",3
 He is building England an enviable stock of resources for now and the future but as ever prizes above all else the life force of recurring victory,1
We know Argentina are going to respond,1
 Its always the case when one side win and one side lose The side who lose go back over every detail of how they lost,2
 They come up with a game plan and perform it energetically,1
" We have got to treat this like a loss and make sure we have the same intent to improve from the last gameNo, Santa Fe should not require a further raising of the stakes but it is going to get one anywayArgentina Tuculet; Moroni, Orlando, Dela Fuente, Boffelli (Moyano 62); Snchez (Hernndez 62), Landajo (Bertranou 69); Noguera Paz (Garcia Botta 70), Creevy (capt; Montoya 48), Pieretto, Alemanno, Lavanini (Petti 48), Matera, Ortega Desio, Leguizamon (Senatore 58)",3

"Aaron Ramsey could not have picked a better place to convert a Panenka penalty as Wales secured a precious point against the Group D leaders, Serbia, to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup finals next summer, yet it was a night tinged with regret for Chris Coleman and his players after they allowed victory to slip through their fingers for the fourth time in this campaign",1
"Playing in the stadium where Antonin Panenka first produced that nonchalant chipped spot-kick, in the 1976 European Championship final for Czechoslovakia against West Germany, Ramsey showed nerves of steel to deliver his own version and for a long time that penalty looked like being the defining moment in the game",1
"Wales, who were missing the suspended Gareth Bale, played with a great deal of courage and discipline to frustrate Serbia but with 17 minutes remaining Alexsandar Mitrovic broke through on the left to equalise, denying the visitors the win that would have made such a huge difference with only four fixtures remainingSitting in third place and trailing Serbia and the Republic of Ireland by four points after a fifth successive draw, Coleman admitted that Wales now have no margin for error in the rest of the campaign if they want to top the group I think realistically, if we want to finish first, [we need] four wins, the Wales manager said",3
" If we want to take our chance in a play-off, its at least three wins and a drawThat challenge starts in early September with a home fixture against Austria and an away trip to Moldova The bad news for Wales it that Joe Allen will miss the Austria match through suspension after picking up a yellow card against Serbia",3
 The good news is that Bale will be available again,1
"That Wales coped so well without the Real Madrid forward here owes much to the performance of Ramsey, who was superb Playing just behind Sam Vokes, Wales lone forward, Ramsey used the ball intelligently and made some excellent forward runs to relieve pressure and stretch the Serbia defence He also converted a penalty kick to rememberI didnt see that coming if Im honest with you, Coleman said But I had no doubt hed score because hes playing with such confidence at the moment",5
 His overall performance was absolutely outstanding,1
" He seems to thrive on that responsibility Its not the first time hes run a game for usHis input tonight was immense If we didnt have him, Im not sure wed have come away with what we did because I thought when we needed someone to keep the ball, hold it and give us a rest, he was fantastic And the penalty  the noise the supporters make here is incredible but it didnt matter to him",5
" Full of confidence and a fantastic finishAsked whether he thought Ramsey was deliberately trying to copy Panenkas penalty because it was the same venue, Coleman said: Do you know what, Im pretty sure that he probably hasnt even seen it",2
 But it was identical Its what we thought as soon as he did it But I dont think that would have been in Aarons thinking,3
It was an audacious piece of skill and came after a comedy of errors from Serbias point of view,1
" Vladimir Stojkovic, the Serbia goalkeeper, made a pigs ear of dealing with Ben Daviess long ball and ended up bringing down Ramsey just outside the area when he realised that he was unable to shepherd the ball out of play From the resultant free-kick Luka Milivojevic was penalised for pulling Sam Vokess shirt and Ramsey, with a delightful dink into the corner of the net, did the rest",2
That goal turned the volume down in a stadium that was a cauldron of noise but it rose again when Serbia equalised,1
" Nemanja Gudelj released a measured pass behind Davies and it was a lovely flick from Aleksandar Prijovic that Mitrovic dispatched inside Wayne Hennesseys near post Ramsey, breaking into the area with yet another well-timed run, could still have won it for Wales but his shot with the outside of his boot was turned behind by StojkovicAn emotional Rafael Nadal described his 10th French Open title as the perfect end to a perfect fortnight after he made history at Roland Garros on Sunday The 31yearold Spaniards 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 victory against Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland made him the first man to win any of the grand slam events 10 times, a feat he achieved without dropping a single setThis has been, I think, a perfect Roland Garros for me, said Nadal, who dropped just 35 games in total on his way to a 15th grand slam title but his first for three years",5
"Nadal was shown a montage of his 10 victories before the trophy presentation and said the historic nature of the triumph added to his satisfaction It is true that this one is going to be one of the more special for the number, for what happened on the ceremony after the final, for so many things, he said And because I am 31 already and not a kid any moreToday was a very important day for me [There] have been some tough moments last times, injuries, so its great to have big success like this again",5
" Nadal said when he first won the title in 2005 he would not have imagined he would still be playing in 2017, let alone winning, and said 10 titles had a special ring to it",1
" As I like to say, if I can do it, someone else can do it, he said",1
" But you need the right circumstances, the right ingredients to win 10 French Open titles I dont know if I will ever get to meet the player who will do better than I did",2
" It has been very special to me, and its true that it is unprecedented Trust me, Im very happy that Im the one who did it",2
" Im very happyWawrinka, who lost a grand slam final for the first time, said he had been beaten by a man at the peak of his game For sure hes playing the best hes ever played, Wawrinka said",3
" But not only here I think since the beginning of the year, you can see hes playing more aggressive, staying more close [to] the line But thats clearly the best he has ever played Thats why hes winning so much againThe Swiss said he had recovered well physically from the effort of defeating Andy Murray in a semi-final which lasted more than four and a half hours, but that mentally the efforts of the past few weeks had caught up with him",5
"From the beginning from my side, for sure, I didnt play my best tennis, he said I think I was a little bit hesitating with my selection of shots I was always a little bit between [thoughts] One, because I play against him and he puts this doubt in your head when you play against him because hes playing so well And second, all the effort I have been doing [in the] last few weeks to get to my best level again, to get some confidence again, and to win all those matches  some tough matches",5
"Wawrinka said the positives of the fortnight outweighed the negatives of losing a grand slam final, having shrugged off a poor clay-court season to make the final for the second time in three years Nadals 10th win, he said, was an incredible achievement Its something tough to describe when you just say you won 10 French Opens, he said Its a grand slam, but its the same grand slam Thats something so big for the sport",5
" Hes the best-ever player on clayNadal said his chances at Wimbledon, where he has not won since 2010, depended on how his aching knees respond on the grass If I have pain in the knees, then I know from experience that its almost impossible, he said",3
" Because I need to feel strong, low and powerful legs to play well in Wimbledon If I dont feel that, then probably my chances are not there, no? But if I am healthy and I am able to have the right preparation and feel healthy during Wimbledon, then I am probably going to have my chances to playwellGreg Eden continued the remarkable revival of his career when he ran in five tries as Castleford took another important step towards ending their 91-year wait to win the championship with a resounding victory over Warrington which left them six points clear at the top of Super LeagueOn this form the 26-year-old winger looks capable of eclipsing the 40 tries scored by Denny Solomona last season to set the competitions record before he departed for rugby union This was Edens fifth hat-trick in six games  including a Challenge Cup treble against St Helens  taking his seasons tally to 30 in 18 leaguegames",5
"Castlefords coach Daryl Powell, who recruited Eden when he was at a low point following a spell in the National Rugby League with Brisbane, said: The people on the inside of him do an outstanding job but hes an incredible finisher But we were scratchy in the second half I thought, and Warrington came back at usJust as Powell takes great credit over the Eden project, he equally deserves plaudits for turning the Tigers into a side who are the undisputed favourites for the Grand Final at Old Trafford in October",3
In recent weeks his team have shown an essential hallmark of a championship team by winning when they are below their best,1
" That was never more evident than against StHelens last Sunday and, while mesmerising in patches here, they were again far from perfect yet still ran out comfortable victors",1
"Warrington were the last side to defeat Castleford at home, in July 2016",1
" But the chance of a repeat here was all but over by the end of a frenetic opening quarter in which the Tigers, with prop Andy Lynch playing the 500th game of his career, had opened up a commanding 20-0 lead after the Warrington captain, Chris Hill, had been sent to the sin-binThat early burst was typical of so many of Castlefords victories this season where a flurry of points in a short, sharp spell have proved decisive It made it hard to win from there, the Warrington coach, Tony Smith, said",3
"His team are now 11 points adrift of the top four and it appears their Challenge Cup quarter-final against Wigan on Saturday may well be season-defining However, there is still the possibility of last seasons beaten grand finalists facing a battle against relegation in the Qualifiers",2
" To illustrate the gulf in class between these two sides, Edens five tries here were one fewer than the six Warrington have managed in their past four games combinedThe early signs were ominous for Warrington when they fell behind after three minutes as Luke Gales kick was claimed by Eden for the first of his haul",2
" Hills yellow card proved a pivotal moment, as in his absence Castleford took control of the match with tries from Eden, Greg Minikin and Mike McMeekenTom Linehams try shortly after Hills return reduced the deficit, although only temporarily, with normal service quickly resumed when Eden completed a hat-trick following a looping pass from Junior Moors  whose knee injury was the only blot on another successful afternoon for the league leaders",2
"The second half was much more closely fought and Warrington managed to score the games final two tries through Joe Westerman and Jack Hughes, but by that stage far too much damage had already been done to their causeEden scored his fourth and fifth tries and, for a brief moment, it looked like he would become only the second player in Super League history after the Bradford great Lesley Vainikolo to score six in a game",2
" That was not to be but, on this evidence, there are still plenty more to come from him this seasonCastleford Hardaker; Minikin, Monaghan, Shenton, Eden; Roberts, Gale; Lynch, McShane, Millington, Sene-Lefao, McMeeken, Massey Interchange Milner, Moors, Holmes, Foster",3

"Referee J Child Attendance 8,577Always a happy hunting ground for Lewis Hamilton, the Canadian Grand Prix was once again conquered by the British driver but his skill was rewarded to a much greater extent than merely claiming his sixth win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve While Hamilton led from pole to flag in a race in which he never relinquished control and followed the Mercedes teams plan to perfection, his Formula One world championship rival Sebastian Vettel endured a trying afternoon from which he did well to manage a strong comeback But it remained a major blow, the Germans fourth-place finish cutting his 25-point advantage over Hamilton to 12",5
"Hamilton led a Mercedes one-two, their first of the season, his team-mate Valtteri Bottas finishing second with the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo third Ferrari had been stymied almost from the start Vettel suffered damage on the opening lap and was forced to play catch-up while his team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, lost places off the grid and had to adopt an alternate strategy, managing to finish only seventh",3
"Hamilton, who gained his debut F1 win here in 2007, relished the success You always need weekends like this, he said There was a lot of time to think when I was out front, reliving the memories of 2007, really being able to absorb the moment and enjoy driving the car It was a challenge but it was like other races I have had here, well managed from the front I love driving this track",5
Hamilton had indeed been untouchable in front He was in a class of his own in qualifying and a race of his own on Sunday It continues the remarkably successful run that began with his first victory here and puts him one behind Michael Schumachers record of seven wins,3
" Having taken the chequered flag in China and Spain already he is now honours even with Vettel  they have three wins apiece  and crucially within touching distance of the German in the title tussle, while his mastery of this demanding track on the le Notre-Dame is simply beyond doubt The deft touch and steely nerve that Montreal demands were once again to the fore and, although he was not under pressure, he did not put a foot wrong",2
" There was no trouble today, he said",1
" It was a beautiful Sunday driveWith the order upset Force India took advantage and, aided by their upgraded Mercedes power unit, Sergio Prez and Esteban Ocon were in the mix throughout They drove superbly to finish fifth and sixth but the team faced a difficult debrief afterwards for not allowing Ocon, quicker than his team-mate in the latter stages, through, thereby assisting Vettels attempt to catch and pass them bothVettel had to pursue his own singular race and did so with admirable determination The German had jumped Hamilton at the start of this race in 2016 but there was no repeat performance",5
" Instead he was caught by the Red Bull of Max VerstappenVerstappen had an electric start and shot up the outside into turn one, while Vettel dropped two spots into fourth but he had not only lost places The Dutch driver clipped Vettels right front wing and he subsequently also suffered from a damaged floor It changed the complexion of Vettels afternoon immediately A stop for a new wing followed, forcing him into a two-stop strategy, while Hamilton could stick to his plan, staying out long on the quicker ultra soft rubber and pitting only once, the optimum for the race, but Vettel was determined to limit the damage",5
After his final stop he came out in seventh and a chase to the finish ensued,1
" Raikkonen was first to fall The Finn, suffering from brake issues, went straight on at the final chicane and Vettel passed him for sixth place on lap 61 On a charge he passed Ocon in a superb move into turn one on lap 66 to go fifth and then went after Prez",3
 This was thrilling stuff at the end and it paid off Vettel pulled off another remarkable move through the final chicane on lap 69 to finish fourth  a result that looked unthinkable after the opening lap,2
"He was, nevertheless, disappointed but accepted the clash at the start had been a racing incident The beginning of the race did not go our way but I still believed we could fight back, he said",2
 Three cars into turn one does not work,1
" He [Verstappen] ran over my front wing You dont do that on purpose because of the chance of a punctureLance Stroll, the Canadian rookie, scored his first points in Formula One at his home grand prix, with what was by far his best drive of the season, finishing in ninth for WilliamsRenaults Nico Hlkenberg came in eighth and the Haas of Romain Grosjean 10th while McLaren took another step towards a divorce from Honda after Fernando Alonsos engine gave out on the penultimate lapBut the day had belonged to Hamilton as it has so often in Montreal",5
" Niki Lauda, the Mercedes non-executive chairman, acknowledged they had got everything right",1
" The whole team is back, he said This race weekend was perfect",2
He was understandably pleased because it was enough for Mercedes to retake the lead in the constructors championship from Ferrari by eight points,1
" The teams executive director, Toto Wolff, described it as an afternoon that was a cruise and so it had been for Hamilton But he executed the race perfectly and leaves Canada not only with a winning feeling but right back in the title fightOnly the foolish would celebrate too hard the Wallabies 37-14 win against a spirited Fijian outfit in Melbourne on Saturday",3
" Yes, of course Karmichael Hunt is a massive positive takeaway point  he was magnificent at 12 and is a match-day 23 keeper  but, overall, coach Michael Cheika should be deeply concerned about his sides atrocious catch-and-pass skillsIts such a glaring inadequacy it renders all positives moot: Australia will lose more often than not against top tier opposition until players learn how to catch and pass accurately  and that means putting the ball in the space in front of support runners, and not behind them whereby players need to check their run and thus lose attacking momentumWith the exception of two of the five Australian tries, the Wallabies were unquestionably poor at this fundamental aspect of the game",3
" In fact, on this showing the Wallabies have never looked further adrift of the All Blacks who are undisputed masters of this core skillPoor catch-and-pass skills have been a blight on the Australian game for nigh on a decade now, and particularly so in the last two Super Rugby seasons It has reached the point where excuses are regularly trotted out: the Kiwis are innately better because they learn these skills from a younger age, and so on",3
" Indeed, thats a reason why New Zealand rugby players catch and pass so well by default But its not an excuse for Australian players being as inadequate as they are now In fact, Australia used to be the envy of the rugby world for this elementary skill set with the Ella brothers, Michael Lynagh, Stephen Larkham, David Knox, Lloyd Walker to name a few leading exponentsThere simply isnt a good enough reason for the Wallabies to be so lacking in this basic aspect of the game Its not as if its beyond them  the interchange between Hunt and Bernard Foley to put Israel Folau away for a gem of a try was a perfect example of flawless execution; players coming onto the ball in space  or where the space will be  and at pace",5
" That was a classic Wallabies try of the kind we rarely see these daysIf Cheika and skills coach Mick Byrne (the former All Blacks kick and pass specialist) can sort out the Wallabies catch-and-pass basics, Australia can at least be competitive against the All Blacks during this years Bledisloe Cup/Rugby Championship On the weekends showing though, the Wallabies will struggle to beat Scotland next up",3
Cheika would have been pleased with what the Fijians brought to the contest Its always a coaching bonus to take big learnings away from a game which has been comfortably won Too often these lessons only come from heartbreaking losses,3
"Unfortunately, one of the lessons from Saturday is that Wallabies captain Stephen Moore, 34, might not make it to the 2019 World Cup in Japan Moore is backing himself to improve, but unless theres a sharp upturn on what he showed off the bench against Fiji it might be the end for him",2
" Michael Hoopers permanent captaincy claims are becoming irresistibleWhat of the Fijians, who will, likely qualification permitting, again play Australia in the World Cup pool stages? There is no mistaking Fiji are a team on the rise Leone Nakarawa was magnificent and troubled the Wallabies no end",3
 He truly is a world class player at the peak of his game,1
The 37-14 scoreline suggests a comfortable Wallabies victory but it was far from that,1
" Fiji butchered several try-scoring opportunities which, had passes stuck, could have seen the islanders sneak a famous win",1
 The Wallabies would have noted the big omissions of Montpellier winger Nemani Nadolo and Toulons Josua Tuisova,1
" And if Fiji can find a quality fly-half  Ben Volavola is simply not international quality  then it could be game on at the World CupSurreys recent record at Guildford, where they are winless since 2002, is abysmal and they require a broad backbone to avoid defeat against Essex With three second-innings wickets in hand they are 217 ahead; victory would take Essex, without a County Championship title since 1992, top of Division One",3
"Essex are making a superb fist of life in the top flight, and this was one of their best days yet Ryan ten Doeschate swelled their first innings advantage to 36 with an unbeaten 168, his top score for Essex, then Simon Harmer, finding drift, turn and bounce with men round the bat, and Jamie Porter, hammering at a length and doing just enough with the ball, bowled beautifully to share seven Surrey wickets Surreys hopes lie with Ben Foakes, once of Essex, who has 46",3
"Ten Doeschate had guided the tail through the first 90 minutes of the day, turning down singles but bunting boundaries between the men in the deep In the half-hour before lunch, Surrey lost Mark Stoneman, caught at first slip off Porter as second slip parried, but Rory Burns and Scott Borthwick bedded in to share 93 in the face of probing bowling",2
"By tea, both were gone, though Borthwick was well taken at short leg off Harmer, then Burns  who had driven nicely in his 57  was bemused to be given out caught down the legside off Porter Again, with the lead not yet 100, it was left to Kumar Sangakkara to bail Surrey out",3
" This time he could not, beaten by Harmers turn and caught behind in 26 that saw him pass 900 runs for the season",1
"Dom Sibley was then trapped in front by one that stayed low from Porter, and Sam Curran was well caught at cover off Harmer Eighteen overs of resistance from Foakes with Gareth Batty was ended by a catch at short leg, giving Harmer  an increasingly canny Kolpak signing  his fourth",2
" Surrey need to grow their lead plenty: while scoring is becoming trickier (particularly off the good length frequented by Porter), boundaries continue to flow and Essexs batting, as Ten Doeschate showed first time round, is very well stockedMiddlesex have not lost since the final game of the 2015 season but a torrid performance at Southport leaves them requiring a superb final day to escape without defeat against Lancashire Ryan McLarens 75 and some late humpty from Tom Bailey carried Lancashire from 136 for six to 309 and a first-innings lead of 129, with Tim Murtagh picking up six for 63",3
"The champions were instantly in trouble, though",1
" They were six down and still behind, with Steve Parry taking three wickets and Saqib Mahmood two, before the shop was steadied by Dawid Malan and James Harris With four wickets in hand, they lead by just 27At Taunton, the equation is simple: Somerset need 161 runs, Yorkshire need six wickets The visitors piled up 283 in their second innings, with Gary Ballance left stranded two shy of his fourth century of the season, to set Somerset 262 for victory Dom Bess, the 19-year-old offspinner, worked his way through 36 overs to record five for 80",5
" Somerset made a poor start to the chase, with Steve Patterson took three wickets as they fell to 49 for four",1
" Steve Davies and Adam Hose, on Championship debut, shared an unbeaten 52 to leave the final day tantalisingly poisedDurhams wait for a Division Two win lags on, as Kent batted throughout the final day to remain unbeaten, with Sam Northeast making 72 and the last pair, Yasir Shah and Mitchell Claydon, surviving 46 deliveries to secure the draw nine wickets down",2
" Durhams maximum bonus points will be no tonic: they remain on minus nine pointsWorcestershire, having won their first four games of the season, have lost their way in the wake of the saga thats seen Tom Kohler-Cadmore join his native Yorkshire with immediate effect",2
" On day one, they had Glamorgan 58 for six, trailing by 209, but they ended up losing by nine wickets before lunch on the third day Michael Hogan took five wickets to bowl Worcestershire out for 129, before Glamorgan knocked off the required 16 for the loss of just Nick Selman for their second win of the summerNorthamptonshire recorded their fourth win of the summer, over Derbyshire by 128 runs",3
" Conor McKerr, a 19-year-old seamer on loan from Surrey, took his second five-wicket haul to finish with match figures of 10 for 141 as Northants subsided from 225 for one to 277 all out in their second innings They responded, though, by bowling Derbyshire out for 191 The absent Luis Reece is feeling better after suffering breathing difficulties on the first dayNottinghamshire, are well placed to extend their lead at the top of Division Two after Samit Patel racked up an unbeaten 257 not out, a career best, in their 535 for eight declared against Gloucestershire That was a lead of 232, and the hosts lost Cameron Bancroft to Luke Fletcher as they reached stumps 30 for one",5
 Nottinghamshire will have James Pattinson available for their One-Day Cup knockout match against Somerset on TuesdayJofra Archer confirmed his status as one of the games most promising fast bowlers by turning Sussexs match with Leicestershire on its head,2
" He took six for 70 (giving him match figures of 11 for 137) as Leicestershire were bowled out for 175 in their second innings (all the more impressive given Sussex were without the injured Vernon Philander), leaving Sussex a target of 232",1
" They closed 100 for twoRacings ruling body has denied undue delay in considering a licence application by Suzi Best, wife of Jim, whose licence to train was suspended at the end of a protracted and troubled non-trier case last year",2
" The Guardian can reveal that Suzi Bests application will now be considered at a hearing on 19 June, the very last day on which her husband is suspended",1
"Privately British Horseracing Authority officials insist this is nothing more than a coincidence and certainly does not amount to evidence of victimisation They are prevented from offering any direct comment by the rules of racing, which insist that licensing proceedings are confidential and must not be discussed in public by either side",2
"Asked why it would take so long to consider a licence application that was made in the first half of December, a BHA spokesman confined himself to explaining the system in general terms rather than discussing Bests case Generally the time required to determine a licence application can vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of additional information required and how quickly that information is provided, he saidApproached for comment, Jim Best declined to discuss his wifes application, saying he had no wish to antagonise the BHA further He added that he had not been to the races in the past six months, even though there was nothing in his suspension to prevent him from going, because he was concerned that his presence might be viewed as inappropriateHowever, it was clearly the hope of the Best family, at the time of Suzis application, that she would be given a licence before her husbands suspension ended and keep the business going at their stable near Lewes in Sussex",5
" In a December interview with The Guardian Jim Best pointed to the concern shown by the BHAs disciplinary panel for the future of staff employed at the yard I dont think it was the chairmans intention for [the business] to be totally finished, he saidThe BHAs decision to refer Suzi Bests application to its licensing committee is in contrast to its handling of the jockey Paul John, who had already admitted stopping two horses when he applied to get his licence back a year ago",3
" John claimed Best had told him to stop the horses and was the only BHA witness against Best in hearings in February and November last year, which resulted in a finding against Best, despite his denials The BHA decided not to oppose Johns application, which was duly granted, prompting concern from licensing committee membersThe committee chairman, Richard Russell, sent an email to ask: Why was Paul John not referred to us? The only reason I can even think of is that, until the Jim Best case has been retried, the BHA did not want Paul John going before the licensing committee or any of its other independent committees",3
" Another of my committee made the comment: I am sure nothing untoward has happened but it just savours a little bit of a done deal in a way that a decision by us cannotThe disciplinary panel in Bests case eventually ruled that the BHA had agreed to give John lenient treatment in exchange for giving evidence, something which the BHA had denied for monthsFrances Champion Hurdle fell to a British raider for the third year in a row on Sunday when LAmi Serge bagged the 142,000 prize for Nicky Henderson",3

"10 Pearl Acclaim (nb)Roy Keane had called for a war but what he got was bloody awful until, that is, Jon Walters stormed to Irelands rescue five minutes from timeThe Irish had trailed since the 31st minute, when Martin Hinteregger struck for a depleted Austrian side who seemed on course to revive their World Cup qualification hopes by dealing a blow to those of their hosts, who were incoherent for much of this match But then Ireland rallied, equalised and even forced the ball into the net a second time, only for the referee to disallow the goal for a supposed foul on the goalkeeper by Shane Duffy, much to the anger of Martin ONeill",3
"With Serbia and Wales also in the running GroupD looks likely to go down to the wire and Ireland can take confidence from this demonstration of their ability to fight to the finish Whatever else they lack, their determination is bottomless No one personifies it better than Walters",3
" Jons not the quickest but hes got a real knowledge of the game and a really great will, ONeill said He is totally invaluable to usDublin looked a picture under a glowing sun but this match all but defaced it in the first half",3
" With wayward passes, clunky touches and negligible imagination it was grisly viewing until Austria scored with a goal of incongruous quality",1
 The visitors had offered a smidgin more neatness than the hosts in the opening half an hour but nothing that foreshadowed the artfulness of their breakthrough It came from a corner delivered by David Alaba Aleksandar Dragovic and Sebastian Prdl flummoxed the Irish defence by letting the ball run past them and over to Hinteregger near the penalty spot,3
" He took one touch before firing past Darren RandolphThere was no immediate trace of an Irish riposte Robbie Brady and Jeff Hendrick can usually be relied on to serve up a measure of creativity but both were sloppy, Brady ineffective from the right wing and Hendrick offering meagre invention in an advanced central role The game was crying out for Wes Hoolahan, the 35-year-old on the benchI knew at half-time that we had left so many things behind and there was a determination in the second half to redress it, said ONeill, who made no personnel changes during the break but his team did emerge with more dynamism",5
"The fragments of class still came from Austria, though The visitors forged a chance to increase their lead when Alaba drove through midfield before flipping the ball wide to the dangerous Florian Kainz and charging into the box",2
" Kainzs low cross was fractionally in front of Alaba, who had to stretch as he shot from 10 yards and that affected his accuracyONeill rejigged his team in the 55th minute, introducing Daryl Murphy up front alongside Walters and reassigning Brady to left-back in place of the substituted Stephen Ward Ireland improved",3
 They cranked up the intensity and delivered more and better balls into the box For the first time Austria looked vulnerable,2
McClean rattled them further when he cut inside from the right and shot a couple of yards wide from the edge of the area,1
"ONeill cast on Hoolahan in the 71st minute and the little schemer almost created an equaliser within moments, delivering a wicked inswinging cross from the left that triggered such panic that Stefan Lainer almost slashed it into his own goal The goalkeeper, Heinz Lindner, came to his rescue",2
Austria rode that storm and would have increased their lead if not for a fine save by Randolph,1
" Just as the visitors sensed a victory, Walters struck It was classic Walters, the striker marauding on to a punt by Randolph, outmuscling Dragovic and walloping the bouncing ball into the bottom corner from 18 yards The crowd went wild and two minutes later they thought things had got even better when Duffy headed into the net from close range after a massive scramble in the Austrian goalmouth",3
" But the Spanish referee, David Fernndez Borbaln, reckoned there had been a shove on the goalkeeper",1
"We had a legitimate goal disallowed, ONeill said",1
" The referee was not to blame for our performance in the first half but I thought he was very poor indeed The Austrian centre-back Prdl said on the pitch that, if it had been the other way round he would have been very disappointed The draw, at least, suited Ireland more than Austria",3
"Ben Stokes could stride into the Champions Trophy semi-final on Wednesday believing himself to be invincible at present but the England all-rounder has said he is not the type to get carried away with his performances; unsatisfied, he will continue striving to reach new levelsHaving bounced Australia out of the tournament exit door at Edgbaston with his career-best unbeaten 102, as Eoin Morgans side made it three wins from three in the group stage, Stokes underlined his status as the player all other teams covet and added more clout to the argument that we are witnessing a oncein-a-generation cricketer",2
"Stokes himself, however, is trying to ignore the hype even though the Indian captain, Virat Kohli, used social media on Saturday to laud a four through the covers off the generally brutalised Pat Cummins  with a break of the wrists to add some deliberate slice  as the best shot he has seen in a long time",1
"I just shut it out, Stokes said You can do well one day and then not do well the other and you are not as good as everyone says You just keep your feet on the floor",3
" I never feel I get too high and I never feel I get too low about things Everyone else may deal with things like that differently but that is just how I go about itI am always trying to get better as a player, no matter how things are going, always trying to expand my game and look into how I can hit more areas or bowl different balls or whatever it is",3
 Im always looking to learn and am never happy with how I am going I think once you get comfortable with what you are offering it is dangerous territory to be in,2
"Lending itself to this level-headedness is the fact that Englands 40-run win by DuckworthLewisStern method  set up by the wonderful counterattacking stand of 159 from 35 for three with Morgan  was the first time Stokes has struck threefigures in a one-day international run chase, with his second innings average going into the match just 20 from 24 innings with one half-centuryThere was a point during his innings in the 70s where Stokes admitted his beans were going a bit and, upon recognising this could lead to his downfall, decided to throttle things back a touch and reset himself once more Such an acknowledgment is one aspect to the 26-year-olds game that has developed over the past year, not least during his subcontinental winter",3
"The Indian Premier League is getting much of the praise here and it would be ignoring the evidence to say there were no benefits, such as an acclimatisation to pressure-cooker stadiums, coping with the expectation of being the tournaments most expensive overseas signing at 17m and gleaning advice from the masala of world-class players on offerSteve Smith, the Australia captain who led Stokes at Rising Pune Supergiant, may now regret being one of those who offered some help",3
" He just gave a little tip out in India, something on my technique, something that he felt could help me with, Stokes said I was losing my backside a bit when I was hitting",2
The whole thing with the IPL is the exposure you get to big moments in games playing in front of a huge crowd all the time,1
 In situations like 35 for three [against Australia] you can just mentally look back to a time in the past and reflect on that and also take confidence in knowing that you have been in that situation before and done well,1
"Such a situation arose when Stokes struck his maiden IPL hundred from 10 for three last month in a match against Gujarat Lions, and winning the tournaments MVP award in his first season was also a significant (and certainly will not be come next years auction) achievement The experience, according to the Englands one-day batting coach, Graham Thorpe, has added an extra edge to a player who was already among the most diligent",2
"He would have felt pressure going over there but there is something different about him now, Thorpe said He wasnt lacking in confidence before  in a nice way, not arrogance  but maybe its a belief, from being around those types of players, that he belongsHim and Joe Root hit the most balls Ive seen among young players over the years You might be able to give them advice but they look to develop their own games Ben has always been powerful but hes adding new elements to his game",5
 Hes very good at self-exploring,1
" When he started, he hit a lot of balls and had fun but now hes really consolidated his basics, tooFor all the benefits Stokes felt from the IPL, the tournament is not crickets allhealing grotto at Lourdes if Jason Roys returns since a largely unused spell with Gujarat  51 runs in eight one-day innings that see Jonny Bairstow in line for the semi-final  are consideredThorpe said: I think it can go one way or the other",3
" It can be a great experience but there is another side We have a player who maybe didnt go there and play every game Thats sport and life though, he could well go back next year and have a really positive experienceRoy will hope that his recent funk does not see him miss out when the Twenty20 squad to face South Africa at the end of the month is named on Monday Stokes and Root are expected to be given a breather before the Tests in July, with Dawid Malan, Liam Livingstone and Sam Northeast among those who could feature",5
"Front-foot no-balls are not memorable The sundries column is the last to be interrogated on any scorecard, if ever",2
" Yet when Morne Morkel overstepped in South Africas doomed defence of 191, Indian partisans roared as loud as they did at any stage during the romping eight-wicket win For white-ball foot faults mean free hits; a guarantee of seeing one of their adored wallopers go for goldIt was a moment emblematic of the fanaticism the follows this team everywhere, capable of overwhelming anyone",3
" In this match, the Proteas were just that: smothered The top seeds Champions Trophy exit was sealed by a skittish batting effort, punctuated by three run outs ranging from desperate to comical through the course of a collapse in which they lost eight wickets for 51 runs Breezy half-centuries from Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli then completed the thrashing with ease",3
"A perfect South London morning brought sizable expectations, this the first of two quasi-quarter-finals to resolve who qualifies for the final four The suddendeath nature  after both teams unexpectedly lost their previous fixtures  added the heat needed for a tournament so far hindered by relentless rainAfter being put in, South Africas slow but serviceable start was their only period of parity with Kohlis men",3
" With run-rate pressure building, their angst showed between the wickets",1
" In the space of five balls, captain AB de Villiers was found short for a single that wasnt there before Faf du Plessis burned David Miller as both batsmen dived for the same end  some 22 yards from where the bails were being removed",1
" It was ugly The innings never recovered, all five bowlers contributing to the wickets column in a consistent and disciplined display",2
"Afterwards, DeVilliers accepted the performance ranks right up there  or down there  in the lengthy list of defeats his nation has suffered at the pointy end of major tournaments over the past quarter-century Through soft dismissals we lost our way and that was the part for me that hurt the most, the captains assessment",2
" A few mistakes cost us badlyHis opposing number underlined a marked improvement in the games third discipline as the driver behind the victory, coming after Sri Lanka upset their campaign on Thursday We had a complete performance in the field, Kohli said This was something that we required Before going out we had a chat and in the huddle I said that I wanted everyones intensity to go up",5
"He added praise for the difficulty posed by his bowlers from the outset While Hashim Amla and Quinton deKocks opening partnership reached 75, it never came at better than four runs an overThe former was the first to go when MSDhoni showed he has lost nothing with the gloves, snaffling a fine low catch from the bowling of Ravichandran Ashwin",3
" A half-century was tallied by the latter, but he departed an over later when Ashwins spin twin Ravi Jadeja brought a delivery back through the sweeping left-handers gateFollowing the pair of run-outs it was the turn of Indias seamers to cash in, Jasprit Bumrah trapping Andile Phehlukwayo with a hooping outswinger before Bhuvneshwar Kumar found the edge of Kagiso Rabada and Morkel with consecutive classy deliveries Predictably, the innings ended with another mid-pitch mix-up some 33 balls short of the full allotment",3
"In reply, India were able to play within themselves, knocking off the runs with 12 overs in hand Dhawan top-scored, slapping an imposing 78 at the top of the list, allowing Kohli to do as he does best with an unbeaten 76 He was there at the end with the veteran Yuvraj Singh, who finished the game with a massive six over midwicket, much to the delight of the capacity crowd, who were chanting in unison for exactly that",3
"The opener played the more distinctive of the innings, on multiple occasions pulling to the rope with a compact and powerful swing By now far behind in the game, there was little South Africas seamers could do",2
" Meanwhile, Kohli has now reached 50 in four of his past five innings, nearing his top gear at the perfect time",1
"To reach the final at this same venue next Sunday India will need to overcome Bangladesh on Thursday at Edgbaston Using history as a guide, having defeated their easterly neighbour in all but five of their 32 meetings, they will go in strong favourites",2
" With Pakistan facing Sri Lanka for the right to play England in the first semi-final on Wednesday, three of the four teams who remain will be from the subcontinentSouth Africa are once again left to once again ponder what might have been",2
" They will do so while remaining in the country rather than returning home, continuing their tour of England with four Tests at the conclusion of the Champions Trophy That will hurt, and it should",2
It is impossible to overstate the fresh sense of purpose that has accompanied the entire British & Irish Lions squad south from Christchurch to Otago,1
 Not many sides conquer a strong Crusaders team with something to spare and the result on Saturday had two significant consequences Not only do these Lions have more belief in themselves but New Zealands worst nightmare is in danger of materialising,2
"From a New Zealand point of view all was relatively normal before the weekend The touring team had been struggling to make an impression, the local media were in full wind-up mode and the Crusaders and the Highlanders were about to treat their visitors to a double shot of southern discomfort",2
" Suddenly Warren Gatland is on the offensive, even publicly querying the legality of Super Rugby scrummaging, and the mangy, jet-lagged Lions of last week have morphed into completely different animals",1
"It is not too much of an exaggeration, listening to some of the whinging about the performance of the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, to suggest sections of the New Zealand rugby community appear rattled A referee prepared to apply the laws? A hard-nosed away team with decent line speed, aggressive but disciplined forwards and excellent tactical kickers? None of this is remotely illegal but, for some reason, the Lions are now being accused of trampling across the beautiful gameThere was a glorious moment at the press conference in the Lions team hotel on Sunday when a Kiwi inquisitor asked Gatland about his teams meagre return of two tries in three tour matches",3
" How many have we conceded? Gatland retorted, quick as a flash Cue a lot of chin-stroking These Lions have shipped only four tries in their first 240 minutes in New Zealand yet focusing on that side of the ledger is considerably less popularOf course Gatlands team need to improve their strike rate at some stage but, as Graham Henry observed on radio at the weekend, there is more than one way to win a game of rugby The beauty, ugly or not, of Saturday was the huge improvement in physicality and forward control that squeezed the Crusaders at source",5
" Keep progressing on both fronts over the next 10 days and the All Blacks will have a stiff challenge on their hands at Eden Park on Saturday weekThe Crusaders, remember, boasted six All Blacks in their pack alone yet, aside from one dominant scrum, trailed in second in most key areas of the game With slightly more precision the Lions could have scored two or three tries in addition to Owen Farrells four penalties",3
" In the back five of the scrum, in particular, Gatland is spoilt for choice Maro Itoje or Alun Wyn Jones? Peter OMahony or CJStander? Sam Warburton, Sean OBrien or Justin Tipuric alongside Taulupe Faletau? With the All Blacks trio of Kieran Read, Dan Coles and Jerome Kaino either sidelined or short of recent rugby, it is far from guaranteed New Zealand will win all the meaningful collisions",2
Add to that the ability of Conor Murray and Farrell to pen opponents deep in their own half with judicious kicks out of hand and the Lions really will be tough to beat when their final passes become more accurate and their attacking rhythm improves,1
" I thought we played some excellent rugby, said Gatland, refusing to accept the Lions are a negative bunch with little to recommend them",1
 Its only the third time in their history the Crusaders have scored only three points in a match and both of the other occasions were away from home,1
" That teams been together for only a week and this is the sixth hotel weve been in since weve been in New Zealand We made 13 line breaks, I didnt see any negative rugby",2
In terms of the scrums Gatland was similarly bullish: I felt they had one scrum where they had some ascendancy but on the whole we scrummaged pretty well Im a little bit surprised such a huge amount has been made of the scrum,2
" I thought the referee did a good job If you look at the numbers elsewhere, I thought we dominated in every other area: lineout, territory, possession, carries, line breaksIt probably did not help that Monsieur Raynal was the official with the whistle in Chicago when Ireland defeated New Zealand last autumn; either way, the Frenchmans dislike of the pre-scrum engagement common in Super Rugby did not concern Gatland",3
"The law says there must be a small gap but they dont play to the law of the game So Super Rugby sides tend to scrummage illegally if thats the case, he said The scrums not going to be a problem for us",3
" I think our scrum will be very strong by the time we come around to Test timeWho starts in the Test midfield remains a fascinating debate For all the promise of the Farrell-Jonathan Sexton axis on Saturday it would be no surprise if Gatland prefers a Farrell-Teo-Davies combo at 10, 12 and 13, with George North and Liam Williams on the wings and, depending on Stuart Hoggs fitness, one of Jared Payne, Leigh Halfpenny or Anthony Watson at full-back",3
"Weve got lots of options; weve just got to get the right ones, Gatland said Im sure there will be a lot of difference of opinion in final selection and thats going to be the challenge for us",2

" Attendance 20,497Sam Warburton says he will not lead the British & Irish Lions into the first Test against the All Blacks on Saturday week unless he truly believes he is worth his place The Welsh flanker concedes his inclusion is not yet certain and he may not be ready unless he has a storming game against the Highlanders on TuesdayWarburton has played only 66 minutes of rugby on tour, having strained an ankle in the opening quarter of the opening game He is finally fit to return to the side but says he will not hesitate to advise Warren Gatland, the head coach, not to pick him if he struggles to match the form shown by Irelands Sean OBrien and Peter OMahony in the 12-3 win against the Crusaders on Saturday",5
"Ill be honest with Gats and Gats will be honest with me, Warburton said, after the squads arrival in Dunedin If I play Tuesday and I still feel Im a bit undercut, then I might not be ready for that first Test Ill be perfectly honest with Warren: if I feel I need more games, then Ill tell him I dont feel ready",3
" If I dont need any, then Ill obviously let him know that with a good performance",1
"Warburton has long been among the most selfless of captains but he accepts he has played insufficient recent rugby to be a first Test certainty I definitely need more games, the Cardiff Blues forward said I knew that coming into the tour Ive received this role as tour captain but I know theres every chance I might not even get involved in that first Test Maybe that would be the situation or maybe I could have a blinder on Tuesday and feel absolutely fine",5
" If Ive made the Test, then that would be a bonus for me but there are three Tests to get selected for so the first one is not the be-all and end-allHis honesty is to be applauded but invites speculation as to who might be involved should he not feature The Lions may also have to soldier on without the full-back Stuart Hogg, who is due to see a specialist to check the facial injury he sustained when his room-mate Conor Murrays elbow inadvertently caught him in the first half of the Crusaders fixture",3
" With Ross Moriarty (back spasm) and Jonathan Davies (concussion protocols) also unavailable, Gatland has opted to play CJStander at No8 alongside Warburton and James Haskell, with Jared Payne and Dan Biggar also fit to resume at No15 and No10 respectively",1
"The Test prospects of, among others, Anthony Watson, Liam Williams, George North, Ben Teo, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola, George Kruis, Maro Itoje, OMahony and OBrien have probably been enhanced by their absence from the midweek lineup",1
" The All Black backline trio of Waisake Naholo, Malakai Fekitoa and Lima Sopoaga all start for the Highlanders but three other internationals  Ben Smith, Aaron Smith and Liam Squire  will sit out the game along with five players due to represent the Maori against the Lions this Saturday",1
Gatland says the Lions will not necessarily put out their optimum Test XV but Warburton confirms internal squad competition is intensifying Now weve all had a game it feels its audition time for the Test series,2
 You know theyre going to start putting their Test team together pretty soon He also admits to feeling momentary panic when injury hit in the opening fixture It was about 15 minutes into the game,3

" Around 300,000 have duly sifted through the long list and picked out their favourites in every position",1
"Unsurprisingly, Antoine Griezmann scores highly, included in more than 99% of the voters selections Not so far behind, chosen by more than 97%, is a player who did not win his third cap until Friday Kylian Mbapp has been included on the strength of his explosive season as footballs latest golden boy, on the assumption that he must be a natural at this level tooThis freakishly talented 18-year-old was largely kept in reserve for Frances recent doubleheader of a friendly against Paraguay, followed by the shock World Cup qualification defeat in Sweden, when he sprinted on for a late cameo but did not really have the opportunity to make an impressionPerhaps he will get more of a chance to show what he can do against England on Tuesday  and the desire to see Griezmann playing just off Mbapp as the attacking spear of a new-look France is understandably enticing  but, all of a sudden, there is an urgency about theagenda that buzzes around the topic of the new generation",5
" Is it time to push for change?Is the moment right to shake up the side that is still largely built on the components that took France to the final of Euro 2016? Those questions lurked in the shadows of the postmortems after defeat in Stockholm, as the French tried to figure out how on earth they have squandered top spot in Group AFrance had the game, marked by fabulous finishing, under reasonable control as they pressed for a winner in the closing stages, but it was turned on its head at the death",2
" Swedens players were overjoyed as they scalped France with a brilliant, opportunistic, stoppage-time strike Hugo Lloris, who had presented Ola Toivonen with the chance to find an unguarded net from half a pitch away, looked as if he wanted to eat his own gloves as some kind of penanceWorld Cup qualification is suddenly a more stressful operation than France had in mind Lloris was profoundly apologetic Deschamps was stern-faced and straight-talking as he laid out the requirement to win all of their remaining games",5
"How quickly the tone of conversation has changed The next few months for France were supposed to be about fine-tuning, about evolving, about Deschamps prising himself away from his loyalty to tried and trusted players to unleash the prodigies in their place There is such demand to see the new wave fast tracked into the first XI The seemingly unstoppable trajectory of Mbapp, the silky touches of Thomas Lemar and the darting dribbles of Ousmane Dembl make strong cases to be the present rather than the future They already look revved up and ready to go and Deschamps is under pressure to weigh up how he balances what they offer compared to an older generation that he trusts",5
"In Sweden, for a game Deschamps (rightly) assumed might pose physical and tactical challenges, the France manager was reluctant to be too bold Having already integrated exciting full-backs in the Monaco pair Benjamin Mendy and Djibril Sidib, Deschamps chose more conservatively in attacking positions, mindful that the young whizzes further forward might not track back or be as diligent as a more experienced option",2
" But Moussa Sissoko? Really? Having spent a season as an expensive spare part at White Hart Lane, he struggled to match the intensity of the toughest group game between the top twoSuch are the decisions Deschamps wrestles with as he tries to sensibly manage the integration of the new wave",2
" Sissoko and his season in the shadows or the vibrant prospect of Dembl? Olivier Giroud, with his weird blend of not-quite moments and an excellent scoring rate  17 goals from his last 17 starts for his country, including a piercingly swiped volley in Sweden  or the wonderkid Mbapp? Dimitri Payet, their star of the Euros, who has found some form again after a mid-season dip, or the purposeful bursts of Lemar?France are spoiled for choice, but those choices are not that straightforward It is a dilemma of sorts: loyalty versus audacity That topic has been put into sharper focus now that the World Cup qualification scenario has changed Only group winners take a guaranteed ticket to Russia; France are behind Sweden on goal difference, with four games remainingHow long is the life of a team? The question was posed by a French journalist, Vincent Duluc, in the aftermath of the quirky defeat in Sweden",5
" Deschamps is not about to abandon the Euro 2016 team, which has formed the basis of this qualification campaign",1
 But the fresh faces are ready and waiting to seize the opportunity How they handle the friendly against England should give the manager even more food for thoughtA school of thought insists that it is unhealthy to crank up the hype trains lever so it approaches speeds worthy of a Shinkansen But  but Christian Pulisic,5
 Christian Pulisic! CHRISTIAN PULISIC,1
" Christian PulisicIf there is hope when the US face Mexico at Estadio Azteca on Sunday night, it lies on the 18-year-olds small but sturdy shoulders",2
" Hard to conclude otherwise after the 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Trinidad & Tobago on Thursday in ColoradoThis is a roster replete with decent players capable of getting a team to the second round of a World Cup finals, and one step farther if the draws kind Pulisic, though, even so early in his career, is the only one who looks like hed belong in the line-up of a top-10 nation, a side that expects to reach the semi-finalsOf the two outfield regulars with the biggest reputations, though only 29, Michael Bradley appears to be settling into a role where he is more shield than sword, disrupting the opposition rather than defining the flow of his own sides attacks Substituted after 61 minutes on Thursday, Clint Dempsey subjected his coach, Bruce Arena, to that famous Deuce glare, eyes boring into his targets soul like an electric drill bit",5
"That surely reflected natural frustration at missing an ideal opportunity to grab the goal that would bring him level with Landon Donovan at the top of the USs all-time scoring chart But its tempting also to see it as a symbolic moment, a scene stemming from the pathos of a player on the way down who knows hes ceding his status as the key forward to a team-mate roughly half his age",2
Pulisic scored his second goal of the game a minute after Dempsey trudged off,1
" And like the former Premier League man in his prime, it was a move that showed him to be both an exuberant creator and a clinical finisher",1
"Forced to pick between the two, its not a hard choice Given that both tend to roam all over the final third, making Jozy Altidores selection important because his more static style provides a fulcrum for attacks, Arena may well have to make a decision",2
" The US have only ever won once in Mexico, a 1-0 friendly victory in 2012 Overall, El Tri have won 23 of 26 home games against their rivals",2
" Starting with all three forwards would seem hubristicArena said on Thursday that he intends to make changes for Sundays match In the high altitude of Mexico City, on short rest, it would appear logical to put the 34-year-old on the bench and go with the hotter feet of the Borussia Dortmund player, who has seven goals in 15 international appearances, five of them coming in eight World Cup qualifiersHes ahead of his time - he gets the ball hes super comfortable on it, hes never ever panicking, you see him when he gets inside the box he stands his defender up and the world is his oyster Hes special, these guys dont come around very often, said Tim Howard, the US goalkeeper",5
"Will Mexico try to intimidate him physically, as T&T tried as did Panama before them? If I were any team that played us Id certainly target him Not sure hed win a street fight but hell always get stuck into a tackle, hes not afraid",2
" Hes a big boy, plays in the Bundesliga, he knows what its about, Howard said But hes not afraid and thats huge for us Because you look at him, hes not the biggest, not the strongest, teams are always going to come in and try and get stuck in to him",3
"The highest-profile encounter in Concacafs Hexagonal qualifying phase is in one way also the lowest-pressure for the visitors Students of the fixtures history, as well as the relative positions of the teams, could only conclude that the Americans are highly likely to loseGiven the forgiving nature of the group, which sees the top three teams automatically reach Russia while the fourth faces a play-off against an Asian side, losing on the road will not be fatal to American prospects as long as they keep winning at home",3
"Mexico beat Honduras 3-0 on Thursday while Costa Rica and Panama shared a goalless draw The US win lifted them to third in the standings, six points behind Mexico in first",2
Mexico have conceded only once in five Hexagonal games,1
" Arenas team was unconvincing enough at the back, especially out wide, to merit a sense of foreboding about what might transpire in the Azteca if the favorites are at their incisive best",1
" We know that we are taking on a very difficult opponent, but they should think the same way about us, the Mexico coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, told reportersPulisic, though, has uncommon self-assurance as well as remarkable talent Theyre a good team and theyre not easy to beat at home so its going to take a lot, but I think the guys we have, the confidence we have, I think theres no reason why we cant do that, he said",3
Eoin Morgan had tipped the raucous Eric Hollies stand here to be one of Englands chief assets before their encounter with Australia,1
" As the captain signalled the charge that would eventually dump their rivals out of the Champions Trophy, the army of assorted bananas, gorillas, Mexicans and Nintendo characters duly respondedA burst of rain had forced a break in proceedings at 3pm",2
" With Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Joe Root all departed after a breathtaking surge from the Australia attack, Englands 35 for three from six overs had left the mood only slightly less dank than the weather; a chance to send Steve Smiths men back to the joys of their contract dispute at home was in jeopardy",1
"But upon returning to the middle, Morgan lit the fuse from which the Hollies  and Edgbaston as a whole  would explode",1
" He cracked Mitchell Starcs first two deliveries through the covers in fearless fashion and, with it, ramming home the point that his England side are no longer the types to be cowed when faced by a canary-yellow onslaught in one-day international cricketBen Stokess violent, unbeaten 102 will doubtless hog much of the limelight, but Morgans 87 in their breakneck stand of 159 was pivotal to this win",2
" He was named in the week by Paul Farbrace, the assistant coach, as the standout central figure in Englands one-day revival and, as he flayed Australias bowlers, it felt simply the latest slab of evidenceMorgan came into the side eight years go as an outlier: a 360-degree cavalier in a team made up largely of roundheads After a spell when he reined it back a touch  and even found his place questioned after a dip in form and the thorny Bangladesh tour saga  he is back at the peak of his powers as a batsman, while his mandate as leader has swelled",3
"With he and Stokes nailing down the coffin of Australias soggy campaign in a flurry of boundaries, before the captains eventual run out, it was Aaron Finch who had the unfortunate stationing in front of the Hollies",1
" The opener enjoys playing England, against whom he has made four of his eight international hundreds, but the repeated chants of Finchys going home may have taken the edge off a touchWith Finch and Australia dispatched, agonising over Roys spot will doubtless fill some of the time between now and Wednesdays semi-final in Cardiff Having averaged 6",3
73 in eight one-day innings this summer it is fair to say England have entered the territory where they lose little but face in making the switch to Jonny Bairstows previously glowing bat,1
"Bairstow has history of thriving when parachuted in, and even Roys electric outfielding  demonstrated by the pop-up-and-reclaim boundary catch that removed Glenn Maxwell in front of Edgbastons most famous stand would be more than compensated by the Yorkshiremans equal prowess The one unknown is how he goes against the new white ball at the top level",2
"While Roys trough has been an unshiftable headache of late, Morgan will be heartened by his bowlers They turned Australias launchpad of 181 for three, at the now double-the-score mark of 32 overs, into 276 for nine from 50, and largely backing up their performance against New Zealand on a pitch offering lessSmith had described Englands bowling strategy as predictable before the match, claiming it to be half the battle won already The other, and more important, 50% is dealing with the ball once it leaves the bowlers hand Though his gaggle of fast-mediums shipped runs, Mark Wood and Adil Rashid shone brightly",5
Woods career-best four for 33 from 10 overs  an England record in the Champions Trophy  was reward for a bowler who once doubted he would return after three ankle operations,1
" That the troublesome joint is seemingly holding up and his pace remains are encouraging signs for the knockout stage to come and the small matter of the Ashes tourA maiden five-wicket haul is the next box to tick off on the Durham quicks CV, but with the pelts of Hashim Amla, Kane Williamson, David Warner and Smith hanging on his wall already this summer, the curious folk that have stared solely at the statistics and not recognised the potential of Woods attributes are evaporating fastRashids four for 41 was startling in its discipline",3
" No boundaries were shipped from his 10 overs and 28 dots wracked up as Australias batsmen floundered against his googly Hollies, the Warwickshire great who inflicted Don Bradmans final-innings duck with the wrong un, would doubtless have nodded in approvalThe England support drew unfavourable comparisons between their oldest rival in international football and San Marino, suggesting, impolitely, that Scotland were inferior to Europes whipping boys",3
" Below the belt, but given their teams problems against a committed but limited side it was not an occasion when England were in a position to revel in supremacy despite extending their unbeaten qualifying record to 35 games courtesy of Harry Kanes injurytime equaliser",1
" The visitors were passive in the face of a ferocious Scotland start and, despite improving to take a degree of control, another illustration of Joe Harts weakness on his left-hand side, when failing to get close to Leigh Griffiths first free-kick, and a subdued display in the final third showed the strides England still need to make It needed the introduction of Alex OxladeChamberlain and Raheem Sterling to finally stretch a shattered home sideBarring a remarkable upturn in fortune in the final four matches, this painful draw may well have curtailed Scotlands World Cup qualifying prospects and Gordon Strachans hopes of leading his country to its first major tournament since 1998",3
" Scotlands staying home, as the England fans cruelly, bluntly but accurately put it",1
" As the reaction to the final whistle testified, with Scots on their knees on the pitch and in the stands, it should have been so much better, a turning point in a campaign that has flickered only sporadically Griffithss outstanding free-kick double put Scotland in sight of their first Hampden win over England since 1985, when Strachan was playing, but regardless of their inability to hold out, and lack of attacking options, their performance and commitment should silence the debate over the managers future for some time yetSouthgate raised a few eyebrows by giving Jake Livermore his second start in an England shirt Although he and Eric Dier struggled with the intensity and aggression of their Scotland counterparts the West Bromwich Albion player left his manager with no cause for regret His range of passing impressed, he posed one of the few threats to Craig Gordons goal and he was the one barking instructions and leading the team when Scottish pressure was at its height",5
" His selection, however, underlined the limited options that were available to Southgate in seeking to protect his defence, with Livermore and Dier the only natural choices for central midfield in the match-day squadGiven the scrutiny on the behaviour of England supporters before the game, and the criticism that flows when it does cross the line, it is only fair to report when they do get it right Southgate had reminded the travelling support of their responsibilities as ambassadors for the country",3
 The message was heeded,1
" A minutes silence for the victims of the Manchester and London attacks was impeccably observed by all and there was no repeat of the cringe-worthy songs aired at recent internationals The Scotland taunt of Jimmy Saville, hes one of your own was greeted by the bewilderment it deserved The two sets of supporters even applauded each other after the final whistle",3
"Strachan sprung a surprise by recalling Christophe Berra to Scotlands back-line for the first time since the 3-0 loss to England in November but also by reverting to a three-man central defence with Kieran Tierney on the left The formation restricted the Celtic full-backs ability to support the Scotland attack but enabled Tierney to demonstrate the awareness, intelligence and timing that attracted so many admirers during his season with Brendan Rodgers invincible side Tierney, left, who only turned 20 on Monday, was instrumental in containing Marcus Rashford and denying space to Englands front line but was unfortunate to collide with Stuart Armstrong when Oxlade-Chamberlain broke the deadlock A genuine talentAs the past few weeks on the election trail have shown, a campaign rarely runs in a straight line",5
" What seems certain one day can look unlikely the next and a few days after being tipped to go through the rest of the tour without securing a victory the Lions not only defeated the previously unbeaten Crusaders but gave New Zealand some reasons to be fearfulOne disappointment for the Lions, which will kick in after the euphoria and relief of a win they needed with the majority of the side likely to start the first Test, was that they did not adorn it with tries They created chances but a mixture of poor decision-making, a lack of understanding and slack passing under pressure cost them from the opening minute",3
"What mattered, though, was the result and the manner of the victory The strong set pieces complemented by resourcefulness at the breakdown, an accurate kicking game and a suffocating defence that maintained its chokehold despite a backline reshuffle in the first half will keep New Zealands analysts up for a few nightsThe Crusaders failed to score a try for the first time since April 2015",3
 The conditions were no aid to passing movements but they had not been in Auckland three nights before when the Blues stretched the Lions defence until it snapped,1
" The home side showed the expected intent in possession but the Lions closed down space so quickly that the Super Rugby favourites became jammed up in a congested midfieldEven when the Lions kicked long and the receiver had time to launch a counterattack the tourists were quick to deter the long pass, leaving a run or a kick as the only options Even from set pieces, which were at times under so much pressure that a kick offered relief, the Crusaders struggled to move the ball beyond the second receiver and were cramped for space",3
"They created two half-chances, George Bridge shoved into touch in the first half after a cross kick and then failing to gather Jack Goodhues improvised kick from a scrum, but otherwise the Crusaders were mute as an attacking force",1
" They struggled to please the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, at the scrum, penalised for not staying square and engaging too early, but they were more perturbed at what they felt was his connivance at the Lions encroaching beyond the feet of the hindmost player as they rushed up in defence",1
"With French officials in charge of the final two Tests, the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, is sure to use media conferences to put pressure on Jrme Garcs and Romain Poite, officials who were not swayed by home pressure during the 2015 World Cup when they took charge of Englands group matches against Wales and AustraliaRaynal was in charge when New Zealand lost to Ireland in Chicago in November and, while the Top 14 may have become the most mind-numbing of the major leagues in Europe, French officials are arguably the worlds best, refereeing what they see with consistency",2
" Unlike most, they tend not to provide a running commentary, making it harder for players to test their tolerance thresholdsThe Lions conceded seven penalties, a marked improvement on Wednesday, when Liam Williams was sent to the sin-bin for taking out a player in the air for the second time This time the Lions waited for the catcher to hit the ground before moving in",3
" The kicks from Conor Murray were precise and Israel Dagg even proved suspect under the high ballMurray, like his half-back partner Owen Farrell, made a significant impact",2
" Farrell moved into the midfield, operating at centre when Jonathan Davies failed a head injury assessment, with Jonathan Sexton coming on at fly-half It gave the Lions the opportunity to see the pair in tandem and they benefited from another happy accident when Anthony Watson replaced the injured Stuart Hogg at full-back and he unnerved the Crusaders with his pace and elusiveness",2
"Watson is an option at full-back for the first Test but the priority in midfield has to be to play Farrell where he is at his most commanding That is at fly-half, which would mean Ben Teo and Jonathan Davies linking up again in midfield Davies, like Leigh Halfpenny and Dan Biggar on Wednesday, showed that the Lions are not playing Warrenball, keeping the ball alive at every opportunity",3
 It may not be the tiki-taka rugby New Zealand have come to cherish but it looks sure enough to prevent a landslideMatt Wallace has learned to trust those with a hunch,2
" The finest endorsement for those who believed in the 27-year-old will arrive on Thursday morning when he makes his major championship debut, at the US Open A year ago, Wallace was enjoying the most fruitful spell of an unremarkable career, winning three times on the Alps Tour, where first prizes occasionally approach 10,000 There was also a meeting with Chubby Chandler, the influential agent, when Wallace attended the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth as a spectatorThis is freaky, Wallace says It was the first time Id ever met him",5
" He said: You know what, Matt? You are going to be playing here next year I said: Shut up Im on the Alps Tour, I have to play Challenge Tour, win things there  how am I even going to get close?Wallace did tee up in the European Tours marquee English event having benefited from two things: his own ability and another demonstration of confidence, this time from Keith Pelley It was the Tours chief executive who invited Wallace to last months Portugal Open where he opened with a 63, won the tournament and thereby earned full playing statusI spoke to Keith at Wentworth, says Wallace",5
" I wrote him a letter of thanks, he got that and came to see me",1
" He said: I really appreciate the letter I was like: Well, I really appreciate you changing my life He said: You are exactly the reason why we give invites",3
" You showed you could take your chance when we gave you that inviteWallaces earlier periods on the road provide insight into a division far removed from the US Open, for which he earned a place from a play-off at international qualifying",2
 The field at Erin Hills will compete for a prize fund of $12m (94m),2
" For Wallace, there was the distribution of a business plan to potential sponsors so that he could collect even some of the minimum 17,000 per year needed to play on the Alps TourI always felt like if I was able to go to events, I could win and make a living, he says",2
" Thats how I spoke to people; some took an interest, others didnt I only had a couple of people helping me and you would have a certain amount of money to last five or six events After that, I had to pay my own way so that was tough",3
"Even in the year where I won six times, it was great but not significant or life-changing money and I was having to pay a lot of stuff off with what I won",1
" I was getting sponsorship, maybe 5,000, so from there on I was paying with whatever I earnedWallace is clearly confident but self-deprecating about his route to the top My parents are PE teachers, my whole family is very sporty",3
" I was very good at pretty much all sports I played really high-level cricket, football and rugby I didnt play golf seriously until I was 18",3
"From 18 my head was on the wrong way, I worked for Hollister and was out partying all the time I changed that when I was 20 when I had this thought of: What am I going to do when Im 30? I have nothingI wanted to go to America and get my degree I did that on a scholarship to Jacksonville State and went there for a year I was at the wrong university; I was the No1 there, won events, helped their ranking then got called into the England first team",5
 I thought it was all going in the right direction but I still wasnt any good,1
" I was just playing with what I was given, talent, and that was itI always managed to score and get it round That helps me now I wasnt that good but I could and can play from positions others arent used to because Ive been in those situations Ive changed my technique, because I had to, and Im a proper golfer now",5
" Im quite confident standing next to anyone on the range and hitting shotsWallaces development is fascinating on two counts That he is a prolific winner  the eventual tally on the Alps Tour last year was six  sets him apart from others, regardless of where those successes took place",3
" At 27, and having turned professional in 2012, he is also relatively late to the high-level party Wallace regularly doubted experiences like this best six months of my life would ever transpire I have worked really hard for years but over the first couple, I didnt see much happening with my game, he says",3
"I didnt see any purchase or any outcome which suggested I was going to be a professional golfer I spoke to a few of my friends about giving it up at the end of 2013 I was busy writing a new CV In hindsight, working hard wasnt the right thing; I had to work a lot smarterAt the end of 2015 I changed coach after being in position a few times on the Alps Tour but not winning",5
 It wasnt mental; I felt great every time I was in position It wasnt nerves,2
" Under pressure, my technique wasnt holding up I worked on my technique, made that a lot better and now have a great team around meThat coaching switch led to the widely respected Matt Belsham overseeing stunning improvement",3
" Among Belshams other pupils is the world No8 Alex Noren This is a guy who I idolise, says Wallace of the Swede",2
 His work ethic and his technique are brilliant He isnt completely happy with the way he swings it so there is a grey area where he is winning but he is always working to get better,2
" Thats where I am because I never had great technique and its technique that gets the ball to go where you want it toChandler delivered a told you so message as Wallace lifted the trophy in Portugal Ive taken so much confidence from someone of his stature telling me I was going to do all right, says the man from west London He will cherish Erin Hills more than mostBarely a month ago, the final whistle was set to blow on David Beckhams long-held dream of launching his own professional football club in Miami, the glitziest of American cities",5
"What was to have been a lucrative retirement project for the former England captain appeared thwarted by a series of broken stadium deals, the snails pace of Miamis complicated political machinery and resistance from locals keen to block progress of Beckhams investment groupEven the bosses of Major League Soccer were losing patience with the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star",2
" Don Garber, the leagues commissioner, pointedly remarked in April that at least 12 other cities were chasing a prized franchise and their own ticket to the top table of American soccerBeckham, however, was always the master of the game-changing moment",2
" Just like a trademark curling free-kick from his playing days, a simple vote from county leaders this week secured a welcome victory, one that restores life to the stalled venture and nudges Brand Beckham closer to the bright lights of South Beach",1
"Our heart is to be one of the best franchises in Major League Soccer and a great neighbour, partner and leader here for the kids that are playing soccer in this community, said Tim Leiweke, Beckhams friend, fellow investor and chief negotiator for the $500m (391m), privately funded projectMajor League Soccer needs Miami just as much as Miami wants Major League Soccer",2
 Our hope is within the next several weeks the league will accept Miami and the Beckham ownership group,1
"The crucial development was the approval by Miami-Dade commissioners to sell a three-acre parcel of county-owned land in the Overtown neighbourhood to the Beckham team, which also includes the music and television entrepreneur Simon Fuller, Bolivian telecommunications billionaire Marcelo Claure and, as of April, financier Todd Boehly, co-owner of baseballs Los Angeles Dodgers",1
"The group bought the derelict sites other six acres privately for $19m (15m) in March 2016 and Beckham needed the final piece of the jigsaw to secure MLS approval for a 25,000-seat, open-roofed stadium A team of league inspectors visited the site this weekYet despite this breakthrough, the MLS product Beckham now looks set to offer is a far cry from the one he envisioned back in February 2014",3
" Then, on a stage beneath the tropical foliage of Miamis Perez arts museum, Beckham confirmed he was exercising the cut-price $25m franchise ownership option that came as a signing bonus when he signed a five-year deal to join LA Galaxy in 2007Miami, he declared, was the worlds most vibrant city and deserving of a soccer team to match, which he pledged would play in a downtown stadium, possibly by 2017 Who wouldnt want to play in Miami? Live in Miami? he asked, speaking passionately of fans walking along picturesque waterfront boulevards to games at a state-of-the-art stadium",3
"But little by little the dream began to fall apart, throttled by politics even as Leiweke worked feverishly behind the scenes to canvass support from the mayors and commissioners of the city and Miami-Dade county",1
"First, county politicians rejected Beckhams proposal to build at the Port of Miami, as an alliance of cruise ship operators and dockyard workers lamented that cargo loaders and crane operators were about to be replaced by peanut-sellers and ticket-takersThen city mayor Tomas Regalado, a one-time Beckham ally, went cold on county mayor Carlos Gimenezs plan to fill in a disused deep-water slipway and build the ground in a grand waterfront park",2
" Stung by the realisation that a prime waterfront site had eluded him, Beckham announced in June 2014 that he was pausing to weigh his optionsNine months passed before a venue next to the Miami Marlins new baseball stadium in Little Havana was touted, and embraced by Beckham",2
" But he walked away frustrated in November 2015, after several individual owners refused to sell despite receiving offers well in excess of the real land valueFacing an MLS deadline and veiled threat to award Sacramento the leagues 24th franchise in December, the group known as Miami Beckham United quickly latched on to the vacant Overtown siteThe move was a little too hasty for many residents of the Spring Garden historic district, a quiet, leafy neighbourhood on Overtowns western edge that some fear will be ruined by noise and traffic if the stadium comes to pass",3
"Home to one of Floridas original tourist attractions in the 1890s, Alligator Joes, where visitors gathered to watch reptile wrestling contests in deep pits, Spring Garden remains unspoiled from its 1920s heyday and is popular with young familiesThe human side, the effects of this stadium arent being addressed, said resident Meredith Vey Im not an elected official, Im not an entertainment mogul and Im not an athlete, Im just a mother trying to raise a kid in my small neighbourhood I feel weve been betrayed by the commissioners who have stars in their eyesAnother resident, Daeja ODonoghue, said Beckhams team called a community meeting at less than 24 hours notice last month and said the group hadnt done its due diligence",5
"I said, Show me the studies, the traffic studies, the feasibility studies, and they had nothing, she said We want proof of how this is going to affect us",2
ODonoghue said she was also concerned that the group planned to use the stadium for open-air concerts as well as 15 or so football games a year,1
Leiweke sought to allay residents fears: People worry were going to do 20 or 30 nights of concerts and disrupt their sleeping patterns and kids,1
" Not true, he said",1
 Were going to cap the number of concerts we do and the genre of music,1
" We are committed to being a good neighbour, we are committed to being a good partnerAmanda Hand, whose house directly faces what would be the western side of the stadium, was not persuaded They have a lot of language like we will attempt to, try to and intend to, she said",3
 Theres a lot of aspirations and not a lot of guarantees,1
" Aspirations are not legally enforceableCelebrity-starved and economically depressed, Overtown is also not quite what the limelight-loving Beckhams had in mind when they set their sights on a life in Miami",2
"In 2014, at the start of the odyssey, the Miami Heat were the defending NBA champions and it was common to find Beckham in a courtside seat, or chilling with his friend LeBron James, the Heat forward who was once a potential partner in the soccer enterpriseBeckham and wife Victoria, the former Spice Girl, were spotted in Miami more often then, eating with other celebrities at the Zuma restaurant or lounging at Soho Beach House, the exclusive club the footballer still uses as a de facto officeTimes have changed: the Heat are back among basketballs also-rans and James has gone home to Cleveland",3
 But there will be plenty to occupy Beckham in Miami as his as-yet unnamed franchise moves forward,1
"A first priority will be finding a big-name coach and well-known players who can deliver immediate success and catch up with Floridas two other new professional soccer teams, which stole a march while Beckhams project flounderedOrlando City, who joined MLS in 2015, signed Brazilian World Cup winner Kaka; Miami FC, unbeaten in eight games this year in their second season in the junior North American Soccer League, are part-owned by the former Italy captain Paolo MaldiniBeckham has said it would be disrespectful to speculate about his own potential players, especially because it could be four years before the team plays a game",3
" But Peter Wilt, who launched Chicago Fire into MLS in 1998 as the franchises founding general manager, said Beckhams status and connections would attract big names eager to be part of the leagues planned expansion to 24 teams by 2020David has an allure that gives them an advantage at the start, he said",2
" Its a dissipating advantage as he gets further away from his playing days and celebrity status, but theres still a something there Working with Tim Leiweke, no doubt hell be smart enough and strategic enough to bring in other athletes and coaches who have that allure",2
"Wilt said Beckhams other challenge would be to make supporters feel part of the clubMiami is one of, if not the most difficult, sports market in the nation because of its transient population, he said",2
" If he can get them emotionally connected to this team theyll make it sustainableWe thank you God, for you have truly been good to Jamaica You have blessed us with doctor, the honourable Usain St Leo Bolt, the embodiment of sportsmanship, who reminds us of the gumption and indomitable spirt of the Jamaican people",3
" May the vibe in the stadium bring a world of justice and love, and make your kingdom on Earth as it is in heaven",1
" AmenMajor sporting events are not supposed to start with prayers from an ordained minister, impeccably observed and with righteous amens in all the right places",2
" Yet, inevitably, it proved the perfect prelude to Usain Bolts 84th and last race in JamaicaThis was an occasion akin to a religious experience, a five-hour outpouring of love and joyous exaltation from 35,000 people to the greatest athlete in their history",2
" Salute To A Legend, they called it And salute they did Whether they were in the buttockdeadening $8 wooden bleacher seats or dignitaries in the grandstand, whenever Bolt appeared the reaction was both classless and overwhelming, with roars and claps and blasts from so many vuvuzelas it sounded as if an army of mosquitoes were invading Kingston",3
Afterwards the 30-year-old admitted he had rarely been as nervous before a race It was here at the National Stadium in 2002 that he first made his name  winning the world junior 200m title as a 15-year-old by beating athletes three years his senior,2
" And now, suddenly, it was hitting home that the circle of his athletics life was rapidly bolting shutEven so he had the presence of mind to treat the crowd to his greatest hits",2
" As the athletes lined up for the 100m, he shadow-boxed like a prizefighter as the master of ceremonies stirred the crowd into greater frenzies by rattling through his achievements with a preachers force and certainty",1
" Then, when the gun went off, he even made his customary terrible start, leaving his blocks with all the grace of someone with backache climbing out of his favourite easy chair",1
" Yet at 50 metres he was ahead and away  and, as always, simply uncatchableHis time of 1003sec was nothing special, at least not for him Then again, having missed more than two weeks training after the death of his close friend Germaine Mason in a motorbike accident  Bolt was one of the first on the scene  it was never going to beAfterwards he was brutally honest about his performance",5
" I think that was possibly one of my worst races, he said",1
" My execution was poor, my start was poor as always",1
 I think in the last bit I lost it a little,1
 But I didnt expect anything spectacular because I have had a lot of time off The two weeks I missed was rough,2
" But the people of Jamaica really came out for me, thank you for showing me your support",1
As Bolt crossed the line he was mobbed by cheerleaders and photographers as a bouquet of fireworks lit up the Kingston skyline His lap of honour was long and delirious and he climbed into the stands to celebrate with friends and family before going back on the track to party with the Jamaican dancehall legend Beanie ManOf course he was never going to lose  not here in Kingston and especially not when the dice had been loaded in his favour,3
" Any athlete who could conceivably have beaten him was put into a tougher 100m earlier in the evening, which was won by his compatriot Yohan Blake, the London 2012 silver medallist, in 9",1
"97secAfterwards, when Blake was asked whether he might fill his friends boots one day, he shook his head He leaves a size 13 shoe to fit and its hard to fit, he admitted",3
" I try to squeeze my foot in itNot everyone was as sentimental The young South African Akani Simbine, who finished second to Blake, was asked whether he wanted to ruin Bolts retirement at the world championships in London in August",3
" Thats the plan, he said, smilingBeforehand Bolt indulged the crowd with two pre-race laps of honour, one in an open-topped car around the velodrome surrounding the track, the other on foot Then came a big bear hug from Sebastian Coe, the International Association of Athletics Federations president, who shovelled praise on the 100m and 200m world record holder and eight-times Olympic gold medallistOur words, at best, can only be a small, modest contribution to the eulogies and tributes that this great man standing behind me has received, Coe told him But if our words are modest, our thanks are mountainous",5
"Peter Phillips, the leader of Jamaicas opposition, the Peoples National Party, was even more effusive You are now the greatest Jamaican of all time, he told him",2
" You have set new limits for human capacity and speed and your records of performance will endure through all historyNot to be outdone, Jamaicas prime minister, Andrew Holness, came dressed in a Puma tracksuit and, putting his hand on Bolts shoulder, called him a great man, a great athlete and a great Jamaican",2
"Bolt, wisely, intends to stay as far away from politics as possible in retirement He has already been offered a place in government and the culture and sports minister has urged him to start making Baby Bolts for the good of the nation Such is his ability to unite all Jamaicans, any party he declared for would surely win a landslide",3
"Seven Olympic champions had come to Kingston to pay tribute to Bolt and there were victories for most of them, including Britains Mo Farah in the 3,000m But it was the South African Wayde Van Niekerk who produced the performance of the night in winning the 200m in 19",2
84sec,1
" That was not only a personal best and the fastest time of the year but a reminder, perhaps, of why Bolt has decided to run only the 100m and 4x100m relay at the world championships",1
"That, though, is a discussion for another day This night, like so many others on the track during the past decade, belonged to Bolt",2
"An injury to fly-half Joey Carbery, who had two kicks charged down for tries, interrupted a win for Ireland in a Test that showed the gap that still exists between the haves and have-nots of rugbyIn truth, the USA have more than they once did: John Mitchells Eagles were well drilled and well lead by two overseas pros: Sale fly-half AJ MacGinty and New Zealander Tony Lamborn on the openside flank Still, a lack of time together and semi-pros in key positions fed into familiar problems: a scrum that struggled, a defensive line that ran ragged a little too soon",3
" Joe Schmidts Ireland, with two Lions starting and another on the bench, made holes and ran through them all gameJoey just sprained his ankle a bit, said Schmidt",2
 We thought it pertinent to get him off,1
 We dont know what the story is yet It hasnt swelled too much but it was a bit tender Well see how it settles and get a scan either here or once we arrive in Tokyo,3
"Mitchell, a former All Blacks head coach, will leave the Eagles at the end of their summer series, which continues against Georgia next week and in a two-legged World Cup qualifier with CanadaWe were outclassed today, he said Were disappointed, defensively we had some issues with our setting which cost us Mitchell also said he didnt expect his first-choice scrum to lose inches, which contributed to Ireland finding the front 50 very easyIn any event, Ireland had much more strength, even though they were without 11 British and Irish Lions, currently touring New Zealand",5
" For one thing they had Keith Earls, the Munster wing who toured South Africa with the 2009 Lions Whatever the New Jersey equivalent of the screaming ab-dabs might be, the Americans got them when Earls was carrying the ball His team-mates noticed and he carried it often: on his wing, off it, on the end of kicks into spaceTwo minutes in his marker, Martin Iosefo, rushed up, allowing space for Tiernan OHalloran to break a tackle and put Earls clear for a 35m run to the line Then, when Carbery made a half-gap of his own, Earls was straight through it to send a long, flat-ish-cum-forward pass out for the other wing, Jacob Stockdale, to score",5
" Carbery converted for 12-0 on 15 minutes Three minutes late a missed MacGinty clearance saw OHalloran run the ball back, a tackler slip off and Kieran Marmion put Earls in at the corner with easeEarlsy usually wants to get the ball all the time, Schmidt said, but I think after the first 20 minutes he didnt want it anymore, hed run it enough",3
"The first US try produced a roar from a crowd above 22,000 The Newcastle Falcons lock Nick Civetta scored it, charging down a clearance from Carbery MacGinty converted for 17-7",3
" In prompt response, Carbery kicked a penalty to the corner and the Irish pack mauled the hooker Niall Scannell over from a throw to big Devin Toner So go the pros",2
Lamborn then made a half-break but couldnt complete the pass,1
" From the scrum, which Ireland pressured to keep the tired No8 David Tameilau bound and busy, came the try of the game Marmion scooted blind and released Earls once again, and though 70 metres later the full-back Ben Cima got him, and well, Earls popped a pass out of a tumble-dryer of arms and legs for Marmion to score Carbery increased the lead to 29-7",3
 So it stayed to the half,1
"The first try of the second period took only three minutes, No8 Jack Conan touching down from a five-metre scrum drive Carbery converted",2
" And then there was a second charge-down of the Irish No10, this time by the Cork-born flanker John Quill",1
" Carbery, Schmidt said with a grin, will learn from the experience",1
"The US then had their best spell of the game, and the roar for what mightve been a third home try shook the stands  for a few seconds or so",1
" Alas, replacement prop Paddy Ryan  Irish-born, employed in the Premiership with Newcastle  threw forward a long pass after a fine break from the wing Mike Teo Iosefos finish was in vain",2
"Ryan Matyas did get over on 54 minutes for the Eagles third, this time patient phase play opening a half-gap Perhaps stung, a little, Ireland brought on the Munster wing Simon Zebo, a Lion in Australia four years ago Although the US scrambling defense was good, another Earls break put the substitute lock James Ryan over and replacement scrum-half Luke McGrath also scored as legs tired",3
" The final try came from a high kick to Stockdales wing, where the undersized Teo was predictably outjumped",1
" Zebo collected the loose ball to scoreOn a hot, sapping evening, both teams earned their applause After five minutes of the game, though, the same fans offered a standing ovation in honor of Robert Paylor, a lock from the University of California, Berkeley who suffered a catastrophic injury in the Varsity Cup final against Arkansas State last month",3

"Sharapova, who is coming back from a 15-month suspension for taking the banned drug meldonium, had been due to enter qualifying after rejecting a wild card",1
" But she posted in a Facebook message: After an additional scan, the muscle tear that I sustained in Rome will unfortunately not allow me to compete in the grass court tournaments I was scheduled to playSharapova will also withdraw from the Aegon Classic in Birmingham, for which she had been granted a wild card",2

Manchester United have reached an agreement to sign the Swedish international Victor Lindelof from Benfica for 307m (35m),2
" With Champions League football secured after the Europa League was added to their EFL Cup and Community Shield triumphs, attention quickly turned to reinforcementsThe centre-back is now set to become Jos Mourinhos first signing of the summer after United struck a deal with the Portuguese champions",2
"A statement on the Premier League clubs official website read: Manchester United is pleased to announce that it has reached agreement with Benfica for the transfer of Victor Lindelof, subject to a medical examination, international clearance and personal termsA further announcement will be made once the transfer is complete",2
"In the end, Harry Kane did almost everything Gareth Southgate had hoped he might",1
" This game had gone, the visitors apparently broken by Leigh Griffiths pair of free-kicks, when Raheem Sterling cut inside and flung over one last desperate cross from the left and there, opening up his body in mid-air to meet the delivery as sweetly as he could, was Englands captain to guide home a first international goal in 13 months The manager leapt into the air, his manic celebrations born as much of relief as delight He had been at pains to point out that talent, eventually, will out",3
" There was evidence of Kanes pedigree in his timingPlucking that point from the dregs of a furious contest left the English buoyed, for all that the shortcomings of the teams display in Glasgow will surely trouble Southgate over his summer",2
" For Kane, the plunder was more personal This had in effect been his audition, the fifth captain of Southgates tenure to date making his influence felt just as embarrassment  and a first loss to bitter rivals in more than 17 years  had beckoned It has ended as a special day, he said",3
" To be 2-1 down in stoppage time from nowhere, getting that goal is special",1
" We found another gear, and it feels like a good pointThe dramatic nature of the equaliser had effectively cleansed the visitors performance, all the exasperation the 23-year-old forward had endured up to then on his first appearance for Southgate going exorcised at the last That finish was Kane inspiring his team-mates as captains should, when the scenario was at its grimmest The manager would prefer not to contemplate who will take the armband on a permanent basis just yet, concentrating as he is on strengthening the collective, but he may just have found his man Last gasp contributions tend to have such far-reaching effects",5
"Kane, a forward with 75 Premier League goals to his name over the past three terms and seven in his final two outings of the season, would have expected to prosper here",1
" After all, the Tottenham Hotspur striker found himself confronted by Christophe Berra, a player whose contract at Ipswich  mid-table in the Championship  expires at the end of the month before a summer return to Hearts Evade Berra and there was Charlie Mulgrew, recently relegated to League One with Blackburn",2
" Kane has prospered against better players all year, and would ease between the latter and the impressive Kieran Tierney to volley home his reward",1
" Yet it said much about Scottish resilience that this contest had actually drifted beyond the mid-way period in the second half before he had glimpsed a proper sight at goalRyan Bertrand mustered a centre to exploit momentary hesitation, the Scots apparently distracted by a substitution on their right, only for Craig Gordon to react and turn away Kanes flashed header",2
" That was as close as he came until stoppage time, when it had appeared even the Royal Marines, Englands saviours last weekend on the infamous sheep dip on Woodbury Common, could not spare them the ignominy of defeat",1
 Southgate will delight in a point but will recognise plenty of failings from this showing,1
" For long periods this had been a painful reminder of the truism every recent permanent England manager, bar Sam Allardyce, has learned to endure",1
" The England team which reconvenes in the summer, most obviously at tournaments, tends to lack the effervescence they usually display in the autumn internationals, the long slog of a Premier League campaign having dulled their sparkleThere was a sloppiness in their possession, the cross-field passes as likely to soar over full-backs heads as find an ally The attacking play was prone to overelaboration, the slicker moves invariably running aground on massed ranks of rugged Scottish defence, with Marcus Rashfords instincts forever to drift into central areas when England needed to stretch their opponents further wide Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who would eventually provide some hustle and bustle to prise the home side apart five minutes after his introduction, appeared a more natural fit in that roleThis was Southgates first taste, as senior manager, of a familiar issue",5
" The Tottenham contingent, whose season had extended to five competitions, had taken part in a post-season friendly in Hong Kong since domestic duties were curtailed Rashford, his senior career still in its infancy, has never known a season of such first-team toil",2
" Perhaps that explained a lack of dynamism, though it could hardly be used as an excuse The Scots, with their hefty Celtic contingent, have hardly spent the past nine months with their feet up How this arena rocked as Griffiths threatened to pilfer the points at the death",3
" The pained intake of breath which greeted Kanes equaliser was one of resignationEven so, the visitors lack of efficiency with the ball will have infuriated Southgate",2
" It also served to heighten Kanes anxiety while that goal drought at this level, stretching back to the friendly win over Turkey last May, was still playing on his mind",1
" The two chances that fell to the forward up to the interval were both awkward, the first born of Eric Diers lofted pass with Kane shinning his attempt high and wide There was more precision to Bertrands exchange with Adam Lallana moments later, the Liverpool midfielder scuttling to the byline to clip over a cross, but the captain was on his heels and could not collect cleanly Fortunately for England, his moment was still to come",3
" This is a day Ill never forget, he added before departing the arena The captain had made his point",2
"Chris Coleman has always wanted Wales to focus on the future rather than basking in last summers success, yet with Sundays World Cup qualifier against Serbia taking place exactly a year after their opening match at Euro 2016, even the manager had to concede that it was impossible not to take a trip down memory lane",1
"That glorious, sun-drenched afternoon in Bordeaux, when Wales marked their first appearance at a major tournament for 58 years with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Slovakia, evokes so many happy thoughts for Coleman, although the moment that will live with him for ever has nothing to do with anything that took place on the pitchWhen the national anthem started, thats what Ill always remember, the Wales manager said Two things stand out: the respect we showed Slovakia when their national anthem was played  it was silent from us, which was great; and then with our national anthem  the noise, wow, that was unbelievable",3
" Thats what I remember Of course I remember the goals But definitely, first tournament, first game, singing the national anthem  that was as good as it gets",3
"Coleman would love to experience more of the same next summer but that World Cup dream will be fading fast if Wales come away from Belgrade with nothing Trailing Serbia and Republic of Ireland by four points at the halfway stage of the qualification campaign, Wales can ill afford to lose more ground and they will be without the suspended Gareth Bale as well as Neil Taylor, Hal Robson-Kanu, James Collins and Andy King",2
"They remain unbeaten in Group D, yet their supporters are a little deflated on the back of four draws from five matches, especially as the lead was squandered in three games, and pessimistic about their qualification chances as a result",1
 Coleman has picked up on that shift in the mood back home and believes expectations have changed after reaching the semi-finals at Euro 2016In the last campaign we drew at home to Bosnia and it was like wed won,2
" This campaign when weve drawn its been like a defeat because of whats happened between the Bosnia game and drawing in Austria What happened in between was unprecedented, nobody thought we were going to get to those dizzy heights",2
 You go to Austria and come back with a point and its a disappointing result because weve qualified and been to a semi-final of a tournamentI cant say it has surprised me because I expected it unless we won every game in this campaign or we were top,2
" Its human nature that if you get so far, you expect a bit more and want a bit more",1
 But we cant look at anybody else Its down to usEverybody looks at us differently and its been tougher  weve been striving for so long to be in this position where teams take us seriously and the expectation is higher,3
" The expectation is higher for a reason  because we producedWith Coleman maintaining that this will be his last campaign as manager the prospect of Wales not qualifying for Russia has raised questions about his position and whether he could decide to stand down sooner rather than later, maybe even after the Serbia match if things go badlyI dont like talking past the next game, its never served me right in the past, Coleman said",3
" But Ive had to mention it [now] because people think: If we dont get the right result or performance, whats my future? But theres another 12 points after that and if its second place that were chasing, but its doable, then Ive got to absolutely go for that with everything that Ive got",1
 Why wouldnt I?Im still optimistic of getting a result in Serbia,1
" We are four points behind with five games to play Are we good enough to win three or four on the bounce? I dont have to tell you the answer to that Whether its Serbia away, it doesnt matter I know we can get a result because weve gone to hard places before and done itThere is no getting away from the fact that Bales absence is a huge blow and with Robson-Kanu and Ben Woodburn, the young Liverpool forward, also missing it leaves Wales short of attacking options beyond the Burnley striker Sam Vokes",5
" Coleman, though, remains positive and believes Wales have enough to touch those right buttons again providing they are in the right frame of mindHopefully well have that mental sharpness and focus so that if were in the lead we can hang on to it and see it out, because thats whats been missing in this campaign, he said Weve not seen the job through for 90 minutes",3
" Weve got to a certain level and then just lacked a bit of concentration Thats what weve got to get backSerbia (probable) Stojkovic; Ivanovic, Obradovic, Nastasic; Rukavina, Matic, Milivojevic, Tosic; Kostic, Tadic; MitrovicWales (probable) Hennessey; Chester, Williams, Davies; Gunter, Allen, Ledley, Richards; Ramsey, Lawrence; VokesMartin ONeill has warned his Republic of Ireland players not to take a backward step as they strive to reach next years World Cup and knock one of their main rivals, Austria, out of the running",3
" The teams face off in Dublin on Sunday in a match of pivotal importance in one of Europes most competitive groupsAt the halfway stage Ireland are level on points with the leaders, Serbia, and four points ahead of both Austria and Wales Having won 1-0 in Vienna in November, they welcome the Austrians knowing that a draw would probably be more helpful to them than to the visitors But ONeill does not want such thoughts to infect the minds of his players and has urged them treat this as a make-or-break battle like their famous duel against Italy at Euro 2016, when Robbie Bradys goal earned passage to the last 16That night we knew at the very beginning that we couldnt rely on anything else so had to go and win the game  sometimes that focuses you and stops you thinking negatively, said ONeill",5
" This is a big, big game for Austria and we want to be positive",1
" I dont think we could have gotten these points we have on the board without being positive so lets not fall into our shellInjury deprives Ireland of two of their best players, Samus Coleman and Shane Long, but ONeill is grateful that Jon Walters has recovered from the knee problem that had threatened to rule him out of action too The Stoke City striker says he is completely fine after training without pain for two days this week and he is expected to start in a central role up front, possibly as captain",3
"Walters has become a folk hero in Ireland in recent years thanks to his full-blooded bravura and ONeill believes the player is particularly deserving of a place at the next World Cup, having helped propel Ireland to Euro 2016 only to miss most of his teams matches there because of injuryJon was a talisman for us in European qualification but picked up injury before the competition started and only played little bits here and there so its nice to have him on board because hes been terrific for us, said ONeill Hes a great warrior and, more than that, he has great ability and that helps us immensely",3
"While Walters seems certain to start, ONeill has several other several selection riddles to solve Most notably, a manager who has a tendency to spring surprises in his lineups must decide whether to keep faith with Darren Randolph in goal even though the 30-year-old lost his starting place at West Ham towards the end of the Premier League season and looked shaky during last weeks friendly win over Uruguay",2
" The alternative is Sheffield Wednesdays Keiren Westwood, who has not featured in a competitive international for five yearsONeill also has a difficult choice to make in central defence, where John OShea, Richard Keogh and Shane Duffy are vying for the two slots",2
" Additionally, there is the question of whether to include the experienced Glenn Whelan in central midfield despite the appeal of a dynamic duo consisting of Harry Arter and Jeff Hendrick ONeill must decide whether to deploy the creative talents of Wes Hoolahan from the start or preserve the 35-year-old for an introduction from the bench if requiredThose might seem like relatively innocuous problems to Austrias beleaguered manager, Marcel Koller, who has been shorn of seven players for a match that risks being his last in charge in the event of defeat Absences in defence may force Austria to a formation featuring a back three, while their offensive threat looks weakened by the loss of the suspended Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic and injuries to Sparta Prague striker Marko Janko and RB Leipzigs Marcel Sabitzer Worryingly for Koller, he has been forced to rely on his fourth-choice goalkeeper, Heinz Lindner, who is reputed to be vulnerable in the face of robust forwards such as Walters",5
"Republic of Ireland (probable) Randolph; Christie, OShea, Duffy, Ward; Arter, Whelan; Brady, McClean, Hendrick; WaltersAustria (probable) Lindner; Hinteregger, Prdl, Dragovic; Lazaro, Alaba, Junuzovic, Baumgartlinger, Klein; Burgstaller, HarnikParis on Tuesday is the final stop in John Stoness inaugural season as the most expensive English defender in history and a reunion with Kylian Mbapp would represent a fitting end to it",1
" The campaign has vindicated his move to Manchester City, the England international insists, but there is also regret over what the Monaco forward and others denied him under Pep Guardiola: the first silverware of a fiercely scrutinised careerVery disappointed, is Stoness blunt assessment of his first season at the Etihad Stadium Purely because we had such a great team and we set the bar high Disappointed on a personal note too as we all believe we can do better and in games I should have done better, which is what I want to improve on for the futureOn another personal note it was unbelievable for me",5
" My journey from the start of the season to the end, Ive just changed completely as a player and grown off the pitch as well, which is what I went there to doPeps message is to improve every day Thats why I went to City and why I wanted to work with Pep  hes got the best out of the players hes worked with and won a lot of trophies Ultimately, that is my goal  to become as good as I can be and win as many things as I can As a kid I played in tournaments and my team won trophies but in my professional career Ive not won anything yet",5
 Im hungry to get a medal around my neck,1
"The Champions League did not satisfy Stoness appetite as City exited in the last 16 against Monaco, for whom Mbapp scored home and away in dominant performances against Guardiolas exposed defence He was clinical, recalls the 23-year-old",2
 Hes a top player in the making and well be looking to stop him,1
 If Im on the pitch Ill definitely be looking to do that Hes still new to the international game and Ive been lucky enough to play a few games nowStoness struggles against the French teenager brought further criticism of Citys 47,3
"5m acquisition from Everton, but also staunch support from Guardiola, who claimed the central defender had more balls than everybody in the Etihad press room after the 1-1 draw against Liverpool that followed Its definitely helped to know hes got my back but its not just him, its everybody at the club, says Stones, who rejects the suggestion his English record price-tag has been a burden The money in football nowadays is frightening and I never thought I would have gone for a transfer like that but ultimately its not down to the player, he saysIt doesnt really make it harder Im very fortunate to be bought for that amount of money, almost flattered by them paying that much, and I want to do that justice",5
"An analysis of Stones or an interview with him rarely passes without reference to a playing style that separates the Barnsley academy graduate from the English norm and attracted Guardiola on his arrival at City last summer He must find the debate tiresome? I dont, no, the defender says You have to be single-minded but listen to what Pep and his staff want me to do for the team",3
Football has evolved and you see more and more teams playing that way,1
 Ive had some nice messages after games from players who I havent spoken to before,1
" I wont name people and drop them in it, but Ive had messages from opposition strikers and defenders saying that they respect and love the way I play, telling me to keep doing it and not to change the way I amTo hear that is great for me and has given me a lot of confidence Its a classy touch from them as well",3
 They dont have to go out of their way to say that,1
" Hopefully, when I get towards the end of my career Ill be able to do the same for up-and-coming players and people who you can see could become top players",1
 Id like to be able to have that bit of class,1
"Stones will wear No5 for City next season but the switch to a more traditional defensive number from 24 does not reflect a change in style, more a tribute to its previous owner, Pablo ZabaletaI spoke to Zaba before I took the shirt, he says",2
" I thought it was the right thing to do, not ask for his permission but his blessing almost",1
 We joked about him winning silverware wearing that number and hopefully I will do it justiceThats the ultimate thing: doing the shirt justice for me and for my teamIf anyone should know what to expect when the Lions play in Dunedin on Tuesday it is James Haskell,3
 Five years ago he was living in the beachside suburb of St Clair and playing for the Highlanders as part of a personal odyssey which also involved stints in France and Japan Choosing the road less travelled was the best decision he ever made,2
"Far from being the death of his international career, it has proved the route to ultimate fulfilment",1
" The 32-year-old flanker thought his treasured Lions dream had evaporated, only to receive a late call last month as a replacement for the injured Billy Vunipola No visiting player will be keener than Haskell when he revisits the Forsyth Barr StadiumEven now he remembers the amazing experience with genuine affection",3
" Its a time of my life I look back on really fondly, Haskell said I loved playing Super Rugby and I was really welcomed by everyone I threw myself into the culture by going diving, fishing, shooting and boxing and I loved the whole place When I left I missed itHis dozen games in a Highlander jersey also taught him much about the Kiwi rugby psyche which his Lions team-mates would do well to listen to",5
" He suspects many visiting players, for example, underestimate the all-consuming nature of the national sport Everybody in New Zealand wants to be an All Black; they just have such a desire to have the ball in hand and to play touch from a very early age, he said In the UK rugbys down the pecking order",3
"Haskell was reassured to discover, even so, that not all New Zealand rugby players are supermen; they just play a different type of rugby",1
" My experience of Super 15 dispelled a few things I was led to believe from the media, from TV and from watching highlight reels I think to a man were probably bigger than these guys but athletically theyre a different kind",2
" In New Zealand theres always another cab off the rank Just when you think youve seen the best thing, theres another one Super Rugby is a very different league but it would be interesting to see what would happen if you put some of those teams in the Premiership",3
" Kingsholm on a February rainy day in the mud, for example, with relegation and everything else involvedThe Lions, either way, have less than a fortnight to finalise the best way to derail the All Black machine and Haskell believes the solution is no secret Against New Zealand you have to be super-disciplined, very direct in what youre doing",3
 You have to play for the full 80 minutes and you have to execute everything at the top of your game,1
" What they do is not rocket science: its executing with speed, intensity and accuracy They consistently do it for 80 minutes Turn your back and theyve got the skill set to punish you Everyone knows what to do but its another thing getting out on the field and delivering it Its not about containment",5
"Dominating physically is clearly another prerequisite  You have to impose yourself on these teams; Im not saying its the go-to but its certainly part of what were trying to do  and Haskell, despite having four staples inserted in his head after being caught by a team-mates elbow during the warm-up to his Lions debut against the Blues on Wednesday, is not about to settle for an indefinite midweek role The moment I got here I wanted to compete for a Test spot like everybody else",2
" Im just not built to sit here and have coffees, I want to push myself as hard as I canIf, furthermore, there are young players at home wondering if a spell playing abroad might be worthwhile, Haskell advises them to pack their bags immediately Im a firm believer that you only learn from playing and really testing yourself",3
" If youre sitting around not doing anything, get a plane ticket and come and play wherever you can As his career has conclusively demonstrated, those who venture the furthest from their comfort zone often gain the mostFull to bursting with kids this England side may have been but they snatched the most remarkable of wins against Argentina with a try at the death by Denny Solomona",3
" One of 10 debutants, Solomona combined brilliantly with two others to steal a game that had twisted this way then that and seemed certain, at last, to have been settled in Argentinas favourIt was a suitably stylish way to round off one of the most outrageously entertaining second halves of recent times",2
" A win against a team as accomplished and familiar with each other as the Pumas represents quite thestatement from Englands youngsters, who were marshalled superbly by George Ford",1
" The fly-half can be inconsistent but when hes as good as this he should be pulling on the red of the LionsI thought it was an incredible game of rugby, said Eddie Jones",2
 In the end I think we had 10 new caps on there and to show poise and stick to what we needed to do in the circumstances was an unbelievable effort from the young guys,1
The match was never less than entertaining but it took a while to reach real excellence,1
" It came as no particular surprise that Argentina were the quickest to settle, their props squeezing Englands youngsters to win a penalty at the first scrum, which Nicols Snchez just missed from an angled 50 yards The hosts also pinched the first England lineout, from which possession they scored the first try, in only the eighth minute: on the blindside, Snchezs wicked chip sat up nicely for Emiliano Boffelli to touch down on his debut",2
"Such a madcap match was made for back-row forwards, and Englands flankers, Mark Wilson and the 18-year-old Tom Curry, had excellent debuts, the former in particular disrupting Argentina possession",1
" But it was Ford who proved the master The timing of his passes kept the Pumas guessing and, best of all, he was as confident as a king off the tee, helping himself to a tally of 23 points, including a try of his own, whose conversion was the only kick he missed",2
"His first two penalties drew England back to within a point, before they took the lead on the half-hour",1
" If Ellis Genge was having a rough time in the scrum, his work in the loose was as excellent as ever He was on to a loose ball on his 22 and away Then another debutant, Alex Lozowski, further stretched the Pumas with a superb run before Fords fine cut-out let Marland Yarde loose against the tight-head prop",3
 No contest,1
"Argentina finished the half stronger, scoring 10 points in the four minutes before the break Another loose England pass was punished when Jernimo de la Fuente sparked a passage of brilliant interplay down the left, setting up Toms Lavanini for a monstrous drive at the line and Argentinas second try Snchezs penalty on the stroke of half-time earned the Pumas a 17-13 leadIn the second half, though, both teams sharpened their act to spectacular effect England responded with 10 points in the first seven minutes to take the lead again",5
" Fords 42nd-minute penalty was followed by a turn of excellence from Henry Slade, who dummied clean through Argentinas midfield and sent a chip to the corner, where Jonny May touched down Ford converted from the touchline once moreAnd so Argentina took a turn for the brilliant",3
" Solomona came on for his much-anticipated debut and immediately found himself in the middle of a whirlwind Martn Landajo broke past Curry and inside Solomona from a scrum to set up De la Fuente for Argentinas third, before they struck for their fourth with the best of the lotMatas Orlando broke through Solomonas tackle deep in his own half and took the ball deep into Englands Solomona managed to get back, only to be turned inside out by Boffelli, who then sent Joaqun Tuculet to the lineThe match turned again in the final quarter",5
" A remarkable 55-metre penalty on the angle by Ford drew England back to within five, before Englands maestro closed the deficit entirely with a try of his own He combined superbly with Piers Francis  another making his first England outing, back from a spell in Super Rugby  to streak clear of the cover for Englands third",2
" Remarkably, he missed the conversion:the game was tied If ever one deserved to be so exquisitely poised for the final 15minutes, it was thisFirst, it seemed England might close the game out as they pressed on Argentinas 22",3
" But of all people Dylan Hartley, the skipper on 85 caps, became the latest to spill the ball in a ferocious tackle, and Argentina broke out through Orlando and Ramiro Moyano, setting up Juan Martn Hernndez for the coolest of drop goals Argentinas game, surely No Up stepped Solomona, and not for anything so mundane as defensive work",3
" This time he showed what he could do with ball in hand Jack Maunder, yet another debutant, combined with Francis down the right to set Solomona stepping, smashing and streaking away through the Pumas defence to steal an extraordinary match at the deathWe came here to win 2-0 and thats what we are going to do, said Jones, teeing up next weeks match in Santa Fe England may still be an inexperienced team then, but after this remarkable win they will feel a whole lot less soIt probably should not be a shock that new chapters in the extensive back catalogue of glorious Scottish sporting failures are still being written in 2017",5
" How familiar this was; how painfully familiarCold analysis should surround Scotlands concession of two horrendous goals, the kind that undermine international campaigns and cost managers their job",2
" The goals scored by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Harry Kane were horribly reminiscent of the type Scotland have continually shipped in recent times Another blunt truth is that a point against England probably is not going to be much use in this World Cup quest, the Scots having been trounced in Slovakia and failed to beat Lithuania at home They need so much more, plus favours, between now and the campaigns conclusionNonetheless, offering such comment feels harsh In two glorious moments, Hampden rejoiced in a manner once customary but not witnessed since the win over France in 2006",5
" Before old failings returned, Scotland dared to dream of a first victory over England here since 1985That was the one, at 60 years old, that could have been the best result of my footballing career, said Gordon Strachan",2
 You cant question the personality or character of those players That was beyond the call of duty at times,2
 They pushed themselves to another level He said the draw had felt like a defeatStrachan had followed his instinct that a three-man defence was the most viable means to halt a powerful England front four,3
" That backline  of Christophe Berra, Charlie Mulgrew and Kieran Tierney  contained only left-footed players The Scotland starting XI featured sevenGood news for the future surrounds the fact that Tierney, a full-back at Celtic, is one of the finest Scottish prospects to emerge in years  if prospect is still applicable, that is He endorsed his rising status with an excellent displayIf it was understandable for Strachan not to express hope that his team could make a mockery 5-1 odds on the grounds of what talent was at his disposal, harping back to the 3-0 loss at Wembley in November made little sense",5
" The performance that night gave us a lot to be optimistic about, said Strachan in his programme notes We were the better team for large periods of the matchIf the media indulged in this kind of gross exaggeration as routine, managerslike Strachan would have plenty to say about it The reality in London was that Scotland were not efficient either in defence or attack, leading to a match that was over with half an hour to play England barely emerged from firstgearduring their canter tovictory",5
"A further glance back to Strachans pre-match comments was necessary within three minutes That get intae them theory of playing football is gone, insisted the manager",2
" They are well in control of their emotionsStrachans captain, Scott Brown, was not on message A reckless tackle on Dele Alli with only 150 seconds played earned the midfielder a booking This was an archetypal case of playing to the gallery by an individual who has never been famed for fine tackling Brown was later woefully lame as Oxlade-Chamberlain breezed past him en route to opening the scoring",5
"And yet, Browns rush of blood aside, so much of Scotlands opening was impressive They pressed and harried their visitors to the point where England were rattled for the first 15 minutes The only problem was that Scottish energy was not reflected in chances created An attempt by Lee Griffiths from 18 yards, which did not trouble Joe Hart, was the sum of Scotlands early playScotlands problems soon resonated",5
" Robert Snodgrass was toiling badly, with Stuart Armstrong failing to impose himself on proceedings and James Morrison virtually invisible Griffiths was a chronically isolated figure in attack for the remainder of the first half, during which Kane should have afforded England an unassailable advantagePerhaps having sensed Englands fragility, Scotland roused the home crowd by starting the second period with considerably more composure and confidence than they had ended the first",3
 Griffiths later emphasised that with two free-kicks worthy of the highest praise; he was already running away in celebration before both hit the net,1
"Strachans emotion was soon differentHe slammed a water bottle to the ground in disgust as Kane finishedatthe back post A football nation, for once, knew precisely how he felt",3
" Im too tired to think about the future, Strachan said I just want to gethome",2
"Ben Stokes left Edgbaston with praise from both captains ringing in his ears following the destructive unbeaten 102 that sees England head into their Champions Trophy semi-final on Wednesday glowing with confidence and Australia on the next plane homeStokes, in registering his third one-day hundred, continued a rich run of form that has carried through from his time in the Indian Premier LeagueThe Rising Pune Supergiants made him the tournaments most expensive overseas player with a 17m deal but for his national team captain, the all-rounder is pricelessHis potential is through the roof, said Eoin Morgan, whose 87 helped pile on 159 with Stokes for the fourth wicket",5
" His batting was exceptional He was very calm with the crease, very relaxed and all those games hes played really came to the fore",2
He was outstanding I think the IPL auction proved [his value],2
" Hes always looking to influence the game, with bat, ball or in the fieldAustralias Steve Smith, who captained Stokes in IPL, said: I dont like to put tags on guys but hes a fantastic player and getting better He played a fantastic innings, took the game on and was hard to stop",3
 Hes an incredibly strong lad and hits the ball very hard  those are the kind of things you want in white ball cricket,1
"I think hes probably developed some smarts and the timing of his innings Im sure the more he plays, the better hell get Hes in exceptional form at the moment",3
"On his teams exit following two washouts against New Zealand and Bangladesh before this rain-affected loss, Smith said: I thought we let ourselves down a little bit today When youre playing in a big tournament for your country, you need to step up and get the job done We werent able to do that on this occasion",3
"Morgan credited his bowlers for keeping Australia to 277 for nine, Mark Wood and Adil Rashid picking up four wickets apiece It is something that has given the captain greater belief that he could be lifting the trophy at The Oval next SundayHe said: The last two games, weve proved that we can peg sides back regardless of where theyre at going into the last 15 overs, which probably two years ago was a bit of a car crash for us So thats a huge improvement And our batting just seems to thrive",5
"Morgan also said Jason Roys position will now be reviewed before Wednesdays semi-final in Cardiff after 51 runs from eight innings this summer Jonny Bairstow, who has opened previously for Yorkshire but not at international level, is waiting in the wings",2
Its unfortunate that Jason didnt get runs today Were obviously three games in and well take a couple of days to have a look at what our best team is for the semi-final,2
" We revisit it every game  everybodys position, he addedGareth Southgate described Harry Kanes 93rd-minute equaliser against Scotland as a huge and significant show of character from England, one he believes will propel the team on the enormous journey needed to deliver on a World Cup stage",2
"England were facing the end of a 34-game unbeaten run in international qualifiers and a first defeat at Hampden Park since 1985 when Kane, Southgates captain for the day, salvaged a draw in stoppage time The substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had given England the lead only for two stunning free-kicks in the final three minutes of normal time from Leigh Griffiths to transform the contestGordon Strachan, the under-pressure Scotland manager, said the 2-2 draw felt like a defeat and was probably the most emotional game of my managerial career",3
 Victory would have revitalised his countrys chances of reaching Russia next summer Instead the point leaves them languishing fourth in Group F with four matches to play,2
"Englands manager, by contrast, accentuated the positives from a late recovery that he claimed went some way to answering doubts over the national teams character",1
" He also spared Joe Hart criticism for Griffiths free-kicks, the first beating the England goalkeeper to his left, the second to his right, claiming credit belonged to the Celtic striker for executing two outstanding finishes under extreme pressureIt was a huge moment for the team, said Southgate of Kanes first international goal in more than a year The questions around this team centre on character, they centre on our ability to withstand events that go against you",3
" Thats what we have shown, that we are a team that is never beat The clock may run out but you never stop Today we didnt stop and a real quality finish got us the point Is it what we wanted? No, but the chain of events was remarkableAnything is possible in football",5
 You can get moments where someone produces an unbelievable moment of quality and then the crowd is on a huge high We had that conversation this week and it is important Its fundamental to being a top team but it is only one small step in that direction,3
" We can still improve in all areas but nevertheless it was a significant momentGary Neville, on pundit duties for Sky, faulted Harts positioning for the Griffiths free-kicks but the Manchester City keeper, who has spent the season on loan at Torino and appears destined to leave the Etihad Stadium this summer, was spared public condemnation by his manager",2
 Southgate said: I need to look at it again They were two brilliant finishes,2
 Firstly you dont concede free-kicks in those positions I couldnt understand the first free-kick or why [Scott] Brown escaped a second yellow card,2
 If you concede those free-kicks in international football you run the risk of being punished by a moment of qualityHe added: Joe has been excellent this week,2
 I thought he showed excellent composure with the ball at his feet and hes been one of the outstanding leaders in the group this week,1
"England remain comfortably on course to reach for the World Cup, maintaining their impressive sequence of qualification, but Southgate admitted the team must improve to finally make an impact at tournament level",1
" Its clear, our record is three knockout wins in 25 years, he added We have a young team emerging, there was a 19-year-old and a 21-year-old in the front line today who havent played in many occasions like this There is great potential, a desire on their part and a desperation to do well for the shirt but of course weve got an enormous journey to go to match teams that have won World Cups and European Championships with players who perform in the Champions League regularly",3
"Strachan was shattered at being denied the finest result of his Scotland reign, one that would have transformed his teams prospects in the group The Scotland manager said: It feels like a defeat, aye One pass, one header, it goes somewhere else and weve won thegame",3
It was like a middleweight fighting a heavyweight out there and I am so proud of the way we kept coming back,1
 That could have been my best result as a manager and Ive been lucky enough to get some good ones against Man United and AC Milan,1
The power and strength and speed of England is phenomenal To keep coming back was brilliant,2
 To have that free-kick at the end of the game when youre tired by Griffiths was brilliant They pushed themselves to another level to get a result for theircountry,2
"With lunch approaching on the second day, Surrey appeared to be squandering the extremely strong position they had built on the first",1
" Their final five wickets had fallen for 46 in the first 70 minutes to be bowled out for 399 and, with Surreys bowling as wayward as their batting had been witless, Essex had ghosted to 55 without loss We know by now that Alastair Cook gorges on short stuff and Surreys attack, particularly Mark Footitt, were spoiling himBut Sam Curran pinned Cook in front with the final ball of the session Cook left looking perplexed, perhaps surprised to receive a ball that challenged him Surrey went with a spring in their step and returned with purpose, finding three more wickets, with Footitt, swapping ends, producing a beauty to have Tom Westley caught behind",5
 Gareth Batty pinned Nick Browne in front and Dan Lawrence cut him straight to point,1
 Essex were 134 for four,1
All of which made this a fine time for Ryan ten Doeschates first century of the season,1
" This was a fine, brisk innings (his 26th first-class century) on a ground, with short boundaries, a fast outfield and good track, that is mighty hard to defend onTen Doeschate is mighty hard to defend against, too: tactically, he might be the best captain in the land, and  with this a case in point  he fights fires down the order, scoring all round the wicket, running brilliantly between the wickets (is there anyone better?) and punishing anything remotely looseThere were plenty of punchy drives, and a beautiful pulled six off Ravi Rampaul on the way to a 120-ball century",3
" The only blemish came on 39, when he was dropped down the legside by Ben Foakes off BattyHe guided Essex to 367 for seven, 32 behind, and shared 120 with Ravi Bopara, who looked in fine touch, smashing Batty down the ground for six, until being fooled by a nipbacker from Stuart Meaker and pinned lbw",2
" Simon Harmer was another doughty ally before he fell in the same fashion as James Foster, caught behind off Footitt",1
The day had begun with Surreys surprise subsidence as they were bowled out one shy of a fifth batting point that for so long had seemed a certainty,1
"They had arrived full of optimism that they were about to see Currans maiden first-class century, and a first double for Mark Stoneman Neither was to beCurrans 65 was full of verve, chutzpah and boundaries (48 came in fours) but was ended when Neil Wagner got one to stay just a touch low, and pinned him in front Stoneman and Batty saw them to within eight of 400, only for the last four wickets to fall for sevenStoneman fell driving Wagner and was caught by the diving Foster for 197, a career best",5
" Stoneman, who with 617 runs is behind only Kumar Sangakkara and Gary Ballance in the runscoring charts, has no obvious weakness",1
" Given Haseeb Hameeds struggles and a golden duck at Canterbury for Keaton Jennings, who has not reached 50 in 10 Division Two innings, Englands selectors might want to take note From first slip, Cook certainly had a good view of a prospective partnerWith no play possible at Southport, the only other Division One action was in another enthralling low-scorer at Taunton, where Peter Handscombs half-century turned a first innings deficit of 22 into a lead of 105 by stumps for Yorkshire over Somerset",3
" Earlier, Ryan Sidebottom had taken the 31st five-wicket haul (and 750th wicket) of his long first-class career, which is due to finish at the end of the season, as Somerset posted 224, with the last six wickets worth 176Durham require 10 Kent wickets on the final day at Canterbury to secure their first win of the season and move into positive figures",2
" They bowled Kent out for 236 (a lead of 212), with Sam Northeast unbeaten on 109 and career-best figures of six for 63 for Barry McCarthy, but declined to enforce the follow-on, instead batting 70 overs before declaring on 271 for six Kent used the 10 overs before stumps to reach 35 without loss; they still need 449Worcestershire were frustrated by Glamorgan at New Road",3
" Resuming on 76 for six in response to 267, two significant partnerships enabled Glamorgan to wiggle their way to 381 and a lead of 114, before Michael Hogan dismissed Daryl Mitchell to leave Worcestershire 34 for one",1
" Jacques Rudolph made 111 and Chris Cooke 93 in a seventh-wicket stand of 158, before Joe Leach trapped both in an over But Andrew Salter and Lukas Carey picked up the baton, sharing 124 for the ninth wicket Salter finished 80 not out, his second career-best in as many matches",3
Nottinghamshire quietly took control against Gloucestershire at Bristol,1
 Having bowled the hosts out for 303 (with Gareth Roderick adding just eight to his overnight 88) they trail by 82 with seven first-innings wickets in hand,1
" Che Pujara, playing his last game for the leaders, fell late in the day for 67 having shared 146 with Samit PatelAt Wantage Road, Northamptonshire were in clinical mood against Derbyshire",2
" They bowled the visitors out for 176, with Ben Sanderson taking five wickets, then swelled their lead from 42 to 289 for the loss of four wickets by the close, with Rob Newton making 108Sussexs last pair frustrated Leicestershire at Grace Road After Mark Cosgrove was last man out for 128 of Leicestershires 340, Sussex were 201 for nine",3
" By the time bad light intervened at 630, Vernon Philander (69) and Danny Briggs (23) had put on 75 to take Sussex to just 64 behindStuart Dallass stoppage-time strike earned Northern Ireland a smash-and-grab 1-0 win over Azerbaijan that kept his team firmly on the road to Russia",3
"Missing eight players from the squad that went to France and without Gareth McAuley after a first-half injury, Michael ONeills side struggled in the Baku heat and were thankful to the profligacy of Afran Ismayilov",1
" The visitors secured an unlikely victory when Dallas rifled in a late winner, his first goal in a competitiveinternational, having been teed up in the penalty area by the cool-headed Jonny EvansDallass attempt was just the second on target that his side had mustered, ONeill seemingly satisfied to settle for a 0-0 stalemate But late goals have become a hallmark of this team in recent years and the winner ensured Northern Ireland would remain in second place in GroupC regardless of results later on Saturday night and they received a further boost when the Czech Republic were held 1-1 in Norway",3
"The Azeris had been shell-shocked by the Northern Irish tactics in a 4-0 loss in November, conceding three times from dead-ball situations, and the first set piece here came in the third minute Evans glanced over from the corner and after some nervy early moments Robert Prosineckis defence settled into a composed unit that strung together lengthy spells of possession, yet rarely crossed the halfway lineOn one of the few occasions they did go long it produced a clear opening for Ramil Sheydaev, who raced beyond an injured McAuley only to rifle his attempt over when faced by Michael McGovern",3
" McAuley, who had been declared fit despite sustaining a thigh injury last month, was unable to continue and that meant ONeill had to scrap his initial tactics with the introduction of Niall McGinnAs the visitors settled into their new system Azerbaijan began to take control,their possession creeping up to 70%,yet there was little for the Northern Irish defence to contend with",2
" ChrisBrunt had slotted back in at left-back and his foray forward almost produced a goalwhen a low whipped cross just evaded LiamBoyce and JoshMagennisThe half-time interval, which arrived just after McGovern repelled Azerbaijans first shot on target, from Pavlo Pashaev, allowed ONeill to tinker with his tactics again Magennis was pushed up to the role of attacking spearhead, with Boyce behind and McGinn and Dallas occupying the flanksThe tweak did little for Northern Irish fortunes and the noise around the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium rose once more in the 64th minute when Ricard Almeida picked out Ismayilov, who turned Brunt inside out before firing at McGovernThe visitors were tiring and they were nearly caught on the counter following a disastrous short-corner routine, while Evanss lunge on substitute Namik Alaskarov somehow went unpunished",5
"The signs that this could be Northern Irelands night grew when Ismayilov blazed over as he closed on goal but there was still a sense of disbelief around the ground when Dallas scored in the second minute of stoppage time He owed much to Evanss decision to square it to him rather than shooting and the Leeds midfielder steadied himself before firing into the corner to spark jubilant scenes among the 300 or so travelling fans, who will now have a bit more hope that they might be travelling this far east again next summer",2
"Slovakia are now only two points behind England in Group F, after a 2-1 win in Lithuania Goals from Vladimir Weiss and Marek Hamsik put them 2-0 up, before Darvydas Sernass lateconsolationEarlier, while Scotland and England were playing out their thrilling draw in Glasgow, Slovenia maintained their push for a place in Russia as goals fromJosip Ilicic and Milivoje Novakovic gave them a 2-0 win over Malta in Ljubljana",3
 The victors remain in third,1
" Only group winners are guaranteed a place in the finals in Russia next yearSandro Wagner scored a hat-trick as the Group C leaders Germany stretched their 100% record to six games with a 7-0 win over San Marino in Nuremberg Julian Draxlers early effort set the Germans on their way and two from Wagner and a fourth for Amin Younes put them four goals clear by the breakShkodran Mustafi increased Germanys lead early in the second half and Julian Brandt headed the sixth before Wagner completed his hat-trick  and Germanys scoring  with a header of his own five minutes from timeIn the same group the Czech Republic were held to a 1-1 draw away to struggling Norway, Theodor Gebre Selassies first-half strike cancelled out by an Alexander Soderlund penalty",5
Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick as Poland maintained their sixpoint lead at the top of Group E with a 3-1 win over Romania in Warsaw The veteran striker opened the scoring with a 29th-minute penalty and doubled their advantage when he added a second just before the hour A second penalty from Lewandowski sealed another win for the hosts five minutes later before Bogdan Stancu scored a late consolation,3
"Stevan Jovetic was another hat-trick hero as Montenegro held on to second place in the same group with a 4-1 win over Armenia in Podgorica The former Manchester City man, now with Sevilla, added to an early strike by Fatos Beciraj to secure a comfortable win for his side, while the visitors replied late through RuslanKoryanDenmark did their best to keep up the pressure on Poland with a 3-1 win over 10-man Kazakhstan in Almaty",3
" Nicolai Jorgensen put the Danes ahead and Christian Eriksen added a second from the spot after Bauyrzhan Islamkhan was sent off in the dying stages of the first half Islambek Kuat briefly reduced the deficit before Kasper Dolbergs 81st-minute strike sealed victory for the visitors The results left Denmark on 10 points from six games, trailing Montenegro on goal difference",3
"That he might match his hero Ayrton Senna in Montreal will doubtless not have escaped Lewis Hamiltons attention when he entered qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix, but to do so with a performance that echoed Sennas brilliance was simply sublime Taking the top spot at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, and in doing so equalling the Brazilians total of 65 pole positions, required a lap that was not only flawless but at the very limit of the unforgiving track and he delivered with a run he rightly described as close to perfection",2
"Already jubilant after a strong comeback from a difficult weekend at the last round in Monaco, he was left reeling when presented with a gift from the Brazilians family: a race-worn Senna helmet from 1987 I am shaking I am speechless, he said",3
" The fact that I have now reached him in that area, I cant believe it I remember getting home from school and putting on the video of Ayrton so its strange that Im here now with that many poles",2
"He finished ahead of his title rival Ferraris Sebastian Vettel in second, his team-mate Valtteri Bottas in third and Kimi Raikkonen in fourth, and acknowledged it had taken something special to do so Being that it is the most difficult season of my career racing against these two great drivers and Kimi and having us so close, pushes us all to the limit and relies on us all being perfect",2
 We cant be perfect but today I got as close as I could get,1
He has three poles already this season and that he would equal Sennas total was inevitable but he did so with a lap that was more than fitting to go on par with his hero,1
" If Im going to get a pole, get that special pole, if anywhere its going to be here, he saidComing across that line, almost holding your breath, hoping, fingers crossed, waiting, knowing that Sebastian was still on a lap, Valtteri was still on a lap It was a good lap but you dont want to get your hopes too much up because youll be disappointed if they do a better lap  but the intensity of the moment  I dont really recall having as intense a momentThe scale of his achievement was recognised by the Mercedes nonexecutive chairman, Niki Lauda Incredible laps",5
" Unforeseeable, he said We did not expect he could go this quick Lewis did a fantastic job",3
"His consistent and quick running throughout qualifying was just the fillip he required and it was significant that he excelled on a track that shares many of the characteristics of Monte Carlo, where he had difficulty with his set-up and with putting the tyres into the correct temperature operating windowBut on the same selection of rubber at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, which has a similar low-grip, low-abrasion surface and short duration, low-speed corners, he had the Mercedes hooked up throughout He led the timing screens in Q2 and put in a masterful quick run at his first attempt in Q3 of 1m 11",3
"791sec It had looked unbeatableimpossible to better but he went out again and promptly did soexactly that, claiming pole with an exceptional lap of 1m 11459sec His car control was fluid and while the walls in Montreal beckoned they were not even brushedThe breathtaking run, the fastest recorded at the circuit, was not only enough to secure pole but also to allay some of the concerns of the team, who have been working to better understand their cars performance",5
" He was pushed by Vettel, who threw everything at his lap, but the magnitude of Hamiltons achievement was further emphasised when the best the German could manage was a full three-tenths backHamilton must now make the best of it on Sunday",2
" He trails Vettel by 25 points in the drivers championship and while it is not job done, his record in Canada is strong",1
" He has won here five times , two short of the record of Michael Schumacher, who he now trails by just three poles for the highest achieved by any driver Hamilton has converted four of his previous five front of the grid starts at Montreal into victory and he shows every sign of being able to repeat the feat",2
" Should he do so it will be the third time in a row and the perfect way to close what has already been an emotional weekendThe two Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen were in fifth and sixth respectively; followed by the Williams of Felipe Massa, the Force India of Sergio Prez and Esteban Ocon and the Renault of Nico Hlkenberg",2
 Fernando Alonso again had an impressive run putting his underpowered McLaren into 12th,1
The only word to describe it is bedlam,1
" It was certainly difficult to make sense of that extraordinary finale other than to say that, ultimately, Harry Kane showed everyone right at the end why Gareth Southgate had made him captain for the day It was the 93rd minute when Kane denied Scotland their football, bloody hell moment and, in the process, that feat of escapology might have helped to secure him the armband on a longerbasisThat, however, tells only part of the story on a day when both sides experienced the exhilarating joys and excruciating disappointments of football, all in the space of a few minutes",3
" For Scotland, in particular, it was an agonising way to finish a wild and eccentric encounter Yet England will have their own frustrations bearing in mind they had been drifting towards a relatively prosaic 1-0 win before all that late drama when Leigh Griffiths brought the home crowd to a point of rare euphoria",2
"The two free-kicks that Griffiths expertly placed beyond Joe Hart came in the 87th and 90th minutes and it is doubtful Hampden has ever made a more deafening roar than when the second one curled into the England net Before this game, the Scottish FA had announced a competition to find the greatest goal in the teams history",2
" Both of these free-kicks could make the shortlist and at that stage Scotland were on the verge of inflicting Englands first defeat in a qualifying fixture since October 2009Kane, though, had other ideas and it was a remarkably composed finish in the circumstances, ensuring Southgates team remain in a position of strength at the top of Group F",2
" Kanes right-foot volley was Englands get-out-of-jail card and the story changed again Suddenly he was running to the corner to celebrate and, all across the pitch, Scotlands players could be seen dropping to their kneesTheir grief was understandable but when they have time to reflect they should not to be too disheartened when, to put it into context, Gordon Strachans starting lineup featured three players from teams that will begin next season in Englands second tier and a centre-half, Charlie Mulgrew, who had just been relegated to League One with Blackburn Rovers",3
"If there was an imbalance of talent, Scotland seemed determined to make up for it in other ways They were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and could never be accused of lacking effort",2
" They also had a captain, Scott Brown, who quickly gave the impression that whatever Englands players encountered alongside the Royal Marines last weekend was going to be chickenfeed compared to 90 minutes in his company Browns first challenge on Dele Alli  a reducer, to use the old-fashioned parlance  earned him a yellow card inside the opening three minutes and he was fortunate, in the extreme, to stay on after another hack at the same player shortly after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, one of Englands substitutes, had opened the scoringEngland had taken a while to settle but once they cleared their heads of any early uncertainty they had enough of the ball in promising positions to have made it a more straightforward assignment and that, perhaps, was the biggest disappointment for Southgate",3
" Englands supporters had started going through their victory songs just before Griffiths turned the game upside down Scotland had been compared, unfavourably, with San Marino",2
" Indeed, the first goal from Griffiths took place with Scotlands staying home as its backdrop",1
" Southgate was exaggerating when he described it as a game we were in control of for 80 minutes but his exasperation was understandable and, without wishing to take anything away from Griffiths, these were moments that will bring more scrutiny on Harts performances",1
"He is not the goalkeeper he once was and Griffiths took advantage with one 25-yard effort towards one corner and then another, from a similar distance, into the other side For Hart, it cannot be satisfactory to be beaten from that distance twice in quick succession They were, according to Strachan, the best free-kicks he could remember from all his years associated with Scotland",3
" From a goalkeepers perspective, however, neither shot was fully into the cornerUntil those moments Scotland had so little momentum in the final third of the pitch that Griffiths, playing as a lone striker, resorted to a penalty-area dive earlier in the second half",2
" England found it difficult to get behind the opposition defence but Kane had at least three other presentable chances, one headed off the goalline by Kieran Tierney, and another shot from Jake Livermore came back off the post after deflecting off the strikerOxlade-Chamberlain had been on the pitch only five minutes when he turned past Brown, moved across the penalty area, right to left, and opened the scoring with a rising left-foot shot",2
" England looked relatively untroubled until a foul by Gary Cahill gave Griffiths his first opportunity to take aimStrachan reflected that he had never heard a noise like it when the second one went in, leaving him on the verge of what he noted wistfully would have been the best result of his managerial career England, however, set about rescuing themselves with all the competitive courage that Southgate had talked about in the buildup to the matchIt was an onslaught once the public announcer let everyone knew there would be four minutes of stoppage time and, finally, the substitute Raheem Sterling picked out Kane England needed their captain and it was an elegant finish given the pressure on that moment and the consequences if he had failed",5
"This England side are dangerous when they play with freedom, as Australia discovered in the West Midlands Colosseum And this was a free game for them",2
" Unlike the rest of the teams in this tournament they were already assured of their semi-final slot at the start of play, which may have helped to account for the flamboyant, carefree manner in which they sent Australia packing This outcome means that Bangladesh will be contesting the Edgbaston semi-final on Thursday",2
Needing 278 to win England were propelled by a blistering partnership between Eoin Morgan and Ben Stokes,1
 The margin of victory was dictated by the DLS method after yet more rain in Birmingham,1
" But at least there was a proper result this time, England winning by 40 runs They were 240 for four with 94 overs remaining when play was suspended",3
"On a surface that invited strokeplay, especially when there was pace on the ball, this pair had a packed house salivating in between singing: Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio, to their favourite rivals Both left-handers were in sublime form If anything Morgan rather than Stokes, whose innings was a model of powerful orthodoxy, had everyone gasping",3
Sometimes Englands captain shimmied down the pitch to the Australian pacemen to crack the ball through the covers At others he stayed back to smash it square,2
" One of his sixes, an instinctive swipe off Josh Hazlewood, just kept going  defying the wind and the longest boundary",1
" The faster Pat Cummins tried to bowl, the further the ball travelled",1
The situation facing Morgan and Stokes mirrored that encountered by Bangladesh on Friday against New Zealand in Cardiff as three wickets fell early in the run chase Such a setback would soon seem a pinprick,2
"There is space here to describe Jason Roys innings in full: a straight-driven boundary first ball; lbw to Mitchell Starc second ball, though proceedings were delayed when he misguidedly sought a review His judgment was awry there as well",2
 So the Roy conundrum continues One suspects the 1922 Committee might have got rid of him by now,2
"Alex Hales was caught at slip off Hazlewood for a duck and Joe Root edged to the keeper just before the first interruption for rain It was 35 for three and briefly England might have been relieved that this was a free gameHowever, it transpired that three early wickets were not enough for Australia, just as four were insufficient for New Zealand against Bangladesh",3
" When the players returned Morgan unveiled some sparkling cover drives and Stokes was soon into his strideThe boundaries are reasonably big here but not large enough to contain Morgan in this form He hit five sixes and could only be dispatched via a chaotic run out after 159 had been added Stokes spooned towards mid-on and scampered for a run; Morgan watched the ball rather than his partner and Adam Zampas throw lit up the stumps This was the best piece of Australian fielding amid some messy out-cricket, albeit in the gloaming of the late afternoon when it was obviously tough to pick up the white ball",5
Morgans departure was not a great setback Jos Buttler settled in without many alarms and Stokes with a hint of serenity  lets hope he is not maturing too fast  had posted his third ODI century when the rain returned By then an undercooked Aussie side had just about accepted the inevitable,3
The rustiness of the Australian team was also reflected in their inability to make the most of a vigorous start when they batted After 32 overs they were 181 for three and another target over 300 was on the horizon,2
 But they could not capitalise,1
" At one point they lost five wickets for 15 runs in the space of 26 balls with Adil Rashid and Mark Wood, who took eight wickets between them, their chief tormentors",1
" In the end Australia reached 277 for nine thanks to a sparky innings from Travis Head, who was exasperated to watch the lower order come and go in the blink of an eyeThat rustiness, a consequence of the rain following Australia wherever they tread in the UK, did not appear to hinder the top order so much David Warner had struck four crisp boundaries before he edged a delivery from Wood to Jos Buttler",3
" Aaron Finch was less silky but eventually began to connect with the ball in his no-nonsense style He shared a run-a-ball partnership with Steve Smith before lofting a catch to the extra cover region off Stokes, who would have one of his more profligate days with the ballUp went the ball into a swirling wind and it seemed to stay there long enough for the odds on the catch being taken to lengthen considerably",3
" Morgan swivelled in a 360-degree arc, never a good sign, yet he caught the ball without fumbling or falling to the ground No honest armchair critic from another era could profess that this was a simple catch which would have been easily gobbled up in his/her daySmith and Moiss Henriques, who looked devastating for 15 minutes, both fell to more straightforward catches by Liam Plunkett Then Glenn Maxwell fell to what is regarded as a routine catch in this decade, but one which has the old-timers gasping A Maxwell hammer off Wood headed for the Hollies Stand when Roy came into view; he caught the ball above his head, realised that his feet were going to cross the boundary and so he calmly tossed the ball in the air before returning to the field of play to catch it, a run-of-the-mill moment of brilliance in this era",5
"From there Australia subsided against Rashid, who was excellent for the second game in succession Both Matthew Wade and Starc embarked on premeditated contortions to make the bowlers job easier as Head looked on aghast from the non-strikers end It was a case of Australia keeping their Head while all about him were losing theirsWarriors forward Draymond Green made no secret of how he feels about Cleveland fans in the aftermath of the Warriors 137-116 loss in Game 4 of the NBA finals on Friday at Quicken Loans ArenaI dont pay that much attention to anybody in Cleveland, honestly, he said",5
" They dont seem to be the sharpest people aroundGreen was the target of a hostile reception from the home crowd throughout the lopsided defeat, which denied the Warriors a finals sweep and the first perfect postseason in league history",2
"Chants of Draymond sucks were audible whenever the Golden State firebrand was at the center of the action, never more than a controversial sequence during the third quarter which saw Green nearly ejectedA year after his antics on this floor led to a suspension for Game 5 that began the Warriors historic collapse, Green was again in the middle of the nights strangest sceneThe 27-year-old appeared to be ejected when he was called for what the Cavs and Warriors thought was his second technical midway through the third quarter",3
" He waved his arms in frustration at an official after being called for fouling Kevin Love and was hit with the tech, which would have triggered an automatic ejectionBut Green didnt leave the court, and referees said the technical they called after Greens foul with 1:55 remaining in the first quarter was on Kerr  though the official box score had it listed as Green",2
"No announcement was ever made correcting the error, not that Green was listening for oneKerr said he thought the first technical was called on Green  though said he thought he deserved it  and believed his power forward was going to have to leave the floor when the one was called in the third quarterBut Green stood stoically on the floor, then egged on the crowd to raise the decibel level of their jeers toward him",3
" He said he knew all along the first tech wasnt on himI knew because the first tech on Steve, which I didnt understand, Mike Callahan came up to John (Goble) and asked him who was the tech on and he said Kerr, Green said So I knew I didnt have a technical foul, but still trying to figure out why did I get the second one",3
"The box was changed after the third quarter to indicate Kerr had received the first technicalThe officials acknowledged after the game they did not handle the situation very wellGoble said he thought he had verbalized to the table that the initial technical was on Kerr, but said after watching the video that he should have done a better job with that The problem then worsened when the officials didnt catch the public address announcer saying it was called on GreenThe procedure is to advise the table who the technical foul is on and with the player we give a number",5
" With a coach or trainer, we just verbalize and at that time we should listen to the PA announcer to who it is on, Callahan said At that time, we did not do a very good job of listening to the PA announcer and we did not hear him announce it",2
" I take full responsibility for thatLate in Game 4 last year, Green swiped at LeBron James groin and was subsequently given a flagrant foul",2
" That gave him an accumulation of flagrant foul points and forced him to sit out Game 5 as the Warriors lost their chance to clinch the series, and they eventually fell in seven gamesSo even though Friday was a bad night for the Warriors, at least they head home with good newsThank God I get to play in Game 5, Green said",3
"For the first time in its four-year history, the Womens Tour of Britain will enjoy a grandstand finale in the centre of London on Sunday, and Polands Kasia Niewiadoma will have every right to enjoy the occasion after dominating the three days of racing since her solo victory on Wednesdays first stage from Daventry to Kettering, where she carved out a 1min 46sec lead that has proved impregnable, in spite of the best efforts of her rivalsOn the toughest stage of the Womens Tour, 122km out and back, a finish close to the church with the twisted spire, the Dutch teams Sunweb and Boels-Dolman both put the 22-year-old under pressure Sunweb placed their Canadian rider Leah Kirchmann in an escape that lasted more than 90km, surviving to the finish, where Australias Sarah Roy took the stage winBoels-Dolman used the strength of the 2016 winner, Lizzie Deignan, to claw back the early three-woman escape, including Kirchmann, to within reach of the peloton before  in a classic tactical move  sending their best hope for the overall title, Luxembourgs Christine Majerus, across to join Kirchmanns group with 50km remainingTogether with Roy and Shara Gillow, of the FDJ team, Kirchmann and Majerus raced into a lead of more than two minutes, with Niewiadoma isolated in a select chasing group that had formed during the excruciatingly tough opening phase, which alternated leg-breaking climbs and greasy twisting descents",5
" The Pole needed the support of her team-mate Marianne Vos, but the multiple world champion and 2014 winner of this race had pulled out on Friday with a cracked collarbone after a late crashDeignans hopes of a repeat victory had evaporated after she was struck down by stomach trouble during Thursdays hilly second stage around Stoke, losing nine minutes Here she was prominent, but only in a team role midway through the stage, as Boels-Dolman chased the early breakaways before sending Majerus across the gap, while she could be seen later on protecting her team-mates bid for the overall title as the chase intensified behind",3
"However, the chasing group swelled as riders left behind in the early kilometres regained contact, and a chase  led notably by the Canyon-SRAM team-mates of the British national champion Hannah Barnes  brought the peloton to almost within touching distance of the escapees by the finishThis was one of the hardest races Ive ever ridden, said Niewiadoma, the under-23 European champion",2
" There were lots and lots of short and steep climbs; after a while I was completely done in, and then I had to think about controlling the other teams I had to stay calm and think positively, I knew other teams would be destroyed on that courseIn April, during the Ardennes Classics, Niewiadoma offered a taste of the form she has enjoyed this week, matching Deignan and the Olympic champion Anna Van der Breggen in Amstel Gold, Flche Wallonne and Lige-Bastogne-Lige",3
" Her victory on Sunday should be a clear-cut one, but that proviso has a little more bite to it than usual The unexpected can always happen, as evidenced by a freak crash on the finish line that sent the stage winner, Roy, to hospitalWith echoes of Deignans high-speed accident on the opening stage in 2015, Roy sprinted up the cobbled street in front of Chesterfields market hall, about 10 metres in front of Majerus and Kirchmann, with the peloton breathing down their necks behind; as she raised her hands in the air to celebrate after crossing the line, she lost control of her front wheel on the bouncy cobbles, jack-knifed her bike and landed heavily on her right side",3
"Roy was not alone in finding Derbyshire a road of pain Within 20 miles of the start, the race was in ribbons because of the constant steep climbs  several tackled after dead turns, which meant the riders started them almost from a standstill The weaker riders buckled rapidly, and midway through the stage the broom wagon that picks up the stragglers had no sitting space left, with those who wanted to quit reduced to finding places in other race vehicles",3
"The Olympic road race champion, Katie Archibald, finished with blood streaming down her right leg and her jersey ripped, after a crash 10km from the finish She crossed the line on the coat-tails of the bunch and dropped to 19th overall She is now out of the running for the prize of best Briton, which has proved an entertaining subplot, acted out by the Barnes sisters, Hannah and Alice",3
" After the younger sibling, Alice, took the jersey on Friday, thanks to a fine second place in Leamington, it went to Hannah on Saturday thanks to a strong fifth place and a fortuitous split in the peloton in the uphill finish",1
"The 79 survivors will be more than conscious of the recent background to Sundays climax in the British capital, if the feelings of the Queen of the Mountains, Audrey Cordon, are anything to go by",1
" Ive been thinking about everything that happened, said the Frenchwoman in a reference to the London Bridge terrorist attack, adding: Racing will show that life goes on",1
" Women can be on their bikes, be strong, and show that we know how to liveCrisis? What crisis? Godolphins all-blue silks were carried to victory in the first four races hereon Saturday as Sheikh Mohammeds team began to move on from the shock of suddenly losing their chief executive in midweekOne waggish bookmaker used Twitter to suggest Godolphin were doing a Leicester City in showing such excellent form so soon after a change in management",3
" In reality, there was nothing particularly new or surprising in three winners from Charlie Appleby, one of Godolphins two main trainers in this town, and another from John Gosden, who has a sprinkling of their horses in his nearby yardAppleby mopped up the first two races with a couple of two-year-olds, a division in which he has had notable success this year, which may have led, indirectly, to Tuesdays resignation of John Ferguson",2
" Saeed bin Suroor, Godolphins other main trainer, appears to believe the division of two-year-olds this year has been somewhat unfair and indeed he is yet to have even a single runner from that age group, while Appleby has now had 10 winners from 15 runners",1
" Bin Suroor vented in the press, prompting Fergusons departure",1
"Bin Suroors only runner on Saturday was at Haydock, so he was at least spared the sight of seeing Appleby making so many trips to the winners enclosure  including after the first race with the debutant Glorious Journey, who cost 2",1
"6m at auction in October, when Ferguson was doing the biddingRegally bred, the colt has clearly generated quite a lot of expectation at Godolphin, prompting a reporter to ask Appleby if he was relieved about this initial successDenying it, the trainer replied cheerily: Do I look like Theresa May? For the record, there is not much of a likeness and Appleby also appears much more willing than the prime minister to address difficult subjects in public, since he responded to a question about Fergusons decision to quit and how it affected the organisationJohn made his decision and felt it was the right one, Appleby said I can only thank him for the help hes given me over the years",5
" Hes been a pleasure to work withFor myself, Im employed by Godolphin to race horses and prepare them to the best of my ability with the team I have and thats what I shall carry on doing Im not going to get involved in anything more than that, its not my department",3
" My department is the horses and, as I said to William [Buick], his department is to ride them and, as long as were doing our best at that, then hopefully well carry on getting the results that we seeJoe Osborne, appointed as Godolphins interim chief executive while Sheikh Mohammed considers what should happen next, was in Applebys stable this week, introducing himself to staff",2
" It appears he has only half of Fergusons job, as the departed man was also racing manager and liaised with the trainers over running plans With no one now in that role, the trainers are free to make more such decisions by themselvesIn Bin Suroors case, this is not much of a change, since it seems he decided to cut Ferguson out of the chain of command some time ago If the Sheikh decides to appoint a new racing manager, that person will surely view the winning of Bin Suroors trust and support as job No1 Whatever the fairness or otherwise of the way horses have been split between the two trainers up to now, Bin Suroor, a native Dubaian who clearly has the Sheikhs ear, can expect to get the cream in the future",5
"In the meantime, Appleby hopes to take a good number of his juvenile team to Royal Ascot in nine days time Theres not a standout among them but they wont look out of place in the lineup, he said He also has the newly gelded Bay Of Poets for the Hampton Court, Endless Time for the Gold Cup and Frontiersman for the Hardwicke",3
 His classy Hawkbill is likely to be saved for another day and a softer surface,1
"Hugh Anderson, Godolphins MD, said: Its been an interesting week but on Saturday, at the business end of the operation on the racetrack, we have seen a Group One win in Australia and a four-timer here at Newmarket Godolphin is about great horses being prepared by excellent teams in our yards and studs",2
 Its about first-class trainers and winners Its been a good day all round and we look forward to much more success over the season,2

"15 Tie Em Up Tel 445 Time To Exceed520 Crafty Madam (nb)Roland Garros is where the Open era of professional tennis began in the fabled summer of 1968, when students took to the streets of Paris and Ken Rosewall picked up 15,000 francs, roughly 2,000, for beating his friend and rival Rod Laver in the final of the French OpenRosewall, who had been the youngest French champion at 18 in 1953 and then the oldest at 33, could have bought half a dozen houses in London with his winnings if he wanted to  although probably not around Wimbledon, where the All England Club matched the French purse in that year of social and political turbulence, joining the professional revolution and sending a definitive signal that the amateur sport had changed for everWhen Rafael Nadal reaches for his 10th Roland Garros title on Sunday, and Stan Wawrinka tries for his second, the prize will be an altogether more stratospheric 2",5
"1m, somewhere near 18m  at the time of writing",2
" Turbulence is cyclicalIf life was simpler in 1968, the game was too Coaches were what you arrived at the ground in We used to travel with each other, hit with each other, Laver said That was as good as any coach",5
"But Sundays final on Court Philippe-Chatrier, while resembling the collision of two small armies, should be every bit as significant and devoured with equal enthusiasm",1
" Tennis in the 60s was played with different rackets and attitudes, perhaps, and had a different constituency but there would be no holding back change",1
"The Spaniard has been making history all of his career, much of it this year as he completed La Dcima at Monte Carlo and Barcelona",1
" Now, he goes for the hat-trick of 10s at the place where it matters most  to him, his fans and loyal devotees of clay-court tennisThere have been minor rumblings that the red dirt of Europe might one day be swamped by low maintenance hard courts  just as the treasured grass of Wimbledon was meant to be under pressure, which has forced a longer lead time on the preparatory tournaments to sustain the interest of the top players  as if millions of whatever currency were not enoughThe titles still matter, though, and Nadal is desperate to move on to 15 majors and to within three of the absent Roger Federer",3
" The Swiss cannily gave the clay season a swerve after his lightning start to 2017 so he could be at his refreshed best for Wimbledon, still his best chance of adding to his collection of majorsClay might not have been a graveyard for Federer but, until the arrival of Novak Djokovic to make life uncomfortable for Nadal, it was always on his list Not any more There is a possibility that after his 36th birthday in August he will not play here again, although his sponsors would cringe in disbelief were he ever to say soFor now, the stage belongs to Nadal and Wawrinka",5
" Selecting a winner might seem straightforward, given Andy Murray stretched Wawrinkas total court time for the tournament by four hours and 34 minutes to 15 hours and 20 minutes in a brave but doomed semi-final over five sets on FridayNadal, meanwhile, has sailed through the fortnight in a minute over 10 hours To get here he did not have to go past two hours in any of his matches until the second semi-final on Friday, when he crushed the sixth seed, Dominic Thiem, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0",3
" Murray avoided the concluding bagel against Wawrinka but only because he fought like a starving dog in a final set of stupendous hitting by Switzerlands highest ranked playerNadal insists, not with much conviction, that: I dont care about the games I lost or not, or sets or these kind of things",2
 The only thing I care about is I have been playing very well during the whole event and I was able to win all the matches,1
 Thats the only thing that really matters,1
"Tell it to Murray, who operated at considerably more draining level and admitted his legs had gone in the end against Wawrinka Quick wins do matter in seven, best-of-five matches  it is absurd to suggest otherwise  so the advantage is most definitely with Nadal",2
"However, Federer does not call his compatriot Diesel for nothing Wawrinka has the genetic gift of being able to chug through a long campaign like a tank, never weakening and always potent",2
" Some of his hitting off the ground against Murray was as hard as it is possible to strike a ball and the Scot, perhaps the best retriever in the game now that Djokovic has declined, could do nothing about the 87 winners that flew by him  and was equally grateful for the 77 unforced errors that came off Wawrinkas some times impetuousracket",1
He will not play any differently against Nadal,1
 Nor will the Spaniard alter his game,1
" He plays with more urgency, perhaps, all fast-twitch fibre and sweat, while Wawrinka will have his trigger ready to press on any given occasion He will move to No2 in the world behind Murray if he wins; Nadal will stay in that slot if he lifts the Coupe des Mousquetaires again",2
If confirmation were needed that history always wraps its fingers around our memories Wawrinka and Nadal are the first pair of finalists here aged 30 or more since 1969,1
 The combatants then were 30-year-old Laver and the 34-year-old Rosewall,1
 The younger man got his revenge that day,1
" And the younger man this time, having lost to Wawrinka in their only previous slam final, the 2014 Australian Open, will probably do likewise on Sunday",1
"There was good and less good news for British tennis on Saturday Ivan Lendl confirmed he had decided to go straight to London to prepare with Murray for his Wimbledon defence rather than return to Florida But Dan Evans had to retire with a calf injury when leading Dustin Brown 6-3, 4-2 at the Aegon Trophy in Surbiton",3
 I dont know [the extent of the injury] until I have a scan on Monday,1
" Hopefully, its settled down a bit",1
"Things like this are not supposed to happen In just her eighth grand slam event, the unseeded, fearless Jelena Ostapenko produced a stunning fightback to win the French Open title here Her 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Simona Halep, the pre-tournament favourite, who would have been world No1 had she won the title, made her the first unseeded woman to win here in the open era",3
" At 20, she is the youngest woman to win here since Iva Majoli of Croatia in 1997, the first Latvian to win a grand slam singles title and the first person to win their first tour title at a grand slam since the Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten lifted the first of his three titles here in 1997, something he achieved on the day Ostapenko was born",1
"Halep will wonder how she failed to clinch victory, having led by a set and 3-0 and having three break-point chances in a long fourth game of the second set that would have put her two breaks up The Romanian also led 3-1 in the third set but, in truth, nothing about Saturdays final was in her hands against Ostapenko, whose outrageous ball-striking sent the ball flying past her outstretched racket time and time again as her hopes of a first grand slam title were dashed in the dirt",2
"It was a stunning victory for a woman who went into the French Open as the world No47, a 100-1 shot and not even spoken about as a contender The junior Wimbledon champion three years ago, Ostapenko had never even been beyond the third round of a grand slam until this fortnight but the way she played here suggests that she will be here for many years to come",2
"It was also fitting, on a sultry day at Roland Garros, that she should finish it off with yet another backhand return down the line, one of 54 clean winners she struck in the final",1
"I still cannot believe I am the Roland Garros champion and Im only 20, said Ostapenko, who showed no nerves and never deviated from her simple, devastating gameplan of attack, attack, attackI know Simona is a great player and she was playing great but I kept trying, stayed aggressive and Im very happy things turned around for me I have no words, she added",3
"In the absence of Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka, all missing for a variety of reasons, this years French Open had been considered one of the most open of all time Halep, most peoples favourite after winning in Madrid and reaching the final in Rome, was expected to be able to tame Ostapenko and when she withstood an early barrage of groundstrokes from the Latvian to take the first set, the 25-year-old was on trackKnowing Ostapenko was capable of reeling off winners seemingly at will, Halep was well aware she needed to stay patient, accept when she was outhit and wait for the mistakes, while taking any chance she had to be aggressive",3
" She must have hoped that Ostapenko would freeze on the big occasion but instead the Latvian looked relatively relaxed The simplicity of her game means she does not second-guess herself, as she proved in beating players such as Sam Stosur and Caroline Wozniacki en route",2
"She had also come from a set down three times on her way to the final and when Halep failed to take any of her three break points at 3-0 in the second set, she had hope That translated into belief when she cracked several winners on her way to levelling at 3-3 and when she broke for 4-3, she whipped up a crowd who were already willing her on, gasping at times at the ferocity of her flatly-struck groundstrokes Though Halep broke back for 4-4, Ostapenko broke again and served out to force adeciderAt the start of the third, Halep saved two break points and then broke on her way to a 3-1 lead as Ostapenkos radar went astray as she sprayed the ball long and wide, her focus dipping for a momentHowever, from 3-1 down she broke back for 3-3 and then, thanks to a bit of outrageous fortune when she got a dead net cord on a backhand that had been heading way wide, the 20-year-old broke to lead 4-3",5
"Finally in front in the match for the first time, Ostapenko might have blinked but she held serve brilliantly for 5-3 At 30-40 on the Halep serve, Ostapenko had match point and she rifled an unstoppable backhand down the line to clinch victory, leaping in the air and turning in delight in the direction of her two coaches, her mother and the former Spanish player, Anabel Medina, who had been on the edge of their courtside seats throughout",2
"Both players struggled on second serve and though Halep may chastise herself for not attacking more, she rarely had the chance Ostapenko defended well when she needed to and as soon as she got in position, or even sometimes when she was not, she slapped the ball at break-neck speedHalep will be world No2 when the womens rankings are updated on Monday and she was gracious in defeat",3
" All the credit for what you have done, she said",1
" Its an amazing thing Enjoy it be happy and keep it going because youre like a kidShe may be a kid but the kid is a grand slam champion and if she can continue to play without a semblance of fear for as long as possible, then this may be the first of many",3
"It sounds like a beginning of a strange joke, only its not Usain Bolt and Mo Farah really are sat in a hotel room in Jamaica discussing who would win a 600m race between them I think Id have a good chance, says Farah Just because of my endurance Bolt throws him a look of mock-horror",5
" So what about me, you and David Rudisha? Farah laughs",1
" That completely changes it, he replies, chuckling Rudisha is strong He has run 1min 40sec for 800m",3
" He could jog and still have usRudisha, the great Kenyan stoic, is sat between the pair saying nothing Bolt turns to him",3
" What do you think? The double Olympic 800m champion is aware that he is on Bolts home turf in Kingston and doesnt want to cause offence Er  well , he begins Everyone cracks up",3
"Eventually, Rudisha decides that honesty is the best policy I have a bit of an advantage because I do a lot of 400m and 800m in training and races, he says So I dont think you have a chance there",3
 Cue more laughter But there is no comeback Everyone accepts that Rudisha tells it as it is,3
"A few minutes later, with the Observer, Rudisha makes another startling admission He believes he is in even better form than last year, when he glided away from the field to win his second Olympic gold in Rio in 1min 42",2
"16sec  his fastest time since that glorious night at London 2012 when he smashed his own world record and was hailed by Sebastian Coe as producing the greatest moment of those GamesWhats changed is that I have been able to do a lot more mileage again, says Rudisha softly That is something I lacked since I seriously injured my knee in 2013",3
" After that, if I attempted long runs I would feel some pain and have to stop because I didnt want any setbacks",1
 But I was able to put more work in during the winter and I am really happy,1
"Rudisha did not looked overly impressive when he was beaten by the 19-year-old Kenyan sensation Kipyegon Bett in Shanghai last month However, he explains that he had a minor strain, which has now cleared, and that his recent times in training over 400m and 300m  which he always uses a benchmark for how he will perform in competition  have surprised and delighted him",2
" I am in a better form than last year and I feel fantastic, he says I just needed to do some finetuning and I think my season will be greatUnderstandably, he has tunnel-vision focus on London in August and winning a third world championships title to go with his 2011 and 2015 victories",3
" I am really excited to go back to the stadium where I made history, he saysThe UK will always have a special place in my heart The fans always welcome me and it has a great history of middle-distance athletes, from Sir Roger Bannister to Steve Ovett, Steve Cram and Lord SebCoeRudisha has run six of the eight fastest 800m times in history and for years looked almost invincible But, for the first time, he admits he is struggling to come to grips with losing after his career-threatening injury",5
" Mentally I used to be a very strong, he says I never wanted to lose But the injury affected me",3
 When I came back I lost a lot of races And sometimes I would be a little bit reluctant in some races,2
" Afterwards Id look back and say to myself: I dont think I have done my best thereSlowly, though, the magic returned In 2013 and 2014, when I had that pain in my knee, it was tough",3
" I love running, but it is a short career So no matter how hard it is, no matter how painful it is, I thought to myself: If you love something you can do it If it was not for the love of sport I would have struggled to come back",3
Rudisha hopes to be a role model for young Kenyans and notes with pride how kids chase after him shouting Rudisha,1
 Rudisha while he is jogging around the hills of Iten,1
"They are always there, he says, smiling Even when we are doing track sessions they like making fun of me, saying things like: You cant beat us  we want to run against you It is always fun and I love that",3
"His deep enjoyment of running has now been passed to his seven-year-old daughter, Charin",1
" She used to say No, dont want anything to do with running I dont want to run like Daddy But now she loves it",3
 When I am training at home we do some exercises and jog together,1
"Rudishas father, Daniel, won a 4x400m silver medal at the 1968 Olympics Could she be the third line of a Rudisha dynasty? Well, she has good genes  I can say that, he says, laughing",2
 But it is hard,1
" Running is not only about talent and genetics It is also about hard work and your spiritsThere is nothing wrong with Rudisha on that front and, at 28, he has enough time on his side to compete at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020",3
" I would love to emulate Bolt and have three Olympic gold medals, he says Wouldnt that be fantastic?Brazils football federation said the striker Gabriel Jesus sustained a broken eye socket during the 1-0 loss to Argentina in a friendly",2
"The Manchester City player was taken off the field on a stretcher late in Fridays game after being hit by an errant elbow during an aerial challenge with club team-mate Nicols OtamendiJesus was initially given the all-clear after precautionary tests but the CBF said on Saturday that, after a more detailed examination, a fracture was diagnosed in the bone that protects his left eyeBrazil will not call up a replacement for Tuesdays friendly with Australia, also in MelbourneAndy Lynch joins a select club on Sunday The venerable Castleford prop, who retires at the end of this season, will become the seventh player in the Super League era to reach 500 club appearances and he is in esteemed company",5
"Lynch, who could yet finish his career with the record for Super League appearances, joins Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Leon Pryce in one of the games most exclusive groups, yet there is one thing missing",1
"While Sinfield, Peacock and Pryce won championships aplenty during their illustrious careers, Super League glory has evaded Lynch, but, at the age of 38, his final season represents his best chance in years to win the title Castleford are top of the table going into Sundays game with Warrington and are overwhelming favourites to reach Old Trafford in October To do it for my hometown club would be an incredible achievement for myself and for Castleford, he said",3
" But we arent getting carried away Its good for the fans to be where we are but were taking things slowly  nothing is won at this time of the yearIt is a commendable attitude, especially as the sense of excitement in Castleford, a town of 40,000 people, is palpable",3
"The club have waited their entire 91-year history to be crowned champions of England but under the commendable work of Daryl Powell that drought could end: a point not lost on Lynch, whose closest call to winning the title came when he watched from the stands as a Bradford player in 2005I love this club and I will always be a Castleford fan, he said",2
" Bringing a trophy home would just be a brilliant way to sign off on a career I have truly loved To bring a trophy back to this club and this town would mean everything to meWhile Cas attempt to remain four points clear at the top, Warrington, last years Grand Finalists, find themselves in the bottom four and face an unlikely battle against relegation in the Qualifiers Lynch, however, is adamant the league leaders will not take their opponents lightlyWe know Warrington will be tough",5
 Theyre due a good performance and this run theyre on cant last for ever,1
 But itll be a special day; just to be named among those players whove made 500 appearances is a great honour and something to look back on in years to come,1
Lynchs career has lasted so long he spent his teenage years playing against Powell If player and coach can bring the championship to Castleford it would be a fitting finale to a career that undoubtedly makes Lynch one of the finest of his era,2
Tom Briscoe scored two tries to help Leeds come from behind and climb back up to third in the Super League table with a 18-16 victory at Wakefield,1
"The Rhinos, temporarily deposed by Hulls win at Salford on Friday, conceded quick-fire scores to trail 10-0 after 11 minutes but ran in two tries either side of the half-time to claim their third win in four gamesTrinity responded with their third try with seven minutes left but it was too late to prevent the visitors third successive win at Belle Vue, now known as the Beaumont Legal Stadium",2
The result brought to an end a run of six straight wins for a Trinity side that have impressed so many during the past two months,1
 Yet Trinity took an early lead thanks to Mason Caton-Browns fifth try in three games and Kyle Woods dart over from 15 yardsStevie Ward replied for the Rhinos and Leeds were quickly in again as Callum Watkins put Briscoe over Trinity held out to maintain their 10-8 advantage into the breakBriscoes second try gave the Rhinos the lead for the first time and they extended their lead shortly afterwards thanks to Joel Moon Ben Jones-Bishop replied for Wakefield but they could not find a winner,5
"Jake Mamo produced a man-of-the-match performance as Huddersfield Giants moved into the Super League top eight with a 56-12 win over Catalans Dragons in PerpignanMamo scored four tries for the Giants, while Jermaine McGillvary and Danny Brough both crossed twice, and Aaron Murphy and Shannon Wakeman completed the scoringCatalans showed no sign of turning their form around they have now won only one of their last eight matches and sit precariously in the bottom four",3
" PAScotland helped their new coach, Gregor Townsend, get off to a perfect start by easing to a comprehensive victory over an inexperienced Italy side in the first Test of their tour",1
"Scotland made light of losing three experienced players to British & Irish Lions duty in New Zealand with the hooker, Ross Ford, leading the way with two tries after the break as Singapore hosted a tier one Test for the first time",1
Townsend was delighted to get off to a winning start,1
" To win is important but as a coach we still have plenty to work on, he said We came out with a win and thats what we work for but theres room for improvement next week and we are already thinking about how we can get betterDespite dominating for most of the opening half, Scotland were unable to shake off their stubborn opponents until they scored two brilliant quick-fire tries through their scrum-half, Ali Price, and winger Tim Visser shortly before the break",3
"We believe the kind of open rugby we play, they are not used to playing with the speed of ball So it was great to get those scores then, Townsend said",2
 If wed gone in at 3-3 they would have had a lot of confidence but the tries gave us a boost and really set us up for the second half,1
" Italy are a tough opponent and the rugby they play takes a lot out of the forwards, but you have to keep working at it because there will be times in the game when opportunities will be madeScotland made good on a pre-match promise of a fast start and forced Italy into desperate defending in the first five minutes through quick and expansive passing as they probed for an opening",2
 Scotlands ambition was soon rewarded when Finn Russell slotted over a penalty to open the scoring but Italy pegged them back almost immediately when Tommaso Allan kicked from long range after an infringement at a ruckScotland were dominating possession but unable to capitalise on good field position due to poor offloads and a lack of discipline Italy were content to soak up pressure and seek to trouble their opponents on the counterattack,3
"Italy, however, continued to give away penalties with Scotland persisting in opting for attacking set pieces and a couple of moments of brilliance in the final two minutes of the half enabled Scotland to pull clearPrice scored the first try when he fooled the defence with a dummied pass and dived over in the corner Visser then hauled down an exquisite chip-kick and stretched to touch down as he fell to the ground Duncan Taylor added the conversion for a 15-3 half-time leadScotland stormed out of the blocks after the break, immediately recording another seven points when Ford burrowed over from a driving maul and Russell added the extras",5
"Italy were looking ragged and after Dean Budd, making his debut, was sent to the sin-bin for persistent infringements Ford added his second try after a well-worked passing move as Scotland ran away with what had rapidly transformed into a one-sided contestItaly briefly stemmed the flow with an intercept try finished off by Michele Campagnaro in the 66th minute but their ill-discipline returned when the replacement back-rower Abraham Steyn was sent to the sin-bin for a dangerous tip-tackleDamian Hoyland capitalised on a man advantage by rounding off a sweeping move to touch down in the corner with five minutes remaining before Italys Angelo Esposito completed the scoring with a consolation try out wideIt was very humid but we thought it was going to be worse Happy to play some good rugby in tough conditions, the Scotland captain, John Barclay, said",5
" We scored some good tries, let in a couple, but were pleased as it was our first outing in a few weeks",1
"Both sides will complete their tours with matches away to Australia and Fiji in the next two weeksIreland made a blistering start to their summer tour with an emphatic 55-19 victory over the US Eagles at Red Bull Arena in New Jersey Tries from Keith Earls (2), Jacob Stockdale, Niall Scannell, Kieran Marmion, Jack Conan, the debutant James Ryan, Luke McGrath and Simon Zebo did the damage, with the fly-half Joey Carbery adding four points from the boot",3
" Garry Ringrose added a solitary conversion with Rory Scannell, on his Test debut, kicking four pointsThe outclassed Eagles replied with tries from Nic Civetta, John Quill and Ryan Matyas with the former Connacht fly-half AJ MacGinty contributing four points from the kicking teeJoe Schmidts side had too much pace, power and precision for the Eagles, who are ranked 13 places below fourth-placed Ireland in the world rankings",3
 That gap in class was blatantly apparent throughout a frantic first half with the visitors bagging five tries to establish a 29-7 half-time lead,1
 Ireland added a further four tries after the break to seal a comfortable victory before they set off to Tokyo on Sunday for their two-Test series with 2019 World Cup pool opponents Japan,1
"Ross Cronj scored a try on his debutasSouth Africa returned to form with a 37-14 victory over an under-strength France in the first test at LoftusVersfeld The Springboks started nervously but scored four tries as centres Jesse Kriel and Jan Serfontein also crossed over, to go with a penalty try",2
" France, who had made 10 changes from the side that played Wales in their final Six Nations match in March, were in the game until the final quarter as centre Henry Chavancy and replacement scrum-half Baptiste Serin crossed the line for the visitors",1
"There were green shoots of recovery for the Boks after their disastrous 2016 season in a game watched by just 29,313 fans I am really pleased, we are moving in the right direction, the Springbok head coach, Allister Coetzee, said Its step one of 13 games this season but our attack, defence and kicking game were all good",3
"We are not there yet, we must acknowledge that the French played without a lot of their leading players and still put us under pressure attimesIsrael Folau and Henry Speight each scored two tries as Australia opened their season with a dominant 37-14 win over a gallant Fiji in MelbourneWarren Gatland and his players insist there is still plenty more to come after the British & Irish Lions revitalised their New Zealand tour prospects with a hard-fought 12-3 victory over the previously unbeaten Crusaders",3
" With the first Test looming on Saturday week, Gatland feels the outcome will give his squad belief that they can upset the All Blacks and take the three-Test series",1
"The most important thing was the result, said Gatland, admitting the last few days had been very tough following the teams midweek defeat to the Blues in Auckland",1
" Tonight was another step up but there is still a lot to work on This team was outstanding in training on Friday, the players looked sharp and I knew there would be a performance because they have had time to gel",2
The result was pretty important for us,1
 Theres been a lot of criticism and people have written the tour off already after two games Thats been challenging for all of us,2
 We need to stay strong in the group and keep the faith,1
 Weve always known about the quality of the players weve got and I just keep repeating myself that with more time together well be better,1
" Gatland then took a wry swipe at his critics: I hope we didnt disappoint any people tonight with the resultGatland also revealed he is planning to invite the tour captain, Sam Warburton, to prove his fitness against the Highlanders in Dunedin on Tuesday, with the Wales flanker having been sidelined for the past week with a strained ankle",2
" The Irish back-row forwards Sean OBrien and Peter OMahony were both praised by the head coach, who also hailed the impact of his bench replacementsThe England lock George Kruis, meanwhile, has suggested the Lions could do a lot worse than adopt a similarly aggressive defensive gameplan against the All Blacks",2
" We talk about how we want to be a brutal pack, a set-piece dominant pack",1
" I think today we showed good signs of that, said the Saracen That was a big test for us",2
 We knew it in the week and we trained hard for that They average 37 points a game so to concede only three is huge for us,2
 They have six internationals in that pack and we knew it would be a tasty game It got a little bit heated at times but we held our own and did a good job Were trying to come up with scenarios that on the pitch we can be unflappable,3
" Were taking steps in the right directionThe Crusaders coach, Scott Robertson, was not too impressed with the Lions attacking creativity  It wasnt a spectacle were normally used to but they got the job done  and reckons his All Black counterpart, Steve Hansen, will find ways to sidestep the touring teams committed defenceWe thought they were going to play that way and we couldnt negate that but Steve will do his homework, said Robertson, hailing Owen Farrell as the man the All Blacks will particularly need to counter",3
 Hes world-class and can see both the game and the space,1
 His skill execution of those flat kicks to the corner is something we need to look at,1
"Alfie Hewett became the first British winner of the mens wheelchair singles title at the French Open with a dramatic victory over the defending champion, Gustavo Fernndez The 19-year-old from Norwich lost the first eight games and saved two match points in the second-set tie-break before going on to win 0-6, 7-6 (11-9), 6-2",2
"I played him a week and a half ago in another final and I was 6-0, 3-0 down, and when it went 6-0, 2-0 this time I was thinking: Oh no, here we go again, Hewett said But I remembered coming back that time so I knew I could come back When it got to that tie-break, it was very up and down, he had I dont know how many match points, I had set points",3
Mentally that was a big positive for me to just keep in there and hold out I felt good after I won that second set,2
" I knew I needed to get off to a good start in the third and when that happened I just grew in confidenceHewett showed his nerves in the first set, making far too many errors as his Argentinian opponent clinched the set in 17 minutes The British player, ranked seventh, finally got on the board in the third game of the second set and it was nip and tuck after he fought back from 3-1 to make it 3-3",3
" The tie-break proved to be the decisive moment, with Fernndez, who beat Scotlands Gordon Reid in last years final, unable to take either of his two chancesHewett carried his momentum into the third set to add his first grand slam singles title to double Paralympic silver from Rio last summer and a Wimbledon doubles title There were a few tears but no great outpouring of emotion from Hewett who had a doubles final to come after with Reid",3
" The British pair went on to lose against Frances Stphane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer 6-4 6-3Celebrations on Saturday night will be limited to a pizza before he heads home to see his parents, brother and sister, who were following from the UKI cant imagine what they were feeling in that second set tie-break, said Hewett Ive always believed I can beat anyone on my day Clay is one of my favourite surfaces",5
" Norwich only has about three clay courts but theres something about it I loveI had a good feeling about this week This time last year I was outside the top 10, hadnt really won anything",3
" A year on Ive got two silver medals, Wimbledon doubles champion and now singles grand slam at Roland Garros I cant believe itThe Cleveland Cavaliers are still the NBAs current champion with essentially the same team from last years title and it was particularly cruel they had to spend three days at home enduring a debate about whether these Golden State Warriors are the greatest team ever What happened Friday night with Clevelands 137-116 Game 4 trampling of the Warriors shouldnt be a surpriseDid everyone really think Golden State  as good as they have played  are that much better than the Cavs?The Warriors might have two of the games three top players, but LeBron James is still the best of his generation",5
" And though he tried to pretend late Friday night that he missed all the chatter of about Golden States historical brilliance, he certainly picked up enough to carry a grudge as big as the arena into Game 4Some of the other guys heard it and told me that they wanted to celebrate on our floor once again and they wanted to spray champagne in our locker room, said James, who seemed specific on details despite his protests that he wasnt listening to the talk about Golden States dominanceHe even had an obvious culprit",3
"I think it came from (Warriors forward) Draymond (Green), James addedThe most honest words uttered so far in these finals came from Cavs guard Kyrie Irving who said: We see everything, Ill be sitting up here lying (if I said) we didnt see it",2
If there is one truth about todays NBA players its that they read and hear every word said about them Players are constantly griping about seemingly innocuous lines from weeks-old stories or stray comments thrown out on radio shows,2
" The idea they slip themselves into cocoons, blacking out a media world swirling around them, is a farce",1
 What they dont see on their computers or glimpse on television is fed to them by an armada of sycophants eager to deliver any news that might catch the players attention,1
"In other words, the Cavs  who still possess the most recent Larry OBrien trophy  were well-aware that the Warriors have become the Showtime Lakers, Jordan Bulls and 1960s Celtics all in one They also heard a lot of talk about how they were going to lose these finals in four games and that they were done as any real championship contender for the next few yearsWhen asked what part of the Warriors talk upset him most, Irving said:All of itIts part of the game, I understand that, he added But we knew what we were faced with, thats what it was",5
" But then you add, of course, some chatter out there and that adds some extra motivation",1
 And you give us a day in between and we were ready to come out - especially me because that taste wouldnt have been the same if we would have lost tonight and they would have celebrated on our home floor,1
" So Ill just leave it at thatThe Warriors are a great team, they are probably the best team the league has seen in 20 years They set the NBA record for regular-season wins last year and then got even better this year by adding Kevin Durant Heading into Friday night, they had stormed through the playoffs with 15 straight victories, 30 wins in 31 overall, and it was plausible for people to wonder if they could become the first team to go 16-0 in a postseasonThey are all but certain to win these finals",5
" While last years team blew a 3-1 lead to these same Cavaliers in a similar situation (with two of the next three games in Oakland), the fact Golden State won Wednesdays Game 3 makes everything different There is a big difference between going up 3-0 in a series as the Warriors did this year as opposed to losing Game 3 as they did last spring and having to fight back to go up 3-1 Golden State are too good to lose four straight to Cleveland The Cavs arent strong enough defensively to stop this Warriors team They have too many weapons",5
"But this expectation that Golden State were going to sweep Cleveland always seemed far-fetched Remember, the Warriors  for all their dominance this spring were down 25 points to San Antonio in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals and came back to win only after Spurs star Kawhi Leonard was knocked out of the series with a sprained ankle Golden State probably would have won that series even if Leonard hadnt been hurt, though it would have been more of a grind",3
" And there wouldnt have been any talk about the Warriors being the best team everA lot went against the Warriors on Friday The crowd was extra loud, there were several early fouls called on the Golden State players that seemed to upset them and the Cavs hit 53% of their three-point attempts",3
" They even feared they had lost Green for Game 5 for a second straight year when he appeared to draw his second technical and an automatic ejection, but the officials later said they had given Greens first technical on Friday to Warriors coach Steve Kerr A huge break for Golden StateBut Game 4 was about the leagues current champion refusing to cede historic greatness to a team they beat last spring",3
"They were aggressive, you have to give them some credit, said Green, who nonetheless still complained that so many Warriors were in early foul trouble that they couldnt be as aggressive as they wantedTheres still some pride in ClevelandStill not very pretty, but mightily effective against Super Rugbys only unbeaten team this year  and as Warren Gatland said: We needed that, didnt we? He has repeatedly claimed that only the Test series matters, but while there was palpable relief on his face after the criticism that followed the Blues defeat, you get the feeling he had targeted this match as the opportunity for the Lions to announce their arrival",3
" Certainly they had a far more cohesive gameplan  with aggressive, suffocating defence at its heart  and his side were far more composed, finishing aside Mako Vunipolas apparent ambivalence towards the haka summed up the Lions refusal to be cowedConor Murray and Owen Farrell dovetailed at half-back as well as Gatland and his coaches could have wished",3
" Farrell scored all the points and his kicking from hand was superb One effort stood out in particular, pegging the Crusaders back in their right corner, and Murray was equally effective with the boot The Lions were deep in their own 22 at one stage in the second half and two box-kicks later  the second a beauty  and the Crusaders had a lineout near their own line The All Blacks will ruthlessly punish aimless kicking, but it can be a powerful weapon for the Lions when they are on the moneyIf there is one man who perhaps deserves more plaudits than Owen Farrell, it is his dad, Andy, who addressed the squad after the Blues defeat to lament their ill-discipline",5
" Against the Crusaders, they conceded seven penalties  compared with 13 last Wednesday  and their ferocious line speed ensured their hosts could not get the ball wide as much as they would have hoped Vunipola and George Kruis were excellent, but, more importantly, the pack, as a unit, was defensively superb",2
" On the odd occasion the Crusaders broke through, the Lions scrambled well, and the set-piece was largely on top against a number of All Blacks forwards, who seemed to struggle with Mathieu Raynals officiatingIt is undoubtedly encouraging that the Lions created far more opportunities than in their two previous matches, but it is still a concern that they are not taking them; it is now two tries in 240 minutes Early on, Jonathan Davies had the chance to put George North clear on the right, and Stuart Hogg might have released Liam Williams on the left",3
" In the second half, a better pass from the otherwise impressive Ben Teo would have put Williams away on the left, while CJ Standers knock-on after Anthony Watsons break was horrible Their opponents deserve plenty of credit for their last line of defence, but while it worked against the Crusaders, the Lions  to paraphrase Sean Connery  will not beat the All Blacks by bringing penalties to a try fightGatland has been lukewarm to the idea of playing Jonathan Sexton and Farrell together, but with the Ireland fly-half finding his best form from the bench, we may well see them paired together against the Maori All Blacks next Saturday",3
" With Teo also on the pitch, interchanging with Farrell, it made for a robust midfield and the Lions benefited from having two playmakers Indeed, their ability to adapt after losing Davies and Hogg in the first half was impressive, and the back-line that ended the match may well start the first Test It would be bold to start Watson at full-back, but the others now have it all to do against the Highlanders on Tuesday if they are to make the Test XV",3
"For much of this season, Dustin Johnsons dominance was such that the Masters and US Open looked like a race for second If the world No1s nonparticipation at Augusta was the result of a freak domestic accident, recent returns of 12th, 13th and a missed cut means suddenly Johnson does not seem quite so imperiousWhile he will understandably have a successful defence of the US Open from Thursday as prime motivation, the other leading lights have been afforded hope at Erin Hills in Wisconsin",3
" In a nod towards the past three champions, Johnson will have Jordan Spieth and Martin Kaymer for company in rounds one and twoUnlike Johnson and the vast majority of the field, Spieth has playing experience of the course  from the US Amateur Championship",2
"I know nothing about it, said Johnson Before I injured myself, I was playing really well Everything was just really solid",3
" But its getting back to where I feel like where Im getting a lot more comfortable and a lot more confident in the game I feel like the game, as far as from last year to this year, is not really much different",2
Fascination elsewhere will surround how Rory McIlroy fares at a course that may well suit his game but who is returning from an enforced break after the recurrence of a rib problem McIlroy is one of precious few players in recent times to destroy a US Open venue  but this tends to be the most attritional major of them all,2
"Erin Hills will be subject to intense scrutiny, as will those who preside over the second major of the year It is a new venue for the championship, which need not be a remarkable factor but the criticism of Chambers Bay in 2015, added to the rules fiasco that overshadowed Johnsons success last year, means the United States Golf Association is in need of positive publicityTheyve taken criticism for the last two years, Im sure theyre not liking it, said Adam Scott, the 2013 Masters champion Theyre going to have to try to run a really good event The ball is in their court; they control it all",5
" Hopefully, they get it right this time, just from a playability standpoint Lets just have something thats a challenge and interesting, not just playing brutal golfThe early indications are not particularly good; the USGA has published a supposedly full tournament draw that includes a batch of to-be-decided player times",3
 Phil Mickelson has been included despite saying he will attend his daughters high school graduation in San Diego on Thursday lunchtime,1
" Handily, Mickelson has been given an afternoon slot for round one; his participation would become feasible in the event of a lengthy weather delayMike Davis, the USGAs executive director, denies the widespread theory that manufactured scoring is high on his organisations agenda We dont even talk about it, he said",3
" What we do talk about is making sure we can adjust the course to, say, if theres soft conditions; maybe we tuck a hole location a little bit more versus if we get real firm conditions and it gets windyWere then sitting there talking among ourselves saying how do we tone this thing down, how do we slow the greens, get some more water on them, whatever the case may be",2
" It really isnt about the score, its about just setting the course up properlyJeonju is eight time zones away from Cobham and when Dominic Solanke broke through the middle before cracking his second goal past the Italy goalkeeper, Andrea Zaccagno, on Thursday his former place of employment could hardly have seemed at a further remove Solanke ended up sitting out this season at Chelsea after talks over a new contract broke down, early hopes of challenging for a first-team place fizzling into a limbo of training sessions and a handful of under-23 fixtures as it became clear he would not be considered for selectionA move to Liverpool was finalised last month; he had been in danger of fading from view but now he will lead the line in Englands Under-20 World Cup final against Venezuela on Sunday as they seek an achievement that has no parallel in this country in the past half-centurySolanke has learned the virtues of perseverance and there may be those inside Chelseas set-up who wonder whether the club should have stuck things out a little longer themselves",5
" He joined the club at the age of eight and with starring roles in FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League titles behind him  not to mention the near-obligatory season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem  his trajectory appeared setIt is rarely that simple for a 19-year-old attempting to break through at Stamford Bridge though and Solanke is hardly the first to seek an alternative path Liverpool will be a fresh start with, should all go to plan, a clearer route by which to make up for lost time",3
"Give or take the finer details, Solankes was a depressingly familiar situation among English players of a similar age Perhaps that will change if the Under-20s win their first final at this tournament and there is a sense that the current crop have a momentum that previous generations found hard to musterWe knew that weve got a winning bunch of players and weve got to repeat that, Solanke said after that 3-1 semi-final win over Italy, referencing the Uefa Under-17 Championship title the core of the squad won together in 2014",3
"Solanke scored Englands goal in the final against Holland, which was decided on penalties; it appears not to have been a flash in the pan and when the players return for pre-season with their clubs  all bar four in the top flight  scrutiny over their use and treatment can be expected to intensify",1
"The cautious conclusion in Solankes case is that, whether or not England win the trophy and regardless of whether he scores the two goals that would almost certainly win the golden boot award outright, the tools are in place for the Premier LeagueHe has won admiration from those who have seen him work up close  particularly the Under-20s manager, Paul Simpson  for the way he handled his exile at Chelsea and has grown into this World Cup after, perhaps understandably, looking a shade below his best in his first two gamesStyle wise, Solanke is a rangy figure who, rather than appearing awkward, has the strength and awareness to threaten when playing up against defenders or in deeper areas",3
" He needs to be playing regularly at a high level now; so, too, do team-mates such as the Everton forward Ademola Lookman and the Bournemouth midfielder Lewis CookIf a lack of success in high-pressure situations has contributed to English clubs caution towards using young players, will an unprecedented victory this summer bring a change in mindset?Venezuela need to be negotiated first and that, despite the countrys lack of presence as a power at senior level, is far from assuredEngland will have the benefit of freshness after their opponents required extra-time to win all three of their knock-out games, but they will have to be wary of the forward Adalberto Pearanda  who is on Watfords books and has trodden a familiar-looking path in spells at Granada and Udinese  as well as Sergio Crdova, whose four-goal tally equals that of Solanke",3
"They are highly dangerous players but Englands biggest challenge may lie more in the mind  a situation that their distance from home, with few fans and media scrambling to make the 11-hour flight at short notice, perhaps improves",1
" Interest and pressure may be ramping up before a first World Cup final at any significant level since 1966, but they are conveniently isolatedEveryones going to be rooting for us back home so hopefully we can make them proud, Solanke said",2
" If England do, their centre-forward might consider that those months on the sidelines were eventually well worth it Chelsea, on the other hand, may feel precisely the opposite is true for themEvery successful Lions tour needs a rallying cry and remember Christchurch will now be the mantra of the 2017 expedition New Zealanders, at the very least, will have to readjust their opinion of the supposed lightweights in their midst The Lions gave easily their best performance so far, brushing aside disruptive backline injuries and local scepticism to confound those who felt they might not win another fixture on this trip",5
"More than that, they breathed fresh life into this Lions enterprise, which would have struggled to escape a litany of gloomy provincial defeats Their collective intensity and controlled physicality was right up where it needed to be and the victory margin could have been considerably wider Four penalties from Owen Farrell ultimately proved sufficient in a try-less contest but it was the forwards who laid the foundations",3
" Against an opposing pack containing six All Blacks, there was a discernible edge lacking from the initial two matches in Whangarei and AucklandMaybe it would have emerged in the Tests regardless but the Lions management now have first-hand evidence that even New Zealands leading provincial side, top of the Super Rugby standings and averaging 37 points per game, can have their attacking brilliance squeezed out of them",2
" Here, broadly speaking, is surely the blueprint of how the All Blacks can be upsetHad the Lions not lost Stuart Hogg and Jonathan Davies to head injuries inside the first half-hour and not let three potential try-scoring chances slip away it might have been even more convincing As it was Farrell and Conor Murray exerted impressive tactical control behind a pack that at last showed signs of living up to its advertised potential",3
" George Kruis, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola, Peter OMahony and Sean OBrien did not feature in everyones starting Test XV before the tour started, but along with Tadhg Furlong, Alun Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau they all enhanced their reputations in these partsIt was a cracking encounter from start to finish, with the sides fully committed and pumped up on a cold evening Two Farrell penalties gave the Lions an early advantage and their biggest early concern was the stray elbow from the otherwise excellent Murray that inadvertently struck his own full-back and forced the bloodied Hogg from the field",3
The Lions backline resources were further stretched when Davies was led away for a head injury assessment at the request of medical staff,1
" Jonathan Sexton came on at 10, Farrell switched to 12 and Watson came on at full-back, an illustration of the Lions range of options and the versatility that Warren Gatland has deliberately opted forLuckily their forwards already had the bit between their teeth with the home side, not helped by a slightly slippery, dew-laden ball, initially struggling to claim restarts and losing their first three lineouts The Lions also had some joy in the scrums against an all-international front row, aside from one backpedalling loss of control that resulted in a mass scuffle and a penalty to the Crusaders, who had won all of their 17 games this year",3
"For a brief moment, as Murray burst away upfield with the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, playing advantage, it seemed as if the Lions might be looking at a hefty interval advantage but an attempted pass off the floor by Jones found a lurking Crusader instead of one of his own team-mates The visitors were slightly fortunate to concede just three points from the resultant intense period of pressure close to their own lineTheir 9-3 half-time advantage, however, was thoroughly merited and would have been extended had Farrell been awarded a 40-metre penalty he felt had sailed over but was ruled out by the referees assistants",3
"The Lions wasted another points-scoring opportunity when a poor right to left pass from Ben Teo made life unnecessarily hard for Liam Williams outside of him CJ Stander also spilt a glorious chance after Watson had broken clear and split the defence wide openIn the final analysis it mattered not, with a fourth Farrell penalty in the 70th minute giving New Zealanders further food for thought with the first Test at Eden Park a fortnight away",3
"What a contest that will be if the All Blacks can be hassled and harried defensively, given scant time to think and repeatedly turned by the pinpoint kicking of Murray and Farrell Despite having not operated in tandem in training, the Sexton-Farrell axis at 10 and 12 went reasonably well without dispelling the sense Gatland will opt for a bigger ball-carrier at inside centre Teo, that one stray pass apart, had another good game and the increasingly confident Watson may also have played himself into the Test 23Among the other interesting conundrums is whether Sam Warburton, in line to return from a strained ankle against the Highlanders on Tuesday, has sufficient recent rugby in his legs to oust OBrien And who starts alongside Kruis, who must be a dead cert, in the second-row? Gatland still has some decisions to make but at least he now knows his best XV will be genuinely competitive",5
"A minor tremor measuring 42 on the Richter scale was felt in the stadium after the game; if the Lions keep improving, a major shock could yet await in the Test seriesCrusaders Dagg; Tamanivalu, Goodhue, Havili, Bridge (Bateman, 66); Mounga (Hunt, 74), Hall (Drummond, 62); Moody (Crockett, 51), Taylor (Funnell, 51), Franks (Alaalatoa, 51), Romano (Strange, 56), Whitelock (capt), Bedwell-Curtis (Brown, 62), Todd, Taufua Pen MoungaBritish & Irish Lions Hogg (Watson, 20); North, Davies (Sexton, 29), Teo, Williams; Farrell, Murray; Vunipola (McGrath, 62), George (Owens, 66), Furlong (Cole, 66), Jones (capt), Kruis (Itoje, 62), OMahony, OBrien (Stander, 56), Faletau Pens Farrell 4Referee Matheiu Raynal (Fr) Att 20,497 Match rating 8/10For Gareth Southgate there was progress of sorts",3
" It has taken some time to reach this stage but finally England have got to the point where the manager of the national team can go through an entire press conference without a single question about Wayne Rooney, former captainSeven months into the Southgate era a new team is taking shape minus the chap who has 119 caps and 53 goals for his country England, as Southgate said, need different leaders now, even if he is still going to great efforts not to alienate Rooney completely by naming a permanent captain Not yet, anywayFor the time being it will be Harry Kane leading out the team at Hampden Park when England and Scotland lock horns in their World Cup qualifying group",5
" Jordan Henderson, Gary Cahill and Joe Hart have all previously worn the armband under the new manager and, at some point, Southgate is going to have to be selfish and discount Rooneys feelings and decide which of the candidates deserves the role on a full-time basisEqually it is not difficult to see what Southgate is trying to achieve if the allegation against England is that when it comes to the crunch they lack genuine leadership and players who can cope when the pressure is dangerously close to intolerable Or as Steve Holland, Englands assistant manager, noted earlier this week about last summers Iceland debacle: Maybe you were in the stadium, or watching it on holiday like me, looking round at the players thinking: Bloody hell, theyve gone Where are the leaders? Where is the leadership? That is a pressure moment, so who is stepping forward? It looked to me like there was nobodyKane, ironically, was one of the players who crumbled, booed by the teams own supporters and warranting three out of ten in LEquipes ratings the next day",5
" One bad night, however, should not be held against him forever, especially when he has just won the Premier Leagues golden boot, and Southgate should probably not be criticised for devoting so much attention to his mission of developing more leaders within the group, with the emphasis on the plural",1
"That process took in a overnight trip to Woodbury Common last weekend when the players began their preparations for the Scotland game by mucking in with the Royal Marines Team-bonding, they call it, although Southgate was also reminded that, when Clive Woodward did the same with the England rugby team, one of the senior training instructors subsequently gave him a list of names as men we wouldnt go into battle with",2
"The feedback for Southgate was not quite so brutal  there was nobody they said shouldnt be on the journey with us, he clarified  and when it comes to Kane there was also the clear sense that the manager sees him as the kind of player who drives others on with his own abilityHis goals record over the last three seasons speaks for itself Even when we worked together at the under-21s, the quality of his finishing was clear",3
" You see the level of finishing from the likes of [Robbie] Fowler, [Paul] Scholes and [Alan] Shearer, and you could see that level from Harry from the first dayThere was the question of whether he could transfer that into matches because he wasnt playing for Spurs at the time, but hes done that now Hes always had the focus about being the best possible player and they are the attributes when you look at the really top playersBy Southgates own admission it is not an orthodox way for England teams to operate That, however, does not make it wrong",5
" Eventually I have to decide: OK, this is what were going to do, Southgate said But it is important to develop a group first I want a group of leaders",3
" Then, when weve got strength in various levels of leadership, everybody can see the importance of their role in the teamPlus Kane is another reminder, in a week when England have reached the final of the Under-20s World Cup, that England is capable of bringing through elite footballers",2
" Everybody knocks youth development, Southgate said Our coaching gets knocked, our youth development gets knocked, our young players get knocked but why shouldnt young English players be able to achieve?We have clubs searching the world to bring in young players, some of whom are outstanding but others who are maybe not as good as the players who are already there under the clubs noses",2
" And if weve got a team in a World Cup final at that age group, why are we looking around the world?When a furious Jordan Pickford conceded a goal during a training exercise with Englands Under-21s at St Georges Park this week, he whacked and burst one of the inflatable mannequins that had been put up to complicate the strikers route to goal",1
" I just dont like conceding, he explains with an endearing chuckle There was an obvious quip that could have been made about being accustomed to it after a campaign behind the dummies in Sunderlands defence but his clubs relegation is no light-hearted matter for the 23-year-oldPickford is still hurt by his hometown teams fall from the Premier League even if things are looking up for him personally, with his acclaimed performances throughout the season likely to result in offers from several top-flight clubs waiting for him when he gets back from this months European Under-21 Championship, from which he is confident of returning as a winner",3
"Its hard to take that I got relegated with Sunderland and itll always be hard to take but Im mentally strong, says Pickford, who has been on the clubs books since he was eight [The impact of relegation] is massive  40-odd people lost their jobs throughout the season and financially its not ideal for the whole club",2
" For me, having grown up and been there since I was a kid, seeing people youve known for a long time losing their jobs, its not nice But I feel like as a team and staff behind the scenes we did the best we could do and it was just unfortunate that we never got the results we neededOf course it was more than misfortune that caused Sunderland to finish bottom of the table but the failure was certainly not the fault of Pickford, whose excellence earned him a place on the shortlist for the PFA young player of the year award It is fair to say promoting Pickford to No1 rather than buying a more experienced goalkeeper when Sunderlands first choice, Vito Mannone, was injured in August was one of the few decisions David Moyes got right during a miserable campaignHe has been great, to give me that experience, says Pickford",5
" There was a lot of talk about certain keepers coming in, like Joe Hart, but the manager just brought in a No2/No3 [Mika, from Benfica] and gave me the opportunity It was top drawer, really I was a young lad thrown in at the deep end but I felt ready for it",3
"It would have been better if we had stayed up; my heart is massive towards the club Its a hard one, reallyHis description of how he became ready for it begins with a memory from his early childhood, when his brother Richard, six years his senior, would invite him to kickabouts with the instruction: Get on the tarmac and dive about lad",3
" He went on to hone his talent in the more formal surrounds of Sunderlands academy and then, after turning professional in 2011, spent loan stints at a variety of Football League clubs, most recently at Preston North End in the 2015-16 season, when he kept 14 clean sheets in 30 matches",1
" That was proving that I was good enough, he says with the confidence he has gained from working his way up steadily",1
"Another sign of that confidence, and his readiness, was the way he hollered instructions at veteran defenders as soon as he was thrust into Sunderlands first team Around the place Im just myself really but as soon as you cross that white line I feel its my job and Im here to do it and get the lads going, he says You dont do it nastily, you do it to help the lads in front of you and you know youre doing it when they look round and give you the thumbs up or, after the game, they bring up something youve done well and that youve saved a goal by talking",3
Pickford is all about the bottom line The saves he cherishes most are not the most acrobatic or difficult ones but the ones that matter most,2
" I go back to the [Peter] Schmeichel thing: you save it how you have to, any way that you can Technique goes out the window sometimes So his favourite stop in his career was the close-range one he made to prevent Leicester Citys Wes Morgan from equalising in the sixth minute of stoppage time at the Stadium of Light in December It wasnt an unbelievable save, it was just the timing of the game, he says A match-winning save and we thought that win might have got us going",5
"The win did not get Sunderland going  they were battered 3-0 by Swansea City a week later  but it lengthened Pickfords list of admirers Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea have been mentioned as potential destinations for him this summer",2
" He admits to being torn about the possibility of having to choose between staying at his hometown club or heading back up to the Premier League, where his talent suggests he belongs",1
" Ideally it would have been better if we had stayed up; my heart is massive towards the club, he says",1
" Its a hard one, really",1
" What will be will beHe has resolved not to think about it until after the European Championship England kick off their campaign on Friday against the holders, Sweden, before completing their group fixtures against Slovakia and the hosts, Poland",3
" The Euros is massive for me and a lot of the other players I dont want to be getting distracted and I am really excited for it We have got a chance to win it with the squad we have got We have come this far, we have to get out of the group first but we are capable of doing that easily We will see where we go from there",5
"One warm evening in the summer of 1971 I got home from work with a copy of the London evening paper in my hand Look, I told my girlfriend, it says here that the Lions are arriving at Heathrow tonight Lets go",3
" So we climbed into the car and drove out on the M4 to the airport We were not alone The arrivals hall was already packed  but with people who had arrived from the opposite direction, which meant from Wales",3
The singing had already begun,1
" Cwm Rhondda, of course, and much else, while we waited By the time the heroes had passed through the baggage hall and passport checks and started to emerge, people were standing on chairs and tables, creating an impromptu arenaLooks of astonishment crossed the players faces as they saw the welcome that awaited them",3
" One after another, each newly minted legend received his massive cheer John Dawes, the captain Gareth Edwards, the genius",3
" Barry John, the king",1
" Willie John McBride, the giant Ian McLauchlan, the mighty mouse",2
" Gerald Davies, the uncatchable",1
" John Taylor, the tackler JPR Williams, author of a crucial drop goal  the only one of his career  in the final match of the Test series And so on",3
" All of them cheered to the rafters  with the exception of David Duckham, the dashing blond England wing, who received a few good-natured Welsh boos for having displaced John Bevan, the 20-year-old Cardiff prodigy, in the last three TestsThe Lions had beaten the All Blacks in a series for the first and, so far, the only time They had been away for three months Their coach returned with them, too It was he who had persuaded McBride to change his mind about undertaking a fourth Lions tour and he who had coaxed a reluctant John  a native of the same mining village  into joining the party with the promise that he would not be subjected to an unduly rigorous training regime",5
" It was he who bent the Lions rules to allow Davies to fly out and join the party three weeks late, after taking his Cambridge tripos examsThat was Carwyn James, whose achievement in New Zealand remains unequalled by any of his successors At 41, and taking a chunk of unpaid time off from his day job as teacher of Welsh and head of rugby and cricket at Llandovery College, James was already a man of many facets, some of them seemingly contradictory: a lover of literature and the theatre, a deacon at his village chapel, a 40-a-day cigarette smoker fond of wine and gin, a compelling columnist (for this newspaper) and broadcaster, a solitary man yet a lover of company and stories and singing",3
" But, most of all, a rugby visionary beyond compareAlthough a confirmed Welsh nationalist who stood in the 1970 general election as a representative of Plaid Cymru, he viewed the task of coaching the Lions as one of reconciling the characteristics of the four nations And he did it his way, a way that persuaded the members of his squad to lay down their deep-rooted national rivalries Lasting friendships were formed that would have seemed impossible before the party assembled to listen to an introductory speech given by a coach known to the Welsh players for his prowess as a fly-half and later coach with Llanelli, but who was a complete unknown to othersYears later he put it this way: The very first thing I said to them was: Look here, be your own man",5
" I dont want Irishmen to pretend to be English, or Englishmen to be Celts, or Scotsmen to be anything less than Scots",1
" You each have an ultimate quality to give to the team and you must know that you are able to express yourself in your own special unique way, both on the field and off it",1
"I shall always remember his gentleness, McLauchlan once said",1
" In New Zealand he was dealing with a fairly rough bunch of blokes, but he never had to utter a harsh word and never had to raise his voice",1
" Our success was entirely due to himI thought of him this week when Eddie Jones, the England coach, spoke of making his players into participants rather than mere recipients, as if this were something new As John Spencer, the England centre who was a member of the 1971 party, said in a TV programme on James several years ago: One of his strengths was that he left a lot of the ideas to the members of the teamBut Spencer also called him a great organiser, and he was meticulous in his preparation An amateur in an amateur game, he brought a professionals commitment to the task as he assembled dossiers on their opponents, visited Matt Busby to talk about Manchester Uniteds training methods and called on Eric Ashton at Wigan to see how rugby leagues champions went about their work",5
"It was amusing to hear Sean Fitzpatrick, speaking in the aftermath of the 2017 tourists defeat by the Auckland Blues, suggesting that their task against the Crusaders on Saturday will be easier because therell be a lot more structure to the game  implying that spontaneity is alien to the Lions culture In 1971, James gave his players a structure within which their individual creativity could find its fullest expressionWhen it was all over, the defeated captain paid him a high compliment: He kept a unity that transferred itself to the pitch, the great Colin Meads said",3
" He did have stars, but no one could have coached the stars he had like Carwyn did",1
" He was judicious and scientific in his approach, in a way we hadnt seen in New Zealand beforeHonoured and fulfilled in many ways, rejected and isolated in others, he died of a heart attack in 1983, aged 53",2
" Now the many elements of his complicated life are explored in great depth and with exemplary sensitivity by Alun Gibbard in a new biography titled Into the Wind, whose English-language edition is published on Friday",1
"Speaking of Jamess love of the work of Federico Garca Lorca, Gibbard refers to the way in which the presence of the Spanish concept of duende within the poets work  a heightened state of emotion, expression and authenticity  found a resonance in the rugby coachs sensibility",1
" Duende might not be an ingredient of Warren Gatlands formula for this years Lions but, as much as anything else, it was what earned the 1971 team their heroes welcome home This article was amended on 13 June 2017",2
 An earlier version said Carwyn James was 31 when he took the Lions to New Zealand in 1971,1

" About the same time, four years ago, my gym introduced a new workout class called Zumba Id never done anything like it before: it was a fitness class, but it also introduced me to a new style of dance Now I drag myself out of bed every Sunday morning just for ZumbaIve been at my gym for 10 years and have tried pretty much every class going  Pilates, body conditioning, legs, bums and tums  but Zumba is top of my list Its a 45-minute fitness class where the instructor stands at the front of the studio and we all face her, shadowing her steps and movements",5

" As a regular, its enough time to practice and learn the sequences without getting bored Sometimes, Ill miss a step here or there, but it really doesnt matter: the steps are repeated, so you join back in when youre ready",2
"The music is as varied as the movement, with songs from different genres and from all over the world",1
" Whatever the style, the choreography suits it brilliantly, so you really get into it Some songs are slower, allowing you to take a bit of a breather, while others are fast, making for a high-intensity workout",2
" It can be hard work physically, but youre having so much fun, you dont notice youre burning calories",1
" Its the only group workout Ive done where pretty much everyone has a smile on their faceFavourite music to dance to? Latin American, such as reggaeton and salsaPost-Zumba recovery snack? I make protein shakes: peanut butter and banana is probably my favourite",3
"1 If youre feeling self-conscious about joining a class, but want to give it a go, there are lots of YouTube videos and Zumba DVDs, which are helpful for learning the basics Get some friends round and turn it into a party2 It doesnt matter how fit you are, or whether youve got an injury or a disability, Zumba can be adapted by the instructor according to your individual needs",3
"3 The most important thing is to feel comfortable, so wear something tight or baggy, plain or sparkly",1
" Trainers are also essential, because theres lots of high-impact jumping and twisting",1
"4 The most basic step thats used in a lot of tracks comes from salsa Step forward with your right foot, back with your left, then bring your right foot back to meet your left one, in a one-two-three rhythm5 Nowadays, its highly likely that any local leisure centre will offer Zumba classes; there will probably be a regular class in a local community hall, too",3

"The Cavaliers poured in a record-breaking 24 three-pointers to break the NBA finals record set by the Warriors in Sundays Game 2 They were led by LeBron James, who finished with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists for his ninth triple-double in NBA finals history, surpassing Magic Johnsons previous mark of eight",2
 No other player has more than two,1
"Its going to be even tougher in Game 5, but we look forward to the challenge, said James, who remains on pace to become the first player to average a triple-double over an entire finals We know its going to be very difficult, but if we can continue to not turn the ball over like weve done the last two games, if we can continue to defend and keep bodies on bodies, we give ourselves a good chance",2

"twittercom/qfR8u6ApKeKevin Love finished with 23 points, including six three-pointers, while JR Smith chipped in 15History would suggest Clevelands win only delays the inevitable: no team in NBA history has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit to win a playoff series in 126 previous tries",3
" But no team had ever won an NBA finals from 3-1 down until the Cavaliers pulled it off last year Now theyll look to repeat the feat starting with Game 5 on Monday night in Oakland Obviously the job is still far from over, said Kyrie Irving, who finished with a game-high 40 points",3
" This is a good startThe Cavaliers came out swinging in the opening minutes as Irving, Smith and Love drained long jumpers to open a 24-9 advantage, their largest lead of the series",2
 Thats when Golden State inserted Andre Iguodala for Zaza Pachulia for one of their vaunted death lineups The Warriors had settled down and slowly chipped away on 10 straight points from Durant that cut it to 31-25,2
"But the turnover-prone Warriors couldnt keep pace with the torrid shooting of the Cavaliers, who led 49-33 after 12 minutes, setting an NBA finals record for points in a quarter despite missing eight of their free throws  against a team thats as well-regarded defensively as any in the leagueJust one of those games, said Curry, who was held to 14 points on 4-of-13 shooting and went without a made basket until midway through the second quarter Not going to overreact to one",3
 Obviously I can play better and want to play better and will play better,1
"They played with their backs against the wall They had a free swing at it, and it was one of those nights where we just didnt have anything clickingThe Cavaliers extended their lead to 19 points early in the second, but Golden State cut it to 11 with James on the bench",3
" Then James returned and within three minutes the hot-shooting Irving and Smith stretched Clevelands lead to 69-49, prompting a timeout from Golden State coach Steve Kerr that saw the Warriors hanging their heads as they retreated to the benchCleveland led by as many as 22 points during a record-breaking first half that saw them connect on 609% of their shots including 13-for-22 from beyond the arc",3
" When the dust cleared the Cavaliers led 86-68 and had set the all-time playoff record for points in a halfIt was often physical and fraught with hostility: including seven technical fouls, a flagrant and a heated exchange of words between James and Durant, who finished with a team-high 35 points",2
" At one point it appeared Draymond Green had been ejected for picking up a second technical foul, but he was allowed to remain in the game when officials said the first had been called on Kerr and mistakenly recorded in the box score to the Warriors forward",1
"Golden State chipped away methodically during the third quarter, getting as close as 104-92 with 2:38 remaining",1
" But Kyle Korver, Deron Williams and James added three-pointers before the end of the frame, stretching the lead back to 19 points and giving Cleveland the record before the fourth quarter had even started",1
"But the Warriors could not get within single digits of Cleveland throughout the second half, prompting renewed optimism amid the sellout crowd of 20,562, who chanted Cavs in seven! in the dying minutesWe have championship DNA as well, said James, who surpassed Michael Jordan for No3 on the all-time finals scoring list We just kept our composure",3
" We shared the ball, we moved the ball and defensively we were physical",1
"The result cost the Warriors, winners of 30 of their last 31 games extending back to the regular season, a chance at the NBAs first ever flawless playoff run Instead, theyll try to join the select list of one-loss champions: the 2001 Los Angeles Lakers (15-1) and 1983 Philadelphia 76ers (12-1)(16-0) would have mattered but thats gone now, said Klay Thompson, who finished with 13 points",3
" But 16-1 sounds pretty goodTrainer form is a tricky beast When David Simcock saddled the second and third in the Lockinge three weeks ago it looked as if the Newmarket man had probably overcome his slow start to the season and was now worth following but, almost a month later, he is still struggling along on a low strike-rate",3
"Breton Rock, one of his Lockinge heroes, is the likely favourite for todays John of Gaunt Stakes at Haydock and the veteran should be suited by the likely squelch underfoot But it is not comfortable being on favourites from his yard in competitive races just nowMitchum Swagger (4",3

"00 Court Minstrel 730 Cobra De Mai 800 Optimistic Bias 830 Defining Year 900 No Hiding PlaceIf Eddie Jones, assessing the situation in the expected cauldron of 25,000 locals raging beneath the Andes, decides to empty his bench  and he usually does  England will blood more new caps in this first Test against Argentina than they have since 1947",5
The coach has selected 11 fresh faces in his squad of 23,1
" Seventy years ago, England fielded 14 because they had to",1
" It was their first Test since the hiatus in international rugby that was the Second World War This time the circumstances are only slightly less compelling Jones has precious little choice with 30 players unavailable for this first Test, of two, in the city of San Juan, 1,000km inland from Buenos Aires, wedged up against the Andes and Chile beyond",3
"It is not the All Blacks at Eden Park, but Argentina in Argentina is about as intense a furnace in which to forge new players as Jones could have chosen Its one of the greatest challenges in world rugby, he said with the grin that assures he is delighted with the situation Everyone is nice to you and everyone smiles, yes sir, what would you like sir? And then comes the game",3
 Bang Its on Thats the difference here,3
"Tom Curry is the headline selection, the Sale flanker set to become Englands youngest debutant  at just shy of 19  since Jonny Wilkinson was introduced in 1998, a couple of months before Curry was born",1
 Wilkinson came on as a winger for the last few minutes of a comfortable win against Ireland; Curry is going to have to mix it from the start with a pack of Pumas,1
" Hes Englands youngest starter for 90 yearsThe reception on the pitch will be ferocious, as will the backdrop",2
" The Estadio San Juan de Bicentenario is a sell-out, and the locals, whatever the sport, do not enter an arena anything less than well up for it When we come to these provinces the people are fanatics, says Martin Landajo, the Argentina scrum-half The Argentinian crowd is like a football crowd",3
" They will insult you, shout offensive things",1
 It is not the same as England where you have the people sitting together and nothing happens If you are a bit cheeky they may do something to you,2
"Fortunately, Curry, whose identical twin, Ben, is also on tour, seems a well brought-up fellow At the other end of the experience spectrum, Dylan Hartley, on 84 caps, is sharing with him",2
" He describes Curry as a studious room-mate who does his stretches every day and rings his mum Such conscientiousness will have to be enhanced on Saturday by something more elemental, but Jones and Hartley have great faith in their young chargesThe opposition are more of a known quantity than Englands thrown-together XV, which includes three other new caps in Harry Williams, Mark Wilson and Alex Lozowski",3
" Another five have fewer than a dozen caps each Argentina boast 528, spread more evenly throughout their XV than Englands 345, 215 of which are shared between Hartley, Danny Care and Mike Brown",2
"The Pumas squad is entirely taken from the Jaguares, Argentinas sole team in Super Rugby They are the only other international side whose selection policy is as strict as the All Blacks, so some of their best players are ineligible",2
" The Jaguares have graced the Super 18 with some fabulous play but a consistent winning formula remains elusive In this, their second season, they won four of their first five matches, then lost six of the next seven",2
"For now, the nascent arrangement between the Jaguares and Pumas is clearly unsatisfactory, the two sides essentially the same, but it has introduced the players to the rigours of regular professionalism",1
" In the future it will help us, says LandajoHe expects the dynamic of international rugby to galvanise the Pumas Jaguares is more like a job; this is our passion",3
"Jones considers this the perfect challenge by which to test his youngsters, even if he knows patience will be required You dont expect them to be world beaters on their first start",2
 It is a process I remember giving Matt Giteau his debut [for Australia] He was terrible,3
" He dropped the first ball, threw two bounce passes and was absolute rubbish Second Test he was a little bit better and then his career blossomedWords of assurance, perhaps, for Lozowski, who starts at inside centre",3
" But for Williams, who makes his debut via a colourful route that took in a degree in English and sports science, a healthy social life, a stint as a pro with Jersey before winding up as a Premiership champion with Exeter last month, and his fellow prop, Ellis Genge, on one cap, the proposition is more brutalJones, enjoying a similarly healthy social life, took a trip to Argentina when he was a teenager himself in 1979 I remember the Australian scrum getting pushed back",3
 You could see the tractor marks in the ground That was when the bajada was at its peakThe bajada is the scrummaging technique around which Argentina built their first great side in the 70s and 80s,3
" It was belligerent, focused and unrelenting Few could deal with itWe live in more enlightened times now, wherein Pumas are seen running with the ball, but that primal threat remains integral to Argentinian rugby",3
" For rugby boys, Argentina in Argentina is an initiation ceremony without equal Englands mission is to emerge from Saturdays inferno with a few more fully formed men",2
Ola Toivonen took advantage of a Hugo Lloris error to score an injury-time winner from inside his own half as Sweden beat France in their World Cup qualifier in Stockholm,1
"The Toulouse midfielder collected a low clearance from Lloris close to the halfway line and clinically lifted the ball into the unguarded net to earn a 2-1 victory that leaves Sweden top of Group A in qualifying for next years World Cup in RussiaFrance, who are second to Sweden on goal difference, took the lead through Olivier Girouds superb left-footed volley after 37 minutes, only for Jimmy Durmaz to equalise for Sweden just before half-time",2
"Holland moved to within three points of the top two with a 5-0 win over Luxembourg in Rotterdam Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder gave the hosts a 2-0 lead at half-time, with Liverpools Gini Wijnaldum and Tottenhams Vincent Janssen on target in the second half Bulgaria lost ground in the race for top spot, falling to fourth in the group after losing 2-1 in Belarus",3
"In Group B Marc Rebes first-half header earned Andorra their first competitive victory since 2004 as they beat Hungary 1-0 The tiny nations first qualifying success since a 1-0 win over Macedonia 13 years ago was also a humiliating setback for the visitors, who topped their group at last summers European Championship but are now eight points adrift of second-placed Portugal",2
"Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for the Euro 2016 winners as they won 3-0 in Latvia to keep up their pursuit of Group B leaders Switzerland Goals from Arsenals Granit Xhaka and Stoke Citys Xherdan Shaqiri earned Switzerland a 2-0 win against the Faroe Islands which extends their 100% start in qualifying to six gamesIn Group H Dries Mertens and Nacer Chadli were on target for Belgium as they won 2-0 in Estonia Mertens opened the scoring after half an hour, turning the ball home after Mihkel Aksalu had spilled Kevin de Bruynes right-wing cross The hosts had Artjom Dmitrijev sent off just before half-time with the score at 1-0",5
" Elsewhere Gibraltar were denied a first-ever point in qualifying when Pieros Sotiriou scored the winner for Cyprus in the 87th minuteBelgium now lead their group by four points from Greece, who drew 0-0 with Bosnia-Herzegovina The Bosnia forward Edin Dzeko and his Roma team-mate Konstantinos Manolas were involved in an altercation after the final whistle following a bad-tempered contest in ZenicaThere have been some encouraging performances from Hull in the first half of this season but given the personnel Lee Radford had to make do without here, it is well within reason to suggest this was their performance of the campaign so farVictories at Salford are certainly not the formality they used to be",5
" In the space of eight months, the Red Devils have become one of the leagues most impressive sides, and they sit second in the table on merit as the season passes the halfway stage",1
"But, for a Hull side without four members of last seasons Super League Dream Team and their star half-back Marc Sneyd, this was an ideal way to prepare for next weekends eagerly-awaited Challenge Cup quarter-final with the leaders, Castleford We didnt fight as hard as we did last year in winning it to just give it away, said the Hull coach Radford, whose side moved back into the top four following this encouraging victory",2
"It would be foolish though to suggest Salford, one of the leagues real surprise packages this season, are on the slide following back-to-back defeats for the first time in 2017 They too have a cup quarter-final next weekend  but Ian Watsons side looked noticeably tired here",2
"Watson has been fortunate in that he has not had a plethora of injuries to contend with this term, but the effects of two double-header weekends in six weeks perhaps took their toll",1
" They taught us a bit of a lesson, he lamented afterwards",1
"The damage was done by the visitors in the first half They led 22-0 by the interval thanks to tries from Fetuli Talanoa, Danny Washbrook and two for the half-back Albert Kelly The Australians arrival from cross-city rivals Hull KR sparked some debate at the end of last season, but with 17 tries in 16 games so far in a Hull shirt, he has proven an inspired signing",3
"Hes a gambler but hes talented, Radford said of Kelly Hull were able to rest him in the final quarter, and while Salford were much improved after the break, tries from Niall Evalds and Weller Hauraki were mere consolation, especially with the visitors responding via Carlos Tuimavave and Jamie Shaul to round off a performance that puts them in good shape for next weekends tie with the league leadersSalford: OBrien; Bibby, Welham, Sau, Evalds; Lui, Dobson; Tasi, Brining, Hasson, Murdoch-Masila, Hauraki, Griffin",3
" Interchange Kopczak, Krasniqi, Carney, Lannon",1

" Interchange Fash, Matongo, Downs, Griffin Tries Talanoa, Kelly 2, Washbrook, Tuimavave, Shaul",2
" Goals Connor 5 Referee: B ThalerOn the basis that if even Gordon Strachan had abandoned hope of Scotland defeating England then the fixture would be pointless, perhaps the managers faith is understandable",3
" History, recent and distant, is hardly in Strachans favour: Scotland have beaten England six times in 50 years and taken seven points from five matches in the latest quest to end a miserable absence from major championshipsI dont think this is a free hit, I really dont think its like that, said Strachan I genuinely believe we can win the game, I really do Id be really disappointed if we didnt get anything from the gamePressed on what possible evidence Strachan had for this bullish approach, he referenced the 3-0 loss at Wembley in November",5
" Scotlands showing there has routinely been worthy of more praise than is valid mainly from the managerI take stuff from the last England game, where we would all agree that there was nothing happening and we were comfortable and doing a lot of things we had worked on, Strachan explained",2
" We get a couple of chances, we dont take them, we could have been in the lead If big Grant Hanley was playing regularly, he would have put that header in the back of the net and then Gary Cahill loops one inThats how close we were, so I take that Then I take the training, the enthusiasm of the training, and what the guys who have had a good season are bringing to the group, all that adds up to feeling goodIf Scotland are to lose  and the manner of defeat may be more significant than whether it happens  further pressure will surround Strachans position",5
" There is a genuine possibility this could be his last match in charge despite, contrary to reports this week, the Scottish Football Association having no shortlist of alternative candidates",1
" Strachan desperately needs a marquee result such as victory over the Auld Enemy to back up regular claims of progressStrachan, as is typical, swatted aside any discussion of this game being crucial to his own situation",2
" Im OK Im fine, he said",2
 Funnily enough I want to win for everyone bar myself So were looking after one another,2
"Englands record, of an unbeaten qualifying run that stretches to 34 games, is not lost on the Scotland manager but does not seem to be a source of fear",1
"I know for a fact that playing for England brings it own stresses and pressures, he said Thats what they have to deal with and so far they have dealt with it well",2
 Im sure they would have liked to do better at tournaments but qualifying has been terrific We said getting second would be fine and its still the target,2
Strachan is believed to have considered a three-man defence as the most legitimate means of handling England but may feel he lacks the resources to deploy that formation,1
" His two most serious calls would appear to be in the wide right attacking position  where James Forrest and Ryan Fraser are candidates to play and at centre-forward, with Leigh Griffiths and Chris Martin the options Martins late goal against Slovenia in March kept alive faint hopes of Scotland featuring in next summers World CupCraig Gordon, who will start in goal for the hosts, will not lack motivation for a potential meeting with Jermain Defoe",3
" When at Sunderland in 2009, Gordon was involved in a clash with Defoe, then of Tottenham Hotspur, which resulted in the goalkeeper sustaining a broken armI wasnt pleased with the challenge, said Gordon",2
 It was a long time ago and these things happen in football There is no way it will have any bearing on this match I went out to dive at his feet It was a challenge where he kicked my arm and broke it He tried to make contact after the game but I wasnt interested in speaking to him,5
" He did try, to be fair to himIt had a lot of impact on the progress I was making in my career at that time When something as bad as that happens to you in your career  and because of the problems I had after, re-breaking it, Ive still got the metal work in there from the three operations I needed to fix it  then its obviously going to stick with you a bit",3
" Lets just hope he doesnt scoreOne quirk of previous encounters may be on Strachans side: the presence of his opposite number, Gareth Southgate, in the England team for the visit of Scotland in 1999 was sufficient for Don Hutchison to be belatedly drafted into the visiting lineup at Wembley Hutchison scored to secure Scotland a 1-0 win",3
"It is when Dele Alli pulls up his chair and starts to reminisce about his younger days that it becomes apparent, contrary to the image he may project, it has not been an entirely seamless rise to put him the position where he is today  a footballer of rare quality, England international, superstar in the makingTwo months after turning 21, he is thinking back to his days in the academy at Milton Keynes Dons, when he was trying to make a name for himself as a striker Just not very successfully, as it turned out, judging by his memories of being removed from the team and told he might have to think again",3
I was on the bench a lot in the under-13s and then the manager [Dan Micciche] took the decision to pull me back and put me just in front of the defence,1
" I wasnt as physically strong as the other boys at the age He said it was so I could get more space, so I didnt have to worry about the physical battles and could just focus on my strengths, which at the time were getting on the ball and passing",2
"The transition into a more attacking player came when he broke into the first team and, again, when he moved to Tottenham, where he recalls it feeling strange to be playing so high up the pitch again and the first call-up from England arrived after six Premier League appearances  a decision that prompted something close to ridicule at the timeRoy Hodgson might not have got everything right as England manager, but nobody should question why he fast-tracked the player who is now the subject of rumoured interest from some of Europes superpowers and has been named the Professional Footballers Association young player of the year for the past two seasons",2
" Yes, he was part of the England side that disintegrated against Iceland last summer but there can be no doubt he is one of the players Gareth Southgate wants to shape his team around Alli will win his 18th cap when England renew acquaintances with Scotland at Hampden Park and it does not need long in his company to realise he is perfectly at ease with his elevated new statusI heard someone use this line about something else  that its unbelievable, yet believable at the same time",3
" When its happening, there are moments when you cant believe this is happening, but then I think: Ive worked so hard for so long  so it is believable I wasnt expecting it to happen so quickly but you cant wait for time and when you get chucked in at the deep end you have to make sure you take the chanceHe sounds supremely confident but grounded, too, smiling shyly when it is pointed out he has a better goals and assists record than Paul Scholes or Steven Gerrard at the same age and noting he has a lot to achieve before I can start thinking Im as good as them",3
" Later he chastises himself for starting last season slowly  a hangover, he says, from the clubs unsuccessful pursuit of Leicester City and the ordeal of Euro 2016, a tournament he would sooner forgetIt wasnt really until I come back here [with England], and Gareth coming in, that Ive even talked about it, he says of that Iceland game Until then you dont really want to talk about it, or even think about it, because its such a hard thing It still makes your heart go and, even now, you get a lump in your throat but its important, as a team, that when something like that happens you need to go through it and see where we went wrong Im sure Gareth is aware of how hard it is to talk about it as players, with it being such a low point in our careers, but its important that we do go to those dark places",5
"His analysis of last season is that Spurs were phenomenal, even if they do not have any silverware to show for it, but it is tempting to wonder what he makes of the idea of a move abroad",1
" People get too worried about where they are going to end up sometimes, then lose focus on the journey and dont enjoy it",1
" Im signed to Tottenham and Im enjoying it Who knows where I am going to end up, whether I stay at Tottenham for the rest of my career or if I do happen to go somewhere else",2
" Im sure if it happens, if I do go somewhere else, it will be at a time when I think thats whats needed But I am just looking forward to enjoying the journey",2
"He is keeping his options open, in other words, but there is still plenty of time for all that when, lest it be forgotten, he will be one of the younger players on the pitch at Hampden Park, a game that leads to the inevitable question about whether someone with his temperament can be trusted to keep controlI know there are a lot of mixed opinions, but thats the player I am, he says When I was younger I always used to get into tackles and if Dan could see me losing my temper hed pull me off the pitch straight away and put me in the sin-bin Its something that has always been in my game and its not something Im looking to change Maybe if I didnt have that in my game I wouldnt have achieved as much as I have done so far at this age",5
" You dont want players to think they can walk all over you  its important you stand your groundThat, however, does not mean he is oblivious to the fact he has crossed the line in the past There are things I regret, like the West Brom one, he says, referring to the off-the-ball incident with Claudio Yacob that resulted in a retrospective three-match ban for violent conduct After that game I regretted it straight away It was one of those moments I have learned from and Ive not done anything like that again",5
There was also the challenge in the Europa League [a red-card tackle on Gents Brecht Dejaegere] I know it looked really bad  and it was a really bad tackle  but I also know I would never go out to hurt someone,2
 It was just a poorly timed tackle I apologised to the guy straight away,2
" To be doing a challenge like that is horrible Horrible for me as well, to think about it",2
 I apologised and felt sorry and Ive learnt from it; it was a mistake,1
Chris Coleman has admitted that the pain of losing 6-1 against Serbia five years ago will never leave him as the Wales manager returns to the country for a crucial World Cup qualifier in Belgrade with a warning for his players that they need to deal with a hostile atmosphere and those periods when their opponents are enjoying a power play,1
"Sitting third in Group D and trailing Serbia and the Republic of Ireland by four points with five matches remaining, Wales have little margin for error on Sunday night in Belgrade, where a defeat would leave their hopes of qualifying for next years World Cup finals in Russia hanging by a threadThe task is made considerably harder because Coleman will be without Gareth Bale, his most influential player, through suspension as well as Neil Taylor, who is serving a two-match ban",2
" To compound matters, Hal Robson-Kanu withdrew from the squad on Thursday and added his name to an injury list that includes James Collins, Andy King and Ben Woodburn, leaving Wales looking rather depleted, especially in attack",1
"Although Coleman refuses to be downbeat and remains sanguine about the teams prospects in Belgrade and beyond, he is prepared for the fact that Serbia will evoke some painful memories",1
 The Wales manager admitted that everything came flooding back when he paid a visit to the country in March,1
"It was only a recce but I had butterflies in my stomach: Here we go, I remember this place, Coleman said, recalling the chastening defeat in Novi Sad that led to many Wales supporters calling for his resignation I cant say this is another game in the group because its not for more than one reason And one of the reasons is that [game in 2012] I suffered there, we suffered there  and it was my fault That will never leave me",5
 Nor should it It will be like that if I went back to Belgrade with my wife for the weekendBut I cant wait for this game,3
" I know its going to be tough but I like meeting those challenges With Balo in the team or not, I cant guarantee a win And were desperate for a win But what we must do is perform We have to stand up to them and not go away with our tails between our legs having missed the game, because thats unacceptable",5
" I wont accept that, but I dont expect it from these players",1
" For some time now theyve stepped up to the markAlthough Coleman admitted Wales would miss the experience and knowhow the absent senior players could have provided, he pointed to the presence of Ashley Williams, the captain he described as a natural born leader, to set an example to others that they must do anything but turn away from the challenge",2
"Coleman added: You go to these places and its almost like theres a stage in the game where theres a power play All of a sudden, from wherever it comes, the crowd start getting really rowdy, the opposition up the tempo for five or 10 minutes and they bombard you",2

"Manchester Uniteds hopes of signing lvaro Morata have received a significant boost after the striker told Real Madrid he would like a move to Old Trafford However, negotiations between the clubs may not be straightforward because of friction relating to David de GeaUnited have frustrated Madrids attempts to sign the goalkeeper and fear the Spanish club will drive a hard bargain over Morata as a result",3
" The De Gea issue has led to a strained relationship in the past, with a proposed move breaking down in 2015",1
"United are not willing to pay more than around 60m for Morata, who is optimistic a deal can be struck",1
 The 24-year-old is due to go on honeymoon in just over a week and would like the transfer to be concluded before thenZlatan Ibrahimovics release by United was confirmed on Friday and Jos Mourinho wants to secure a replacement striker as swiftly as possible The manager worked with Morata at Madrid and has made the Spain international his principal target,3
" United had an opening offer of 52m turned down this week by Madrid, who held talks with Moratas representative, Juanma Lpez, on Friday",1
"Lpez is understood to have informed Madrids general director, Jos ngel Snchez, that the player who scored 20 goals in all competitions this season has decided to leave in search of regular first-team football Morata, who came through Madrids youth sides before being sold to Juventus in 2014, started 14 times in La Liga during this campaign having rejoined the club in the summer and suspects his opportunities at the Bernabu could be even more limited next seasonMorata has been convinced by Mourinho that Old Trafford is the best place to restart his career",3
" Interest from Chelsea has not been followed up and, although Milan have emerged as suitors, Morata is determined to play in the Premier LeagueMourinho gave Morata his first-team debut at Madrid in December 2010 but Morata left for Juventus having made 37 La Liga appearances in nearly four seasons The release of Ibrahimovic followed a serious knee injury sustained by the 35-year-old in the Europa League semi-final tie against Anderlecht in April He is expected to be out until early 2018 and will continue his rehabilitation at UnitedUnited are also interested in Internazionales winger Ivan Perisic after lodging a 40m offer",5
" Inter are holding out for 55m and, while negotiations continue, the Torino striker Andrea Belotti remains an option as Mourinho seeks to rebuild his attacking options Reports in Portugal on Friday claimed that a 30m move for the Benfica defender Victor Lindelof could be back onThe fight between Mercedes and Ferrari remains finely poised at the front of the Formula One grid as Canada hosts round seven of the season this weekend Certainly there was little to choose between them in practice on Friday at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve with Lewis Hamilton edging out Sebastian Vettel in the morning and Kimi Raikkonen ahead of the British driver in the afternoon but, behind them the gulf to the midfield teams remains a chasmIt is in danger of becoming even more pronounced",5
 The Williams chief technical officer Paddy Lowe has warned that the spending differential to the top teams is greater than ever and the sports senior management addressed the issue in Canada Williams are currently in sixth place in the constructors championship,2
" They have a quick car but they and their contemporaries on the grid are still two seconds off the pace of the leaders, not a gap that can be bridged while the financial disparity remains so drastic",1
"We face a gulf of spending that has probably never been seen before in the sport, said Lowe, whose first stint with Williams concluded in 1992 with Nigel Mansell winning the title It was a great reward to us that we came and beat McLaren We knew they had a lot more money than us and we did a better job than them",3
 But the distortion we have today is on another level Probably a factor of two-and-a-half times in expenditure between the leading teams and the first of the independents,2
" That seems like a gulf that is difficult to cross, certainly in a sustained wayEstimated figures from 2016 back him up, with Williams spending 100m to the 265m of Mercedes, 225m of Ferrari and 215m of Red Bull",2
" Lowe has first hand experience of some of this largesse, having been technical director at Mercedes between 2013 and 2016 It is clear something has to be done about that, he saidWilliams are celebrating their 40th anniversary this year and the team are still held in high regard Thirty-thousand fans turned out last week to attend a day at Silverstone for a display of their cars The circuit will host a similar event at the British Grand Prix and the fans reaction will doubtless be similarly enthusiastic",5
" But they have not won a title since 1997 and, as things stand, are not in the mix to do so again Chase Carey, the chief executive of the Formula One group, acknowledged the issue on Friday in Montreal and insisted it was being addressed There is no question right now that there is a disparity in spending that is quite wide, he said",3
" There are amounts being spent at the top that even the teams that are spending it would recognise it is tough to rationalise It creates issues because it undermines the competitive balance of the sportHe was backed by F1s director of motorsports, Ross Brawn, who also agreed that changes would occur but within parameters We dont want to dumb Formula One down, he said We dont want all the teams to be exactly the same, there should still be the Ferrari, the Mercedes, the Red Bulls, the teams you aspire to beat but we dont want domination",5
 We need an environment where if a team does a really good job it can do well,1
" We dont want a situation where financial power enables a team to get a dominant position, as has happened in the last few yearsRob Smedley, Williams head of vehicle performance, joined the team from Ferrari having been with the Scuderia just as Brawn and Jean Todt were helping Michael Schumacher to his fifth consecutive title in 2004 He believes the current structure of F1 is a direct consequence of that period noting the role Brawn, the poacher now turned gamekeeper, played",3
"It is essential F1 should not just be how much you spend Williams showed you didnt have to be the richest team but that its become less about that was probably created by my old team when Ross and Jean built a team around finding marginal gains, he said",2
 F1 should be about engineering excellence and brave drivers going toe to toe on the trackThe task is a considerable one Damon Hill won his title with Williams in 1996 and recognises how much the landscape of the sport has changed,3
" It is very difficult for a team like Williams to break the stranglehold that Ferrari and Mercedes have, he said",1
"The perennial problem is one of coaxing agreement from teams with vested interests but Hill believes it will be dealt with because of commercial expediency F1 is as much about teams competing as it is about drivers, he added [Owners] Liberty see this as entertainment and their buck comes from the racing and if there is no bang they dont get people watching",3
"The long, lank boy in lane three is rigid with nerves Understandably, given he is 15 years old and racing in the World Junior Championships 200m final against athletes three years his senior",2
" Technically he is a mess too When he runs his neck is cocked back and tilted rightwards, as if he has slept awkwardly and missed an osteopaths appointment",2
 It barely matters As he rounds the bend he suddenly goes supersonic to win in 20,2
"61 secIn front of his home fans at the National Stadium in Kingston, Usain Bolt has just become the youngest junior world champion in historyOn Saturday night, 15 years on from that golden hello, Bolt returns to the same stadium for his farewell race in Jamaica",3
" They are calling it Salute to a Legend, and for once the hyperbole is not misplaced Over 30,000 will watch a star-studded undercard, including Britains double Olympic champion Mo Farah, the double Olympic 800m gold medallist David Rudisha, and the 400m world record holder Wayde van Niekerk, and then party long into the night with dancehall stars such as Beenie Man and Ding Dong",2
" As always, though, Bolt will take centre stageBut, as he admits, saying goodbye  and coming to terms with his own sporting mortality  is going to be emotional I live to make my country proud, he adds",3
" When I was growing up my idols were Don Quarrie and Herb McKenley I watched these guys dominating on the track, and working hard and I just wanted to be like them I wanted to put my country on the map",3
" Wherever I go in the world and see Jamaicans and they tell me I make them feel proud, and for me that is a big honour",1
"In truth, Bolts 100m race at 1010pm local time will be more of a celebration than a contest His most dangerous rivals, including Olympic silver medallist Yohan Blake and the young South African sensation Akani Simbine, who has dipped under 10 seconds six times in 2017, have been planted in a much tougher 100m earlier in the evening He will win And win well",5
"He started at 15 on a winning note and he wants to leave the sport on a winning noteEven so, it will still serve as a useful barometer given that Bolt has not raced competitively since January and missed training for nearly three weeks following the death of his close friend, the British high jumper, Germaine Mason With the world championships in London two months away, he needs to make a statement As his father, Wellesley, puts it: He started at 15 on a winning note and he wants to leave the sport on a winning note",3
" So his main aim is to win here and be in LondonIt is hard to overstate the outpouring of love and pride Jamaicans have for Bolt In dozens of conversations the same phrases are uttered like mantras, especially People person and Makes our country proud There is also no doubt among Jamaicans that, despite the chequered history of the 100m and doping, Bolt has done everything the right wayAnd at the Spartan Health Club where Bolt does regular cardio, fat-burning and step sessions (although he draws the line at the Friday evening burlesque class), his personal trainer, Steve Ming, insists that what you see is what you get",5
" The moment he walks in, he lights up the room, says Ming, who has known Bolt since he was a scrawny teenager Theres a big rivalry inside the gym between Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea We are the [Manchester] United crew and hes a United supporter",3
" So when Arsenal are losing he will walk in and start joking Hes just a normal person The owner of the gym, Andro Henry, adds that Bolts other big passion is Japanese manga comics  especially Naruto and Bleach  and that Bolt talks to everyone",3
"The Jamaican minister of culture, gender, entertainment and sport, Olivia Grange, goes further still She believes Bolt ranks alongside Bob Marley as the biggest star to ever come out of the country",2
" Anywhere around the world you go, if you say Jamaica they say Bob and Bolt, she says We have a saying: were little but we are tallawah, which means we maybe small but we are awesome Its wonderful that Jamaica  which is such a small country  has such an awesome presence through its music and track and field",3
"It helps, too, that Bolt is considered humble and willing to do so much for charity As Andre Lowe, the sports editor of the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, puts it: Hes not your quintessential mega-rich, diva-type superstar He loves kids and thats why helping to improve the quality of life for Jamaican kids is such a big part of his charity efforts Theres a joke  if you want to get Bolt to appear anywhere, tell him there will be kids thereBut in Jamaica they know that the 6ft 5in star will cast a long shadow when he retires after London - especially given that he has contributed to 40% of the countrys medals at Olympic Games and world championships since 2008",5
" True, there is a long treadmill of talent, but few dispute that freaks such as Bolt come along once in a generation We will certainly miss his dominance, admits Lowe His international appeal, his personality  these are things that all added to brand Jamaica, these are all things that we will no longer be able to point to",3
"Bolt, meanwhile, is yet to make any firm plans for retirement His coach, Glen Mills, wants him to take over as coach of the Racers Club, but he has always shown a certain reluctance for early morning starts And while the Jamaican government says he is pushing at an open door if he wants to go into politics, he insists that it is not for him and he tries to stay as far as possible away from that",3
"Even so, the sports minister is still hoping that Bolt will continue to do his bit for Jamaica in the future I wish he would change his mind, she says, before adding, with a twinkle in her eye",2
" But if not, I look forward to him settling down and making a family with some little Bolts",1
"A former member of the Newcastle United youth football system has appeared in court charged with 29 historical sex offences committed over the 25-year period from 1973 to 1998George Ormond, 61, also a coach at the Montagu and North Fenham boys football club during that period, appeared by videolink at North Tyneside magistrates court on Friday He is charged with 28 offences of indecent assault committed on boys aged under and over 16, and one charge of buggery on a 15 year-old-boy, alleged to have been committed between 1982 and 1983 Ormond, wearing black steel-rimmed spectacles, with grey hair in a side parting, a greying beard and wearing an open-necked blue shirt, spoke at the five-minute hearing only to confirm his name, age and current address in Devon and to say that he understood the charges and conditions of the court hearingOf the charges 10 alleged victims of indecent assault were under 14 when the offences took place; the youngest was aged 11 at the time",5
 Eight of the indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed on boys aged between 14 and 16; a further 10 charges relate to young men who were over 16 at the time The charges collectively relate to alleged offences committed against 17 different victims over the 25-year period,2
"None of the victims can be named for legal reasons The chair of the magistrates, Lillian Molloy, informed Ormond, who is on bail without conditions, that he will appear next on 7 July at Newcastle crown courtIn 1939 the Football League made the wearing of numbers on the backs of shirts mandatory, and in 1951 it officially allowed footballs, previously a shade of mud brown that given the state of many pitches at the time must have been extremely unhelpful, to be white",3
" These novelties stand as two steps on footballs long journey to modernity though superficially they have little in common, separated as they were by 12 years and a world war In fact, however, they were introduced in a single pioneering week during the pre-season of 1927, a time of wild experimentation which appears to have gone forgotten or unnoticed in the games many histories and timelinesHerbert Chapman, who had already won two leagues titles and an FA Cup with Huddersfield Town and was in due course to repeat that feat at Arsenal, has been credited with playing a decisive role in both",3
" In fact he seems to have been supportive but only tangentially involved, with credit for player numbers more rationally belonging with Chelseas manager, David Calderhead, his chairman, Claude Kirby, and later with Evertons William Cuff, and for the white ball with a certain Mr EL Roberts of Kingsland, ShrewsburyAt the end of July 1927 Roberts, a humble reader, wrote to the Athletic News to draw the attention of the Football Association and all lovers of the game to the desirability of changing the colour of the football, which I have no doubt whatever will meet with universal approval A white ball, he suggested, would not only be more visible but also inherently more exciting",3
" The attraction would be to see a white globe travelling low and high, he suggested, with its twists and turns increasing our interest and excitement as it goes towards the goal",1
"Ivan Sharpe, once of Derby County, Leeds United and Watford and a member of Britains gold medal-winning football team at the 1912 Olympics, was editing the paper at the time So taken was he with this idea that in his next edition he not only published the letter in full, but also an editorial at the top of the front page A ball of white leather  has advantages for spectators and players, it read On sunny days the players probably would find it more difficult to see than the ball now used, but as the bright days of the English winter, as in the modern summer, are comparatively few, more might be gained than lost In the murky weather characteristic of the football season it is probable that the white ball would be a very welcome innovation to spectators",5
" The idea seems fanciful, but is worthy of thought",1
This is where Chapman came in,1
" He, along with several other managers, was sufficiently intrigued to test white balls in pre-season friendlies that summer We realise the possibilities of the suggestion appearing in the Athletic News, he said, and intend to explore them as fully as possible",2
" He did, however, admit that I doubt it will ever be done in league matches It certainly is a novel suggestion, said the FA secretary, Frederick Wall, when challenged to declare it illegal There is nothing in the laws of the game to prevent a white ball being used, and as it is a practice game I personally see no objectionIt wasnt a completely novel idea There are records of white-painted balls being used in games dating back to the end of the 19th century, and they were already in occasional use on the continent",5
" Derby had come across one on a pre-season tour of the Netherlands in 1925: when dusk fell during a game against Ajax, making the brown ball hard to make out, a white replacement was thrown on to the field The tourists kicked it back off again, refusing to play with a lump of whitewash This time, however, the English game was a little more receptive",3
" Only, however, a littleReading were among the first to try it, and no one there was particularly impressed The referee, JV Pennington, said that it is difficult to express a definite opinion after one trial but also that I am satisfied that it would severely handicap the goalkeeper on a bright day and, puzzlingly, that a ball painted white is dangerous to players heading it",3
" The Reading captain, Robert Eggo, sniffed: I cannot see that a white ball is any advantage, and on a bright sunny day it might easily prove a distinct disadvantage Their manager, Andrew Wylie, declared the whole idea a piece of nonsense  only a fadThe Guardian reported that of other trials that weekend, at Clapton Orient it was a distinct disappointment, with the players complaining of finding difficulty in sighting it in the grey weather, while at Huddersfield the white paint was swiftly rubbed off the ball, which assumed the ordinary hue long before the end, and at Blackpool players were emphatic in expressing their dislike of the innovation",3
"Arsenal played the first half of their game with a ball covered with shiny, enamel paint  the same stuff that was applied to golf balls  and the second half with one with a matt finish The Athletic News correspondent noticed particularly how the ball showed up against the dark background of the spectators standing on the popular terracing, and declared it was obvious that on a really dull day the white ball would be an enormous advantage from a spectators point of view",2
"Those actually on the field, however, were less overwhelmed The referee, WT Guttridge, described one occasion when I entirely lost the ball as it flashed across the white crossbar, and complained that I found it even more difficult to follow when it travelled level with the players white knickers Billy Blyth, the Arsenal captain, said of the enamelled ball that all the players agree it was impossible to control, slithering off the toe at all angles So far as visibility was concerned, we could see the ball splendidly when it was on the ground, but it was a strain following its flight at a heightWe made the experiment as an experiment, and we are not going on with it, declared Chapman",5
" I would not go so far as to say it was unsatisfactory, but it was not successful enough to justify any departure from traditionThe league season kicked off with balls unchanged and that, it seemed, was that",2
" The probabilities are that we have heard the last of the white football, read an editorial in the Burnley News A proposal that seems to have had its origin in the craze for novelty, it only required the light of actual experience to demonstrate its futility",2
" On Saturday the white ball was used on several grounds, and in all cases the experiment may be said to have been a complete failure",1
" The experiment has met with a chorus of condemnation, and we may take it for granted that the white ball has been kicked for the last timeCalderhead had been one of the white balls vocal critics, perhaps because he was concentrating on alternative innovations, with his Chelsea side preparing to experiment for the first time with the use of numbered jerseys in a trial match the following Monday",2
" Though it had been witnessed in a couple of amateur internationals at club level this was a true first, and though Calderhead declared it certainly helpful, particularly from the spectators point of view he said he was not certain if it is worth putting it up to the Football Association councilThis too had a hostile reception Sidney King, manager of West Ham United, said numbers made players look like horses and jockeys, while Tottenham Hotspurs Billy Minter said that in my long experience of football, I have always found the crowd able to pick out any man after a glance at the programme",3
" Walter Hart, Birmingham president, declared it hideous and Wall, on behalf of the FA, declared the idea very undesirable and unnecessary Chapman, a good friend of Calderheads, was a lone supportive voice",2
" I dont see how the idea can be otherwise than useful, he said, even if the innovation would hardly be necessaryA year later both Chelsea and Arsenal wore numbers in their first league games of the season",2
 That day the great football writer James Catton wrote an article in support of the novelty,1
" The objects of every club should be to play the game and give the greatest possible pleasure to those who throng the seats and terraces, he wrote It is difficult to understand why some clubs are strongly objecting to a proposed change which is of great help to everybody on all occasions The convenience of the public should be paramount",3
"Not likely Though Chelsea surveyed 700 fans after their game and received unanimous support for numbering, and the Guardian reported that the spectators approved of a practice that should have become general years ago because the personality of a scoring forward in a crush goal is not always revealed by the shape of his back, the League immediately banned them Chelsea, though, did not give up, and in 1929 wore numbers on a tour of Brazil, earning the nickname Los Numerados",3
"I can see nothing whatever against the numbering of players and I hope to see this agreed at the annual League meeting, their chairman, Claude Kirby, said in 1928",1
" League football has many new and powerful rivals to contend with, and we cannot afford to miss any opportunity of popularising it I am convinced that thousands of casual spectators would become regular followers if they had this easy means of identifying players",2
"His fellow chairmen were unmoved, but the idea never went away There was some support at the FA, whose honorary treasurer, Arthur Kingscott, had seen numbers in use while acting as tour manager on a trip to Canada in 1926 and returned to declare that at first I did not like the idea but that in the end I came to the conclusion that it was an excellent idea, and it enabled the crowd to follow closely the movement of every playerIn January 1933 Tottenham were allowed to wear numbers for their FA Cup third-round match against Watford, which they won 7-1, and that March they were worn in a trial match between Englands first and second XIs at Fratton Park, leading to larger versions being used in the FA Cup final the following month between Everton, who wore 1-11 starting with the goalkeeper at No1 and ending with the outside-left, and Manchester City, who took 12-22 starting with their outside-left and ending with their goalkeeper, Len Langford, at No22",3
"The idea was debated and rejected by the Football League later that year (What the advantage would be it is hard to conceive, sniffed the Times) and the next time numbers were seen at Wembley was in 1939 (It makes the game so much easier to follow that one wonders why players in League matches are not also allowed to be numbered, enthused the Times), a couple of months before the league finally made them compulsory, the motion proposed by the Everton chairman, new league president and long-term numbering advocate, William Cuff, and carried by 24-20",1
"White balls would get their turn, though they had to wait a while The late 1940s saw several colour-based oddities, with the winter of 1946-47, the snowiest of the 20th century, prompting Southend to paint their touchlines red and Reading to turn their goalposts blue, and soon alternatives to brown leather balls were being considered once againOf particular importance on the white balls road to acceptance was a televised match between England and Italy at White Hart Lane in 1949 when a white ball was used in fading light towards the end at the insistence of the Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, who felt that against the background of high stands at White Hart Lane the ordinary ball becomes almost invisible in the air when the night is falling",3
"After that game the leagues secretary, F Howarth, sniffed that I do not think the ball offered many advantages over the ordinary one, but it had been well received by the watching public and the FA resolved to keep experimenting: in February 1950 England B played Switzerland B at Hillsborough with a bright yellow ball being used in the first half, and a garish orange one in the second The big push came the following year, the first to see top-level competitive floodlit football",2
" It was under lights that the white ball really, in every sense, shoneIn 1951 the League permitted their use, but their introduction was haphazard Initially most games started, according to tradition, with a brown ball, a white one being brought out only if it got a bit gloomy  the Guardian described the latter stages of one Chelsea game that year as being like watching a ping-pong ball bobbing about in a darkened room",3
" But there was a catch Back in 1927 one ball manufacturer was quoted as saying that it was, in his opinion, practically impossible to make a white football",2
" By 1951 a solution had been found, which involved a different tanning process, the application of a layer of white paint, and then a layer of cellulose The first layer made the ball white, the second protected the first from damage",2
" It also, and quite accidentally, protected the ball from water: traditional versions might increase in weight by as much as 20% on a wet day, but white ones remained impervious It was a discovery that was to change the gameIt certainly changed some games",3
" In 1951, for example, an amateur international between England and Wales was tied at 1-1 with 15 minutes to play and the two teams battling to hoof a sodden leather ball around a muddy pitch, when a white ball was called for England duly skipped to a 4-1 victory",2
"In 1952 the Sunderland Echo asserted that the ball particularly helped players who were smaller in build and favouring a short-passing gameBig players given an advantage on mud declare that this compensates them for the start and finish of the season when conditions favour smaller men, it wrote",2
" They insist that the light ball, used as a counter to mud, penalises themIn 1953 the FA recommended that white balls should be used from the start or not at all, though this remained at the referees discretion",2
" That November, Hungary showed quite how much it assisted more technical players when they put a white ball into the England net six times at WembleyThe greatest possible advert for their use came with the arrival of another Hungarian team the following year, for what must surely rank among the most important friendlies in the history of the game, most probably at No1 The match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Honved was to inspire Lquipe to propose a European Cup, which started in 1955, and an eight-year-old George Best to become a Wolves fan, as an estimated 12 million people watched the BBCs broadcast of the second half, a rare glimpse of televised football beyond the FA Cup final and occasional internationalsWith his team 2-0 down at the interval the Wolves manager, Stan Cullis, sent his groundsmen and apprentices (including a 15-year-old Ron Atkinson) out at half-time to drench the pitch with water, and with the resulting bog frustrating the swift-passing Hungarians his side utilised more direct tactics to battle back to a thrilling, dramatic 3-2 victoryThe 1958 World Cup was the first to utilise a white ball, and the battle was effectively over, the sympathies of supporters made crystal clear two years later when the later stages of Burnleys title-clinching 2-1 win over Manchester City at Maine Road were soundtracked by both sides fans singing white ball, white ball as they strained to keep track of the brown one",5
"Back in 1927, the often outspoken and always readable Derby Telegraph columnist bylined An Outside Right took aim at footballing novelties",1
 I am among the large army of football enthusiasts who regard the attempt to introduce such innovations as white balls and identity numbers for players as the mere vapourings of people who are not happy unless they are being given something novel There is nothing wrong with the game Let us get on with it,3
" Players ought to be numbered, should they? Here is a proposition put forward by someone who, like the sponsor of the white ball idea, ought to see an optician, and yet wishes to evade that expense by football helping him out",1
"The one great objection to players being numbered is that spectators would take a superficial, rather than an intelligent, interest in the game Under existing conditions spectators have to exert their powers of observation and intelligence in order to follow correctly the play and the players",2
 Make this [too] easy for them and there will be no fun in it,1

" I am against anything that makes football too easy a spectacle to watch and follow Football will soon go to the dogs if the football administrators give ear to the faddistsOver the 90 years since those words were written the football administrators havent just given ear to the faddists but eyes, nose and mouth as well Heaven knows what he would have made of the modern game, but an Outside Right would surely admit that he got this call wrongMark Sampson says he believes the most together team will be the last to go home as England Women begin a monthlong training camp before the European Championship this summer",5
" With hopes high after Englands third-place finish at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, Sampson says players and staff are focused on being the best on the planet and have not discussed any outcome other than winning the trophy",1
"Speaking before preparations that include friendlies, the first of which is on Saturday away against Switzerland, and a warm-weather training camp in Spain, Sampson said: I think that the key quality in this tournament will be togetherness The most together team will definitely be the team that is last to go homeWell be working hard on the training pitch to make sure were fit, to make sure we understand what were trying to do and to make sure that whatever the opponent throws at us weve got the relevant weapons to find a way to win",3
" Refusing to go home, find a way to win, and staying togetherI believe this team has the ability to be the best in the world, 100% Theres been nothing on my mind since the final whistle of the [World Cup] semi-final than how were going to win this event Ive never once discussed with the players about getting through the group, of getting to this stage or whatever Its about winning",5
"Thats no guarantee well win  of course its not We might lose our first two and be eliminated But our focus is completely on doing everything we can to give us the best possible chance to win this eventSampson earned criticism from inside the womens game after he named his 23-strong squad three months before the tournament and before the Spring Series, the climactic event in a reshaped Womens Super League",5
 Yet the England manager defended his decision and said the announcement was a necessary part of the squads preparation,1
"Ive got to give huge credit to the players, he said",1
" They were all made aware of the announcement and their confirmed places in the squad early and I think the work they have put in has been incredibly diligent and professional Ive been really impressed with their level of performance [in the Spring Series] but Ive also been impressed by their work away from the field This was always the intention, to do the work behind the scenes that makes the big difference when youre put in front of all the cameras",3
"We said we need to rip into each other and have a right good go at this Spring Series We said we had to compete, to tackle, to fight, to push each other I think we arrive now with the right balance between toughness and freshness",3
"England are planning to stay to the end of a tournament being hosted by the Netherlands and which begins on 16 July Were looking at it that were away from 5June to 7August which seems a really long time, Sampson said So we try to have a good balance as to when we switch on When we do switch on with this team we demand the highest of standards, work ethic, competitiveness, learning  all the key qualities to be the best on the planet But when we switch off we want to have fun, we want to enjoy ourselves and weve got a great balance, I think",5

" If New Zealand were to suffer an unscheduled wobble, however, Tew anticipates Gatlands name entering the frame",1
"Ian Foster is sitting there as a very strong candidate when Steve does finish but therell be others, said Tew, suggesting that the overseas-based Gatland, Joe Schmidt and Vern Cotter would be potential alternatives Joe is sitting in Ireland and wed like to have him back",2
 Vern is coaching at a very high level and you wouldnt rule Gatty out either,1
"Asked whether Gatlands stock would rise appreciably if the Lions won the Test series, Tew replied: Youll have to ask Warren what he wants to do next We dont know what Steves doing yet but what we will do is manage the transition very well",2
" Well be sitting down later this year to work out the processThe notion of Gatland taking over from Hansen might sound improbable to many in New Zealand but there is considerable respect for his successful stints in charge of Wales, Wasps and the 2013 Lions in Australia Im still of the view this is a very good Lions team and once they get together theyll be very tough in this Test series, said Tew",3
"I think the physical attrition of the series is going to take its toll One team will come through that better than the otherThe commercial benefits to New Zealand Rugby of staging a Lions tour are similarly striking and, unsurprisingly, Tew wants his country to host another in 2029 Its unique and something thats worth preserving The current contract between the Lions and Sanzar (South African, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) runs out after this tournament and needs to be renegotiated but the commitment from all of us is that the Lions are locked into the calendar",5
"More contentiously he has dismissed switching to a 16-year cycle to allow Argentina, now part of the Rugby Championship, to host the Lions before 2033 at the earliest Were not currently anticipating Argentina coming into it because theres a history of them touring to the three countries",2
"World Rugbys vice-chairman, Agustn Pichot, feels otherwise, with the possibility of arranging early tour games in North America clearly an option, but the three leading southern hemisphere unions are, to varying degrees, kept financially afloat by the Lions",1
" In 16 years time it might change but I think youd struggle to run a Lions tour with a meaningful schedule in Argentina, said Tew Theres no doubt our good friend Mr Pichot has his eyes on the Lions but I dont think that would involve turning it into a 16-year cycle Thats not on our radar",3
"Nor, predictably, is backing a Super Rugby franchise in the Pacific Islands  In the immediate future I cant see how you could sustain a professional team in a Pacific Island unless, financially, theres significant private intervention  but as recently as the past week Tew has had discussions with South African officials about rugbys future viability across the southern hemisphere Its not as simple as saying they [South Africa] want to leave Sanzar Ive asked that question in the last week",3
 The complication for the southern hemisphere is that we all live so far apart,1
 Its an enormous costOne of the things weve learnt [from Super Rugby] is to be careful about expansion,2
" The Aussies, the South Africans and to a degree the Japanese are learning that the hard wayTew has reaffirmed the All Blacks will continue to play financial hardball when it comes to negotiating deals to play Tests in the northern hemisphere Despite not having agreed to play England on tour this autumn, discussions with the RFUs chief executive, Ian Ritchie, proved informative",3
 We know that when we play at Twickenham you can ratchet the turnstiles up,1
 Ian and I had a good commercial conversation so Ive now got a good idea what the real number looks like,1
" We certainly had a conversation about a fee that was higher than wed ever had before Thatll sit in the system until the next time we come back and discuss itOne of the great contrasts of the Olympic Games is that while they bring out the best in athletes, they often bring out the worst in host cities This past week offered a sharp reminder of this dynamic, with fresh revelations that the National Security Agency engaged in indiscriminate surveillance during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City This was no mere quirk of history",5
" The Olympics-induced state of exception has long afforded government authorities enormous leeway to break norms and bend lawsIf, as appears likely, Paris and Los Angeles are awarded the 2024 and 2028 Games respectively, the cities should bear in mind the events in Salt Lake City and not sleepwalk to the optimistic rhythms of the IOC",2
" Its time to face up to the past and make big asks for the futureThe NSA, according to former executive and whistleblower Thomas Drake, was not merely scooping up metadata during the Salt Lake City Games, alarming as even that would be Drake said of the warrantless dragnet: Virtually all electronic communication signals that went into or out of one of those designated areas were captured and stored by the NSA, including the contents of emails and text messages",3
" Drakes input is part of a lawsuit brought in 2015 by former Salt Lake City mayor Rocky Anderson alleging an overreaching mass surveillance program that vacuumed up data on millions of innocent peopleDrakes disclosure adds detail to what former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed in 2013, that according to government documents, the NSA met with higher-ups from COMPANY E ahead of the Games As part of the Presidents Surveillance Program, NSA asked COMPANY E to provide call detail records in support of security for the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City",3
" The CEO of COMPANY E, which turned out to be Denver-based Qwest, fully cooperated Another document from the Snowden surveillance archive makes it clear that Salt Lake City was no one-off: NSA has had an active role in the Olympics since 1984 Los Angeles games, and has seen its involvement increase with the recent games in Atlanta, Sydney, and Salt Lake City",2
"The lesson for everyday people in aspiring host cities is threefold First, governments are perfectly willing to use the Games to test-drive new methods and technologies, publicly denying it all the while Second, private companies are more than willing to go along for the ride",3
" Finally, the truth can take years to unearthSince the 2002 Salt Lake City Games  the last time the US hosted the Olympics  the country has cartwheeled forward with intensified surveillance measures This should fuel serious public concern in Los Angeles But the only group raising the issue is NOlympics LA, led by activists from the Democratic Socialists of America and their coalition allies The LA bidding team simply avoids the subject",5
The truth is that the Olympics are at an inflection point The promise of memorable athletic performances is no longer enough,2
" The terrain around the Games has shifted mightily in the last decade, with activists, academics, and elected officials asking tough questions during the bid process, kneecapping bids with data and in some cases torpedoing them with public referenda Exhibit A is Boston where activists so vociferously opposed the Games that the mayor refused to sign on the dotted line for cost overruns, thereby killing the bid The 2024 Olympics field originally featured five full-fledged candidates before public pressure derailed bids in Hamburg, Rome, and Budapest, leaving only Los Angeles and Paris",3
For too long the IOCs response to criticism has been to ladle out fat dollops of slapdashery,1
" It starts at the top with the IOC president, Thomas Bach The Rio 2016 Olympics left a herd of white-elephant venues already crumbling into disrepair, disgruntled residents who had their homes demolished for the Games, and broken legacy promises, most notably related to water cleanup Former Rio mayor Eduardo Paes, who was one of the Games biggest boosters, has been accused of accepting nearly $5m for shepherding Olympic contracts into particular palms",3
" Yet, in the wake of the Games, Bach proclaimed the Rio Olympics marvelous and heralded their tremendous legacy to the people of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and South America He even claimed with a straight face that in Rio, the financial model of the Olympic Games has really stood a stress testFast forward to today In Los Angeles and Paris, the IOC has two relatively strong bids Bach recently said this is a position you like to be in",5
" But behind Bachs stiff-lipped insistence, the smartest people in the IOC know that with the number of aspiring host cities dwindling the Olympics are in crisis Even the Economist, the house journal for corporate capitalism, has admitted that the current dearth of prospective hosts indicates that the business model for the Olympic Games is running out of puff",2
"According to media reports, LA is engaged in backroom badinage with the IOC to squeeze out a few concessions, including financial aid to run its organizing committee for an additional four years Last week, the LA mayor Eric Garcetti suggested that the IOC could also help finance metropolitan youth sports programs If these are the best concessions that Los Angeles bid jockeys can wrest from the IOC, then they need to work on their game",3
" This is a historic opportunity to extract fat satchels of cash from the IOC (and the group has plenty to spare) that could benefit everyday Angelenos After all, LA has more people living in poverty than any other major US city and the highest number of chronically homeless people in the country",2
" Last year, LA had the most officer-involved killings in the US",1
" The Los Angeles County Jail is the biggest in the country, and is plagued by serious inmate abuse issues Los Angeles need not squander this unique moment",2
 Time to think big,1
" The Olympics come with serious baggage, whether its blanket surveillance, public debt, or aggressive marginalization of the already marginalized",1
 LA bidders have a rare chance to push back,1
"Apparently Liverpool are going to keep plugging away at this transfer negotiation lark until they crack it or land themselves a full-scale ban But judging by the latest names being linked with them, the feast of new players that Jrgen Klopp was hoping to find waiting for him at Anfield is pie in the sky and hes been told to make do with whatever he can find at the service station on the way home His old muckers at Dortmumd might help him out by lending him the 19-year-old schemer Emre Mor for a season and theres chat in France about grasping for Bordeauxs sprightly forward Gatan Laborde",3

The night started with a catfish throw,1
It ended with haymaker after haymaker  both literal and proverbial  from the ever resilient Pittsburgh PenguinsThe defending champions provided an emphatic and repeated reminder of what makes them such a difficult out in a 6-0 demolition of the Nashville Predators in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup final to take a three-games-to-two leadPittsburgh will have a chance to become the first franchise in 19 years to win back to back Cups when the series shifts back to Nashville for Game 6 on Sunday night,3
"Understand that were going to play a desperate team, said Penguins captain Sidney Crosby after collecting three assists Nothings done yet and weve got a lot of work ahead of ourselvesSo do the Predators, who cant get back to Smashville fast enough",3
"Justin Schultz, Bryan Rust and Evgeni Malkin scored during a first-period barrage against Pekka Rinne that sent the Nashville goaltender to the bench for the rest of the night, all the good mojo he created during a pair of wins in Games 3 and 4 gone",1
"Conor Sheary, Phil Kessel  just as linemate Malkin predicted  and 35-year-old playoff newbie Ron Hainsey also scored for the Penguins",1
" Crosbys eventful night included becoming the franchises all-time leading scorer in the Stanley Cup final, a two-minute roughing penalty for trying to dribble Nashville defenseman PK Subbans head on the ice near the end of the first period and an flip of a water bottle onto the ice during playIts just one of those things it slipped out of my hand, Crosby said I had a gesture with my hand and before I knew it the thing was flying across the ice I know youre not allowed to do that, so Im not going to start doing it in the Stanley Cup finalMatt Murray bounced back from so-so performances during Pittsburghs lost weekend in Nashville to make 24 stops while also benefiting from a dominant performance by the guys in front of him",5
"Penguins coach Mike Sullivan, as he has for each of the last two springs when his team finds itself in a tight spot, pushed all the right buttons again He stuck with Murray, reunited Sheary with Crosby and Jake Guentzel, and stressed his team needed to play with urgency but not desperation after the Predators rallied to tie the series by outscoring the Penguins 9-2 during two wins in NashvilleIt took all of 91 seconds for Pittsburgh to get its swagger back",3
"Just 91 seconds after a Nashville fan flipped a catfish onto the PPG Paints Arena ice  a move that came shortly before a three-goal outburst by Nashville in Game 1  Schultz powered home a slapshot to end an 0-for-15 power-play skidWe were on our toes tonight, Schultz said We were really jumping and playing our game, playing fast",3
 It all started with that start and got us going for the rest of the gameRust made it 2-0 just 6:43 into the game with a nasty backhand flip over Rinnes glove,2
"Then things got chippy (and a little weird) for the games best player Crosby and Subban became tangled up behind the Nashville net late in the first period, with Crosby ended up on top of Subban Crosby then started hitting Subban in the head repeatedly, eventually drawing a roughing penalty while Subban  who quipped that Crosby was complaining about Subbans bad breath during a Game 3 exchange  went off for holdingMalkin ripped a wrist shot over Rinnes glove on the ensuing 4-on-4 to make it 3-0 with just 10 seconds left in the first Rinne gave way to Juuse Saros at the start of the second period after stopping just six of nine shots, continuing his wildly uneven play",5
 Rinne stopped 50 of 52 shots he faced back home in Games 3 and 4,1
 Hes stopped just 34 of 45 in Pittsburgh during the seriesSaros hardly fared any better,2
" Sheary took a pretty feed from Crosby and sent it by Saros 1:19 into the second to push Pittsburghs lead to four Kessel ended a six-game goal drought 8:02 into the second The score had been predicted by Malkin and it came just seconds after Crosby threw a water bottle onto the ice as the play went by Pittsburghs bench, a move he told referees was unintentionalWhen Hainsey, who waited 907 regular-season games before reaching the playoffs for the first time this season, tapped in a pass from Malkin to make it 6-0, the stage was set for the Penguins to return to familiar territoryThe franchise has won all four of its Cups on the road",5
" A shot at a fifth awaits Sunday, though itll hardly be easy",1
"The Predators are 9-1 at home in the playoffs, a place they will need to be a haven once again if they want to extend their improbable Cup run - and a flat-out odd final - back to Pittsburgh",1
"Crosby now has 20 career points in the Stanley Cup final, a new franchise record and one more than team owner Mario Lemieux",1

"If a win can ever feel worrying, this may be the oneVictory was crucial for the USs prospects of automatic qualification for next years World Cup finals and duly obtained Key job, done",3
" But there was a certain slackness to the Americans that a superior side  say, Mexico  will surely exploitIf the Hexagonal groups bottom team was capable of exposing vulnerabilities in the Americans back line and midfield here in the Denver suburbs on Thursday, what might Mexico do to the US at home on Sunday?A draw in Mexico would be an impressive result for the US in almost any conceivable context; on this evidence, thats surely the right attitude to take into the fixture No reason for hopes to be set too high",3
"Christian Pulisic was the hero - a sentence likely to become a well-worn sentiment in the months and years ahead Ruthless and alert, the 18-year-old scored twice and provided a coolness in front of goal that more experienced team-mates lackedHes having fun, Bruce Arena said, calling him an exceptional talent",3
" He added: I just think hes a natural for the game, he sees the game very well and has good instincts on getting in good spots, especially his running off the balls exceptional",1
"Arena said he felt frustrated at half time with the lack of sharpness at both ends, but overall pronounced himself content",1
" We played a solid 90 minutes, he said Weve started off 2017 in pretty good shape so Im pleased at this timeDennis Lawrence, the T&T head coach, felt his charges were unfortunate",3
" Individual errors is probably what cost us, he said I felt all-in-all the boys probably didnt deserve thatWhile any team can miss a multitude of chances, it was the number of good opportunities afforded to the away side that should be most worrisome ahead of the trip to Mexico City",3
" And, curiously, Arenas men had some of their worst defensive moments when leading 2-0 in the latter stages against a Trinidad & Tobago team that ought to have been demoralized and feeling the effects of the thin Colorado airEven if the US camp insisted in the build-up that the focus was squarely on this match, the structure of their international break demonstrated how seriously they are taking the trip to the Azteca Like mountaineers heading to the pinnacle, the Americans played to a 1-1 draw in a friendly against Venezuela in Utah last Saturday; this stadium is 700ft higher, at 5,200 ft; the Azteca is at 7,200ftBut the biggest altitude problem ahead of the game was the low position of the US in the standings: out of the rarefied air of the places ensuring automatic qualification for next years tournament in Russia and six points adrift of Mexico at the summitThree points against T&T was virtually essential  both to lessen the risk of missing the top three spots and facing a playoff against an Asian side, and to avoid being struck by self-doubt ahead of the toughest fixture of the campaign",5
"With few injury problems to worry about, Arena picked what looked like a strong and solid, low-risk line-up John Brooks, who came off with a leg injury in the unedifying spectacle against Venezuela, returned to partner Geoff Cameron in central defense but did not convince",2
"Pulisic, the teams most exciting player, had license to roam across the final third of the pitch",1
" With Clint Dempsey also inclined to wander in search of the ball, it was important for the teams shape that Jozy Altidore was a more robust and predictable spearhead up frontThe first chance of note came in the 15th minute as Dempsey found space on the edge of the area to unfurl a dipping shot that narrowly cleared the bar The Seattle Sounders forward was chasing his 57th international strike, a number that would tie him with Landon Donovan at the top of the all-time US scoring chart",3
 Not this time: he was substituted in the second half Arena said he understood why Dempsey was visibly irked to be removed,2
" Hes got a really competitive edge to him, he said",1
"After 25 minutes, Brooks tested Jan-Michael Williams from distance, and the T&T goalkeeper was called upon again seconds later to deny Altidore Pulisic then ran down the left and lashed over Amid the American pressure the visitors enjoyed a surprising amount of room on their left wing, though fashioned little when close to Tim Howards net",3
"Until the 32nd minute, that is, when Kenwyne Jones squandered an outstanding chance to head the visitors into the lead",1
" With Howard flailing, the Atlanta United and former Sunderland striker  one of four MLS-attached players in the T&T starting XI  nodded the ball against the bar Though Williams had to make five saves in the first half, the sides were level at the breakAmerican anxieties were soothed after 52 minutes with the opening goal DeAndre Yedlin crossed low and Pulisic  operating outside the area for so much of this match  appeared inside the six-yard box, as if teleported, to slide the ball beyond Williams Yet, in another sign that the home team was prone to lapses in concentration, T&T had the ball in Howards net almost immediately after the restart, but it was correctly ruled offside",5
"Two minutes after the hour, Pulisic finished a move that he started",1
" Thanks to some incisive passing he was set clear on the right of the area and calmly slotted past the goalkeeper at his near post to make the game safe, though not exactly comfortable While Arena did not get the assertive and cohesive team display he no doubt craved before Sunday, at least he could once again savor a fine performance from the teenager",2
"Fast graduating from starlet into star, the Borussia Dortmund tyro is not short of self-belief Its gonna be a tough one down there in Mexico especially, but we really want some revenge on them [for their win last November], Pulisic told FS1 post-match So were really confident going into that game, he said with a nonchalant shrug",3
 Were going to come out with a win there too,1
A legal challenge has been launched by Newcastle United over documents seized from the club by officials conducting a tax investigation,1
"A high court judge banned HM Revenue & Customs from examining, without the clubs consent, material taken in a raid carried out in April under search warrants issued by Leeds crown courtMr Justice Supperstone, sitting in London, said on Thursday that the ban would continue until resolution of the clubs application for a judicial review against HMRC He directed that any material being retained by HMRC which is identified as attracting legal professional privilege must be returned to the club He also directed that the legal action involving Newcastle, who have just secured promotion back to the Premier League, must return to court on 22 June It is expected the club will then have to show it has an arguable case to take to a full judicial review hearing",5

" There are moments on the pitch  and the Iceland game is everyones point of reference  where you have to react, when youre one up and everything looks fine, then suddenly bang, bang, its 1-2",1
"The feedback Gareths had has been that, in some cases, the teams identity has been lackingMaybe you were in the stadium, or watching it on holiday like me, looking round at the players thinking: Bloody hell, theyve gone Where are the leaders? Where is the leadership? That is a pressure moment, so who is stepping forward? It looked to me like there was nobody Does what we did at the weekend solve that? Not in one hit, no",3
" But having identified it, it is part of a process that hopefully, in the short term but also in the long term, will create a different mindset within the group that can help us",1
 It is as simple as that,1
" The exorcism of that nightmare on the French Riviera is still continuingScotland will test Englands progress in the ferocious din of Hampden Park on Saturday, with the group leaders charged with imposing themselves on their hosts Coping with that level of expectation is part of the process Roy Hodgsons side were supposed to ease beyond Iceland, after all, and were ahead early on Southgate and his staff have recognised that this young groups potential will not be realised until hurdles such as these are vaulted with ease",5
" There is potential, yes, but there is also clearly some work to be done to get this group to where their maximum is, said Holland",1
 If we can hit that then this team has a chance to win [tournaments],1
" I have no doubt, this team has a chance to win",1
"Since coming in, Gareth has been very interactive in the way he has dealt with the players and what happened last summer: asking them what they think, not necessarily telling them what he thinks",1
" It has been driven really by an ownership from the players What did you recognise? What was right? What was wrong? How is it going to be different next time? What can we do to make that process different? The feedback Gareths had from players of the past and the present has been that, in some cases, the teams identity has been lacking, whether that is tactical or philosophical They want to get that back",3
"The aim is to give the group some tactical flexibility, allowing them to switch from four at the back to three if required, as they have demonstrated under Southgate Likewise, they need to mix between pressing high up the pitch when out of possession, or being able to sit deeper and look to counterattack And what are we doing with the ball? said the assistant manager Are we obsessed with playing from goalkeeper to halfway line, or is that not so important? How are we going to get from the halfway line to make chances? Everybody has to be very clear about their roles and responsibilities There is room for adaptation there, positionally, but I think that is the only way",5
"All of which suggests a settled group will use international breaks, including the current two-game period, to familiarise themselves with Southgates demands and ensure that, come Russia next summer, Englands thinking is anything but muddled",1
" Hollands role is now full-time, his eight-year spell with Chelsea curtailed as a Premier League champion, with any fears rival elite clubs, Tottenham Hotspur among them, might have had over him gleaning inside information on players while on international duty presumably now allayed The job offered to me was not a split duty job, he said It was come full-time or dont come at all, and I understand totally what that is",3
" That is correct I can see why people might have thought there were issuesI had the best eight years of my life at Chelsea, incredible experiences winning the Champions League and Premier League, so I am grateful to them But it was not a wrench joining Gareth here Im 46 and Ive never seen England in a final",5
" My eldest son is 18 and hes never seen England in a semi-final When you can try and affect that, working with an England team that delivered success, that opportunity was impossible to reject",2
Sydneys audacious bid to make the AFL finals faces another test against the last side to make a miraculous charge into September action Thursdays impressive 46-point win over reigning premiers the Western Bulldogs at the SCG lifted Sydney to a 4-7 record,2
"It bumped them three places up the ladder to 13th and ensured they will be no more than two wins off eighth by the end of the round The resurgent Swans, who have won four of their last five after a 0-6 start, get a nine-day break before tackling Richmond at the MCGThree years ago, the Tigers were in an even worse mid-season position than the 2017 Swans, floundering in the lower reaches of the ladder with a 3-10 record after four straight losses But the Tigers then reeled off nine straight wins to scrape into the top eightLong-suffering Richmond supporters are breathing more easily this season with the club firmly entrenched in the top eight with a 7-4 record",5
" They were fourth going into their bye week and cant drop more than one spot despite not playingSydney coach John Longmire is clearly an admirer of the way the Tigers go about their business and knows his team will face a tough test at the MCG on Saturday week They have been fierce around the contest, Longmire said of Richmond following the Swans win over the Bulldogs",3
"Their pressure has been enormous, thats the thing Ive really noticed this year They play a really strong hard brand of footy, so thats a good challenge for usSydney utility Gary Rohan, who pulled out with sickness a few hours before Thursdays game, is expected to be available next week Recalled former co-captain Kieren Jack dlslocated fingers late in his comeback game against the Bulldogs, but earned praise from Longmire for lifting after a quiet first halfHe was pretty important for us just in a leadership sense in that first half, and then he got going when he started to find his sea legs, Longmire said",5
" His third quarter was really good and he started off well in the the last quarter as well, went in for centre bounces, and dislocated a couple of fingers there at the end, but he was pretty good in the second half",1
What becomes obvious in conversation with Ivan Lendl is that his hard-nosed approach to the physical demands of his sport is the perfect antidote to the occasionally downbeat world view of AndyMurrayIt is a working athletes natural inclination to seek comfort in hardship,2
" If it was easy, goes the thinking, everyone would be doing it; because it is not, the best survive and prosper A word that recurs more often than most in a Murray interview is toughCertainly, with three slams to his name and the prospect of fighting for another one this weekend  after indifferent clay form, shingles, flu, injury and some struggles in his first five matches at this French Open  Murray has cause to wonder if he is in the best possible shape to play Stan Wawrinka in their semi-final on Friday He says he is Physically, I feel great, he said after defeating Kei Nishikori in four sets on Wednesday",5
"Enter his coach You have to put in consistent work to have consistent results, Lendl said on Thursday If you have three illnesses and an injury which take you out for some time, you start again",3
" You get going and you get ill or injured again, then you start again and again and again Its very difficult mentally for the player",2
Its nice that Andys healthy and he can put the practices in  and I think the results are starting to come,1
" I had a few injuries or have been ill at the wrong time of the year when I needed to do a training block It happensWith the exception of the first two or three days, when he had a bit of flu, he has been putting in great work He scraped through the first two matches and then the work started to come inMurray has also complained in the past that the four-month gap between the first two slams of the season can affect a players motivation",5
" Lendl demursOf course, you focus on the slams but, in order to play well in the slams, you have to have confidence You get confidence through winning",3
 You get winning through consistent work So you are kind of feeding into that,2
 I dont think hes low physically,1
 Hes pretty strong out there He doesnt feel tired the next day,2
" You dont lose your conditioning over two- or threeday flu If youre in bed for two or three weeks, you lose your conditioning",2
 You just shake off flu and rebound very quickly to the level you were before Im not very concerned about that,2
"Murray  along with everyone else at Roland Garros  was surprised to see Novak Djokovic wilt shockingly in the third and final set of his quarter-final against Dominic Thiem, shortly before the Scot came through his own dips to outlast Nishikori in 2hr 39min The Serb, who has not won a slam since beating Murray in last years final here, has slipped well behind him in ranking points, and left the tournament dispirited and puzzledDjokovic could not explain his dramatic collapse  especially having beaten Thiem in 11 of the 12 games they played in the Rome semi-finals",3
" Of the many theories circulating here, burnout was near the top of the list",1
"He had a public power outage at the worst possible moment and could do nothing about it after losing a tight first set  even with four chances left to repair the damageWhen Murray was asked how he has turned his tennis around this fortnight after early exits in the leadup clay tournaments where he did so well last year, he said: I was doing a lot of very basic drills, a lot of patterns of play and just literally repeating those Pretty boring",3
" Its not much fun But, when Im getting into longer rallies now, I feel like Im on autopilotHe cannot afford to crash like Djokovic did He must be fit enough on Friday to hold at bay an opponent regarded as the naturally strongest player on the tour, and who spent just 1hr 40min getting rid of Marin Cilic Wawrinka has yet to drop a set; Murray has given up three and fought through three tie-breaks",5
"Lendl concedes it could turn into a battle of strength Yeah, possibly",2
" It comes down to executing your gameplan and the conditions Different conditions favour different players on the court  or not necessarily players, but the patterns you can do and cant do [On Wednesday] it was extremely difficult with the wind [at the start of the match] Ball-striking was hard and Kei hit the ball incredibly well the first set But then it left him",5
 He was pushing Andy around because of the conditions and Andy couldnt get the timing [right] Then Kei couldnt keep the timing because of the conditions,2
"If Murray wins, he plays either Thiem or Rafael Nadal, who meet in the second semi-final",1
 And that probably will be a slugging match,1
" Of the four men left, the young Austrian hits his forehand with most venom, at 84mph, followed by Wawrinka (81mph), Nadal (79mph) and Murray (73mph)",1
"As a comparison, the Latvian who on Thursday reached the womens final, Jelena Ostapenko, has been averaging 76mph with her forehand If Murray gets to the final for the second year in a row, he will be significantly in deficit in power off the ground, whoever he playsThe British & Irish Lions have flown south, across the snow-capped Southern Alps, aware they have an increasing mountain to climb on tour in New Zealand Some are billing their looming fixture with the Crusaders as a fourth Test on a par with facing the All Blacks and a second provincial defeat in four days would add to the pressure on Warren Gatlands squadNews that Sam Warburton has an ankle strain is another setback, with the tour captain having hurt himself in the opening game in Whangarei",5
 His absence from the match-day squad to face the Crusaders does allow Sean OBrien to stake his claim at openside but represents another headache for Gatland in an increasingly trying week,1
"The 22-16 defeat against the Blues on Wednesday has generated little external belief that the Lions are building towards a series win and the release of impressively strong All Blacks, Maori and Crusaders squads on the same day has not helped, either When a young player as electric as the Chiefs Damian McKenzie cannot make even the All Blacks squad, let alone the starting lineup, New Zealand clearly have remarkable strength in depth",2
"At least the Lions have responded by naming their strongest side so far Under the leadership of Alun Wyn Jones, the third successive Welsh captain named by Gatland, this is a team with a serious edge to it, with the first-choice half-backs Conor Murray and Owen Farrell also united for the first time and Liam Williams on the wingGatland has stuck to his promise to give every player at least one start in the opening three games, with George North and Jonathan Davies featuring for the first time on this trip Nine of the XV were involved on the victorious 2013 tour and have enough experience to know that Lions tours are defined by the last three weekends rather than the opening stanzasAt least two thirds of this XV would appear to have a good chance of starting the first Test, although Gatland is insisting he has not yet commenced those deliberations, saying: The players are going to get one or two chances before we start thinking about that",5
" We havent spoken about Test combinations Plenty of others continue to do so on his behalf, however, and the centre pairing of Ben Teo and Davies is just one area set to be closely monitored by all concerned",2
"What no one disputes is that Farrell is maturing into a top-notch international player and Gatland has been as impressed as anyone Ive seen a massive development in him in the last four years, the head coach said I think hes been one of the top players in the northern hemisphere for the last two years Hes a good age, hes matured and hes calm andconfidentThe fly-half himself is also not the sort to be fazed by a little adversity, particularly in a city that has had to show such extraordinary resilience in the face of the earthquake devastation from which the region is still recovering",5
"Obviously you have to be mentally strong because of the standard of the opposition, Farrell said",1
" Weve got to have our wits about us, weve got to be in the game constantly You cant afford to have periods where youre not on your mettle against teams like this",2
"With the Highlanders, the Maori and the Chiefs also to come between now and the first Test on 24June, Farrell concedes the touring team would not want to suffer five successive losses at this psychologically important stage: I dont think we would, no Youve got to take confidence from how you perform but that also comes from how you train, how you act and how you play Games can be tipped on a knife edge sometimes, as you saw [on Wednesday] It was a first outing for a lot of boys and I thought apart from the result it was a step in the right directionThat is a slightly debatable conclusion given the way the Lions discipline and execution began to fray in the second half",5
" They conceded far too many soft penalties for Gatlands liking and also made the mistake of compounding one error with another We need to make sure were a bit smarter than that, Gatland said [Wednesdays] result was disappointing",3
 We know we cant afford to give away so many penaltiesThe Lions will certainly need to raise their game to cope with a strong-looking Crusaders side captained by Sam Whitelock and containing a posse of All Blacks,2
" We are facing some of the best rugby players in the world but we havesome of the worlds best in this team, too, the head coach, Scott Robertson, said No matter how it unfolds, this will be a game the players involved will remember as one of the special moments in their careersCrusaders I Dagg; S Tamanivalu, J Goodhue, D Havili, G Bridge; R Mounga, B Hall; J Moody, C Taylor, O Franks, L Romano, S Whitelock (capt), H Bedwell-Curtis, M Todd, J Taufua Replacements B Funnell, W Crockett, M Alaalatoa, Q Strange, J Brown M Drummond, M Hunt, T BatemanBritish & Irish Lions S Hogg; G North, J Davies, B Teo, L Williams; O Farrell, C Murray; M Vunipola, J George, T Furlong, AW Jones (capt), G Kruis, P OMahony, S OBrien, T Faletau",5

"Returning to F1 after competing in the Indy 500 where he was running strongly until his Honda engine gave out, Alonso was unequivocal about the need for the manufacturer to drastically improve their power unit",1
" His comments echoed those of McLarens executive director, Zak Brown, who warned this week that time was running out for Honda after they failed to bring hoped for upgrades to CanadaWe have to win, Alonso said If we are winning before September when I make a decision, I will stay",3
" Winning by September is not on the cards for McLaren and his options to go elsewhere are extremely limited but he insisted he would move on Things have to change, he said I want to win",3
" I joined this project because I want to be world champion and we are not in that position so if you dont see things changing and you are not in a competitive position you change projectsAlonso was equally unenamoured by suggestions that F1s new owners would be increasing the number of races to 25 in a season, stating a position Lewis Hamilton said he agreed with I started when the calendar was 16 races, plus the tests, and now we keep increasing the races year after year, said Alonso",3
"We are in a number that is quite demanding already with the life you have between the preparation, the sponsor events, the tests, the commitments, plus 20 or 21 races I think its already enough",2
"I consider that a good quality of life is more important than more seasons in F1 If the calendar stays between 20 and 21 races, I would be happy to continue but it if increases it is not for me",2
"Hamilton, meanwhile, has admitted he goes into this weekends Canadian Grand Prix on the back foot against his world championship title rival, Ferraris Sebastian Vettel",1
" After two difficult races already this season, Hamilton acknowledged that his Mercedes team need to bring him up to speed quickly at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, a track that shares traits with the others at which he has struggledHamilton trails Vettel by 25 points in the standings but crucially in his attempt to win a fourth title Hamilton has struggled with his set-up twice this season and he and Mercedes need to identify the issues if he is to keep Vettel in sight",2
"We have seen Ferrari are the quickest and that they are the favourites, Hamilton said We are working hard to rectify the issues we had in the last race and hope we can attack this weekend",2
 They have got some unique bits on the car which will work well this weekend but it doesnt mean we cant take the fight to them,1
"He was off the pace all weekend in Russia, then at the last round in Monaco he could not hook up the car again and failed to make the final session of qualifying",1
 Bringing the tyres into the right temperature for their operating window has been the major issue and it has been of greater import to Hamilton rather than his team-mate Valtteri BottasIdentifying and rectifying the problem before this weekends grand prix is paramount,2
" The track itself is similar to Sochi and Monte Carlo, a low-abrasion, low-grip surface with short-duration corners and the tyre selection in Montreal is also the same, including the ultrasoft rubber, which has proved most troublesome for Hamilton But he admitted that although he returned to the factory to work on the problem they would not be able to identify whether they have solved it until returning to the trackAfter the last race, there was a lot of information for the engineers to be working on but we didnt have all the solutions and the answers at that point, he said",3
 We have done some analysis but we will find whether or not there are new things we can improve on this weekend,1
"The three-times world champion, who has won five times at the track, remained optimistic he could put in a good performance",1
" There are lots of opportunities for overtaking here, you can follow a little better than other circuits, it suits an aggressive driving style, he saidRomanias Simona Halep will take on the unseeded Jelena Ostapenko for the French Open title after two outstanding semi-finals here on Thursday which showcased some of the best ball-striking and athleticism the game has to offerHalep, the third seed and considered a weak favourite in what was called the most open of French Opens, reached her second Roland Garros final by outmanoeuvring the second seed, Karolina Pliskova, to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-3",3
" Ostapenko, the world No47, overcame Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 with a barrage of 50 winners, the last of which put the 20yearold into her first grand slam final She is the first Latvian player to achieve the feat",2
"There was more than a sense, when Halep came from a set and 5-1 down to win her quarter-final against Elina Svitolina of Ukraine on Wednesday, that the Romanian had survived the toughest moment she would face in the tournament But the 2014 runner-up had to play well to cope with the easy power of Pliskova, the runner-up at the US Open last year",2
"Halep led 4-1 in the first set and though Pliskova hit back to 4-3, she broke again to move ahead Pliskova hammered a series of winners to get the early break as she won the second set and looked confident when she recovered from 4-1 down in the third to get back on serve at 4-3",2
" But Halep, who credits her coach, Darren Cahill, with her new positive attitude, did not panic",1
" The Romanian dug deep and returned to her gameplan, getting the taller Pliskova on the move and hitting into space It worked as she broke for 5-3 and she served out for a place in her second grand slam final Its an amazing feeling right now, Halep said Im just happy I dont know what was yesterday, I just care about today",5
 It was extremely toughVictory in the final on Saturday would make Halep the world No1 for the first time in her career but first she will have to beat a woman who does not seem to know what pressure is,2
" It is three years since Ostapenko won the junior Wimbledon title, since when she has taken time to mature, better known for her feisty attitude than her results Until this fortnight, she had never been past the third round of a grand slam and she has yet to win a Tour title Now she is one great day away from winning her first grand slam crown",3
"With the fearlessness only young players can truly show, Ostapenko bashed down winner after winner to defeat Bacsinszky in 2hr 24min The Swiss, a semi-finalist two years ago, has the greater experience and more variety but for long periods of the match she was bludgeoned Even when Bacsinszky fought back and levelled at 3-3 in the decider, Ostapenko never wavered from her all-or-nothing approach and she pulled away to become the first unseeded woman to reach the final since Mima Jausovec in 1983",3
"Both players were celebrating their birthday on the day of the match but Ostapenko will probably remember it best When I came here, of course I didnt expect I would be in the final, Ostapenko said But then, first match was a tough match as well, and I won it",3
" I think it kind of gave me confidence Then every match I was playing better and better and I got my confidence, and I think it works pretty well She was playing pretty well, and I was telling myself that I have to still play aggressive but to be, like, smarter and to not make many unforced errors",3
" And I think it helped me that I was still playing very aggressiveBacsinszky said she regretted not taking some opportunities in the first set but for the most part was impressed at the outrageous hitting of OstapenkoShes 20, not afraid of anything, Bacsinszky said",3
 She doesnt measure maybe what shes doing right now She probably doesnt care Best example is the match point,3
 I serve very well wide,1
" Shes, like, hitting as hard as she can down the line from nowhere",1
" It comes above the net and in the corner and, I mean, who tries that? Seriously? I mean, its like one out of 10 But she does it",2
 So well see if she does it at 28 years old,1
"If Ostapenko wins the final on Saturday, she will not care too much about what happens when she is olderEngland will take on one of rugbys most formidable assignments  a Test match in Argentina  with four new caps in their starting XV and a further four players whose tally of Tests is in single figures",2
" Most significant is the selection of Tom Curry, one of the twin brothers who have taken this England camp by storm",1
"Curry will become Englands youngest new cap since one Jonny Wilkinson made his debut, aged 18 years 314 days, in the 1998 Six Nations, just a couple of months before Curry was born My principle has always been that if a player is good enough, you play him whether he is old or young, the head coach, Eddie Jones, said Some players at 18 are much more mature than players at 28",3
 There were no qualms at all about throwing him in,1
"If Currys career can be half as influential as Wilkinsons, England are set fair indeed, all the more so as in this case there are two of them The Curry boys, who play for Sale, turn 19 next Thursday, so Tom will be 18 years 360 days old when he takes to the field in San Juan on Saturday",2
"Whether Englands back row ever accommodates both brothers remains to be seen  their energy and industry might work well with a heavy-duty ball carrier, a Billy Vunipola, say  but for now they compete with each other",1
" Ben was given the nod for the Barbarians game at the end of last month but had to withdraw from the bench with a back injury, so Tom replaced him, came on in the first half and was awarded man of the matchBen is not available for this match and joins Chris Robshaw and Sam Underhill as back-row forwards just failing to make it out of the treatment room The loss of Robshaws experience is a particular blow for a squad shorn of 30 players by injury and the British & Irish Lions",3
" Chris is almost back to full training, Jones said",1
" We just felt he was a bit tired Certainly, he should be available for the secondTestThe Pumas will face a XV with 345 caps, nearly a quarter of those owned by the captain, Dylan Hartley, who passes Martin Johnson to draw level with Lawrence Dallaglio and Rory Underwood as Englands thirdmost capped player",3
" All being well, both here and with the Lions in New Zealand, Hartley will claim third place outright, behind Wilkinson and Jason Leonard, in the second Test in Santa Fe on 17JuneTo conjure such names is to summon memories of Englands most glorious era But, for all the success of more recent times, a victory on Saturday against battle-hardened Super Rugby players already up to speed with the game and each other will represent a feat every bit as impressive as any Jones has managed in his remarkable England tenure to dateAs well as Curry, he awards new caps to Alex Lozowski, Harry Williams and Mark Wilson Hes a good tough player, quite similar to Robshaw, the England head coach said of the latter",5
 Hes a hard worker and a very tough player He has impressed and really deserves his opportunity,2
"Beyond the debutants, Henry Slade, Ellis Genge, Charlie Ewels and Nathan Hughes have fewer than 10 caps apiece And if England should be looking for reassurance from the bench they will find only Matt Mullan with any caps at all",2
" The anticipated debut of Denny Solomona may yet transpire, but he takes his place on the bench, having overcome the foot injury that had threatened his tour",1
" Marland Yarde starts instead on the right wingTest match rugby is about winning, said Jones You only survive in Test match rugby if you win as a player and as a coach",3
"Low on experience this collective may be, but the expectations of their coach remain as high as ever",1

"50 Balnaslow 825 Mr Satco 900 My DanceOn a grey, tense, occasionally febrile day at The Oval a Champions Trophy that has fizzled and sparked burst into vibrant life as Sri Lanka beat India by seven wickets to scenes of great joy among their flag-twirling fansThis was a hugely impressive, relentlessly aggressive team batting performance as Sri Lanka chased down Indias 321, a total built around a fine century from Shikhar Dhawan For India the match was probably lost in the middle overs as Sri Lanka bowled tightly and only MS Dhoni of that trio of grand middle order guns got into double figures",5
"Afterwards Angelo Mathews dedicated the win to Sri Lankas recent flood victims and said he hoped victory might bring a smile in some difficult times The result at The Oval has also thrown up an intriguing turn for the tournament itself, with the final fixtures in Group B  Pakistan versus Sri Lanka and South Africa versus India  pared back into de facto knockout quarter-finals",2
 It might have taken a while We may have had to dry our socks once or twice But the next 10 days look fraught with possibilities,3
"This match might still have turned late on with Sri Lanka closing in on Indias totalHaving limped his way to a feisty 47 Kusal Perera wandered off clutching a hamstring, breaking the spell of a wonderful partnership with Mathews that had seemed to be romping cloudlessly towards the finish In came Asela Gunaratne in his place, a fun, slightly clubby-looking cricketer, who poked around a little before getting off the mark with a wonderful pulled six over square leg to leave Sri Lanka needing 43 from 36 balls",3
" Gunaratne kept on swinging, plonking Jasprit Bumrah over midwicket Mathews raced to his 50 and with eight balls remaining Sri Lanka were home",2
"The large Indian crowd was slightly chastened by the end, not to mention distinctly thinned out",1
" But The Oval had been a seething and enthused full house for most of the day, with flags and colours of both nations ranged around the bleachers The first great swirl of excitement came at the toss as Mathews chose to field, offering up the prospect of another display of muscular ignition from that bravura Indian top orderAt times, though, the most striking moments in a cricket match tend to arrive with a stunned hush",3
" And so it was here midway though the Indian innings, with the deep blue platform set and the crowd cranking up the volume",1
" Rohit Sharma had got to 50 with a flipped six off Thisara Perera, bringing up the hundred without loss in the 20th over That first six was hit hard and flat and spilt over the boundary by Gunaratne, but the same shot led to Sharma being bounced out two overs later, spooning a catch to deep fine leg",2
"Enter Virat Kohli, to the familiar gale of triumphalist squeals and swoons Bathos is defined as a sudden, unintentionally humorous anti-climax Another definition might be KohlicDickwellabPradeep0, the worlds top white-ball batsman caught attempting a glide to a full-length ball that moved off the seam, as they will at times in England Kohli trudged off, the silence broken only by some who are you chants from the Anglo-Sri Lankan ultras in the OCS stand Kohli has batted five times now for India at The Oval for 54 runs and five times out",5
"At the other end Dhawan kept on motoring, that huge, pale sabre of a bat marking out a lovely high parabola and sending the ball disappearing at high speeds square of the wickets",1
" But at 179 for two the second stunned silence arrived as Yuvraj Singh was dismissed, bowled by Gunaratne jamming a full loopy ball down into the ground, feet motionless, and seeing the ball bounce back on to his stumps Asela bowls something perhaps best described as mystery trundlers",2
 This was a floaty cutter that Yuvraj just seemed to lose,1
"Exit one galactico, enter Dhoni, who got off the mark with an extraordinary helicopter-upper cut  into the crowd over wide third man The 200 came up at the end of the 38th over Dhawan carved his way to his 10th hundred in one-day internationals, seven of which have come outside India",3
" Hardik Pandya came and went, flogging Lakmal over midwicket for six before a flaccid exit next ball, swatting a wide yorker to coverDhoni rattled along to 50 at a run a ball, a patient innings studded with brutal hitting, but was out soon after whirling himself almost off his feet skying a catch to long off",2
 And for all the delirium of the crowd a score of 321 for six was imposing but still gettable,1
"Sri Lanka emerged cautiously in reply, edging to 44 from their opening 10 overs for the loss of Dickwella, caught slicing to short third man The commandingly upright left-hander Danushka Gunathilaka drove with authority and produced one spanked swivelling six over deep fine leg that clattered the seats He was joined by Kusal Mendis, who played with real wristy power all around the wicket as SriLanka got after Ravindra Jadeja, reduced on a bland English pitch to a rather glamorous purveyor of left-arm darts Gunathilaka was run out for a fine 76, his top score in ODIsMendis departed soon after for a lovely 89, brilliantly run out by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, but both Mathews and Kusal Perera carved fearlessly as Indias fielding grew a little ragged and a tough looking chase became a stately, occasionally violent procession",5
"Diego Costas decision to make public a text message exchange with Antonio Conte, in which the Italian apparently confirmed the striker has no future with Chelsea, could end up costing the Premier League champions millions of pounds with potential suitors now aware the Spain forward is unsettled at Stamford Bridge",1
"Costa, who is with his national squad having played a significant part in his club sides title success, has said he will have to find a way out given his relationship with Conte and the club has effectively fractured beyond repair Yet Chelsea have made clear to the 28-year-old that he will not be permitted to negotiate his own exit and, instead, the club will take the lead in overseeing the departure of a player whose contract has two years to runChelsea had initially hoped to sell Costa to Tianjin Quanjian for 76m but their chances of generating such a mind-boggling fee, which could have been reinvested in the pursuit of Evertons Romelu Lukaku, have been complicated by the players comments to the media after Spains draw with Colombia on Wednesday night",3
 The striker had suggested his relationship with Conte has been bad this season before relaying a text exchange between the pair,1
"Im going to be honest, the other day Conte sent me a message saying he does not count on me for next season, Costa said in the mixed zone, so Ill have to find a way out The fact the striker has made clear he has been told he can leave would appear to undermine Chelseas bargaining position with possible buyers Costa could even pursue the payment of a loyalty bonus if sold given he has not formally asked for a transfer and has been told the club are actively looking to move him on",3
"It is understood Conte had sent an initial message detailing what he expected of the player in terms of fitness work over the summer, with the indifferent tone of Costas response apparently prompting a follow-up which cast doubt on the players future The pairs relationship has been tested regularly over the managers first year in English football",2
" The first cracks opened in pre-season, when Costa had claimed a back injury prevented him from playing a full part in the managers monotonous if crucial pattern-of-play sessions, and an angry clash with a fitness coach in the wake of Tianjin first expressing interest in January testing matters furtherHe was subsequently dropped for a league game at Leicester",2
 Conte claimed that was because of another back complaint  he has been consistent in only selecting players able to play a full part in training  and had opted not to criticise the player in public after Costa was filmed enjoying a post-match beer in the dressing room following a win against West Bromwich Albion the previous month,1
" On each occasion, the Italian made clear he would not tolerate the forwards influence disrupting Chelseas pursuit of the title and, to his credit, Costa responded by leading the line effectively and taking his goal tally to 22 in all competitions His last came in the FACup final defeat by ArsenalThe player indicated in the aftermath at Wembley that he would resist any move to the Chinese Super League before the World Cup next summer, with his preference a return to his former club Atltico Madrid",3
" Yet with the Spanish sides transfer ban upheld and not due to expire until January 2018, he would face sitting out the first half of next season if Atltico mustered a bid deemed acceptable to Chelsea He is unlikely to have the patience for such a scenario",2
" I love living in Madrid but I have to think about my future, Costa had said Its complicated because I cannot go four or five months without playing",2
" I have no preference for a league, I just want to playMore plausible may be an initial switch to Milan, now under the ownership of LiYonghong, to follow in the footsteps of Fernando Torres The Spaniard ended up back at Atltico via a spell at San Siro, and Costas agent, Jorge Mendes, is believed to have been in Italy on Thursday to speak with the Rossoneri over summer recruitment Costas situation will have been addressed, although Milan have alternative forward options they may opt to pursueChelsea always envisaged adding to their forward ranks this summer, and had hoped to persuade Everton to drop their 100m valuation of Lukaku",5
" Yet even that price may rise now that their eagerness to shift Costa has been exposed The Premier League winners do retain an interest in Southamptons Virgil van Dijk, who is no longer under immediate consideration by Liverpool, and will seek to purchase a back-up goalkeeper to replace Asmir Begovic",2
"Transfers are not part of Peter Moores remit as Liverpools new chief executive and the clubs alleged tapping up of Virgil van Dijk predated his official start date in the job, but his first Premier League meeting in Harrogate on Thursday will have been awkward regardless Southampton are not the only member club to regard an emissary of Fenway Sports Group with scepticism and suspicionLiverpools owners, including John W Henry and the chairman, Tom Werner, were heavily involved in the damaging decision to withdraw interest publicly in Van Dijk on Wednesday, 24 hours after Southampton complained to the Premier League of a clandestine approach and 48 hours after it emerged the Holland defender favoured a move to Anfield over Chelsea, Manchester City and ArsenalIn a statement Liverpool clalimed that recent media speculation was the source of our regret, which raises the question of why the plug was pulled on this summers transfer priority when countless targets who have been mentioned in the media have ended up at Anfield in the past The evidence that Southampton allegedly have against Liverpool  Van Dijk meeting Jrgen Klopp in Blackpool, text messages from the manager to the player  suggests FSG would be justified in fearing an investigation into its clubs conduct should the Premier League take the complaint further",5
" That could still happen, with the Premier League having written to both clubs to request their version of events It is also worth noting that Liverpool withdrew their interest in a 60m-rated transfer, one that was months in the planning, following communication with Southampton earlier in the day",2
Liverpool are under a transfer embargo at academy level for the next two years  the second year suspended  having been found guilty of tapping up a 12-year-old schoolboy from Stoke City and offering him and his family inducementsFive years ago it was Fulham who received an apology from Liverpool after they reported the Anfield club to the Premier League for making an illegal approach to Clint Dempsey Fulham were particularly aggrieved by a report on FSGs website that claimed the USA international had joined Brendan Rodgers squad,3
" It took a personal apology from Werner to Fulhams then owner, Mohamed al-Fayed, followed by a letter from Liverpools then managing director Ian Ayre that stated: Our club can do better and we pledge that it will, before officials at Craven Cottage withdrew the complaint",1
"FSG is said to be concerned at the impact of the Van Dijk approach on Liverpools reputation, hence the sudden U-turn Its dubious record in dealing with other clubs  whether on transfers or seeking to end the collective sale of overseas broadcasting rights  suggests an inability to learn from mistakes is the bigger problem",2
"It would be breathtakingly hypocritical of other Premier League clubs, or any professional club for that matter, to condemn Liverpool for sounding out a potential recruit Equally, it is fair to accuse FSG or those who run the club on its behalf in England  the president, Mike Gordon, the sporting director, Michael Edwards, and Klopp  of turning what should have been a major statement of intent in the transfer market into a shambles The warning signs did not emerge on Monday It was 20 April when the Liverpool manager, discussing how Anfield is a more attractive proposition for recruits this summer, said: The talks weve had so far are very positive That doesnt mean it will all work out but they are really positive and they all see the progress",5
 Thats goodKlopp has missed out on a key defensive target before Liverpool had approached Southampton with a bid Van Dijk may now question Liverpools commitment to a deal that always appeared problematic given he is under contract at Southampton for another five years,3
" Liverpool have alternative central defensive targets having been conscious that Van Dijk would look elsewhere if Champions League football were not on offer  Burnleys Michael Keane, Hulls Harry Maguire and Napolis Kalidou Koulibaly are among them  but can ill-afford further blunders as they strive to build on last seasons progress Efforts to sign Mohamed Salah have also stalled in recent days with Liverpool reluctant to meet Romas asking priceIt was only last week that Moore, on his first day as Ian Ayres successor, stated that Liverpool wont be spending 100m just because Manchester City has spent 100m",3
" But Liverpool, and FSG recognise as much, do need to invest 100m-plus in a squad that will be competing, Klopp hopes, for the Champions League and Premier League title next season Considering Liverpool were offering 28m for Salah at the time and had treated a 60m target to a day out in Blackpool, Moores attempted contrast with Citys expenditure was somewhat inaccurate",2
" Citys ability to get two signings worth 783m over the line with a minimum of fuss  Bernardo Silva and Ederson  is another contrast that reflects poorly on LiverpoolThere remains plenty of time and money for Klopp to enhance his squad of course but, without another dramatic turn of events in the Van Dijk saga, the rebuilding will continue without the player he wanted for the cornerstone of Liverpools defence A severe and avoidable setbackEoin Morgan has been singled out as the most important figure behind Englands one-day revival by the teams assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, who believes their current barnstorming approach to the format comes down to the captains near relentless backing of his players",5
"After wins over Bangladesh and New Zealand, England go into Saturdays group game against Australia at Edgbaston with a Champions Trophy semi-final already sewn up and their one headache being whether to stick with Jason Roy or parachute in Jonny Bairstow as openerMorgan has previously said Roy will play through the entire tournament but his faith is being tested by the right-handers average of 6",2
"71 from his seven international innings this summer Farbrace all but ruled out a switch, however, saying it would go against the philosophy of the captain that has made their disastrous 2015 World Cup a distant memoryI think Eoin Morgan is the single biggest factor in Englands success in the last two years in white-ball cricket, said Farbrace, who stepped up as caretaker coach during the New Zealand series that followed the World Cup and witnessed something of an epiphany when the side came out all guns blazing by posting 408 for nine in Birmingham in the first ODI",3
"Andrew Strauss [the director of cricket] took a lot of credit in that he talked about a new emphasis, while Trevor Bayliss has come in as a very experienced coach",1
" But for me, Eoin Morgan is the single biggest factorIn the buildup to that game here in 2015 [against New Zealand] he talked to players about going and playing your way  therell be no one getting stuck into you if you get out playing an ordinary shot",2
 People have taken his lead and I think thats why the team has flourished,1
Roy actually made a golden duck during that watershed total two years ago in his maiden international innings but it was the selflessness shown in attacking for the team that means Farbrace is fully behind Morgans current support of the 26-year-oldHe said: We havent seen anything about him that suggests he is struggling forconfidence Weve been consistent with our selections and weve stuck by people when they havent been taking wickets or scoring runs,3
 Its always paid dividends I dont see Jason being anydifferent,2
"At no stage has he ever tried to get runs for himself to keep himself in the next game Hes always played in the way we want him to as a team and you stick by people in that caseBairstow was one of four England reserves to train in the indoor school at Edgbaston on Thursday, with the XI that beat New Zealand in Cardiff given an extra dayoff",3
"On the prospect of knocking out Australia on Saturday, Farbrace added: Our motivation is purely on keeping momentum going and playing well We think were still learning Who were playing on Saturday is irrelevant",3
 Its a case of us continuing to do well Australia have a high quality,2
" You want the players to be excited by thatNotwithstanding the vagaries of the London transport network, the biggest insult to an already beleaguered Scotland support at Wembley last November was not delivered on the pitch As English fans vacated the premises in their thousands with plenty of time to play, their team 3-0 ahead, it became tricky to distinguish this occasion from the visit of Lithuania",3
"If this seems a strange scenario to highlight, consider the reverse Should Scotland, by some miracle, find themselves coasting to victory against England at Hampden Park on Saturday there will be no rush to join the nightlife scene",2
 Precisely the same desire to stay put and celebrate applied when the Scots recorded a famous home win over France in 2006,1
"Perhaps the fact that Scotland no longer pull off the kind of uplifting, surprise results when huge underdogs breeds desperation If it has always appeared the case Scotland place more significance on a meeting with the Auld Enemy than the English  see Wembley 1977 as a case in point  respective attitudes have surely never looked more contrasting",2
"Englands supporters are perfectly accustomed to qualifying for major championships as a bare minimum While Gareth Southgate can hardly be classed as a blue-chip manager, his players collectively operate at a level from which the Scots have long since been removed",2
" But, intriguingly, as far as professionals are concerned any notion that Scotland actually care more about a fixture with England than their opposition is flawedThat idea is completely wrong, says David Weir, who won 69 Scotland caps and spent a significant chunk of his career at Everton",2
 They might play it down beforehand  like they are not bothered and its not that important a game because they are a big country who play against big countries all the time  but theyll happily rub your nose in it afterwards,1
It gets painted as Scotlands World Cup final but the reality is if England get a result they like to enjoy it and stress the importance of it,1
" They might even say how easy it was to beat us It definitely means plenty to England, albeit they try to downplay it",2
 There is always still an edge to that game,1
"For England the stakes are, of course, higher in one respect We are talking about qualification for a World Cup, says Weir",2
" England are in a decent position but that can change quickly The English players also know the stick they get if they dont win any internationalThere are many background factors that are pertinent here, of course",3
" Scotland is the smaller neighbour, for starters For so long, the production of top-class football players north of the border meant Scots loved causing embarrassment to the English  and could",2
" The negative depiction of England, particularly when it comes to sport, in Scotland would always involve arrogance",1
"It is a truism throughout football that some fans would take one-off success over age-old rivals before more tangible reward Scotlands problem is, without a major tournament appearance since 1998 and a world ranking of 61, this rivalry exists on grounds of history alone It is difficult to link battles for land dating back centuries as a motivation for people attending a football game in 2017 but the current political landscape  where an independent Scotland is very much part of the equation  fuels attitudes on both sides They want it badly too, insists Craig Burley who, like Weir, was a Scotland international based in EnglandWe tend to convince ourselves it means more to us as a mechanism to overcome [football] class deficit, particularly now",5
 Theyre depicted as caring less because of salaries and reputations,1
 I cant speak for individuals but as a whole the English lads I knew wanted it badly This theyre not bothered as much as us does not wash with meFor a spell in the late 1980s Ray Wilkins was the reverse of Weir and Burley  a decorated England international who enjoyed a club period at Rangers,3
" I always felt the rivalry was equally intense at both ends, Wilkins says What I remember was hilarity when we came to play at Hampden, with some of the antics from the supporters towards us when we were on the bus or before kickoff We used to be in absolute fits on the coach",3
" You do tend to get the impression that it means more in Scotland Most of the time when I played, Scotland were the underdogs, so there was that little bit of added intensity on their behalf But believe me  if there was one fixture we wanted to win, it was that one",3
"Jim Baxter enjoyed a superb club career but is best known as the player to do keepy-uppys in a Scotland shirt at Wembley in 1967 So much of the Tartan Armys chosen verse involves barbs, putting it mildly, towards England The trouble is, evidence that a sense of significance works both ways is increasingly difficult to find; off the field, at least",3
"1967 England 2 Scotland 3 Goals from Denis Law, Bobby Lennox and Jim McCalliog lead to the world champions being beaten on home turf1977 England 1 Scotland 2 The Tartan army invade the Wembley pitch following a deserved Home International win by the visitors1985 Scotland 1 England 0 Jock Steins men win the short-lived Rous Cup after Richard Goughs 69thminute goal at Hampden ParkThe Dutch sprinter Amy Pieters beat the British national champion, Hannah Barnes, to victory on stage two of the Womens Tour in Stoke-on-Trent",1

Thomas De Gent (Lotto-Soudal) finished in the pack to retain his overall lead  although he will expect to be spending his last day in the yellow and blue jersey on Friday with the general classification battle about to come alive,1
"This was the last opportunity for the sprinters before the race heads to the mountains for the final three days, with Chris Froome needing to make up time after he was only eighth on Wednesdays time trial",1
" He sits sixth overall, 64 seconds down on De Gendt, but it is his former team-mate Richie Porte who is seen as in pole position for overall victory The Tasmanian, now with BMC, is in second place with 37 seconds in hand over Froome",2
"On Thursday morning, the French newspaper Lquipe published a story suggesting Froome wants to ride for BMC next year but the Sky man told Cycling News the story was complete rubbish while BMC also denied having an interest in the three-times Tour winner",1
" In 2016, Froome signed a contract with Team Sky which runs until the end of the 2018 seasonUsain Bolt has revealed how the death of his close friend Germaine Mason, the British high jumper, left him so devastated that he was unable to train for more than two weeks, threatening to derail his farewell seasonThe eight-times Olympic gold medallist had been out with the 34-year-old Mason before he died in a motorcycle accident in Kingston in April, and was one of the first on the scene after the crash",3

"34m  a height that equalled his personal best  to finish behind the Russian Andrey Silnov, who cleared 236mCraig Shakespeare has been confirmed as Leicester Citys permanent manager and given a three-year contract that provides a measure of the clubs faith in him after he steered the team away from the Premier League relegation zone in the wake of Claudio Ranieris sackingLeicesters owners were hugely impressed with the way Shakespeare galvanised the players across the final three months of the season and the only surprise is that the club took so long to announce that the 53-year-old has been rewarded with the jobShakespeare, who had previously served as assistant manager to Ranieri and Nigel Pearson, won eight of his 16 matches in charge, including seven in the Premier League, ensuring that any fears of relegation were allayed as Leicester finished 12th after winning the title the season before",5
" He also guided Leicester into the Champions League quarter-finals after overseeing a memorable 2-0 second-leg win against Sevilla at the King Power StadiumAlthough he had never managed before, Shakespeare made no secret of the fact that he was interested in succeeding Ranieri shortly after he was given an opportunity in February",2
" It quickly became clear that he enjoyed the support of players who were disillusioned under Ranieri, and that showed in a turnaround that led to Shakespeare becoming the first British manager to win his first five Premier League matches in charge Staff were also impressed with the way Shakespeare adapted to the role and looked like a natural managerTalks took place with the clubs owners at the end of the season and culminated in the news that Shakespeare has been given a long-term deal to build on the results of last season",3
"This is a really exciting opportunity for me to continue along this new path in my career and to continue to work with a club and a group of staff Ive grown extremely close to, Shakespeare said Im grateful to the owners and the board of directors for their continued faith and support",2
"Our preparations for pre-season and the new Premier League campaign have been ongoing for some time, but we can now move on with certainty and ensure we are well equipped to compete at the levels now expected of a club like Leicester CityAs well as trying to strengthen the squad over the summer, Shakespeare will need to bring in an assistant manager",2
" He is also expected to add another coach to a backroom team that was left depleted when Ranieri departed along with several of the staff that worked alongside himFor Leicesters owners, who were vindicated in their controversial decision to dismiss Ranieri, Shakespeare is seen as the right man to lead the club after a couple of remarkable years, during which they have won the Premier League, flirted with relegation and got through to the last eight of the Champions LeagueCraig has shown all the qualities in leadership, motivation and talent management that are required to be successful in this role, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicesters vice chairman, said",3
"Those qualities, aligned with his firstclass coaching acumen, his knowledge of Leicester City and its philosophy, and the respect he has earned at every level of the club make him the ideal choice to help take us forwardOur primary objective for the coming years is to successfully translate the extraordinary experiences of the last two seasons into lessons that will strengthen and enhance the clubs pursuit of its longterm vision of sustainable success",2
Continuity is among the key elements to making such a process work,1
" Over the last nine years, Craig has built a unique insight into the catalysts for success at Leicester City, its impact on our personnel and the conditions needed to ensure its longevityThe Reverend David Warner, as he is now known by his Australia team-mates, has pointed to his late-night swing at Joe Root in Birminghams Walkabout bar four years ago as the turning point in his career, one that has led to him becoming the most feared of openers on the field while transforming him into a mild family man off itThe meeting on Saturday between Australia and England at Edgbaston  a match Steve Smiths side likely need to win to join their opponents in the Champions Trophy semi-finals  was always going to lead to Warners infamous punch being revisited",3
" It came after the corresponding fixture in 2013, resulting in his banishment from the start of the Ashes series that summerNow 30, married with two young children and teetotal to boot, Warner looks back at that night as the making of him, with the numbers since certainly supporting the theory given that 26 of his 31 international centuries have come since the Walkabout incidentIt was definitely [pivotal] in becoming the person I am today and not just the cricketer, said Warner, speaking four years to the day of the episode that followed Englands 48-run win and led to his being suspended, fined 7,000 and packed off to AustraliasA tour of Zimbabwe",3

" What can or cant I do?The incident, called an unprovoked physical attack by England in a statement at the time, was said to have been sparked by Warner taking offence at Root wearing a wig on his chin in the belief he was mocking South Africas Hashim Amla The Yorkshireman labelled this explanation ridiculous before the pair went on to bury the hatchet during the 2015 Ashes series People didnt look too far or deep into it to see who was in the right or wrong  and thats forgotten, the Australia vicecaptain said",3
" But thats all gone, its in the past and we can tell a happily ever after story at the end of my careerWarner said the pair would shake hands this weekend and might even return to the Walkabout if they offer him a couple of free soft drinks But while his previous nickname of the Bull has largely been replaced by something more ethereal these days, he insists the punchy side of his character has not fully disappeared",3
"It depends on what day you get me, Warner replied Most of the time, Im probably the Reverend  as they say  but look, its about coming out and winning games for Australia and being the best person I can [be] around the team and around people outside cricketWarner comes into the England match brimming with form, having crunched more one-day runs (1,957) since the last World Cup than any other batsman and top-scored in the most recent Indian Premier League, with his lower centre of gravity and brutal cut-shot making him one of the most thrilling players to watch",3
"But it is of course England who can land the knockout blow on Saturday, with Australia going into the game on the back of two washouts against New Zealand and Bangladesh that have left their hopes of reaching the semi-finals hanging by a threadWarner said: England are a very good team  one of the best in the world Theyve been playing fantastic cricket and in their own back yard, they know the conditions, they bowl well and they bat well For us, its about coming out and playing our best cricket to beat themI think the way Eoin [Morgan] has been handling the troops is fantastic  he has been the key and his form alongside Rooty has been fantastic",5
" We know Jase [Roy], hasnt been going well, but he is a key man for them at the top of the order and the same with [Alex] HalesWe have to respect each and every bowler that we face  they have been bowling well and used the conditions in Cardiff, we have to be mindful of thatThe Bull of old may have looked to try a few mind-games ahead of match but that the rebranded 2017 version is now talking up his opponents is surely cause for a hallelujah",3
A shiny bronze pfennig for the thoughts of Jrgen Klopp,1
" The man worked absolute wonders last season to earn Liverpool a place in the Big Cup qualifiers Just think about it for a minute: a top-four finish, despite a defence featuring a goalkeeper who only finally learned how to punch the ball correctly this March, a teenage striking sensation gone to seed, and Dejan Lovren Klopps reward for turning base metal into gold? The promise of some transfer money for a few upgrades",3
" So he gave sporting director Michael Edwards a list with the names Mohamed Salah, Naby Keta, Ryan Sessegnon and Virgil van Dijk on it But on the way to the shops, Edwards dropped the list",2
" Then on the way back, Edwards lost his yellow basket A-tisket, a-tasket! Wont someone help him find his basket? Was it green? No! Was it blue? No no no no! Just a little yellow basket",2
"The thick black vapour currently pouring from Klopps lugs as a result of this clanking ineptitude brings to mind one of the great quotes regarding clodhopping transfer-market uselessness What do you think theyre smoking over there?! quipped none other than Liverpool owner John W Henry, upon taking receipt of Arsenals pointlessly antagonistic 40,000,001 bid for Luis Surez back in 2013 Now, four years down the line, Henrys own club have taken needlessly self-defeating behaviour to a whole new level during their brash pursuit of Van Dijk",3
" A level which, if Henrys First Law of Negotiation Buffoonery is any measure, suggests were way beyond mere smokes, probably past hot knives too, and on to a contraption consisting of a sturdy bucket, a 10-gallon barrel of water and several metres of garden hose",1
"As if being forced into a humiliating climbdown after prematurely celebrating Van Dijks arrival wasnt bad enough, Liverpool also look like losing out on Sessegnon to Spurs and Keta to Milan, while the Salah deal has seemingly stalled over a stubborn refusal to meet a headline 42m bill, despite reports in Italy claiming Roma would be perfectly happy with 35m as a compromise Given all four transfers were recently considered shoo-ins, it may be time for Liverpools backroom staff to be given a refresher course on arm-joint/large-intestine identification techniques",2
" Although fairs fair, they did start the summer by landing Dominic Solanke, who scored twice against Italy on Thursday to send England to the U-20 World Cup final Thats Englands first World Cup final at any level since 1966  and hes the two-goal hero! So thats got to be worth something, right, Liverpool fans? Eh? Ywhat?Im a privileged footballer I could vote for benefit of my tax rate",3

"But they forget that the Warriors also have Stephen Curry backThe man who was considered the leagues best player two years running was not himself in last years playoffs Part of this was because he sprained his knee early in the postseason and didnt appear to be playing at full strength But there was something else too, something that might have had more to do with the Warriors losing the finals than an aching knee: mentally, Curry wasnt thereThis wasnt something that got much attention as Golden State built up a 3-1 lead in last years championship round, and yet it was discussed around the team",5
" Something was eating at Steph At the time, sources told the Guardian that Curry was distracted: that the previous 13 months had become too much And its little wonder: in that time he had won a title and two league MVPs, as well as adapted to a new level of fame and all the obligations and pressures that come with that",3
"While some great players are good at cutting out the chatter around them, Curry hates to let anyone down",1
" Stephs a pleaser, Bruce Fraser, the Warriors assistant coach closest to Curry, told the Guardian early in last years postseason He wants to please people, thats an incredibly redeeming quality",2
"But as Golden State struggled to get past Durants Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference finals and then lost to the Cavaliers in the finals, some around the team worried that Curry was trying to please too many people and was draining himself He still led the Warriors in scoring during the 2016 finals with 22",2
"6 points a game, but averaged just 37 assists and never played with the joy he had in the previous two seasons",2
" He appeared frustratedIn these playoffs, however, that burden appears to have lifted, and Curry has been brilliant Lost behind Durants excellent is Currys 28",3
7 points a game alongside 9 assists and 97 rebounds,2
" Yes, the thinnest player on the floor is getting almost 10 rebounds a game Quietly, he is having one of the great playoff runs in NBA history",2
"Undoubtedly the presence of Durant makes Curry and the other Warriors better Durant forces the Cavs, who are not a good defensive team, to make choices over which Golden State star they will try to stop",2
 He was huge in the late minutes of Wednesdays Game 3 as the Warriors scored the final 11 points to steal Clevelands last real chance to get back in the series His presence allows Golden State to survive Klay Thompsons shooting slump in Game 1 and Draymond Greens foul troubles,2
" He makes the bench deeper and helped the Warriors endure the loss of coach Steve Kerr, who missed most of the playoffs with back problemsStill, the Warriors should have won last years championship without Durant Several times they stood on the brink of breaking the Cavs only to fall just short",3
" Had Green not been suspended for Game 5 last year, or had center Andrew Bogut not gone down with a knee injury, Golden State probably would have won their second straight title and wed be talking about a three-year run of championships Durant helps a lot but the Warriors unselfish atmosphere that allowed Curry, Thompson and Green to thrive together also accepted the arrival of one the games top three playersThat culture, as anyone who has been around the Warriors will tell you, is Currys",3
 At some level this remains his team,1
" And when he is the Curry of old, Golden State are incredibly hard to beat And so far this postseason, Curry has been the Curry of old The enthusiasm has returnedLast season was a very unique year for a lot of different reasons and we learned a lot, Curry said Wednesday night I think we have grown and matured just mentally of how to just pace yourself through this long year and take every day as a new experience and something that you can kind of take control of",5
"He was speaking about the fatigue of following up a season in which his team won a record 73 regular season games, but he may well have been talking about himself",1
 The drain of 2016 seems gone,1
 Now the Warriors can break a new record and become the first NBA team to go 16-0 in the postseason,1
Durant has been a tremendous in these finals and yet the Warriors biggest addition to this years title round might be that they have the old Steph Curry back again,1
Paul Simpson has urged his England Under-20s to write their names into the history books after they became the first mens team from these shores to reach a World Cup final since 1966,1
" England play Venezuela in Sundays final after they came from behind to beat Italy 3-1 in the last four Dominic Solanke, who is due to sign for Liverpool, scored either side of Ademola Lookmans simple strike to propel Simpsons side into the final in South Korea, with all three of their goals coming in the final 25 minutes",2
" It is 51 years since England had a team in a major global football final, when Sir Alf Ramseys side beat West Germany at the old WembleyIts a dream to take a team to a World Cup final, Simpson, the England Under-20s manager, said I was born in 1966 and that was the last time we did it",3
" Were delighted to be in it and Ive said from the first day I am greedy and I want to go and win the final I dont just want to make the numbers up, We always thought we had a chance to go to the final Weve achieved that, but really weve achieved nothing yet because we have to go and win and put our name into the history books of English football",3
The spine of this England group has been neatly blossoming for some time,1
" Freddie Woodman, Jonjoe Kenny, Lewis Cook, the captain, and Solanke helped England to the Under-17s European Championship title in Malta three years ago and last year they formed the nucleus of the team beaten by Italy in the semi-finals of the Under-19s European ChampionshipEngland started brightly in Jeonju, earning an early corner after a surging Kenny run, but moments later they found themselves on the back foot and trailing",2
" When Cook, the Bournemouth midfielder, was penalised for handball on the halfway line, Italy took England by surprise with a quick free-kick Andrea Favilli lost his marker, Fikayo Tomori, and the Ascoli forward unselfishly picked out his strike partner Riccardo Orsolini, who fired his curling first-time effort beyond Woodman in the England goalItaly, though, failed to build upon their promising start and retreated deeper and deeper, happy to soak up England pressure",3
" Yet there was only so long they could suffocate Englands attacking talents Solanke twice went close to levelling before half-time, heading narrowly wide before forcing Andrea Zaccagno, the Italy goalkeeper, into a smart stop and Simpsons side dominated large spells of the game but eventually they were rewarded for an excellent performance, with Kenny, the Everton full-back, and Liverpools forward Sheyi Ojo, a second-half substitute, particularly influential in giving England a cutting edge in the final third",2
"Ojo made an instant impact and struck a post with a fine, bending effort before his devious cross supplied Solanke, who reacted quickest in the box to finish coolly after 66 minutes",1
" The 19-yearold Ojo then sent in another cross from the right flank, which Evertons Lookman, who calmly collected before smashing the ball low and beyond Zaccagno with 13 minutes leftItaly were deflated but England continued to pour forward and added a third when Solanke struck ambitiously from 25 yards out The forward, who will move to Anfield from Chelsea next month, saw promptly wheeled away after in celebration of capping Englands win after his powerful as effort slipped through the hands of Zaccagno, who failed to parryEnglands best finish in this competition had been third in 1993, but now they have a chance to be crowned world champions in Suwon on Sunday against Venezuela, who had earlier prevailed on penalties against Uruguay in the other semi-final Venezuela trailed to a 49th-minute penalty before Samuel Sosa equalised in added time, then won the shootout 4-3 after a goalless extra time",5
"It was a fine day for Englands youth sides On Saturday the Young Lions will defend their Toulon Tournament title in France after beating Scotland 3-0 in the semi-finals, thanks to a Harvey Barnes double and an Elliot Embleton strike just hours after the Under-20s secured passage to the final",2
"The Stoppelkamp-Alle is a rather unusual boulevard that runs for precisely 823 metres in front of the Benteler-Arena, home of SC Paderborn 07",2
" It was opened in October 2014, just weeks after the man who inspired it, Moritz Stoppelkamp, had scored the clubs most famous goal against Hannover 96, from the same distance The goal came at a high point for the club, on the day they moved to the top of the Bundesliga for the first time in their history",2
"Less than three years later and Paderborn have fallen through the trapdoor, out of the third division into the Regionalliga and amateur football Three relegations in three years: a feat never before achieved in professional German football",2
" Paderborn put up a fight at the bitter end but by the time they started swinging it was already too lateOr at least so it seemed, until 1860 Munich inadvertently did them a favour Having been relegated from the second tier, 1860 Munich failed to stump up the 10m needed for a license to compete in the third division Paderborn quickly stuffed their license application into an envelope, transferred the money to the DFB and now dare to hope that the backdoor to the third tier is still on the latch1860s fate may rescue Paderborn but, even if they are allowed to start next season in the third tier, the club is still at rock bottom",5
" Speaking after their final game of the season  a scoreless draw away at VfL Osnabrck  manager Steffen Baumgart made no excuses, saying they had simply failed Parachuted in with only a handful of games to play in April, the former Hansa Rostock striker had a simple remit: halt the slide The team picked 11 points in his five games in charge, so it is not his fault, but they still slipped over the precipice",3
"The club is currently swamped in gloom but the Paderborn story had been an uplifting one until very recently The clubs roots date back to 1907 but they took on the name of SC Paderborn 07 in 1985, when three local sides merged together",2
" Having spent most of their history in the Regionalliga, the club reached the second tier in 2005",1
" Promotion ushered in a new era of prosperity and they established themselves as regulars in the second division, spending eight of the next nine seasons at that levelThe second tier in any country is generally unforgiving and unpredictable, with a handful of teams moving through the revolving doors at both ends Clubs have to compete with lower-league upstarts who are charging up the tables, such as Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig, while fending off big-budget giants who have bellyflopped in from above  VfB Stuttgart and Hannover 96 last season, for exampleDespite the stiff competition, Paderborn made a couple of decent stabs at promotion to the top flight, finishing fifth in 2010 and 2012, before appointing freshly qualified coach Andr Breitenreiter for the start of the 2013-14 season He helped them make history that season, when a second-place finish guaranteed promotion to the Bundesliga",5
" Only a decade after playing in the Regionalliga, Paderborn were dining at the top table of German footballDespite the euphoria and the confidence everyone had in Breitenreiter, Paderborn began the season among the favourites for the drop The players, however, had no intention of playing with their old mates in the second division and began their maiden Bundesliga campaign with a bang",3
" They went unbeaten in their first four games  including that 2-0 win over Hannover 96, the game still remembered for Stoppelkamps long-distance wonder strike  to go top of the league They only stayed there for three days but reaching the summit of German football was something to sing about",2
They had bolted out of the blocks but the mission was still to squeeze as much out of their early-season run as possible and survive Next stop Munich and a 4-0 defeat Welcome to the Bundesliga,3
" Still, Breitenreiters team dusted themselves off and secured some decent results in the next few weeks, picking up another 11 points before the winter break to leave them relatively snug in 10th place at the halfway point of the seasonThe winter break can slam the breaks on any momentum a club has built up and give rivals time to regroup and strengthen Paderborn started 2015 sluggishly, quickly shedding the points reserve they had collected before Christmas, and they were soon flirting with the bottom three as the Bundesliga dream turned into the reality of a relegation fight",3
"They appeared to be sitting pretty in midtable but five of the eight teams below them were Stuttgart, Hamburg, Werder Bremen, Hertha Berlin and Jrgen Klopps Borussia Dortmund  all of whom were bound to improve And so it came to pass",2
" By Valentines Day, Hamburg and Bremen had leapfrogged them And, by the time they had lost 6-0 at home to Bayern Munich, Paderborn were also watching Borussia Dortmund drift into the distanceSuddenly things began to look serious To their credit, they did not spend a second in the bottom three until the start of March  the problem was they only spent one week out of it after then, and not the final one They fought for survival right up until the last day of the campaign but finished a point below 15th-place Hertha Berlin and went down",5
" The dream was over and the nightmare was about to beginHe had taken the club down but Breitenreiters good work had not been lost on the football world and he was appointed by Schalke Markus Gellhaus took over as interim boss at Paderborn but he only lasted only until October, when Steffen Effenberg swapped giving his opinions in a TV studio to give instructions the touchline",3
" Effenberg took over with the team already tumbling towards the bottom three but he did not lack confidence and said all the right things He was typically bullish, batting away any talk of consecutive relegations",2
" Effenberg, the Tiger, had been a winner in his playing career and hoped some of that mentality would rub off on his players in his first job in management",1
It wasnt to be,1
" Less than five months down the line, Effenberg had only steered the club further into trouble, eventually being relieved of his duties with Paderborn in 17th place, already five points from safety The new man, academy coach and former Paderborn player Rene Mller came in with 10 games to stop the unthinkable: back-to-back relegations",2
 He won nine points in those 10 games and Paderborn finished bottom of the table,1
Effenbergs appointment had been nothing short of a disaster and Mller never really had a chance,1
" Players were jumping ship and grabbing any lifeline they could, leaving the team was in constant flux, barely recognisable from the side that had performed so valiantly in the Bundesliga After two relegations in a row, the club were in freefallThey never really got going in the third division",3
" Mller was sacked in November after a 6-0 defeat to Sportfreunde Lotte, a club competing in the third tier for the first time in their history, and his replacement, Stefan Emmerling, was already out the door by Easter Paderborn were experiencing the now familiar slide towards the bottom of the league They were fighting to stay in the Bundesliga pyramid  not just with the big boys, but on the map",3
" If Baumgart been appointed just a few weeks earlier, they might just have managed it without the help of 1860 Munich",1
"Paderborn have likely been spared an arduous task Coming back up from the fourth tier is very difficult To have any chance of bouncing back into the third division, Paderborn would have needed to win the Regionalliga West outright",3
" And, while there are three places in the third division up for grabs every season, they are split between the five regional leagues: Bavaria, Nord, Nordost, Sdwest and West Six teams go into the promotion play-offs  the champions of each league and the second-placed team from the league with the most clubs (this year it was Sdwest)  where they play each other home and away for the golden ticket back into the bottom floor of the BundesligaPaderborn have shown signs of life under Baumgart, who has committed himself to the club",3
" Just days after their relegation, they lined up for the final of the Westfalenpokal, one of 21 regional cups that is effectively a qualifying tournament for the DFB Pokal, the German Cup After serving up a season of misery and struggle for their fans, they were at least able to give them something to cheer about by winning the final 3-1",2
"Scant consolation maybe, but the victory and the funds that will come from appearing in next seasons DFB Pokal may just provide a touch of solid ground to halt the downward spiral",1
" They will be even happier if and when the Bundesliga confirms that 1860 Munich have been demoted and their position in the third tier is secure Regardless of which league Paderborn compete in next season, their fans will hope that the only way is up And those walking the 82",3
3 metres down the Stoppelkamp Allee may be thinking there but for the grace of God This article is from Englische Woche Follow Englische Woche on TwitterAustralian tennis player Thanasi Kokkinakis is facing a court battle over his right to use his Special K nickname commercially,2
"A directions hearing between Kelloggs, the breakfast cereal maker that owns the right to the Special K trademark in Australia, and Kokkinakis took place in the federal court in Adelaide on ThursdayKelloggs wants to stop the 21-year-old from using the term Special K as part of a branding campaign that would include clothing and tennis wear, the Adelaide Advertiser saysSpecial K is obviously an iconic cereal brand for Kelloggs in Australia, a spokeswoman for the companys Australian division told the newspaper",3
Justice Brigitte Markovic sent the case to a mediation conference in August,1
 She also allowed Kelloggs extra time to amend its statement of claim and for Kokkinakis to file a defence The case will return to the federal court on 31 August,2
"The companys Australian trademark for Special K dates back 59 years, but the cereal first appeared on the US market in 1955 Throughout its history it has been marketed as a low-fat, low-sugar breakfast targeted at dietersKokkinakis has endured a frustrating run with injuries over the past two years and fell outside the world top 1,000 At one point, he managed only one top-level singles match in 20 months He admitted last week that the prolonged period on the sidelines had emotionally drained him",5
" Its been shit-house, Kokkinakis saidThe sportsman returned to action during the French Open this week",2
" Playing with a protected ranking of 81, he took the first set from world No 8 Kei Nishikori in their first-round singles encounter, but the Australian ended up losing in four sets",1
"Its not how, its how many Australia were far from their best against Saudi Arabia in Adelaide on Thursday night but they did enough to earn the three points that keep alive their hopes for automatic qualification for Russia 2018Two poachers goals from Tomi Juric and a screamer from Tom Rogic papered over the cracks of the latest unflattering performance from the Asian Cup holders",3
" Despite scoring inside five minutes, Australia were lucky to be level at half-time, and despite dominating the second term they failed to secure the two-goal cushion that would have seen them leapfrog their Group B opponents on goal difference",1
"Ange Postecoglou deserves great credit for extracting a much improved second-half performance after a skittish opening term At the interval Australia were second best and short of options, by the final whistle they could savour a job done, if not necessarily well done",2
"But for all the praise the coach deserves for his interventions, questions remain about the quality of this iteration of his national side Notably, the back three again looked unsuited to the task and the attacking set-up lacked the craft and flow of their opponentsEverything began perfectly",3
" Tomi Jurics beautifully taken opener rewarded his and his teams early industry Whenever a white shirt took possession two or more golden ones immediately swarmed in unison like a gang of pick-pockets This was the training ground brought to matchday; Anges archetype, relentless without the ball and composed with itBut in the blink of an eye that vim evaporated The early goal failed to live up to its cliche and instead of settling the confidence of the hosts and forcing the visitors to overreach, it somehow sucked the life out of Australias press and the Saudis took control",5
"The purposeful harrying in the middle and final thirds was replaced by ball-watching and an inability to disrupt play The equaliser on 22 minutes came as no surprise but the ease with which Australias midfield and defence was sliced open by a series of neat passes still exasperated There was no tackle, no professional foul and no tracking of the runners",3
 It was an indictment on the defensive mindset Mark Milligans value grew in absentiaThe next phase was torturous,3
 Saudi Arabia could have scored three and should have bagged at least one as Australia pondered in possession and looked unable or unwilling to adapt in transition or take the game on in broken play,1
"Plan A  used agonisingly often to reset  involved Trent Sainsbury, in front of his own D, feeding Aaron Mooy who then looked for Tom Rogic It seldom worked and around them there was a lack of appetite or freedom of thought to interpret the game on the run",2
 Time and again in this increasingly long and winding road to Russia players have declined opportunities to take responsibility Again in Adelaide there were too many passengers and too few influencers,2
 Everything productive Australia tried had the fingerprints of Rogic or Mooy on it They cannot be relied upon to deliver indefinitely,2
Rogic was excellent on his return to the side and his goal lit up the night,1
" Jackson Irvine was anonymous alongside him in his advanced midfield role and his lack of impact highlighted the benefit to this system of someone like James Troisi, one of this countrys few risk takers",1
" Troisi is a low-percentage option, shooting often and scoring rarely, but he brings an impetus to games, an unpredictability that such a predictable team could benefit from",1
"Defensively Saudi Arabia were a shambles, conceding two poor goals and at risk throughout of shipping more, but going forward their nimble combinations were everything Postecoglous sides aspire to be Yahia Al Shehri, Mohammed Al Sahlawi and Salem Al Dawsari in particular all displayed excellent technique allied with a game awareness that allowed them to keep the ball moving with one touch, probing space, keeping defenders on the turnPostecoglou has stated, admirably, that he is not managing a team whose intention is merely to qualify for the World Cup, but to go to Russia and win it",3
" On current form, that remains wishful thinking, but you have to be in it to win it, and a second win in a row after four spirit-sapping draws, is not to be sneezed at Next up, the small matter of Japan away",2
"This might have been another year of European heartbreak for Juventus, but domestically it was the same old story",1
" The Bianconeri won Serie A for the sixth consecutive season, and collected their third straight Coppa Italia as well No team had ever won either trophy so many times in succession",2
" They have made the unprecedented look routineAnd yet, this season was not lacking in drama",2
" To the contrary, there was something wild about this campaign right from the start",1
 There were 32 goals scored (not to mention three red cards) on the opening weekend alone The final tally of 296 per game was highest among Europes top five leagues,3
"Quantity is not synonymous with quality, and the gulf between Serie As haves and have nots has rarely appeared more stark",1
 Yet there was scintillating football to be found outside of a Juventus team that fell one game short of the treble,1
" Roma and Napoli each broke the 90-goal mark while setting club-record points tallies for a top-flight campaignDespite finishing third, the Partenopei might have been the most entertaining team in all of Europe A side that began the season fretting about how to replace Gonzalo Higuan first discovered Arkadiusz Milik, and then unleashed Dries Mertens into a new centre-forward role",3
" We called him a false nine to begin with Thirty-six goals later: not so muchThen there was Atalanta, a defiant example of what can be achieved with a well-run academy and a dash of trust",3
" Lazio sparkled under Simone Inzaghi before an end-of-season fade Torino gave us helter-skelter entertainment and a breakout season for the prolific Andrea BelottiSome of the best stories, though, unfolded at clubs further down the standings",3
 This season will be remembered for Crotones miraculous escape  claiming 20 points from their last nine games after previously having scraped together just 14 in 29,1
" Over at Sampdoria, lifelong fan Christian Puggioni went from third-choice goalkeeper to dominating the Derby della Lanterna at 35 years oldAnd how about Fabio Pisacane, The Guardians inaugural Player of the Year in 2016? Paralysed by Guillain-Barr syndrome at 14, then feted for reporting a directors attempt to fix a third-tier match in 2011, he finally made his top-flight debut in September His tears at the end of that 3-0 win over Atalanta were an abiding image of this campaign",3
"It was a season of farewells  from Francesco Totti to Silvio Berlusconi, but also one for new beginnings",1
" Giovanni Simeone emulated his dad, Diego, with an iconic headed goal against Juventus Moise Kean became the first player born this century to score in one of Europes top-five leagues, and then was trumped by the even-younger Pietro PellegriIf those were the positives, then we must also acknowledge some of the negatives",3
" Senad Lulic avoided a racism charge for suggesting that Antonio Rudger had been selling socks and belts before he came to Roma, but many perceived a malicious undertone to his words The Italian Football Federation then drew international condemnation for its initial failure to support Sulley Muntari when he walked off the pitch in protest at abusive chants in May",2
"Although the players suspension was eventually rescinded, the lack of coherence on such matters is dispiriting If Juves hegemony on the pitch has become predictable, then so has the absence of strong leadership from Italian footballs governing bodies off of itJust call him Diego Armando Mertens",3
" Or, actually, dont, because hes really not keen on those comparisons to Maradona But do recognise that Dries Mertens has had an astonishing season at Napoli, adapting to his new centre-forward role with such ease that it is tempting to wonder how nobody thought to try him there sooner",2
"Drafted in to replace the injured Milik, the Belgian took a few games to hit his stride, but by December he was flying Mertens followed up a hat-trick against Cagliari by sticking four past Torino a week later His eventual tally of 28 league goals came at a rate of one for every 91",3
"6 minutes played He finished one strike behind Edin Dzeko in the race to become Capocannoniere, despite starting five fewer gamesNor were goals the sum of his contribution",3
 We can debate the semantics of whether or not he should still be called a false nine (he believes that he has done enough to shed such a label) but in practical terms he was effective both playing off the shoulder of the last defender and dropping deep to direct play,1
"Napolis 2-1 win away to Milan was a case in point, Mertens providing both assists  the first a brilliant no-look pass, and the second a slick through-ball round the back of Davide Calabria to Lorenzo Insigne Above all, from one week to another, Mertens just looked like a man who was having way too much funHe is the first to acknowledge the contribution of his team-mates to his success Insigne, Jos Callejn and Marek Hamsik all had excellent seasons, as did a rotating cast of midfielders It was Mertens, though, who shone the brightest",5
" Who would have imagined, last summer, that this was the man to make Napoli forget about Higuan?5) There were not as many true overhead strikes in Serie A as we have seen in some recent campaigns (probably because Mauricio Pinilla was playing less often), but Andrea Conti pulled one out for Atalanta against Genoa 4) Its not just the smoothness of Mauro Zrates first-time finish, but the quality of the ball from Federico Bernardeschi that made this goal against Napoli so special (that said, Lorenzo Insignes finish in the same game wasnt half bad, either) 3) Did he mean it? Maradona reckoned that Mertens was only trying to cross the ball, rather than chip Joe Hart during his one-man demolition of Torino Personally, I dont really care 2) Simone Verdi pays tribute to Marco van Basten 1) Patrik Schick pays homage to Dennis Bergkamp Manuel Locatellis first Milan goal only narrowly missed the shortlist above His second, a match-winner against Juventus two games later wasnt far behind",3
" These were the teenagers first two shots on target ever in Serie AJoe Hart was named as John on the team-sheet for his first game at Torino, and wound up conceding a goal from a misjudged punch Regrettably, despite winning the adoration of his clubs fans, there were one or two more mishaps to come (hough, for the record, he did have his brighter moments in a Torino shirt, too)Taken in isolation, Pepe Reinas save from Diego Perotti this March was sensational The keeper somehow reversed his momentum in a fraction of a second when the ball deflected off Kalidou Koulibaly right in front of him, tipping it on to the post before hooking the rebound away from another attacker with his leg",5
" Context only makes the stop even more special This was the 93rd minute, with Napoli defending a 2-1 lead at the Stadio Olimpico, where they had not earned a point in five years This time, they held on to take all three",3
"In a season of seven, eight and even 10-goal thrillers, there is no shortage to choose from But Im going with Fiorentinas 3-3 draw with Napoli just before Christmas Twice the Partenopei had their noses in front, but in the end they were happy to scrape a point after Federico Bernardeschi turned things around with a sensational solo performance  evoking memories of great Fiorentina No10s such as Roberto Baggio and Giancarlo Antognoni",3
"After scoring twice, he set up a third for Zrate  a goal which, as youve already seen, made it into my shortlist for the best of the season So did Insignes opener for Napoli This was one of those days when the quality did match the quantity after all",3
"Gianluigi Donnarumma; Dani Alves, Leonardo Bonucci, Mattia Caldara, Alex Sandro; Felipe Anderson, Radja Nainggolan, Marek Hamsik, Lorenzo Insigne; Dries Mertens, Edin DzekoSubs: Gigi Buffon, Andrea Conti, Federico Fazio, Kevin Strootman, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Jos Callejn, Mohamed Salah, Federico Bernardeschi, Andrea Belotti, Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuan, Diego Falcinelli",2
" NB: Yes, 12 subs are permitted in Serie A No, I havent picked a very balanced bench But, boy, when we need a goal in the 90th minute This was the toughest decision of the lot, for me, because I can see four or five outstanding candidates",3
" Davide Nicola did an astonishing job to keep Crotone afloat, maintaining his belief that survival was achievable even when all evidence suggested otherwise He transmitted that same conviction to his players, but also knew how to keep the mood light in the face of adversity Eight points adrift in late March, he took them to train on the beachAt the top of the table, Massimiliano Allegri again demonstrated that he is one of the best managers in the world It was not a given that Juventus would proceed seamlessly after losing Paul Pogba",5
" And yet, they led from start to finish",1
"Indeed, Allegri imposed a major tactical reshuffle despite his team still sitting top of the table after a defeat to Fiorentina in January  finding a formation that allowed him to get Gonzalo Higuan, Paulo Dybala, Miralem Pjanic, Mario Mandzukic, and Juan Cuadrado into the starting XI all at the same time",1
" In doing so, he galvanised his players and pushed them to reach another level  both at home and abroadMaurizio Sarri also deserves credit for the way he remodelled his teams approach to suit Dries Mertens, as does Simone Inzaghi for his work at Lazio In the end, though, I think this award has to go to Gian Piero Gasperini",3
"Its not just that he led Atalanta to fourth, their best-ever top-flight finish, but the manner in which he did it",1
" He had inherited a bloated squad and lost four of his first five league games in charge, but thereafter put his faith in youth Gasperini picked four Italy Under-21 internationals against Napoli in October and emerged with a 1-0 victory He never looked back",3
"For such a young side, Atalanta showed remarkable resilience",1
" Roberto Gagliardini, one of the most eye-catching performers during their pre-Christmas surge, was sold to Inter in January, and yet his former team-mates kept on winning all the sameTogether with breakout stars like Gagliardini, Mattia Caldara, Franck Kessi and Andrea Conti, Gasperini was also getting the best out of his veterans",2
" Papu Gmez was reinvented as, in the players words, a false second striker, and went on to produce the best season of his careerIt is enough to think that Atalanta had already smashed their top-flight points record when they still had nine games left to go As one front page headline on LEco di Bergamo put it, the whole story was Bonkers, incredible, but marvellously true",3
"The farewell tribute to Silvio Berlusconi from San Siros Curva Sud turned out to be a few weeks premature, but was astonishing in its scale",1
 Its fair to say that the man himself was satisfied,1
"Leonardo Bonuccis oldest son, Lorenzo, was the one person looking glum at Juventuss title celebrations Understandable, really, since he supports TorinoBonucci Sr, who made up for that ordeal by taking Lorenzo to meet favourite player, Andrea Belotti, a week laterHonourable mention: Papu Gmez, teaching his four-year-old son Bautista tough life lessons with a savage two-footed challenge on the beachWhoever it was that signed off on Udinese wearing their black-and-white striped shirts away to Atalanta  who wear blue-and-black",5
" The visitors wound up having to smother their tops in tape to mitigate the clashDries Mertens, out for a walkOK, so technically Roberto Mancini was never actually involved in this Serie A season, having left Inter before it began, but his response to speculation about Mauro Icardis future last July still bears recalling",3
" I dont read newspapers or websites, he insisted",1
" And I dont watch pay-TV, if not for the odd pornoFinding out what weird and wonderful design Papu Gmez would be wearing on his left bicep this season was a weekly treat He celebrated everything from Halloween to the movie Frozen, but most iconic was his tribute to the original Pro Evolution Soccer Master League XI",3

"I dont know how much more there is to say on Francesco Totti, but it would be wrong to sign off without a final thought for one of the most iconic and brilliant footballers of my lifetime Certain fixed images of him will live long in the memory  of stunts and selfies, of that cucchiaio against Inter and of course the 2001 Scudetto",2
"Most of all, though, what I will remember Totti is the simple pleasure of the little touches, the elegance in possession and the complicated passes made simple",1
 He is one of those footballers who was so much more than can be told by any curated highlights package,1
" To watch him in the flesh was to see this sport played in a whole different wayHe truly loved it, too Indeed, his reluctance to announce a permanent retirement suggests he still does",3
" If there is an iconic image of Totti to be taken from this season, it was not that of him crying at his farewell address but rather of him warming up all alone during an 80-minute rain delay during Romas win over Sampdoria in SeptemberHis team-mates were all inside sheltering Totti just wanted to play",3
" And so he did, coming off the bench to set up an equalising goal and then convert the match-winning spot-kickTotti builds the ark, drives away the clouds, creates a rainbow and scores the penalty, gushed Maurizio Crosetti in La Repubblica at the time",2
" Superstar and demiurge, and now a meteorologist, theologian and philosopher as well",1
" Yes, the hurricane will end Yes, there is life beyond life",2
" Yes, immortality existsPerhaps, but that is not the same as saying you can play on forever Tottis time had come, as indeed had that of Silvio Berlusconi at Milan",3
" He, too, in a very different way, has been an icon of Italian football",1
" Love him or loathe him, it was he who presided over the most successful era in the clubs history, a three-decade long stretch in which they won five Champions League titles and, for a time, called themselves the most titled club in the world",1
No other team in Italy has ever enjoyed such success on an international stage Whether Milan will ever do so again remains to be seen,2
 This summer offers intrigue as both they and neighbours Inter press ahead under Chinese owners with apparently ambitious spending plans,1
" They hope that this time next year, we will not be talking about the same old story atop Serie A yet againI was in demand, remembered Phil Babb I was on holiday and every other day I was reading the papers and I was going here, there and everywhereBack in 1994, the player who was once rejected by his local club Millwall appeared to have the world at his feet Fresh from his exploits for Republic of Ireland at the World Cup in the United States, Babb joined Liverpool on 1 September for 3",5
6m  a then British record fee for a defender The very next day he was joined at Anfield by Wimbledons John Scales for 35m as Roy Evans set about attempting to transform the fortunes of a team who had conceded 55 goals in finishing eighth the previous season,3
"More than two decades have passed since then but, once more, Liverpool find themselves on the lookout for premium defensive reinforcements following a campaign that saw them concede more goals than any of the other top-four sides But whereas more than a few eyebrows were raised in 1994 when Evans shelled out more than 7m for two centre-halves, the changing landscape of the modern transfer market means his successor was contemplating making Virgil van Dijk the most expensive defender in history until they were forced into a dramatic climbdown on Wednesday after being accused by Southampton of tapping him upKlopp must now find an alternative  and quickly  in an environment that saw Manchester City shell out 47",3
5m on John Stones last August and looks as if it will become more frenzied as the summer goes on,1
"I dont think they will ever be the same level as the strikers but the amount clubs are prepared to pay for outstanding defenders has certainly increased, says Scales, who stayed at Anfield for only two seasons before moving to Tottenham The number of clubs at the top of the Premier League that had defensive problems last season shows there is a lack of depth in that area and that helps to drive up the price for those few that there areTheres clearly a lack of top-class defenders who are available and clubs are prepared to pay ever more to get them, so that inflates the price",3
 When you have Sunderland earning 100m for finishing bottom of the table then it shows just how much money teams have got to spend now,1
 Add to that all the other teams from Europes top leagues and it quickly drives the prices up,1
"David Luiz remains the costliest defender of all time after his 50m move from Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain in 2014 That ranks only 14th in the overall list but after several higher bids were received by Napoli last summer for the Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly, it seems a matter of time before that is broken",2
"Its a cliche but a player is worth what a club is prepared to pay for him, says Scales, who works for the English Schools FA and as a pundit for Sky Sports coverage of the Eredivisie",1
 Its very difficult to weigh up all the factors that must be considered but one of the most important things for a defender is maturity There are exceptions to the rule but generally you want a defender who has three or four years more experience than a younger playerAttacking-wise you can take more of a risk to allow them to develop their talent in a slightly less pressurised way because youre rotating them more until they have established themselves properly,3
 A club will have more options offensively so some of them can be taken out of the firing line much more easily than expensive defenders that youre buying to go in there and form a unit,1
" You need that maturity and physical development to be able to do that because if you make a mistake it usually leads to a goalSince the purchase of Eliaquim Mangala for an eye-watering 42m in August 2014, City have been particularly wasteful in their pursuit of a high-class defender to partner Vincent Kompany Nicols Otamendi arrived the following summer for 34m, meaning that the purchase of Stones took their outlay past the 120m mark and Pep Guardiola is thought to be weighing up a new approach for the France defender Aymeric Laporte from Athletic Bilbao, who has a 65m release clause",3
" Meanwhile, Manchester United could surpass the 30m they paid for Eric Bailly last summer with the signing of Victor Lindelof from Benfica or to bring back their youth-team product Michael Keane from Burnley",1
"In terms of value for money, they may be better served taking a punt on one of the young Ajax defenders who performed so admirably in their run to the Europa League final",1
" Matthijs de Ligt does not turn 18 until August but the Holland international has been tipped in his homeland to be the first 100m defender, and the Colombian Davinson Snchez has been linked with Barcelona in recent weeks According to Scales, however, things are never that simple",2
"Youve got to be wary of the Dutch League because the pace of the game isnt as intense as the top leagues and players need time and space to adapt to moving up a level, he says",1
" Having said that, if youve got the talent like both of them have then you have a great chanceThe problem is you never know how they are going to do until they are thrown into the next level Looking at the personality and mentality of the players is sometimes more important than their playing ability",3
" Thats why it is so crucial that clubs do their due diligence properly1 David Luiz, 50m Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, 20142",3
" John Stones, 475m Everton to Manchester City, 20163 Eliaquim Mangala, 42m Porto to Manchester City, 20144",3
" Shkodran Mustafi, 35m Valencia to Arsenal, 20165 Nicols Otamendi, 34m Valencia to Manchester City, 2015While Im prepared to deal with the real world from time to time, as occasion demands, there are days when Im particularly grateful for the diversion provided by the world of horse racing",2
" For reasons that you can doubtless divine, this is one of those days and perhaps you, like me, will be delighted to see an absorbing Sandown card scheduled for this eveningOf course, it would have been more absorbing if the nap, Utopian Dream, hadnt become a non-runner because of a high temperature",2
" Alas for John Gosdens filly But theres still 12-1 about Envoy (700), which seems just a bit mad to me in light of his maiden success last month, his first outing since being gelded in the autumn",3
This is a big horse who might reasonably be expected to do much better now than in his first couple of juvenile outings and indeed his return to action was a big improvement on what went before He will also be well suited by some rain-softened ground,2
His opening mark looks pretty reasonable to me and I can only think he is such a big price because hes trained by James Eustace in a race featuring some more fashionable trainers But the upside on Envoy is about as promising as anything else I can see in the race,2
On To Victory (7,1
"35) is proving more popular at 9-4 in the following race From the Eve Johnson Houghton yard which is contriving to stay below most radars while winning plenty of races, he got off the mark in his first handicap a fortnight ago, beating a Clive Cox favourite On To Victory is 8lb higher against a couple of unexposed types but the extra quarter-mile looks like good news and, again, he is proven on ground with some cut",3
The pick of the prices this afternoon might be 14-1 about Boots And Spurs (330) at Ripon,2
" Hes on a pretty serious losing run since last summer but came within inches of ending it at Thirsk two runs ago, on soft, and things didnt work out so well for him last time",1

"50 Mustaqbal 920 ReinforcedDavid Warner, the Australia vice-captain, has questioned whether his board truly want them to beat England at Edgbaston on Saturday given the release of a video during the week that has proved a major setback in the continuing contract disputeCricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers Association are at loggerheads over the proposed end to the revenue-sharing model that has been in place for 20 years, and with a 30 June deadline approaching before their contracts expire  after which players would be free agents  time is running out for a new memorandum of understanding (MoU) to be agreed",3
"The two parties had recently resumed talks about a possible end to the impasse, only for the boards lead negotiator, the executive general manager, Kevin Roberts, to release a video on Wednesday in which he described the current system  one the players want to keep  as unbalanced and unsustainable when it comes to the funding of grassroots cricket",1
"It prompted the ACA to hit out at half-truths from Cricket Australia and, with Steve Smiths senior mens side in all likelihood needing to beat England to progress to the Champions Trophy semi-finals  Eoin Morgans side are already through after winning the Group A  the timing of this video, believes Warner, is poorly judgedAt the end of the day were here to win and if Cricket Australia want to try and help us win I think they wouldnt be releasing videos like that, said Warner, who has previous suggested his team-mates could even strike during the Ashes series at the end of the year",2
 We have an important game coming up this week and that is our focus and the MoU can wait until after the game and the tournament But from where we sit as players its been the same as weve always said: 100% support of the ACA to get to the table with CA,2
"For us were just sticking here together as one and all the players around the country and as weve said we just want a fair share but leave it until after the gamesUnder their proposed new system there are improved terms for female players at state and international level but, while the international men will also be better off under a capped system, it separates them from the domestic players, who will be relatively worse off",2
" At present all professional male players share a fixed 20% of the revenueSpeaking before her teams departure for the upcoming World Cup in England, the captain of the Australia womens team, Meg Lanning, said: All the players are behind a revenue-share model for all cricketers, and weve been able to stay really strong and well continue to do that and hopefully theres a resolution pretty soonLanning and Smith requested in writing in February that the board deal solely with their union  a request that has been ignored, with the latest video from Roberts one of two in recent weeks, to go with emails sent directly to the elite players that included an offer of multiyear central contracts",3
"Ederson made sure he left Benfica for Manchester City with a bang In the goalkeepers penultimate league match for the Portuguese champions, not only did he keep his 17th clean sheet of the season, he also got an assistA goal-kick from the 23-year-old led to Benficas second goal in a 5-0 defeat of Vitria Guimares It was a kick that found the forward Ral Jimnez on the edge of the Vitria penalty area, the Mexican controlling it with his feet before turning it into the goal with his head But not only was Edersons kick enormous, it was clever",5
" It took advantage of the fact that his forward, dallying so far upfield, could not be found offside from a keepers dead ball",1
" It is a little-known rule but understandable; after all, who is going to kick it that far anyway?Prowess with the ball at his feet is thought to be a central reason why Pep Guardiola has made Ederson, depending on how you interpret historical exchange rates, either the most or the second most expensive goalkeeper in history It is an incredible accolade either way, given that the record is held by Gianluigi Buffon, perhaps the greatest goalkeeper of all time It is even more impressive when you consider Ederson has played only a season and a half as a regular at a major club",3
"The Brazilian played as a youth for his hometown club of So Paulo, before Benfica took him to Portugal at the age of 16",1
" Not uncommonly, the move did not work out and the teenager moved on, first joining the second-division side Ribeiro then Rio Ave His performances with the Primeira Liga minnows persuaded Benfica they had made a mistake The club brought Ederson back in a deal that cost them only 500,000 up front but granted Rio 50% of any future transfer fee (20% of which, in a not entirely surprising development, then goes to Edersons agent, Jorge Mendes)",3
"Ederson arrived as understudy to his fellow countryman Jlio Csar, but when Csar was injured in March 2016 the younger man seized the gloves and never gave them back",1
 His performances in domestic competition have been consistently assured but it was his display against Borussia Dortmund that got Europes elitetalking,1
"Eventually humbled 4-0 in the return leg at the Westfalenstadion, Benfica won the first leg 1-0, but they would have lost that too were it not for the Brazilian The standout moment was a penalty save from Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang Ederson not only out-thought the striker by staying on his feet as the ball flew down the centre of the goal, but he completed the save with a club of a punch that drove the ball clear of goalThis was the second penalty that Ederson had saved in the competition but it was far from his only moment in the match His speed of movement denied Ousmane Dembl a goal from six yards out and the length of his reach allowed him to turn a Marco Reus 25-yard effort round a post",5
" Best of all was a save from Christian Pulisic The Americans fierce volley from outside the penalty area took two deflections but still Ederson found a strong hand to turn itwide Within a month, the Portuguese press reported that Guardiola had made a personal call to Ederson to persuade him to come to City",3
"Ederson has all the talent to become a top-class goalkeeper, says Vitor Alvarenga, editor of the Portuguese magazine Maisfutebol The special ability that made Guardiola pay attention is that he is very strong with his feet, but Ederson also has not only the agility of a great keeper but the security too I believe he will soon be the No1 keeper with BrazilAll the noises are that Ederson will soon graduate to the Brazil team This, combined with his age, his footballing ability and the fact he recently renewed his Benfica contract, has meant his price is high",5
"Paradoxically, given the travails of Citys last big-money goalkeeping recruit, Claudio Bravo, it is Edersons confidence on the ball that could be his weak spot, says Alvarenga",1
 The risk is that he has to show he can cope with the pressure of a top league,1
" In the Primeira Liga, he is facing minor teams 80% of the time",1
 Ederson has a great game with his feet but in some matches he has shown overconfidence He will have to learn how to be able to control thatWhen Ian McGeechan coached the Lions in New Zealand in 1993 his policy with the media was simple: say nothing in a polite way,3
" He knew, even at a time when the Lions were a rugby entity rather than the commercial juggernaut they have become, that a difficult tour would become onerous if the tourists generated negative headlines through a word or two out of placeHave a quiet word with him afterwards, as you were able to in those days, and you were given something more sustaining than gruel, but on top table, in front of New Zealand journalists, he would be like Geoffrey Boycott, dropping his bat to loaded questions and returning them gently to his inquisitors",2
"McGeechan was circumspect in Australia and South Africa, not wanting to incite a media agenda, but especially so in New Zealand where questions tended to be more technical and rugby-oriented As a Kiwi, Warren Gatland knew what to expect on this tour, but even he was surprised at the persistent questions this week, before the defeat to the Blues, about the physical, confrontational gameplan he has employed with Wales this decade, caught on recording devices making a whispered aside at the end of one media conferenceThe subject became live after Saturdays opener against the New Zealand Provincial Barbarians, where an expected comfortable victory turned into one where the Lions were grateful to kick the ball into touch at the end, and a disdainful comment made by the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, about Gatlands favoured style of play in his long coaching careerNever mind that the Lions hardly rolled Warrenball in Whangarei where they played in the first half as they should in the second and vice versa, taking liberties before the game was won They sought space rather than contact but a number of factors, not least untried combinations, skilful opponents, unforced errors and a rusty scrum-half undermined them",5
 It was only when they went back to basics that they pulled ahead,1
Hansens remarks were more complimentary than insulting and clearly self-serving,1
" The underlying message seemed to be that he would rather the Lions try to take on the All Blacks at their own game, which is regarded as throwing the ball around and taking risks, than have them play for territory and drive through the forwards, exposing his players to a game they are not familiar withNot that New Zealand leave too much to chance The Lions attack coach, Rob Howley, who had been kept away from the media since the announcement of the squad until Tuesday, talked about how in training they are trying to produce rugby chaos, uninhibited and unstructured play, but that is not the All Blacks, who combine deliberation with skill, pace and precision",3
"New Zealand sides tend to score their tries from set pieces, taking advantage of the 20-metre gap between backs at the lineout and 10 at the scrum to create space out wide by passing with alacrity, off-loading, kicking and turnovers And a few interceptions",2
" They do not see much reward in multi-phase moves, and the Lions travails in Auckland, when they failed to turn possession into tries, showed whyA productive tactic of Gatlands Wales earlier this decade was to get ball from the top of the lineout quickly into the hands of Jamie Roberts for the centre to smash his way over the gainline, take out any number of defenders and set up quick ruck ball",2
"Successful teams now, like New Zealand and Saracens, see the lineout as a licence to score tries by exploiting space rather than sending a juggernaut on a rumble The Wales way, as it was with the scrum, witness the 2013 Six Nations decider against England, was to use it first as a means of gaining a penalty",2
"The ploy was devised at a time when the pace of the game was slower and attacking teams were given less latitude at the breakdown by referees For all their battering of England in 2013, Wales only scored two tries, both in the final quarter, but more are needed now",2
" When the Lions captain, Sam Warburton, said this week that his side would need to score at least 20 points to beat the All Blacks, he was out of date: that amount would have been enough to defeat them only seven times in 94 Tests this decade; 30 points would only have been enough 45% of the timeFor all the talk this week about Warrenball and boshing, the Test series will be defined at least as much by how the Lions cope in defence against an attacking style seen infrequently in Europe, and almost never in the Six Nations Organised chaos is one way of putting it with the chaotic usually referring to the defence, again as the Lions found five minutes from the end in Auckland when they conceded a try out of the Super Rugby playbookThe Barbarians gave the Lions a taste in Whangarei, so quick to detect opportunity, but they lacked the pedigree of the teams that were to follow, starting with the Blues, the runt of the Super Rugby litter, the New Zealand equivalent of the Premierships Gloucester or the Pro12s own Blues, CardiffIt was a clash of styles: the set-piece superiority of the Lions against the ball-handling skills and opportunism of the Blues",5
" The Lions were more coordinated than they had been on Saturday and they tried to play with continuity, but they were exposed to a game that is foreign to the Six Nations and not prevalent in any of the major leagues in Europe: the skill of the Blues, who had three tries ruled out on review, trumped power",1
"Why did Joe Schmidt, a New Zealander, all but outlaw the offload after taking charge of Ireland? Why did Gatland, another Kiwi, adopt a rigid gameplan with Wales having lamented, like Graham Henry before him, that innate talent was not complemented by basic skills such as passing? Because they recognised that players in Europe were generally less skilful and intuitive than in New Zealand and so they played to the strength of their charges Eddie Jones has spent most of his time in charge of England talking about the need for players to take more decisions, appreciating that unless they are able to produce plays such as the one that won the match for the Blues, they will struggle to wrest the World Cup off the All BlacksAttacks on Warrenball are misdirected: it is the game as a whole in Europe, starting with the complacent Six Nations which bills itself as the greatest tournament in the world, which it will only have a chance of becoming if countries start finding tickets hard to sell, that is being questioned",3
A common excuse for conservatism in the Six Nations in the opening rounds is the weather,1
" It rained in Auckland, but the adventure of the home side was not dampened",1
" It is what New Zealand know now, but in 1971 it was the Lions who attacked with aplomb and the All Blacks who were direct and predictableAt least the Lions will be well prepared for the All Blacks, but they are taking aim at a moving target They repaired faults after the opening game, clearing out harder at the breakdown to secure quicker ball and reading kicks quicker, but new ones were exposed",3
"It is the New Zealand way, constantly exposing faultlines, but the opening Test is not a lost cause The Lions have a foundation in the set pieces and goal-kicking, but it is wider out, in attack and defence, where there needs to be a difference",2
" With a tilt to McGeechan, they need to say nothing, no matter how many words it takes: torque, not talk This is an extract taken from the Breakdown, the Guardians weekly rugby union email",2
" To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructionsHaving held 22 managerial jobs at 17 Portuguese clubs throughout his long and continuing career, Vtor Oliveira has shown he has an extraordinary and irrepressible nomadic streak",2
" But the 63-year-old is known throughout Portugal for far more than just his wanderlust Over the course of his 32-year managerial career, Oliveira has achieved promotion 10 times, including an unprecedented five in a row in his last five seasonsAfter calling time on a nondescript playing career in June 1985, the 31-year-old midfielder was quickly installed as manager of his most recent club, Portimonense, who just so happen to be the club he manages today He showed little of the skill that would help him make his name in his first job and soon found himself seeking alternative employment After a brief spell with FC Maia, Oliveira took over at Paos de Ferreira, where he achieved the first of many promotions at the end of his third full season",5
" Oliveira led his team out of the Portuguese second tier and kept them up the following season, improving his reputation and earning a three-year spell as manager of established top tier side Gil Vicente, before moving on to Vitria de GuimaresOliveiras spell in Guimares proved far from favourable and within less than a year he had set sail again, this time to lead an ambitious project at Acadmica de Coimbra The move proved inspired and he secured the second promotion of his career in the 1996-97 season, guiding Acadmica to the top tier",3
" Oliveira stayed with Acadmica for just one more season following their promotion before opting for another change of scenery, taking the Unio de Leiria job He stayed for a single campaign, just long enough to guide the team to the league title and, of course, promotion to the Primeira Liga",2
"His success in Leiria gave him the chance to manage Braga, an opportunity that showed his stock was rising But, after just three wins in his first 14 league matches, Oliveira set his sights south once more  geographically and competitively  as he returned to the division he had come to know so intimately, taking a job with Belenenses He arrived a few weeks before Christmas but, by the end of the season, he had secured a runners-up place in the league and an immediate return to the top tier  the clubs first promotion in almost a decade and Oliveiras fourth in nine seasons",3
"Then came something of a barren spell, the worst of Oliveiras career to date",1
" He stuck with his club-hopping credo, ducking in and out of short-lived spells with clubs old and new  Rio Ave, Gil Vicente, Acadmica, Moreirense  but could not replicate his recent success Things picked up in the 2006-07 season, when he helped Leixes achieve promotion, but but then came another six years of relative hardship, with spells Unio de Leiria, Trofense and Aves bringing scant successFortunately for Oliveira, this period of stagnation was the precursor to a complete shift in fortunes as his move to Arouca in 2011 brought about an astoundingly successful period, even by his own lofty standards",3
" Oliveira steered Arouca to second place in the 2012-13 season, securing his sixth promotion, then stepped down in pursuit of a second spell at Moreirense, where he claimed his fourth second-tier title, along with his seventh promotion",1
"Unio da Madeira were the next lucky recipients of his close-your-eyes-and-point-at-the-map technique of career choices They secured his services in the summer of 2014 and, sure enough, they finished runners-up the following May and earned the seemingly inevitable promotion to the top tier, where they joined nine of their coachs former clubsNot that he stuck around to enjoy the company",3
" By the time the club kicked off in the top division, Oliveira was off in search of yet another promotion party, this time with Chaves",1
 Another second-place finish in 2015-16 brought Oliveira his fourth promotion in as many seasons,1
"This time last year, Oliveira brought his managerial career full circle by joining Portimonense, the club where his grand journey had begun 32 years ago And how exactly did his old club fare under Oliveira? They won promotion, of course, as champions no less",2
"As another long summer ticks by, the allure of a sixth promotion in six years must entice the coach But Oliveira says he wants to stay at Portimonense Im going to continue in Portimo, he said at the end of the season",3
" Whether or not he will be able to stifle his impulse to drop a division in pursuit of another promotion remains to be seen Perhaps he will stick around and try to win the Primeira Liga, one league he has yet to conquer",2
 This article is from These Football Times Follow These Football Times and Will Sharp on TwitterManchester City have confirmed the signing of the goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica The 23-year-old Brazilian has cost 40m (347m) and becomes Pep Guardiolas second signing of the summer after the midfielder Bernado Silva,3
"Edersons fee is a British record for a goalkeeper but is eclipsed by the 53m Juventus paid Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001 He will formally join City on 1July, when the transfer window opensI like everything about Manchester City, Ederson told the clubs website",3
" This is a great club, the league they have here in England and they have amazing fans and they play splendid football I have always had the dream to play in English football and now Im going to make it true",2
"With Pep Guardiola, City are growing more and more",1
 He is putting in place a young team for the future Those were important factors in making my decision,2
 Manchester City has an amazing squad,1
" I think they managed to have a good season Next season, we will have to be focused to achieve the goal of winning trophies",2
"The signing of Ederson takes Citys contingent of Brazilians to four, joining Fernando, Fernandinho and Gabriel Jesus The goalkeeper has played for Brazil at age-group level but not for the senior team He was named in the provisional squad for the Copa Amrica last year but injury forced him out of the final reckoningEderson, born in So Paulo state in Brazil, went to Benfica as a teenager but left to play for two smaller Portuguese clubs  Ribeiro and Rio Ave  before rejoining in 2015Guardiola signed the goalkeeper Claudio Bravo from Barcelona last August but the Chile international failed to impress and Willy Caballero was preferred at times",5
" Caballero is among the players who have left City this summerEderson said of English football: I have always watched it on TV My impression is that it is a very intense game, box-to-box",3
 The grounds are always full and the stadiums are nice,1
" This is a very captivating football The competition here would motivate any player Im ready, Im always readyIm going to try to adapt to this league as quick as possible Everyone knows here the competition is ferocious",5
 Its a bit different than the Portuguese league,1
At Benfica I played a little bit more advanced and I was involved a lot in the game I think that revolution in the way goalkeepers get involved in the game was very importantI already had that skill to play outside the box,3
" When I played for a team [RioAve] lower down I didnt have the chance to play far from the goal, I had to stay close to it But when I went to Benfica, I was able to improve what I knew and play further out getting more involved in the games, being more active",2
 I have been developing that since,1
"1) Cheick Tiot tragically died on Monday after reportedly suffering a heart attack while training with his club in China If you havent already rewatched his famous volleyed equaliser in Newcastles 4-4 draw with Arsenal, here you go",2

"3) LeBron James is sick and tired of losing to the Golden State Warriors, and LeBron James is sick and tired of answering your stupid questions This isnt the first time he has responded spikily to reporters: two weeks ago he called out WHBCs Kenny Roda: Theres this weird thing with you, Kenny You always come around when we lose, I swear And in 2011, he blurted out ask me a better question tomorrow when he was with the Miami Heat Maybe LeBron should take a leaf out of Russell Westbrooks book: I just dont like you",5

"LeBron James had 39 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for the Cavaliers, finishing one assist short of a record-breaking ninth career playoff triple double, while Kyrie Irving added 38 pointsBut they couldnt hold off the relentless Warriors during the final minutes, with Durant depositing the long-range coup de grce over James outstretched arm The sports best player, as it turned out, was no match for its best teamI said it after we won the Eastern Conference finals that were getting ready for a juggernaut, James said afterward Its probably the most, most firepower Ive played (against) in my career",5
" I played against some great teams, but I dont think no team has had this type of firepowerSo even when youre playing well, you got to play like A-plus-plus, because theyre going to make runs and theyre going to make shots and they got guys thats going to make plays",2
" So we made enough plays tonight to still win the ball game, but they made a couple moreAfter Irvings missed three-pointer on Clevelands last full possession, four Golden State free throws closed the show And just like that, the Cavaliers title defense is all but finished: no team in league history has ever rallied from a three-games-to-none deficit to win a playoff series in 126 previous tries",3
"Theyre a juggernaut of a team, do a great job of spacing out the floor, keeping a high tempo, and just made some big-time plays down the stretch, Irving said",1
" You got to give credit when credit is dueAdded Warriors coach Steve Kerr: Overall, it was just an incredibly tough, resilient performance It wasnt our smartest game that we have played all year, but it was maybe our toughest in terms of our ability to just hang in there",3
"The Warriors no doubt expected Clevelands best shot in the early stages given the stakes and they got it James pumped in 15 points on 7-for-8 shooting in the first quarter, including a thunderous dunk in transition over Durant and JaVale McGeeHe was aided by JR Smith, who had not made a shot in only five attempts over the previous 95 minutes of game action, but added a pair of three-pointers in the opening frameBut when James went to the bench for a breather, the Warriors rattled off 10 straight points to extend a 39-32 lead at the end of the quarter Cleveland was shooting 61",5
"1% from the floor and LeBron was off to a sizzling start, yet the Warriors were still leading by sevenBoth teams cooled after their torrid start, though James at times singlehandedly kept the Cavaliers within touching distance of the Warriors manifold attack By the time LeBron scored on a spectacular left-handed reverse layup to win a one-on-one matchup with Durant and close Golden States lead to 46-45 with seven minutes left in the half, the Cleveland superstar had posted 23 points  more than half Clevelands total  on 10-for-11 shootingThe Cavaliers had faded badly after half-time in the opening two games, but instead on Wednesday surged ahead behind more sensational play from James That carried over into the fourth quarter, where they led 113-107 with three minutes left",5
"Now the Warriors will look to finish the series, and their bid for a perfect postseason, in Friday nights Game 4, a markedly shorter turnaround after no less than three-day breaks before the opening three games",1
"I think well all be fine, Thompson said",1
" This is the most minutes I think we played all year between me, Steph, and Kevin",1
" And Coach Kerrs done a great job managing our minutes And we know whats at stake, and thats an NBA titleSo we wont be tired because we got adrenaline on our side and we got to act like this is a do-or-die situation We dont want to go back to the Bay and win it; we want to finish it here and forget this game quickly and lock in tomorrow morning and get ready for a battle on FridayHe cracked a small smile, then didnt miss",5
 All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has never been one to waste an opportunity,1
" This time it was to rubbish his Lions counter-part, Warren Gatlands claim theres little between New Zealands Super Rugby teams and what the All Blacks will bring to the three testsTheres a huge gap, Hansen suggested with a knowing shake of his head",2
"Hansen had just named two uncapped players in a largely predictable squad Both are from the Hurricanes Midfielder Ngani Laumape is the joint leading try scorer in Super Rugby with 14 and Jordie Barrett is one of three from the same family, alongside lock Scott and World Rugbys best player last year, Beauden",3
"Two of the Blues backs who made life difficult for the Lions the previous night were also named  Sonny Bill Williams back after missing last year with Sevens duties and an achilles injury suffered at the Rio OlympicsBlues wing Rieko Ioane entered a logjam of quality outside backs and will get another crack at the Lions with New Zealand Maori a week before the Test, along with his brother Akira, who is one of five players on standby for the All Blacks, and halfback Tawera Kerr Barlow Before that game the Lions play an All Blacks-heavy Crusaders team and the Highlanders, who will have backs Lima Sopoaga and Waisake Naholo, and forward Liam Squire released for the match",3
"It paints a bleak picture for the Lions, with Gatland having tried to soften the defeat to the Blues by claiming they and the other four New Zealand Super teams are on a par with the All Blacks I dont think there will be a lot of difference between some Super Rugby sides and the All Blacks, Gatland saidHansen tossed him a bone when he said the former All Blacks hooker was trying for a bit of humour after reacting poorly to earlier suggestions his game plan was a predictable bash-fest",3
" I dont think theres any comparison between Super Rugby and Test rugby, Hansen said with a nod and a chuckle He was probably just trying to make a light commentHansen made it clear he sees the Lions as a serious threat whatever happens in the games that precede the Tests Ive always said this and I still believe it, I think theyre the best Lions side to come here Gatlands made it very, very clear that the first Test is all hes got his eyes on",5
 I dont think theyre too bothered about whats happening between now and thenIt would be foolish of us to think we can just rock up and expect a soft game,2
" Well get the kitchen sink thrown at us and we need to be ready for thatHansen touched on the Lions schedule, declaring the three-day lead-in to the first game was too tough and not something the All Blacks would have agreed too Given that, he dismissed the performance against the Barbarians and said the loss to the Blues showed the players were still trying to establish combinationsTheyre in the infancy of this tour, Hansen said Theyll only get better and better",5
" Theyll be a good side when the Tests come around Its well documented that thats all they want to win anyway, they just want to win the Test matchesHansen has named a formidable squad to counter the best of Britain and Ireland, those picked reflecting the depth he has to sift through and the form of many in the Super competition",3
"There are, though, a few injury concerns Hooker Dane Coles isnt expected to feature in the first two tests having been sidelined since mid-March with concussion Midfielder Ryan Crotty is also in doubt with a rib injury while Ben Smith and Brodie Retallick have concussion issues",3
" But there is a lot to like about this squad There is x-factor and speed in the backs while the pack is simply the best New Zealand has to offerThe only quibble would be the exclusion of Steven Luatua, but his departure soon to Bristol meant others were considered ahead of him Laumape is a bold and inspired move He has been in terrific form for the Hurricanes and deservedly pushed past incumbent All Blacks George Moala and Malakai Fekitoa",5
"And yet, Laumape may not feature in the Tests given Williams considerable ability, and if Ryan Crotty is able to shrug off a rib injury Williams was a colossus in the Blues win against the Lions and revealed he is lighter, stronger and faster since his return from injury",2
" Im starting to feel nimble, I just need more games, the two-time World cup winner saidWilliams said he never thought his career was over when he ruptured his achilles in Rio, but confessed to moping about for a bit",2
" Then I made the decision I wanted to be a better player and thats what Im striving forGiven how well he played for the Blues, the Lions will be wondering just how much better he can be for the All Blacks Williams will also test Gatlands theory about just how close the Super teams are to the All Blacks It could give Hansen another small chuckleOutside backs: Jordie Barrett, Israel Dagg, Rieko Ioane, Waisake Naholo, Julian Savea, Ben Smith",5

"It was the first meeting between the two sides since their controversial match at the 2014 World Cup when Uruguay forward Luis Surez bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, and was subsequently suspended from football for four months Surez missed Wednesdays game through injury while Chiellini came on as a substitute in the second halfIn the seventh minute of the match, Lorenzo Insigne launched a long ball forward and Andrea Belotti chested it down with his back to goal  only for Atltico Madrid defender Gimnez to take it off his foot, inadvertently rifling a shot past his own goalkeeper Fernando Muslera",3
"Uruguay, also missing Edinson Cavani through injury, rallied in the second half",1
" Martn Cceres headed the ball into the net on the hour but the goal was harshly disallowed for a foul on Riccardo Montolivoder diverted Manolo Gabbiadinis shot into the net with a close-range header in the 83rd minute, before De Rossi scored from a penalty in stoppage time after Stephan El Shaarawy was tripped by the hapless GimnezIn Murcia, Real Madrids lvaro Morata rescued a draw for Spain against Colombia to extend Julen Lopeteguis unbeaten start as national coachDavid Silva opened the scoring for the hosts in the 22nd minute, turning home Pedros cross, but midfielder Edwin Cardona equalised for Colombia five minutes before half-time Falcaos 55th-minute header from a corner gave Colombia the lead, as they extended an unbeaten run against European sides stretching back to 2011",5
"While other Real Madrid players were rested, Morata  a late substitute in the Champions League final  was brought on for Iago Aspas and earned a draw in the 87th minute, heading in from Sal guezs left-wing crossIt would be daft to get too excited at England grabbing their semi-final slot days before anyone else",2
 This does not guarantee a romp to the final and then the trophy But the current climate makes a change to the agonising postmortems that accompanied Englands early flight home from the 2015 World Cup,2
"The margin of New Zealands defeat in Cardiff  87 runs  was misleading After 30 overs of their run chase the Kiwis were 156 for two in pursuit of 311; Kane Williamson, after some early scares, was cruising with Ross Taylor in his wake There was no sign of an imminent capsizeThe New Zealand captain looked serene, rarely inclined to play a shot that involved risk, which was why Morgan had turned to the nearest he has to a shock bowler, the galloping Mark Wood He needed a wicket badly",5
" Then the ball misbehaved, bouncing steeply and flicking Williamsons glove; Jos Buttler took a testing catch safely",1
It may be that Morgan had a bit of luck since treacherous deliveries cannot be summoned up to order like pizzas But from this moment on England did not require any luck Morgan and his bowlers did not miss a trick,3
The next batsman was Neil Broom and for the first time in the match a short leg was posted Morgan must have noticed how Williamson had stared at the treacherous spot on the pitch before departing like a man betrayed Here was the Kiwi captain suggesting that the fates were against him and his side,3
That short-leg fielder was unlikely to take a catch but he was delivering a message to Broom This surface was no longer to be trusted; the ball was popping (there was some truth in this since both Williamson and Taylor had been disconcerted earlier in the innings); more importantly there was no harm in reminding the new batsman of this,2
" England were now hunting for wickets rather than containmentThere was a message here for Morgans pace bowlers: bang the ball into the pitch not at bouncer length, which was the policy employed by New Zealand when bowling from that end in the second half of Englands innings, but just short of a length, preferably using the cross-seam method Then something might happen Somehow the ball seems to grip the surface when bowling cross seam at Cardiff, a handy discovery by Stuart Broad a year or two ago, which had been dutifully passed onFrom here Morgan was in control on a day when the little things were counting for something  like the decision to give Jake Ball the first over; he had been carted for over 80 in two of his last three outings",5
" But Morgan wanted him to start in place of Chris Woakes, an expression of confidence in someone who was considered a borderline selection before the game",1
 How did Ball respond? With a wicket and two maidens and ultimately the man-of-the-match award in a game when there was no obvious recipientThe other borderline selection was superb,2
 Rashid obviously has not been sulking since his omission against Bangladesh,1
 The suspicion is that Morgan must have convinced him that this was no slight on his ability or temperament,1
" The conditions were nasty for a wrist-spinner: a gusting wind, a pitch offering little turn, those much-mentioned short, straight boundaries Yet Rashid has seldom bowled better for England; there was barely a bad ball; the googly was employed frequently, which can be a sound indicator that his confidence is highIn the field Morgan attacked adroitly throughout (not just with his brief dalliance with a short leg)",3
 With the departure of Williamson Morgan kept his seamers going and the asking rate started to climb; a less confident captain might have slipped on his vulnerable spinner immediately to shed the remaining four overs required from a slow bowler In any case Morgan had faith in RashidSo for 20 overs on a blustery Cardiff evening England were brilliant,3
" But it was only 20 overs They must get better and contemplate whether a change of personnel is required No prizes for the next name to surface: Jason Roy The advice is echoing around Some advocate that he should be more circumspect, that he should try just to bat some overs before elaborating",5
That sounds like poor advice to me and I suspect this is the last thing Morgan will be saying to him Roy is in the side because he is prepared to bat in a maverick manner at the top of the order,2
" That is what England want him to do He has neither the temperament nor the technique to play like a proper, old-fashioned opener So if selected, he must be allowed the freedom to continue playing his way",3
Whether Roy should continue to be selected is another matter,1
 It would be convenient for England if they could play Roy and Jonny Bairstow on Saturday,1
" However, England are likely to be hellbent on playing their best side even in a free game After all, the opponents are AustraliaChris Smalling, one of the players whose competitive courage has repeatedly been questioned by Jos Mourinho over the last season, has said it is wrong to allege he is not willing to put his body on the line and insisted he can supply the hard evidence to show the Manchester United manager was wrong",3
"Smalling chose his words carefully to make sure he did not say anything that could be construed as direct criticism of Mourinho but the centre-half said it was not true, contrary to what his manager had implicitly stated, that he was reluctant to play unless he felt 100% fit",1
"Mourinho clearly has a different view judging by the number of occasions when he has publicly challenged Smalling, as well as Phil Jones, to speed up their recovery from injuries, at one point stating that if he had the same problem he would declare himself fit the next daySmalling was one of the players to whom Mourinho was referring when he complained that the attitude was cautious, cautious, cautious and, again, when he talked about the player missing a game against Swansea City last November and spoke at length about there being a difference between the brave, who want to play at any cost, and the ones for whom a little pain can make a difference",2
"Those comments backfired on Mourinho when it emerged Smalling had a broken toe but played with the injury two weeks earlier at Chelsea, a 4-0 defeat when the defender needed two pain-killing injections to be involvedSmalling, on England duty preparing for the game against Scotland on Saturday, confirmed there had never been an apology from his manager No, its just professional, he said",3
 All of us are professionals and no player wants not to play That was all just [him being] professional  get on with the rehab and then get out as quickly as you can,2
I think that was directed at everybody,1
 We had a lot of injuries at that time and he was frustrated that quite a lot of players werent available,1
" He knew the picture in terms of liaising with the medical staff and he was just frustrated, the same as us players who wanted to be on the pitchAsked about the specific allegation that he would not play unless 100%, Smalling said: I think in the Chelsea game I proved that I would play with injections",2
"I had done the injury, I played on and it turned out there was a break I had a couple of injections but it got worse and thats when I had the layoff You always want to push yourself because you dont want to let the fans or players down Obviously he didnt know the full extent at that time You just keep playing until physically you cant and that was the story with the break",5
 But I dont think he knew the full picture then and once it was cleared up it was all good,1
"Mourinho did, however, come back to the same point on several occasions when Smalling damaged a knee later in the season and it did not help that the injury was inflicted when he and Jones tackled one another in a training session with England We dont hold anything back, either for our clubs or on international duty, so injuries are going to come, Smalling said",2
 It was unfortunate that we are obviously from the same club,1
" Thats been the story of this season, unfortunately Ive been lucky in previous seasons not to be too injury-prone",2
"Smalling went on to describe himself as a leader and, referring to Mourinhos public challenges to accelerate his recovery process, he said he would take it as a complimentIt comes back to the managers frustrations, he said When Im sitting down with the manager and the medical staff we set out a timeline and then we try to shave it, and push and push  because the longer it takes the fewer games you have",3
 They are always trying to push us as much as they can,1
" The manager has shown his frustration but we [injured players] are just as frustratedIts good when he shows that frustration because it shows he wants you back out on that pitch If he wasnt interested, he would just leave you alone and he wouldnt say any of these things So I take it as a positive, as a challenge to get back as quickly as I can  which I would have done anyway, regardless of whatever was saidMarcus Rashford believes Gareth Southgate determined what was best for England as well as for the Manchester United striker when selecting him for the senior squad rather than allowing him to continue his development in the under-21s this summer",5
"Rashford, who scored 11 goals in 53 club games last season, registered a hat-trick on his only appearance for the under-21s, against Norway last September, and the coach, Aidy Boothroyd, had hoped to take him to the European Championship in Poland, which starts next week However, Southgate opted to protect the striker after a hefty workload last term, with the 19-year-old seeking a ninth senior cap against Scotland on Saturday having earned his place in the squad on merit",2
"The Football Association has in the past been keen for players to gain tournament experience in their age-group teams before playing exclusively for the senior side, and Rashford is still eligible for the under-20s, who are excelling at the World Cup in South Korea He [Southgate] has had to think about whats best for England and for me as a player, Rashford said",2
" Im happy to be with the seniors and to continue my development Its important to be on the same pageIts something you look forward to, being selected for your country",3
" You have the under-20s in South Korea doing well, and the under-21s going into a tournament",1
 Whatever age group youre called upon [by] its important you have a mindset where youre going to achieve great things,1
 To me its not being fast-tracked,1
 Theres been a lot of games; England and United have dealt with it in a positive way I feel comfortable with the position Im in,2
Rashford is one of three strikers available to Southgate for the qualifier against Scotland and Tuesdays friendly in France after Jamie Vardy withdrew because of a thigh injury suffered in training on Tuesday,1
" The forward felt a twinge and has returned to Leicester City for treatment, with his departure described as precautionary",1
 Harry Kane will start at Hampden Park and Jermain Defoe joins Rashford on the bench,1
"The United manager, Jos Mourinho, had made clear his preference was for Rashford to be retained by the seniors rather than drop back into the under21s",1
" There was, however, no dialogue between Mourinho and Boothroyd, who had long since grown resigned to being without the 19-year-old at the finals I want all the best players but my job is also a development role, said the coach In the end it never came down to Jos It was about me talking to Gareth and listening to what he had to say because hes the bossIf he thinks Marcus would be better suited to the senior team and had gone past the under-21s, then I can put my tuppence worth in  which I did  but in the end, for the best of everybody, Marcus went with the senior team",5
" Since March he has been scoring goals regularly He has become Manchester Uniteds No1 goalscorer, their key player in the magnificent season theyve had",2
" If hed had a bit of a dip it would have suited the under-21s more but the fact that he has just kept on going means he comes into the senior team I think once youve moved [up], youve moved",2
"Rashford was utilised more regularly in a central role at United after Zlatan Ibrahimovic suffered a serious knee ligament injury in April and had no qualms about stepping into the void left by the Swede I knew how I would react, he said",2
" It is more about what other people learnt about me Going into that situation some people had different opinions of what would happen, but none of that mattersWe got the trophy we needed [the Europa League]",3
" If you dont believe in yourself you cant expect other people to believe in you, so I was confident going into the games It is just another step that you take individually",2
 Taking on the responsibility of being in that role is something you take pride inMarcus Rashfords decision to visit victims of the Manchester terror attack in hospital was motivated by a desire to show the city remains united,2
"The Manchester United striker, with his club-mate Jesse Lingard, made use of a day off from England duty on Monday to spend time at Manchester childrens hospital with youngsters hurt in the blast after the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena just over two weeks ago, which left 22 people dead",1
" A further 119 were injured Rashford, who was raised in Wythenshawe, and Lingard attended Sundays benefit concert at the Old Trafford cricket groundIt was our spare time and this is something we wanted to do, Rashford said We thought it was important If you can make a difference, its important you do so",5
" Going there and seeing the victims, helping them smile and having a laugh with them, creates a good feeling",1
 Friends of friends of mine were affected,1
 Manchester is a small place and it was more than likely that I was going to know someone who was a victim thereWe are with the families as much as we can be and its important the families know that Thats one of the reasons why we wanted to visit the hospitals,3
 We are doing all we can to support the families and the victims of the attack Things like the concert and going to the hospital shows the families and people around the city we are together and we have to fight it together,2
"Manchester United are set to increase their offer for lvaro Morata to 60m after their first bid of around 52m was rejected by Real MadridJos Mourinho has identified the 24-year-old as his primary attacking target for this summer after France international Antoine Griezmann confirmed he will not be leaving Atltico Madrid Negotiations with Madrid have taken place this week, with Uniteds first offer of 60m (523m) turned down as the Champions League winners value him significantly higher at 90mUnited are understood to be confident of persuading the Real president, Florentino Prez, to settle for a reduced fee if they can pay the majority of it up front for a player who returned to the Santiago Bernabu Stadium from Juventus last year after Madrid exercised a buyback clause of 30m",5
" Chelsea had also registered an interest in Morata, who scored 20 goals in all competitions last season and helped Spain draw their friendly 2-2 with Colombia on Wednesday night, but are now believed to be closing in on a deal for Evertons Romelu LukakuAlvaro is a player who wants to play a more important role, his agent Juanma Lopez told Foot Mercato on Thursday He wants to play more",3
 Which is normal for an attacker who has scored 19 goals I do not know (if he will have another season at Madrid),2
 This has been a brilliant season for Real Madrid who have won many titles The player will take a clear and definitive decision in the coming days,2
" I have not yet met with the representatives from Real MadridAsked about reported interest from Milan, he added: It existed and continues to exist, like other big teams who are interested in a player of his qualityMadrid are also keen to sell James Rodrguez, with the Colombia forward thought to be available for around 60m, although there is less enthusiasm for that pursuit at Old Trafford",3
" Meanwhile, Paulo Dybalas agent has denied reports that the Juventus forward is a target for both United and Chelsea by insisting the Argentina international wants to remain with the Serie A champions Paulo signed a new contract with Juventus last month He is happy in Turin, Pierpaolo Triulzi told the GuardianPakistan lived up to every well-worn trope about the mercurial nature of their cricket, delivering a resurgent, prediction-defying performance in the field followed by a tense run chase that felled South Africa via Duckworth-Lewis and kept their Champions Trophy campaign aliveSarfraz Ahmeds side had been written off as no-hopers after their lamentable defeat to India here on Sunday",5
 But as the rain fell in Birmingham and forced the players off at 7,1
"38pm, his batsmen were 119 for three from 27 overs, chasing 220 to win, and 19 runs above the par score of 100 Victory was theirs when the match was called off at 944pm",3
"It had followed a gloriously absorbing passage of play in the most compelling contest of this already soggy tournament Babar Azams unbeaten 31 from 51 balls and a similarly watchful 26 from Mohammad Hafeez had battled to keep their side north of the crucial equation in front of a vocal Pakistani crowd and amid the growing mizzle and murkWhen the latter became Morne Morkels third victim in a hostile performance from the right-armer, as AB de Villiers shuffled his Duckworth-Lewis sheets Pakistan were just one run ahead",3
" But Shoaib Malik emerged with a flurry of boundaries in an unbeaten 16 that would ease the tension and prompt huge cheers when the skies fully openedDe Villiers said: If I had known it would only be 27 overs, I would have attacked a lot more on the field We have to up our ante a bit",3
 We started well against Sri Lanka [to win] and we know which areas to work on,1
"That Pakistans overall target was so meagre came down to a transformed performance in the field after losing the toss, as players policed the inner ring as if their lives depended on it Sarfraz, speaking afterwards, credited an honest team meeting in which there was no shouting given their training day was ruined by the weather",2
"In quintessential Pakistani fashion they also got the two white balls to move off the straight for the first time seen in this tournament Hassan Ali, the slippery right-armer from Punjab, was the chief destroyer with this, picking up three for 23 from eight overs including two in two balls as the eighth-ranked side limited the top-ranked team to 219 for eight from 50 overs",2
"The tone was set by the leftarm seamers, Mohammad Amir and the recalled Junaid Khan, but it was the spinners who inflicted the first bout of panic in the South Africa dressing room",1
" With dots mounting up through this renewed collective effort, Imad Wasim and Hafeez reduced the Proteas to 61 for three in the 15th over, capped off by De Villiers experiencing his first golden duck in ODI cricketThe left-armer Imad struck first, pinning Hashim Amla in front on 16, before Hafeez  unused against India  repeated the trick to Quinton de Kock on 20If Edgbaston was throbbing at this stage, it found a whole new level when DeVilliers rocked back to his first ball from Imad and carved it straight to backward point Whats eating South Africas captain at present, given his similarly distracted dismissal against Sri Lanka, is anyones guessFrom here it was over to Hassan, who after persuading Faf du Plessis to chop on to his stumps on 26 produced the burst for the ages as from around the wicket and with just a smidgeon of line-holding movement, the edge of JP Duminys bat was found to reward an attacking wide slip, followed by the removal of Wayne Parnells off-stump first ball",5
"That South Africa did not implode fully came down to Dave Millers unbeaten 75, defying his usual belligerent style in stands of 47 and 49 with Chris Morris and Kagiso Rabada and finishing the innings with a bludgeoned four Junaid accounted for both of his tailend partners before the conclusion, with Hassan  the man who dropped Yuvraj Singh on Sunday  summing up Pakistans head-scratching upturn with two swirling catches in thedeepPakistans reply began in bold fashion, Fakhar Zaman attacking anything wide in a breakneck 31 from only 23 balls",3
" The debutants opening salvo was ended at slip via a smart off-cutter by Morkel, followed by Azhar Ali ramping the rightarmer to third man on nine to prompt a steady ascent first from Babar and Hafeez, before Shoaibs decisive late cameo",1
"Warren Gatland believes that his British & Irish Lions squad could yet upset the All Blacks despite their frustrating lastgasp 22-16 defeat against the Blues in Auckland Gatland has warned his players, however, to stop conceding soft penalties if they are to put a tough start to their 2017 tour behind them",2
"With a string of tough provincial games ahead, notably the Crusaders match in Christchurch on Saturday, Gatland argues his side will be uniquely well prepared when they do finally encounter New Zealand in just over three weeksThere is so much strength in depth I dont believe theres going to be a massive amount of difference between the Super Rugby sides and the All Blacks, the Lions head coach said",2
 These guys have been together for seven months and the All Blacks are coming together cold We will have learned a lot from tonight and learned a lot about the opposition and I think we will keep improving,2
"Look, we know the quality of the New Zealand sides but I thought it was a big improvement from Saturday It was [settled by] a moment of magic which you do get from New Zealand teams We have to be a little bit better at stopping their offloading game but we will continue to improve",3
"In the dressing room, too, Gatlands assistant Andy Farrell has been stressing the need for players to be more clinical and not give sides like the Blues easy points",1
" The big message from Andy Farrell to the players was the penalty count and penalties that were avoidable, Gatland said",1
 In the first two games we have been a bit soft in that area We have to be hard on ourselves as players and coaches to make sure we definitely tighten up in that area because it is causing us a few issues,2
 If we cut down the number of penalties we give away its going to make a big difference,1
"The Lions have slight fitness doubts over the Irish centre Jared Payne who aggravated a calf problem in Wednesdays game, and the Welsh fly-half Dan Biggar, who failed a head injury assessment",1
 Both are unlikely to feature this weekend when a number of likely Test starters are expected to be involved After Christchurch the team will travel to Dunedin to face the Highlanders on Tuesday,2
"The scrum-half Rhys Webb said the result would make no difference to the squads morale Were not going to drop our heads, well review the game, learn from it and move on, he said",2
 Theres no sense of panic,1
" We knew it was going to be tough, we knew it was going to be a challenge coming over",1
 These teams are pretty special and the strength in depth theyve got in these teams is amazing They can make tries from anywhere and score tries from anywhere,2
" We just need to stay alert for the full 80 minutesHe also paid tribute to Sonny Bill Williams, who had a highly influential game in the Blues midfield and helped to set up a spectacular winning try for Ihaia West Hes a monster, isnt he? Webb said",3
 Everyone knows what he can do; he got them over the gain-line and hes got that class about him,1
" We know hes going to be a threat in a couple of weeks time, so it was good to play against him now",1
" Hes special, hes an athlete and hes worldclass He showed a couple of glimpses today of what he can do",2
" Hes been out with injury, but hes coming back into a bit of form now",1
" We need to be on our money to stop him in a couple of weeks timeThe Cavaliers may be down in their NBA finals rematch with the Warriors, but LeBron James is far from outDo I look tired? the Cleveland superstar said at his teams shootaround Wednesday ahead of Game 3 against the Warriors",3
 I feel great Im averaging a triple-double in the finals,2
" Im pretty good, I would thinkJames is averaging 285 points, 130 rebounds and 110 assists, but hes been outshone by defensive assignment Kevin Durant, whos averaged 35",5
5 points and 110 rebounds as the Warriors have taken the first two games of the best-of-seven championship series by a combined 41 points,2
"Theyre playing well, James said They are playing exceptionally well, and I dont get involved in whats going on in the summertime or things of that nature Im too far removed from those talks and communications and all the things that go on So at the end of the day, I want to win just as bad as they doCleveland was in a very similar spot a year ago, when the Cavs lost the first two games by 48 points, won Game 3 and then overcame a three-games-to-one deficit to win their first title",5
"In addition to all he does on offense, James has also been assigned to cover Durant Its unlikely Cavs coach Tyronn Lue will change the matchup at the start of Game 3, but he did use guard Iman Shumpert on Durant for portions of Game 2According to ESPNs research, the first two games of the series were played at a faster pace  possessions per minutes  than any of James previous 212 playoff games",3
" The three-time champion stopped driving to the basket in the second half of Game 2 and he looked spent on the bench when he took a break during the third quarterThe Warriors are a perfect 14-0 so far in the postseason, and they seem intent on revenge after giving up a 3-1 lead to the Cavs in last years finalsJames, however, also rejected any notion that the Warriors are any hungrier than he and his teammates",3
"I want to win just as bad as they do and obviously they probably got a bad taste in their mouth after what happened last year and we had one in our mouth last year from what happened the year before, James said",1
" Ive had a few bad tastes in my mouth from what happened in the finals, so and Ive always had that feeling so it never changed for meBoris Becker, who split with Novak Djokovic in December, says the Serb urgently needs another full-time coach to replace Andre Agassi, who was not in his box on Wednesday when Dominic Thiem knocked him out of the quarter finals of the French Open after beating him 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-0 in front of a stunned audience",2
"The defending champion, who appeared to give up in the third set, admitted: Im not close to my best, and I know that",1
" But he refused to blame Agassi, who returned to the United States on Friday after watching only three of his matches The former world No1 has not added to his 12 slams since winning here for the first time in 2016Novak certainly has to make a clean cut, said Becker, who helped guide Djokovic to six majors in three years, on Eurosport",3
" He started to work with Agassi, a new super-coach However Agassi missed the second week when Djokovic needed him there the most He has to find a new Tour coach",3
" It is said that there were conversations with some coaches who will support him, but this has to happen fast and not during Wimbledon, because Djokovic has to take advantage of the next three or four weeks to come backDjokovic insisted: Dont put Andre in the midst of this",2
" The final set, thats all me Were gonna try to get together in Wimbledon, but thats all for now",2
" His influence and impact on my game, its gonna take time Its not something that comes out in the first week We have spent seven days together",3
 We just got to know each other We will see where it takes us There have been a lot of changes with the team and so forth,3
" Im so excited to work with Andre and the new teamThiem took just one game off Djokovic in Rome two weeks ago The 23-year-old Austrian said after the best win of his career that it was, understandable that Djokovic appeared to be suffering mentally at the end of this match",3
" The key for [my] first victory against him [after five straight losses] was to win this close first set, and then have a good start to the second setThiem plays Rafael Nadal for the fourth time in a month on Friday The nine-time champion earlier went through on a retirement win over Pablo Carreno BustaDjokovic said of the world No7 who bamboozled him over two-and-a-quarter hours on Court Suzanne Lenglen with slice and power: Thiem is one of the up-and-coming rising stars Hes very hungry to beat you and to get his hands on a grand slam trophy",5
 Hes got a really good chance,1
" It was not there for me today, especially in the second part of the match I was unable to hit the ball well, hit too many unforced errors",2
 He was getting better and better and more confident as the match progressed He deserved to win,2
 He was definitely the better player on the court todayI love this sport,2
" Im motivated as any other player on the Tour Even though I have played for many years, I still want to do well The least I can do is give my all whenever Im holding a racket in my hand But sometimes circumstances are such that you are not able to perform as well as you wantI always expect a lot from myself, but its a fact that Im not playing close to my best, and I know that",5
 All the top players have been through [it],1
" I guess youve got to go through it, try to learn your lessons and figure out a way how to get out of it stronger Its a big challenge, but Im up for itAsked if he would take a break to refresh his mind and body, he added: I was planning to play only Wimbledon",3
" I might play a lead-up event; I might not I have responsibility to the game itself, towards others",2
" Its not an easy decision to makeThe British Horseracing Authority and the executives at tracks such as Ascot and Goodwood have  quite understandably  had little or nothing to say so far about the developing crisis in the Gulf, which places British racings two biggest benefactors from the region on opposite sides of a blockade",2
"Godolphins Sheikh Mohammed is the defence minister of the United Arab Emirates, part of a coalition led by Saudi Arabia which has cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar",1
" Land, sea and air links have been severed, while Qatari citizens in the UAE have been given a fortnight to leave The Saudi-led coalition accuses Qatar of support for terrorist groups and destabilising its neighbours, claims that Qatar deniesThus far, the BHA has noted the British governments encouragement of a strong and growing trading relationship with Qatar, and that it is not currently aware of any change in that regard Ascot, meanwhile, simply stated the obvious, pointing out the significant contribution that Qatar has made to British racing in recent yearsOf that, there is no doubt",5
" European racing in general  and the sport in Britain in particular  has benefited hugely from Qatari largesse It takes colossal wealth to buy your way on to the top table in international racing, and both Sheikh Fahad al-Thani and Sheikh Joaan al-Thani, members of Qatars ruling family, have done so in double-quick time, not just via their bloodstock but also through long-term sponsorship deals with major tracks",2
"Goodwood has a 10-year deal for sponsorship of its summer Festival meeting which is due to run until 2024 Qipco, whose board of directors are all members of the ruling family, has a deal to support the Champions Series and Champions Day at Ascot which also expires in 2024 The new money has led to significant boosts in prize funds, and helped to keep prices buoyant at the major yearling sales Champions Day, the BHAs most cherished project in recent years, might have struggled to get off the ground without Qipcos support (and disappointment at the viewing figures for Champions Day on Channel 4 was, it is rumoured, a factor in the decision to switch coverage to ITV)Any situation which threatens to disrupt or terminate the flow of Qatari money into British racing is one that the biggest beneficiaries will view with alarm, to say the least",5
" The al-Thanis are young men in their early 30s, and apparently as enthusiastic about racing as Sheikh Mohammed and his brothers were when they caught the bug, back in the 1970s There has been a growing, and possibly dangerous, assumption that the latest billionaires to fall in love with the turf would be around for decades to come",2
"And it is still very possible that they will But however the current crisis plays out, it is a reminder that even where billionaires with sovereign wealth are concerned, nothing can ever be taken for grantedIt is difficult to imagine where British racing might be now without the staggering sums that have found their way into the sport since Sheikh Mohammed took a train to Brighton in 1977 to watch his first winner",3
" But the next generation of the Maktoum family does not, as yet at least, seem to share the same zeal for the sport as the one before Nor is there an obvious heir at present to the Juddmonte racing and breeding empire, which has seen the Saudi prince Khalid Abdullah race such brilliant horses as Dancing Brave and Frankel over the last 40 years",2

 Ginter wants to know where Bosz sees him as fitting into his plans,1
"It is inconceivable to believe and ludicrous to suggest that Novak Djokovic will not rediscover the spiritual drive and technical facility that lifted him to the summit of his sport here only 12 months ago But there were extended moments towards the end of the defending champions shocking three-set defeat against Dominic Thiem on the 11th day of the French Open when that prognosis seemed wholly validLosing in the quarter-finals of a slam is hardly a disgrace But when the third set screamed by in only 20 minutes there was a disturbing sense of surrender in the Serbs demeanour Later, his press conference felt like a wake that turned into a reading of the will, as Djokovic pondered his immediate plans, while giving his conqueror duerespect",5

" His sole, meagre success was to prevail in the one rally that went longer than nine shots He hit 12 unforced errors, a third of his total for the entire match The score tells the story of his weakening resistance: 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-0 in only two and a quarter hours  the same time it took Hsieh Su-wei to beat Johanna Konta in the first round of the womens drawThiem played very well but, as Mats Wilander, who won this tournament three times in the 80s, observed, Djokovic played as poorly as he can have done in the past seven or eight years He will drop to at least No3 in the rankings on Monday, possibly No4",5
" He has not been outside the top two since he launched his magnificent assault on his opponents in 2011 It seems so long agoThiems challenge, meanwhile, is to keep his composure for the semi-final on Friday against a rampant Rafael Nadal, who earlier had the benefit of a retirement result against his Spanish compatriot Pablo Carreo Busta when leading 6-2,2-0",3
As Thiem said courtside: Its amazing how difficult it is to go deep in a grand slam You have to play the best guys round after round Its not getting easier on Friday,3
 It could not have been much easier on Wednesday,1
"There are moments when champions have to draw on the powers that make them special Djokovic has recovered from unpromising positions so many times that even when he looked down and out, there was hope Yet the passages of disappointment began to mount with such alarming regularity that, after a couple of hours, it seemed pointless to hold on to any notion of redemption",3
"Using the kick serve into the advantage corner, Thiem had drained Djokovics normally rock-solid backhand return He invested a lot of his bread-and-butter strokes with a slice that confounded his opponent and he kept his own mistakes to a minimum, moving like a panther to hunt down the many short balls served up to him But there was more going on than mere tennis shots",3
"The first set was close, although Thiem suspected this might not be the Djokovic who hit him off the court in the semi-finals in Rome recently The Austrian had witnessed his opponents occasional struggles in the first week This was his time",3
" He stuck to his uncomplicated, robust shot-making and, gradually, forced Djokovic to drop deeper, then drilled home the angled winnersHe might have been waiting for the backlash but it did not materialise",2
" At 0-30 and two sets down, Djokovic played a blinding point to get back into the rally The patrons applauded and the Serb, who lives for love, smiled and raised a defiant fist But it did not have the fire of old It was just that: a gesture Thiem broke his serve, and maybe his heart",5
"If Djokovic had realistic ambitions beforehand of reaching the semi-finals, his primary objective now was to avoid embarrassment",1
 His ground strokes disintegrated The net grew larger and the court shrank Thiem was not looking across at a legend who had won 12 slam titles and probably would collect a few more yet; he saw a wounded bull,3
"As the confident 23-year-old rested before the final act, leading 5-0, he looked as calm as Djokovic often has done in similar situations There was no room for pity He wanted a bloodless conclusion",3
"Thiem coasted to 40-0 Court Suzanne Lenglen, the tournaments second arena, went silent",2
" Would he not only bagel Djokovic but not allow him even one more point? Thiem netted a backhand, the smallest of merciesHe missed a serve  and then he lashed an exquisite backhand down the line The deed was done",3
There were press-box mutterings: did we just see Djokovic give up? Surely not,1
" He had, though, been beaten out of sight by a young man who one day might be as great a champion himselfSouthampton are confident that Virgil vanDijk will remain at the club next season after Liverpool were forced into a humiliating climbdown over their pursuit of the player The south-coast club were furious to read stories on Monday that Liverpool were primed to complete a 60m move for the Holland centre-half and they reported them to the Premier League for an alleged illegal approachSouthampton felt that Liverpools fingerprints were on the stories and they questioned how there could have been thebelief at Anfield that VanDijk wanted to join them given they had made no official approach for him Moreover, they wondered how  as per the reports  VanDijk might be so keen to play for Jrgen Klopp if he had not spoken to the Liverpool manager",5
"It has been reported that VanDijk met Klopp in Blackpool to discuss the proposed transfer  which would have been in breach of the Leagues rules on tapping-up On Wednesday evening, Liverpool released a statement on their website in which they apologised to Southampton over any misunderstanding regarding the pursuit of VanDijk and stated that they had formally dropped their interest in him",2
"Liverpool Football Club would like to put on record our regret over recent media speculation regarding Southampton Football Club and player transfers between the two clubs, the statement read",1
" We apologise to the owner, board of directors and fans of Southampton for any misunderstanding regarding Virgil vanDijk",1
" We respect Southamptons position and can confirm we have ended any interest in the playerSouthampton wonder how Liverpool could have dropped their interest in a player about whom they had never formally enquired  a clear admission, in their opinion, of the Merseyside clubs guilt in terms of the alleged illegal approachThe Premier League had written to both clubs on Tuesday to ask for their version of events with a view to deciding whether to launch an investigation and it is unclear, at this stage, whether Liverpools apology will bring an end to it If both clubs agree that the matter is closed, it is unlikely that the League would take it furtherLiverpool are serving a two-year ban on signing academy players  the second year suspended  after they accepted making an illegal approach to a 12-year-old Stoke City player in April and it is Southamptons contention that the Merseyside club were panicked by the accusation they made against them",5
"Liverpool have signed five players from Southampton in the past three years for a total of 96m  Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Rickie Lambert, Nathaniel Clyne and Sadio Man But Southampton are adamant that VanDijk will not tread the same path or, indeed, be prised away by any of the other clubs that covet him  namely, Chelsea and Manchester CityTheir robustness over the 25-year-old is based, in large part, on the strength of his contract; VanDijk signed a new deal only last summer that tied him to StMarys until 2022",3
" The chairman, Ralph Krueger, was typically strident when he outlined why the club had no need to sellThe trading in the last three summers was often out of necessity, Krueger said",2
 We have contracts in place like never before We go into the first summer ever where we do not have to sell a player We built longevity in the contracts and that gives you a chance to move with a core of players into multiple seasons and build some synergy,3
" Our goal is to keep the core in placeChelsea and City will continue to monitor VanDijks situation, although Chelsea might recoil at the 60m fee that has been mentioned",2
" VanDijk joined Southampton from Celtic in the summer of 2015 for 115m and he has been outstanding in their colours until a serious ankle injury sidelined him last JanuaryLos Angeles has apparently given up its bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, a move that effectively means Paris will host the Games in seven years",3
" LA is then expected to be the host city in 2028To be blunt, LA 2024 has never been only about LA or 2024, LAs bid leader, Casey Wasserman, writes Even when the issue of a dual award for the 2024 and 2028 Games was initially raised, we didnt say its LA first or its now or never for LA: that sounds like an ultimatum",3
"We could have used that strategy, but we didnt because we thought it was presumptuous to tell the IOC what to do and how to think",1
" Were better partners than that It has always been our contention that LA 2024 had to make as much sense for the Olympic Movement as it did for the people of LA - and weve stuck to that premiseOn Friday, it is expected that the IOC will confirm the host cities for 2024 and 2028 will be announced at a meeting in Lima on 13 September",3
"In the wake of Wassermans statement, an LA 2024 spokesman insisted it had not yet given up on hosting the 2024 OlympicsLA has not conceded 2024",2
" Indeed, LA has a firm belief that it is the best host for the 2024 Games given the current situation in the Olympic movement, said the spokesmanThe attraction of hosting the Olympics has dimmed in recent years with huge expenses and redundant venues haunting the IOC Hamburg, Rome, Budapest and Boston have all dropped out of the bidding process for 2024, partly due to protests from citizens concerned their cities would be saddled with debtsThere is an absolute consensus among sports economists that it is economically damaging to host the Games, unless one puts a very high value on the local population enjoying the party, David Forrest, an economics professor at the University of Liverpool, told the Guardian in February The only publications attributing benefits to hosting are by consultancies paid by politicians to validate their vanity projects",5
"LA (1932 and 1984) and Paris (1900 and 1924) would join London as the only cities to host the Summer Games three times, should the IOC confirm that Paris will host in 2024, with LA hosting four years later",1
"Andy Murray is in the semifinals of the French Open for the fourth year in a row, exploding the myth, surely, that clay is his weakest surface He is now consistent on all surfaces  certainly in big tournaments  and has a fighting chance of finally adding the title to those he has won at Flushing Meadows and WimbledonHowever, the world No1  who arrived in Paris in ordinary form and unable to train properly because of a lingering cold  was briefly in danger of following the defending champion, Novak Djokovic, out of the tournament before defeating Kei Nishikori in a fourset match that he began poorly and finished in style on Court Philippe Chatrier on a warm, still Wednesday afternoon",3
"Murray, who lost against Djokovic in the Roland Garros final last year, won 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-0), 6-1 in 2hr39min to book a place in the semi-finals on Friday against Stan Wawrinka, who breezed past Marin Cilic in 1hr40minMurray said courtside: I needed to put a little bit more pace on my shots",2
 He was dictating all the points in the first set,1
" Once I got a better rhythm, I was able to keep him away from the baseline and that made a big differenceOf his semi-final opponent, Murray said: Stan has played fantastic this tournament I dont think hes dropped a set",3
" I had to play one of my best matches on clay to beat him last yearNishikori broke twice in the first halfhour, serving out the set without bother, and Murray needed to regroup quickly in perfect conditions once the wind dropped",2
"At the US Open last year, it was Nishikori who came from 1-2 down to beat Murray in the quarter-finals but, after his uneven win against Fernando Verdasco in the third round, it was still a surprise to see him start so fast hereThe match, predictably, was not without incident",2
" The chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, gave Murray a time violation in the first set and he dropped serve, descending thereafter into a rolling rant that lasted all the way to thefourthsetAt deuce and 1-1 on Murrays serve in the second set, Ramos interrupted him during his ball toss for a second time violation, penalising him the point, but this time the Scot was motivated to hold  not before letting the umpire know what he thought: Ive been on Tour so long and Ive never seen that",2
" Why did you do it when I was throwing the ball up? The umpire replied: Every single point, you are over the timeIt was the spark that Murray needed  and Nishikori suffered He handed him two break points with a dreadful smash and Murray was up 3-1",3
" Within minutes, he had to save two break points  the second given up with his fourth double fault  to hold and went on to level at a setapiece",1
"Murray was coasting, a break up in the third set, when he dropped serve and Nishikori held to love They worked their way to the tie-break  probably one of the worst shootouts either of them has playedThey swapped breaks again at the start of the fourth, and a worryingly familiar pattern reinstated itself",3
" Coming into this tournament, Murray has handed back the break to his opponents 18 out of 80 times this year",1
" Last year, he held on to his break 255 of 302 times (84%), similar to his strike rate in 2015That Murray managed to forge on to the finish line without blemish probably surprised him as much as everyone elseEarlier, the erratic and tempestuous world No4, Simona Halep, who wondered before the tournament if she would even play because of a twisted ankle, defeated the fifth seed Elina Svitolina, 3-6,7-6,6-0, having come back from a set and 5-1 down",3
" In the semifinals, she plays the second seed Karolina Pliskova, who defeated the home favourite, Caroline Garcia, 7-6, 6-4",1
" Pliskova will become the first player from the Czech Republic to be ranked No1 in the world if she reaches the finalBritish Cycling will appoint a new head of medicine, split its medical team into cure and prevention units and create British sports first clinical governance committee to maintain the highest standardsThe measures are the result of an independent review of the governing bodys medical services that was prompted by UK Anti-Dopings investigation into allegations of wrongdoing within the GB team and its professional road cycling off-shoot, Team Sky",3
"That investigation is continuing but it has already emerged that medical record-keeping has been poor, with treatment notes missing, confusion over who has been ordering medicine at the National Cycling Centre and why, and an absence of records to show when drugs have been dispatched to racesCommissioned by British Cycling, the review was led by English Institute of Sport director of medical services Dr Rod Jaques and he said he was delighted his recommendations have been approved by the governing bodys boardIn a statement, Jaques said: I found members I met with from the British Cycling medical team to be competent professionals, working to the best of their abilities within their current structuresTo ensure athletes are served in ways that best support performance and allow professionals to develop, the review outlines reforms that will bolster both areas and ensure that British Cycling makes changes to ensure the highest standards of professionalism and careThe changes, with immediate force, are part of wider reforms in response to both the Ukad investigation and an independent review looking at allegations of bullying and discrimination within the GB elite set-up",5
" That investigation, instigated by the former GB sprinter Jess Varnishs claims about the former technical director Shane Sutton, is expected to publish its findings next week after months of delaysThe wait for that report, though, has meant British Cycling has already made sweeping changes in personnel and practice, with a new code of conduct, chief executive, performance director, human resources head and chairman of the boardThe latter, Jonathan Browning, said: The creation of the clinical governance committee underlines the importance of having the right people, structures and processes in place so that British Cycling can provide our athletes with best in class medical services",3
"That committee will comprise British Cycling staff, including the new chief executive officer Julie Harrington, with external advisers, and will report to the board The new head of medicine will be recruited and report to the new performance director, Stephen Park",2
"The medical team will be divided into a rider health section, which will focus on reducing the risk of injury, mental health and lifestyle education, including anti-doping, and a medical services section that concentrates on care and record-keepingA spokesman for British Cycling said these changes do not mean that the doctor at the centre of the Ukad investigation, Dr Richard Freeman, has no future at the National Cycling Centre Freeman, who has described himself as British Cyclings head of medicine, is off work with a stressrelated illness but is expected to return to duty when he is well enough",3
"The spokesman said this new head of medicine role is a more senior position with a different line manager and set of responsibilitiesFreeman was heavily criticised by MPs during a culture, media and sport select committee hearing into the allegations surrounding the GB squad and Team Sky for failing to keep adequate records of the treatment he gave riders, most notably the 2012 Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins Both Freeman and Wiggins deny breaking any anti-doping rules",3
"Jos Buttler has said England intend to meet Australias phalanx of fast bowlers with aggression on Saturday and admitted the prospect of knocking them out of the Champions Trophy provides an extra layer of motivationWith the top spot in Group A sewn up and a semi-final in Cardiff next Wednesday now booked following the 87-run win against New Zealand, Eoin Morgans side have earned a pressure-free shot at sending Australia home early when the two sides meet at a sold-out Edgbaston",2
" Steve Smiths world champions, whose opening two matches have been ruined by rain, feature a pace attack that could include Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins and which has thus far been unable to accommodate the talents of James Pattinson",1
"Asked about the chance to end Australias campaign, Buttler said: Yes, it would be nice",1
 We will not think too much about that,1
 We want to win and keep our momentum going no matter who we play But it is always nice to know that would be the outcome if we did win,2
"They are a very good side and one to be respected but we always focus on ourselves, what we can do well, and will not change our style of cricket We will keep trying to take them on They have got some good pace bowlers but we will try and be aggressive with the batEnglands reward for beating New Zealand is a day off from training on Thursday for the team that played, while Australia started their preparations on Wednesday with a full session at Edgbaston  a ground they have not won at in any format since 2001We have got some good memories of playing there, said Buttler",5
" It is a ground we like playing at, which is one of the advantages of being at home, isnt it? We have to make the most of that",1
"It was Buttler who turned Englands first innings against New Zealand in Cardiff into a match-winning total, with his unbeaten 61 from 48 balls steering his side to 310 all out on a pitch that did not suit his fluent stroke-play, and in winds that reached 55mphIn a tournament yet to come fully to life, Buttler did provide one moment for the highlights reel when a scoop for six had the cameraman on the raised gantry at the river Taff end ducking for cover  a first, said the batsman, from that particular shot",2
" I have not done that from a scoop shot before, he said It is something I try and work hard on and with the wind it was quite helpful It is good form when it comes offAdil Rashid has admitted he might have struggled with being dropped for Englands opening fixture against Bangladesh when he was younger but instead demonstrated his maturity when returning to face New Zealand and delivering one of his most accomplished international performances to date in his 10 overs, two for 47England may publicly claim the end justified the means, but it felt a duff call in what has been an otherwise impressive march to the semi-finals",5
" Any fears over the impact on his previous exclusion were misplaced, however: When I was younger, 10 years ago, maybe [I would have taken it badly] But I think now, because of the way the team is, we back each other whether we play or not, its all together  15 in the squad",2
Rashid has been a player saddled by expectation ever since he spun Yorkshire to victory over Warwickshire on his first-class debut with a six-wicket haul at Scarborough in 2006 While a brief international spell followed three years later  including the World Twenty20 that summer  it is a wiser and more relaxed cricketer turning out for his country these days,2
"As you get older, play more, you experience more situations in games and how to react to them, said Rashid, whose 47 caps have now yielded 65 wickets, 62 of which have come in the last two years Over the years I have gone better and when things dont go quite so well, that experience can kick inSometimes when you dont play, you think: Ive got to make sure I perform in the next game",3
 But for me it wasnt so much that,1
 My mind was clear because Ive been in this position before,1

"With an eye patch and bushy beard, the face of Jack ONeill, who has died aged 94, was known around the world as a logo for the company that bore his name ONeill was celebrated as a pioneer, if not inventor, of the wetsuit, which opened up colder waters to surfers, and the company that grew out of his tiny surf shop went on to sell sportswear that captured the imagination of surfers and skateboarders, eventually becoming a sought-after fashion brandONeill developed the wetsuit out of necessity: I just wanted to surf longer, he explained Surfing San Franciscos Ocean Beach, ONeill and his fellow surfers tried to cope with the icy waters of northern California by soaking sweaters in oily water sealants But it was the realisation that you do not need to stay dry in order to stay warm (hence the term wet suit) that prompted his move to the use of neoprene, in 1951",5
" He had first tried stuffing PVC into swimming bodysuits, but as it absorbed water, it added too much weight to allow surfingThe question of invention, or where the idea for neoprene came from, is a moot point",2
" ONeill originally claimed to have discovered neoprene in aeroplane carpets, but the flammable substance was never used for that He later attributed it to a tip from a pharmacy student at San Francisco State University, Harry HindCompeting claims came from Bob Meistrell, who with his brother started Body Glove in Redondo Beach, south of Los Angeles",3
" Meistrell and ONeill traded threats of legal action for years until the Meistrells top surfer, Bev Morgan, revealed he had suggested neoprene to them after reading a paper by a University of California scientist, Hugh Bradner, who had successfully tested neoprene diving suits in 1950 but had never marketed his invention outside the technical world ONeill may not have been first, but it was his melding of a nylon interior to the neoprene shell that made the wetsuit suitable for the sport of surfers",2
"All my friends said, ""Jack, you'll sell to five friends on the beach and then you'll be out of business""ONeill was born in Denver, Colorado, but his family moved to Long Beach, California, in which he became an avid body surfer After the second world war, where he served as a US Navy flyer, he moved to Oregon to study business at Portland University and first encountered colder waters After graduating in 1949, ONeill settled in Ocean Beach, working as a lifeguard, longshoreman, fisherman, taxi driver and salesman",3
"He continued to surf, and recalled being fired from one job when he expelled salt water from his nose during a sales meeting In 1952, he and his wife, the former Marjorie Bennett, opened what he called the Surf Shop in a garage on the Great Highway next to Ocean Beach",2
" All my friends said, Jack, youll sell to five friends on the beach and then youll be out of business, he recalledIn 1959 the family moved 75 miles south, to Cowell Beach in Santa Cruz, where he opened another shop",2
" Although he trademarked the name Surf Shop, he never enforced his exclusivity against any of the hundreds of others using the same title The ONeill wetsuit, sold with the slogan Its Always Summer Inside, a take on the classic surfing documentary The Endless Summer, led to a rapid growth in sales and expansion into other products In 1971, ONeill lost an eye while testing the now-common surf leash, developed by his son, Pat In typical fashion, he turned the eyepatch into a symbol of his companyONeill invented the sand sailer, a sailing boat on wheels for use at beaches, and continued to fly, primarily in hot air balloons, decorated in ONeill colours, in which he would drop in to surfing competitions",5
" By the 1980s, when his was the largest-selling wetsuit in the world, the companys surf brand became a fashion accessory",1
" Eventually the firm became part of an international conglomerate, though Pat still runs the businessBut in 1964, Jack had set up his ONeill Surf Team, which provided new boards for kids in the Santa Cruz area, and in 1996 he set up ONeill Sea Odyssey, a marine environmental education programme that has taken about 100,000 children on its catamaran around Monterey Bay national marine sanctuary His own home, on Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz, overlooked what is now designated officially a world surfing reserve",3
" The ocean is alive, he said, and weve got to take care of itONeill is survived by his second wife, Noriko, his sons, Pat, Tim and Jack, and daughters, Cathi, Bridget and Shawne Another son, Michael, died in 2012",3
" Jack ONeill, surfer and businessman, born 27 March 1923; died 2 June 2017The insertion of an earth-shattering event into a trundling everyday narrative is a common enough literary device That was probably the best way to frame Michy Batshuayis title-winning contribution for Chelsea  an intervention as audacious as someone reading you the last paragraph of a novel youd spent 700 pages toiling over You might think Batshuayi, previously more impactful through his chirpy use of Twitter, would have warmed to his new role as champion shock jock but  struck down by the loose-tongue affliction that seems to afflict Belgians more than most when away on international duty  he had a very different kind of surprise in store for those who hold his fortunes dearNo, no, no Everyone knows that I have to play more, that I have to score goals, he protested when asked if he would accept next season panning out in a similar way on Chelseas substitute bench",5

" The statistics were grim: 17 games on this stage without a win stretching back to 1997, and that accounted only for the occasions on which they had qualified",1
Simpsons squad have turned it all round and stand on the verge of making history,1
 Victory over Italy in Jeonju on Thursday would bring a first appearance in the final,1
" England have overcome a broad range of challenges, and the occasional wobble, in getting this far and have played with an intensity that treats this competition in the way it is so often regarded abroad: as a big deal The players know the importance of what theyve achieved, he says Theres a steely determination about them and they want to go out there and achieve something",3
" So far, so good, but we really want to make that next step and go to the finalEngland will have been together for 35 days by the end of the tournament on Sunday and Simpson speaks glowingly of a group that has not given me one moment of a problem",2
" They have made a positive impression with their courtesy towards hosts and Fifa officials; there has been a keenness within the England set up to show that they are serious this time and, in reaching the last four for the first time since 1993, their approach has paid off on all frontsWe want to be recognised as good people but we want to be recognised as good football players as well, Simpson says, and a squad bolstered through rare levels of co-operation from Premier League clubs has stepped up In previous years an England campaign might have been remembered for the moment a fortnight ago when, with the team a goal up in the group stage against Guinea, the Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori drilled a 45-yard backpass past his own goalkeeper with no danger in sight That now seems the smallest kink in a run that has brought wins against Argentina, South Korea, Costa Rica and, in Mondays quarter-final, MexicoWe couldnt have chosen a tougher first game than Argentina; they had so much of the ball but we were just clinical in both 18-yard boxes and killed the game, Simpson says of a tone-setting 3-0 victory",5
" South Korea was another tough game where our only supporters were probably a handful of our players families Costa Rica and Mexico were also difficult and I know that Italy will be a hell of a tough task  they look to be a typical well-drilled, well-organised Italian sideIt is a fair impression, although Italy have not found goals hard to come by They won a wild quarter-final against Zambia 3-2 despite spending almost 80 of the 120 minutes with 10 men; the Juventus forward Riccardo Orsolini has scored four times in the tournament and the impression before Thursdays fixture is of two finely -balanced sides who may go the distance againSimpson was pleased to see his striker Dominic Solanke score the winner against Mexico days after the players move to Liverpool was confirmed",5
" Solanke did not play a senior game last season, a situation said partly to have been rooted in a contract stand-off with his former club Chelsea, and his international manager regards him as an incredible guy for dealing with the frustration",1
"Hed been a little slow to find his feet but I thought his performance against Mexico was outstanding, Simpson says",1
" He really brought his game to the party, and Im sure that its because his situation has now been resolved and its out in the open That must have been a real burden to have hanging over him",2
" Hopefully he can perform in the semis and show everyone what a top footballer he is capable of beingPlenty of others have come through with their stock raised, although Simpson will have to do without one important player against Italy after Josh Onomah, of Tottenham, was shown what the manager  along with most others  perceived was an absolutely ridiculous red card late in the Mexico game That was the first real negative of Englands past three weeks but it has made no mark on their appetite to harness the new-found optimism",3

"Katarzyna Niewiadoma soloed to victory on the opening stage of the Womens Tour to seize control of the battle for overall victoryThe 22-year-old Pole, among the pre-race favourites, broke clear with a little under 50km remaining of the 147",2
"5km stage from Daventry to Kettering, and her rivals left it too late to respond",1
"It was a first win of the year for Niewiadoma, the Polish national champion, who is here as the race leader for the WM3 team despite the inclusion in the squad of the great Marianne Vos  winner of the inaugural Womens Tour in 2014It was Vos who crossed the line in second place one minute and 46 seconds down, leading in the pack that contained the 2016 winner Lizzie Deignan (Boels-Dolmans) and the rest of the general classification hopefulsAlice Barnes (Drops) was the highest British finisher in seventh place, while the French rider Audrey Cordon-Ragot of the British team Wiggle High5 took the first Queen of the Mountains jersey by crossing the two main climbs of the day in first place",3
"After making her move Niewiadoma quickly pulled out a commanding lead, and it was allowed to grow to more than three minutes before the peloton got organised in their chase, with Boels-Dolmans taking the initiativeBut they were running out of road and, when Niewiadoma passed the 10km to go marker with more than two minutes in hand, it was clear where victory was going",2
"Thursdays second stage, a 1445km route around Stoke-on-Trent, contains a number of testing climbs and should help shape the general classification battle further before the sprinters can hope to have their chance in Leamington Spa on Saturday The race will conclude on Sunday with a stage in LondonAt the Critrium du Dauphin, the Australian Richie Porte sent a warning to his Tour de France rivals by winning fourth stage, a 235km individual time trial, as Chris Froome struggled",5
The BMC rider Porte clocked a best time of 28 minutes 7 seconds to beat the German Tony Martin (Katusha-Alpecin) by 12 seconds and Spains Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) by 24,1
"The Belgian Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Soudal) retained the overall leaders yellow jersey after the solo effort between La Tour du Pin and Bourgoin-JallieuTeam Skys Froome, the defending champion who tipped Porte as possibly his main rival for the Tour, produced a below-par performance as he finished 37 seconds off the paceHowever, results are hard to assess on the Dauphine as top riders usually use it as a Tour warm-up and try not to peak to soon ahead of the gruelling three-week race, which starts on 1 July",3
"Spains Alberto Contador (Trek-Segafredo) was two seconds ahead of Froome, while last years Tour de France runner-up Romain Bardet (AG2R-La Mondiale) lost almost two minutes",1
"Drawing conclusions this early in a British & Irish Lions tour can be dangerous but there is one that can already be made with certainty: the phrase rugby chaos must be banished from the tourists vocabulary, never toreturnIt always had the whiff of a soundbite, dreamt up by an anxious PR team eager to deflect attention from negative Warrenball headlines, but with a laborious opening victory now followed by defeat against the weakest of SuperRugby sides the Lions will face, it has backfired with an irony not lost on the caustic New Zealand pressWith four years of preparation WarrenGatland would not have at his disposal players who offload with the instinctive ability of Sonny Bill Williams or who attack with the grace of Rieko Ioane",3
" To even suggest that the Lions will be in a position to take on anyone in New Zealand at their own game is ludicrous Gatlands side, particularly the backs, may lack the X-factor he speaks of, but they will not find it trying to mimic theiropponents",2
Instead the Lions must master what they are best at but Gatlands greatest problem is that he does not yet know precisely what that is,1
" Limited preparation makes it understandable but still the Lions are playing as if disadvantaged that the cream of the British Isles has been pooled Whether it becomes an advantage  whether in this day and age that is possible  is the million-dollar questionFor it is not much of a reach to say that each of the four home nations would beat the Blues and four years ago the Lions succeeded largely because Gatland could rely on the spine of his Wales team against a below-par Australia side It was less a mixture of the four home nations, more the best of the rest bolted on to a team Gatland knew inside outIncreasingly Steve Hansens claim that the Lions would be foolish to attempt to replicate Irelands win against the All Blacks in Chicago appears diversionary",5
" New Zealand were beaten that day by a side who got the basics right with unerring accuracy and if that does not sound quite like X-factor, it may be the next best thing for GatlandBack to events at Eden Park, though, and the temptation when looking for positives is to highlight Maro Itojes enthusiasm, Courtney Lawess workrate or Rhys Webbs command of his forwards but to focus on individuals only underscores Gatlands problem",2
" In terms of cohesiveness, the scrum and the defensive line speed were encouraging but ill-discipline is more of a worry than those two pluses combined",1
"The lineout, meanwhile, cannot be considered a success because of the shambolic attempt in the final minute Hookers can often take too much of the blame for a malfunctioning lineout but Rory Best has previous in this kind of do-or-die situation He snatched at his throw, missed his man and the Lions were condemned to a morale-draining defeat",3
"Indeed, it is the final five minutes, after Ihaia Wests dazzling late try, that should be pored over before facing the Crusaders The Lions rumbled up the middle only for Joe Marler to concede a needless penalty, before Bests aberration, which again raises the question of why Dylan Hartley is not in New Zealand He is the best throwing hooker in the northern hemisphere and the Lions are finding out what it feels like when these chances are not taken",3
Fortunately for Gatland he has largely kept Owen Farrell under wraps until now and he is the most accurate fly-half at his disposal But while his shoulders are broad it may be stretching it to pin the Lions hopes on his talents already  in both matches the backs have appeared lifeless even beyond the Saracens restorative powers,2
 They do not have to offload out of every tackle but they must be sharper than the blunt instrument on show sofarAnd they must be clinical  Jared Paynes first-half try was correctly disallowed but that must be viewed as a missed open goal considering the Lions backs did not come close to creating a similar opportunity again The expectation is that the startingXV against the Crusaders will not be far off that for the first Test but if the Blues match was one the Lions dare not lose then what does that make the trip to Christchurch to face the only undefeated side in this years Super Rugby competition?It is here that Gatland must earn his corn,3
 Months ago he celebrated the fact that the Super Rugby sides would be at full strength and that the Lions would be battle-hardened for the Test series,1
 He continued to push that narrative in defeat but it is all the more difficult when his squad are already being written off as no-hopers,1
" Gatland, however, must keep his nerve and instil an identity into this side that maximises their strengths both in the pack and behind itFor it was not chaos that ensured the Blues won the day It was clear thinking, trusting a skill-set that has been honed since childhood  relying on their point of difference when the stakes are highest  and the Lions must find a way to do the same",3
 Chaos is the last thing they needSome NFL players are notoriously reluctant to attend pre-season workouts Buffalo Bills cornerback Shareece Wright is not one of them,3
"Wright joined the Bills last month and found himself at Chicagos OHare Airport at 11pm on Sunday faced with a 550-mile, trip to reach the Bills practice facilities the next morningMy flight ended up getting in late, so I wasnt able to make my connecting flight, Wright told the Bills website He did not rent a car as he wanted to sleep before meeting up with his new team",3
 I called one of my ex-teammates that lives in Chicago ,3
" and he wasnt able to take me and Uber was my next thoughtHe soon find a driver, willing to take him",2
" This guy accepted the ride and I called him right away and told him, Man, I need to go to Buffalo, NY thats eight hours are you willing to take me there? and he said, Yeah, man, Ill take you anywhere you need to go I told him the situation I told him I had to make it there by 7am",3

" Wright is due to make $775,000 this year and has career earnings of $10",1
"8mThe Bills practice this week was voluntary but as a new member of the team, Wright will need to become familiar with a new defensive schemeTaking this long drive with @chadj19 and @mikeyj14 back to greenbay",3
"Earlier this week, the Green Bay Packers cornerback Davon House also needed help getting to practice after missing a flight He put out a call for help on Twitter and brothers Chad and Mike Johnson gave him a four-hour lift to the teams facility",2
" I went to bed and I was scrolling through my Twitter and saw he needed a ride, Chad Johnson said My brother lives in Hudson, [Wisconsin]; Im in Eau Claire",2
" I tweeted him that I could come pick you up, and in the meantime I texted my brother that House needs a ride My brother also tweeted him",2
" He was closer so he swung up to the airport and picked him up, and I met him on Highway 29 so my brother and I could keep each other awakeDame Di Ellis, who has died aged 79, was a most unlikely physical specimen to ascend to the summit of British rowing",2
" At 5ft 3in tall, she occupied a coxswains frame in a world of lofty men and women But her skills as a competitor, manager and manipulator  in the best sense of the word  took her to the head of one of Britains most successful Olympic sports, and propelled her into the orbit of national and international sports institutionsCompetitively, she rowed for Great Britain in 1966, as part of the womens eight at the European championships, coxed the England womens four to gold in the 1972 home countries match, and won the womens eights head of the river race seven times, four as a cox and three as a rower, from 1966 to 1973",3
" She became the first national champion in 1972 on the new 2,000-metre course at Holme Pierrepont, near NottinghamHowever it was as an official that she made her biggest mark As chair of the Amateur Rowing Association (ARA, which became British Rowing in 2009, much at her behest) for 24 years from 1989, she transformed the amateur body, which was in an impoverished muddle when she took over, into a professionally run and well-funded sport",3
"It was Di who persuaded David Tanner to take early retirement as a headteacher and set up the high performance rowing programme that has consistently produced Olympic gold medals since the National Lottery came on stream after 1996, when Steve Redgrave and Matt Pinsent won Britains only gold medal at the Atlanta games Tanner described her as a pulse of the sport, a pioneer, a very strong administrator and leader",2
"Di also expanded and developed womens rowing, which became a phenomenon during her 60 years in the sport In 1997 she was the first woman elected as a steward of Henley Royal Regatta Today about 20% of Henleys stewards are women, and this year the regatta introduces three new events for women to bring their open events on a par with those for men",3
" Meanwhile, Henley Womens Regatta has grown from modest beginnings in 1988 to an enormous three-day eventThe second of three daughters of Robert Hall, a proof reader, and his wife, Mabel (nee Steadman), a nurse, Di attended Ealing girls school, in west London, and Guildford College of Technology, Surrey, where she studied management and nutrition This led to a career with Surrey county council that included management of the school meal serviceShe began messing about in boats as a teenage Sea Ranger, and competed for Middlesex, becoming a one-oar sculling-over-the-stern champion from 1954 to 1957 In 1960 she began rowing at St Georges Ladies rowing club, one of the first clubs to be affiliated to the Womens Amateur Rowing Association",5
" In 1966, the same year she began her winning streak in the head of the river race, she married John Ellis, a bank officialShe qualified as an umpire in 1978, was secretary of the national championships and chairman of the womens commission of ARA (both 1984-87), and was made GB team manager in 1988, before taking up the ARA chair",2
"Di touched every part of the sport, from grassroots to elite, local to international She was a sound voice as leader of the British delegation at the congress of the international rowing federation, or Fisa (world rowings governing body), from 1989 to 2013 Her abilities as a doer and a fixer resulted in a seat on the British Olympic Association in 1995 and promotion to the board (1997-2013) She was on the organising committees of the world championships at Strathclyde in 1996 and Eton Dorney in 2006, and the world junior championships in 2011 and world cup in 2013, both at DorneyShe held trusteeships and board seats on a host of sporting organisations, including the River & Rowing Museum (2007-15) and the British Olympic Foundation",5
 She won awards from the International Olympic Committee for services to womens sport and from Fisa for distinguished service to international rowing She was made a vice-president of the British Olympic Association in 2013 and honorary president of British Rowing in 2014 She was appointed CBE for services to rowing in 2004 and made a dame for services to sport in 2013,3
"Latterly she was in charge of the three-person team in the finishing tower at Henley The team clock crews crossing the line by aligning a piece of cord with a black strip on the opposite side of the course They have a monitor to follow the progress of a race, consult a waterline photo-finish camera if the result is in doubt, check that the umpire raises a white flag to indicate a completed race, translate seconds into lengths and pass the verdict to the commentary boxIt is a well-rehearsed routine that is hair-raising during close races, and Di possessed the temperament for it She was a very capable administrator, said the former chairman of the regatta, Mike Sweeney",5
" She got things done and smoothed out rough waterDi is survived by John, their daughter, Claire, grandsons, Daniel and Joseph, and her sisters, Janet and Sue Diana Margaret Ellis, rower and sports official, born 11 April 1938; died 18 May 2017The very last time Pepe put on his Real Madrid kit and ran on to the pitch, it wasnt to play",3
" Kpler Laveran Lima Ferreira joined team-mates in celebrations at the Santiago Bernabu on Sunday evening wearing all white, knowing that he will not be back",1
" The day before, he had been left out of the squad for the Champions League final at the Millennium Stadium; the night after, he finally confirmed what had long been an open secret: Its clear that I wont be continuing at Madrid, he said",1
" There was sadness as he said it There was a touch of bitterness, too Ten years on, he was goingAt 34 and into the final year of his contract, Pepe had publicly said he would wait for Madrid until the end, but eventually gave up in April He wanted to stay and asked for a two-year deal; Madrid offered only one",5
" Most of his stuff has been in storage for the past two months, shipped back to Portugal, awaiting his next destination, which appears likely to be France",1
 He knew it would end but it was not supposed to be like this,1
" Everyone else knew it too, even as he kept silent  not least because he kept silent, in fact He was the only player, with Fbio Coentro, nowhere to be seen at the clubs pre-final media dayWhen Madrid won the league in Mlaga, Pepe filmed celebrations from the touchline, selfie stick in hand",3
" In Cardiff, he joined them having watched the game from the stands When they returned, visiting the cathedral and the town hall, he hung back",2
" At the Bernabu celebrations there was a photo with Cristiano Ronaldo in the dressing room  with my friend Pepito, Ronaldo wrote  before his farewell in front of the fans",1
" He didnt say goodbye to Zinedine Zidane, he admitted pointedly, as the coach already knew he was off  before he himself had",1
"The following night, party packed up, Pepe said that Madrids treatment of him had not been right His complaints, made on the radio station Cadena Cope, have changed the atmosphere, ending things in a way that few expected, but beyond that immediate irritation, there will surely be gratitude for the past 10 years",2
" Pepe said that Madrid had not protected him amid accusations of tax evasion; admitted that, unusually among the squad, he had connected better with Rafa Bentez than with Zidane; and expressed his disappointment that noone from the board had called him after he had cracked his ribs against Atltico Madrid on 8AprilAs it turned out, that was the last time he ever played for Madrid",2
" Before he had been forced to withdraw, he had scored the goal that had put Madrid into the lead He celebrated with a raised finger, Madrid badge held between his teeth That image felt appropriate; fans at the Bernabu have long appreciated him, celebrated him",3
" Team-mates, too When Pepe arrived from Porto for 30m, one question was asked repeatedly: Who is Pepe?! He leaves with three league titles, three European Cups and having played 334 games Only five foreigners ever played more than the Brazilian-born Portugal defenderWho is Pepe? For a long time, the answer from some was a villain, public enemy No1 Rival supporters chanted: Assasin! Assasin! at him",5
" Catalan TV3 depicted him as Hannibal Lecter; Madrid tried, and failed, to sue Few forgot that image of him treading on Leo Messis hand In the aftermath of a series of tense clsicos in 2012 which turned genuinely nasty, he accused Barcelonas players of acting",3
" Andrs Iniesta admitted that he was offended, but scoffed: Whats Pepe going to say? He added: We could do a whole video of his fouls We all know himOn the pitch, perhaps",3
" Off it, he was one of the most likable members of Real Madrids squad: approachable, friendly, funny, even gentle It is not so unusual: there are plenty of players like that, men whose team-mates love them even as they admit they are transformed out there Pepe was always remembered best for his attack on Getafes Javier Casquero in April 2009 At the time, there was no doubt that he was one of the toughest, most aggressive defenders in Spain, often a little wild, sometimes dirty, but that night was something elsePepe pushed Casquero over, kicked him twice in the back, raking his studs across Casqueros spine, punched Juan Albn, and walked off calling them all sons of bitches",5
" He was handed a 10-game ban, the sixth-biggest in Spanish football history, allowing some in the capital to present it as if he were the victim Without him, Madrid lost five of the next six, the title slipping awayHe was hurt, he said He said he didnt recognise himself; he had gone absolutely mad He described those days as the worst days of his life, and said he had spent much of the time in tears",5
 Madrids full-back Marcelo said: I have never seen him like this,1
" Pepe apologised to the Getafe players and to football as a whole but not to his team-mates, at least not straight away I suppose he doesnt want to talk about it, Christoph Metzelder said I hope he will soon be the happy lad we all know Pepe said: Im not sure I have the will to keep playing at the momentHe did, of course",5
 He sought professional help to control himself,1
" He didnt exactly become an angel and certainly not straight away  those battles with Barcelona were still three years off, and fans celebrated his aggressiveness  but nothing quite like that happened again And with time, maturity, his game did change, as did peoples perceptions  especially after the departure of Jos Mourinho Pepes last red card for Real Madrid was in 2011",3
" He has not been in double figures for yellow cards for four seasonsAlthough some clung to that image, it wasnt him",2
" He came to be seen not just as a pantomime bad guy but a player and a very good one The chant Pepe, mtalo! became Pepe, marca un gol!: they had gone from Pepe, kill him! to Pepe, score a goal! In truth, his own fans had always liked the bad guy, too, but mostly they liked this defender: reliable, dependable, committed He had become a symbol for the club, a captain without the armband It was reported on Tuesday morning in Spain that the club were arranging a farewell for him",5
 Sources at the club were quoted as calling his commitment and performance impeccable,1
" At that point, they had not yet heard his comments from the night before",1
"Increasingly, he led There was personality on and off the pitch that was appreciated He ended up falling out with Mourinho when he publicly stood up for Iker Casillas, calling out the coach for his treatment of the club captain Mourinho replied that, at heart, Pepes problem was that he was a 30-year-old who couldnt take being run over by the 19-year-old Raphal Varane The manager described it as life, but there was life left in Pepe",5
"At that point, in May 2013, he was thinking about a departure but Carlo Ancelotti convinced him that he would be important He trusted in Pepe Varane was talented, he said, but Pepe is Pepe Ancelotti said: Were more assured with him He gives us confidence, personality and he helps the other players; he is very important for them",5
" The Italian coach always spoke admiringly of the defenders honesty and professionalism in admitting that he wasnt fully fit before the 2014 European Cup final against Atltico in Lisbon In Milan, two years later, he started, aged 33, and he was superb",2
" There is an argument to suggest that he was also Portugals best player at Euro 2016 A year on, injuries interrupted his season, although he impressed every time he was available, and the contract he waited for never came On Monday night he admitted what had become an open secret",3
"Pepe once said that when he retires he would like to travel the world in a caravan Thats still some way off He believes he has matches left in him, just not, he now knows, for Madrid",3
"Liverpool are in talks with Sporting Lisbon regarding a deal for the winger Gelson Martins as the club continue their quest to bring more pace to their attackThe Anfield club have been in negotiations with Roma about Mohamed Salah, but fear being priced out of a move for the Egypt international and Martins is seen as another viable optionIt has been claimed in Portugal that Martins has a buyout clause of 60m (52m), but that Sportings failure to qualify for the Champions League means they would take 50m euros The 22-year-old made 44 appearances last season, scoring seven goals and providing 14 assists, and produced a particularly impressive individual performance against Real Madrid at the Bernabu in the Champions League in SeptemberJrgen Klopp is known to want to add more pace to his side for next term",5
" It is understood Liverpool have also been monitoring Keita Bald at Lazio and Bayern Munichs Douglas Costa in addition to Salah and MartinsRomas valuation of Salah is believed to be far in excess of Liverpools, who had a 28m bid rejected last week,with the Serie A club asking for more than the 40m being reported in Italy Romas American chairman, James Pallotta, told the US radio station SiriusXM: For the moment, there is nothing with Liverpool",3
 Well see what to do,1
" However, that did not prevent Salah, away on international duty, allowing himself to be pictured with two fans holding Liverpool shirtsKlopp is keen to significantly strengthen his squad this summer in preparation for Champions League football and has been linked with a move for the Southampton centre-back Virgil van Dijk",2
"It is understood the Holland international has made Anfield his preferred destination, should he leave St Marys, although Saints have asked the Premier League to investigate an alleged illegal approach from Liverpool for the playerSteven Gerrard believes the 25-year-olds capture would be a major boost for the club",2
 The former Liverpool captain said at an event in Belfast: Id love to see him in a red shirt Im a huge fan,2
 I thought he was fantastic at Celtic and I thought we should have had a go for him back then,1
" It will cost us a few more quid but I think he is a piece of the jigsaw that would be very welcome and very big for this teamIt is difficult to understate the impact Kylian Mbapps clinical finishing, terrifying pace and prodigious skill have had this season",2
" His emergence at the turn of the calendar year was the catalyst for Monaco as they turned on the afterburners and intensified their already scintillating form, taking the Ligue 1 title and galloping into the Champions League semi-finals At just 18, he became the only man to score in his first four Champions League knockout games He also scored 15 goals in 17 appearances in Ligue 1 and laid on eight assists Young players regularly burst on to the scene in France  Sofiane Boufal and Ousmane Dembl were the trailblazers last season  but Mbapp is on another planet entirely His fluid, graceful style and unerring finishing draw natural comparisons with Thierry Henry",5
" Yet, his warp-speed acceleration and ability to bamboozle defenders make him more like a young Ronaldo",1
 The Brazilian was nicknamed The Phenomenon; it might be time to pass on that sobriquet,1
"Interested: Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real MadridEstimated value: 150mThis season has been a frustrating one for Rennes They sold both of their wingers  prize asset Paul-Georges Ntep to Wolfsburg and longtime super-sub Kamil Grosicki to Hull City  and did not replace either of them They finished ninth, without a place in Europe, but the development of 20-year-old defensive powerhouse Joris Gnagnon gave the club a rare bright spot",3
" Gnagnons impressive physique is a clear asset but he has also proven to be an intelligent and wily operator, exhibiting superb positional play, anticipation and an astute ability to cover for his colleagues With manager Christian Gourcuff now describing him as the leader of Rennes back four, bigger clubs are circling Holding on to Gnagnon this summer will be a serious challenge for a side without clear ambitions for the forthcoming campaign",3
 A sizeable offer may be inevitable and impossible to turn down,1
"Interested: Monaco, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund, Borussia Mnchengladbach, Chelsea, Inter, Sevilla, Tottenham",1
"Estimated value: 25mMonaco have Fabinho, Paris Saint-Germain have Marco Verratti, and Nice have Jean-Michal Seri",1
 Fabinho and Verratti dictated play for the top two clubs in Ligue 1 this season and the Ivorian did the same for Nice He should be considered as on par with the Brazilian and Italian as a deep-lying playmaker and passer,2
" Seri can pick up the ball from his centre-backs and either command the pace and direction of play with his passing and close control or drive the team forwards with a sharp dribble He racked up 10 assists in the league this season, further underlining his influence in the final third Seri very rarely gives away the ball, even when under the pressure of a hounding, aggressive press He has a knack for calmly wriggling away from danger or nonchalantly picking the perfect pass to negate the threat With a 40m release clause (in theory banned by the LFP but still legally binding by taking advantage of loopholes), he has interested some of Europes richest clubs",5
"Interested: Arsenal, Roma, Barcelona, PSG, Tottenham",1
"Estimated value: 40mCut adrift of the Champions League places and embarrassed by Ajax in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final, this has been an underwhelming season for Lyon There have, however, been bright spots: Alexandre Lacazettes phenomenal goal tally, young Lucas Tousarts emergence at the base of the midfield and Mathieu Valbuenas resurgence have all stood out, but Corentin Tolissos breakthrough campaign has topped them all The 22-year-old is comfortable playing as a holding, central or attacking midfielder and his understanding with Lacazette has been the key to anything positive Bruno Gnsios team have done this season Perhaps most impressive is his ability to play insightful, deft throughballs, expertly judging the timing and weight of passes and selecting the right option on the counter If Juventus follow through on their interest, he will be extremely difficult to replace at the Parc OL",5
" Having rejected Napolis bid of 375m for Tolisso last summer, Lyon President Aulas will be ready for tough negotiations",2
"Interested: Arsenal, Chelsea, Juventus, Manchester City, Inter, TottenhamEstimated Valuation: 50mRyad Boudebouz is quite simply far too accomplished to be playing for Montpellier",2
" The club meandered in the lower echelons of mid-table this season but, without his goals and creativity, they might have been relegated His skill, vision, ability on the ball, eye for goal and trademark swish of the hips have made him an under-appreciated delight in Ligue 1 Montpellier have little chance of holding on to him this summer His form had fluctuated from the sublime to the anonymous during spells at SC Bastia and Sochaux, but his talent has finally won out and, at 27, he has entered his prime A top-six club will snap him up this summer  assuming they are not beaten to it by a foreign giant",5
"Interested: Lazio, Lyon, Newcastle United, Nice, SchalkeEstimated value: 15mAlexandre Lacazettes form, sharpness and goalscoring have fluctuated frustratingly in the past but, as this season got into its stride, so too did the Lyon forward Lacazette exemplifies the possible path that promising Ligue 1 players can take if they are not rushed out of the door as soon as they show some semblance of quality",3
 The 26-year-old now emerges as a very complete article after enjoying his most assured and consistent season to date His finishing is pin sharp; his touch and awareness of space have been refined; and his acceleration is as frightening as ever,2
" He made 30 appearances in Ligue 1 this season and scored 28 goals This summer is the perfect time for Lacazette to finally fly the nest and prove he is capable of becoming a top-tier European striker He looked likely to join Atltico Madrid, but their transfer ban has thrown everything into uncertaintyInterested: Arsenal, Atltico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Manchester UnitedEstimated value: 60mWithout Fabinho, Monaco would probably not have won the Ligue 1 title this season",5
" The difference between Leonardo Jardims side with and without their midfield general is stark The 4-1 drubbing they received from Paris Saint-Germain the Coupe de la Ligue final when he was suspended shows how much they rely on his mobility, power, range of passing and ability to dominate midfield battles in tandem with Tiemou Bakayoko, despite often being outnumbered in a two-man midfield If Fabinho doesnt play, Monacos freewheeling, relentless, high-pressing 4-4-2 starts to fall apart",3

" His pace, towering aerial ability, reading of play and assured defending were key to their miraculous survival under the inspirational Pascal Dupraz last season Diop has developed into one of the most consistent centre-backs in France, finishing the season as captain and working in tandem with the equally superb Christophe Julien in one of Ligue 1s most eye-catching defensive partnership Still just 20, Diops growing stature is already justifiably turning heads",3

" Cheick Diabat, who scored eight goals in the 15 games he played since arriving on loan in January from Turkish club Osmanlspor, provides half an answer to the question The other half of the equation is the emergence of teenage winger Ismaila Sarr Sarrs explosive and direct wing play dragged his Metz counterparts towards safety in the latter part of the season The Senegalese was signed from Metzs partner club, Gnration Foot, last summer and remains raw His style resembles that of a lightening-quick Paulo Wanchope, all flailing limbs and unpredictability, but flashes of genuine brilliance have become increasingly evident in 2017",5

" Their combined aggression and power means Monaco are often outmanned but they are never outgunned Although Bakayokos core skillset places him somewhere between Ngolo Kant and Claude Makll in the spectrum of midfield sentinels  astutely shutting down burgeoning attacks and harrying forwards into mistakes  his strong, leggy Patrick Vieira-like physique adds an extra dimension to his game",2

"The escalating diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its neighbours is a subject of concern to many in British horse racing, as a result of that countrys enormous investment in the sport in recent years From a position of almost no involvement less than a decade ago, Qatar rivals Dubai for significance in Flat racing, thanks in large part to the interest shown by two members of the ruling al-Thani family, Sheikh Fahad and Sheikh JoaanBut Qatars situation appears perilous, following the news on Monday that nations including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain had severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region and supporting terrorist groups The countries involved declared they would halt all land, air and sea traffic with Qatar, eject its diplomats and order Qatari citizens to leave within a fortnightPeninsular Qatar has a single land border, with Saudi Arabia, and the prospect of its closure has reportedly caused panic buying of food",5
 Qatari officials deny the allegations against their country and say the blockade is part of a plan to undermine their state,1
"In the context of a crisis on that scale, any amount of horse racing sponsorship is clearly small potatoes",1
" Still, British racing is awash with Qatari money just now and officials at several tracks are clearly hoping that will continue to be true for a long timeIn December 2014, the state of Qatar signed up to back Glorious Goodwood, renamed as the Qatar Goodwood Festival, in a 10-year deal that was described as the biggest in the history of British racing No value was put on that deal in reports at the time but it took the total prize money for the 2015 meeting to 4",3

"Just six months later, another biggest ever deal was struck, estimated at 50m in value, between Ascot, Newmarket, the British Champions Series of races and Qipco, an investment vehicle for some members of the al-Thani family",1
" Under the deal, prize money for Champions Day is supposed to reach 5m by 2024Qipco was already the sponsor of the British Champions Series and had already become Ascots first official partner, entitling it to branding rights during two days of the Royal meeting each year",2
" Sheikh Joaan had runners in Britain last year with 11 different trainers, while Sheikh Fahad used 18 Sheikh Joaans Al Shaqab Racing, which sponsors Newburys Lockinge Stakes, finished fourth in the owners table by prize money won with a total of just under 2m",2
"Understandably, officials have responded with caution when asked to discuss whether Qatari investment can be expected to continue in the light of recent events, or whether it should continue The British Horseracing Authority said it would be guided by the position of the British government in such matters",2
"The UK government has encouraged the development of a strong and growing trading relationship with Qatar and we are not currently aware of any change in that regard, a BHA spokesman said Qatar remains a significant investor in the UK, accounting for 35bn of existing investment",2
"Individual sponsorships of races were a matter for the tracks involved, the BHA added Goodwood did not respond to my requests for comment, while Ascot confined itself to saying: Qipco has made and continues to make a significant contribution to British racing through its role as sponsors, owners, breeders and charity supportersA spokesperson for the British Champions Series said: Qipco is a privately owned company which has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to British racing through its role as sponsors, owners, breeders and charity supporters",3

" Even so, before they return to this stadium to face the All Blacks on 24June some fundamental issues need addressing Without sharper backline execution, better lineout execution and tighter discipline, they will not win the matches that really matter",2
"To suggest this was a contest they would have won if they had conceded fewer penalties also obscures the abiding lesson of a damp, showery evening Ultimately the Blues emerged victorious courtesy of two vivid flashes of creative skill the Lions simply could not match; unless Warren Gatlands squad conjures up some similar game-changing magicians, all their undoubted forward power is going to be insufficient",2
"Gatland had spoken before the game about X-factor contributors and his point was perfectly underlined by the home sides match-winning 74th-minute try from the replacement fly-half Ihaia West, set up by Sonny Bill Williams Williams is set to be named in the All Blacks squad to face the Lions and the sweet offload which sent the rapid West on a 40-metre slaloming run to score under the posts contrasted sharply with their visitors more pedestrian midfield effortsNor could any Lion match the brilliance of the long pass from the 20-year-old Stephen Perofeta which put his similarly youthful team-mate Rieko Ioane away for the Blues opening try",3
" If there was a hint of fortune about the Blues other try just before half-time, when it seemed to the naked eye as if the ball went forward off TJFaianes hand, a try count of three tries to one reflected the home teams ruthless finishing The Lions are averaging one try per game and it is not nearly enough",2
"It should help to have Owen Farrell lined up at 10 as they transfer to Christchurch to tackle the unbeaten Crusaders; with Dan Biggar failing a head injury assessment and Jonathan Sexton still nowhere near his best, the Lions creative heart needs to start pumping with more ideas and energy Then again, simply chucking the ball around and hoping for the best against New Zealand sides is never a great idea either The tour itinerary remains brutal and, unless a sharp improvement materialises, the below-par success against the Provincial Barbarians last Saturday could conceivably be the first and last weekend fixture the Lions win",3
The alternative is to bottle the frustration of this outcome and look to uncork it in the Tests,1
" Courtney Lawes, Maro Itoje, CJStander, Rhys Webb and Leigh Halfpenny all had their moments and there was enough scrummaging success to suggest the Lions should be more than competitive in that key area",1
" As Gatland rightly observed, however, no team conceding 13 penalties, several of them soft ones, is giving themselves much chance at the highest levelLiam Williams being sent to the sinbin in the 57th minute, after a second mistimed aerial challenge on Matt Duffie, was merely the most obvious example of players not thinking straight Standers high tackle shortly before half-time also allowed Perofeta the penalty shot at goal that ended up shaping the game profoundly",3
" The ball struck the upright, the rebound  knocked on or not  went over the Lions line and Sonny Bill Williams was in the right place at the right time to score The Blues were suddenly walking back to the sheds 12-10 up and the Lions could never muster quite the same authorityagainInjury-wise it also proved a wince-inducing night for the Lions",3
" The centre Jared Payne limped off having apparently aggravated the calf problem that ruled him out of the opening fixture and Biggar never reappeared after departing for a head injury assessment It was a particularly bittersweet occasion for Payne, who used to play for the Blues and has a brother living in Auckland Before his evening ending prematurely he could have had a couple of first-quarter tries, once just failing to reach a rolling ball in the in-goal area and then being denied a try when his left knee grazed the touchline as he went to touch down in the left cornerWith Webb also being collared just short of the line when a try looked certain, the Lions were overdue a score when Stander finally finished off a rolling maul Halfpennys conversion and penalty gave the visitors a 10-5 lead which their improved tempo and sense of purpose fully deserved",5
" The ever-dangerous Ioane came close to bagging another score, having touched down for the Blues first try, within three minutes of the restart as the Lions made a sluggish start to the second half",1
" Even before Liam Williams was handed a yellow card, the touring team were tightly marshalled in midfield, only for Halfpennys boot to put them back in front with nine minutes remainingIt was to prove a false dawn, with the Lions over-throwing a last-minute lineout which could have transformed the mood",2
" Rory Best will not recall the moment with much affection but he and his team-mates know it is what happens next that really counts Can the Lions iron out such teething problems in less than three weeks? Do they have anything like enough in their attacking locker? And, most pertinent of all, if they are losing against New Zealands sixth-best non-Test side, how on earth are they going to beat the AllBlacks?

"There was a twist this year to Arsenals annual late-season injection of hope in that it came with a change of formation Can a conversion to a back three really, after all these years, be the recipe that actually delivers jam tomorrow? Yet its not even clear that Arsne Wenger intends to stick with a shape of which he was once openly scornful, and that means that every transfer, every rumour, will be analysed not merely in terms of the player, but for what it may indicate about Wengers vision of the future",2
"The free-transfer signing of the Bosnia-Herzegovina left-back Sead Kolasinac from Schalke on a five-year contract this week makes the picture very little clearer, but what he should offer is flexibility and a steeliness Arsenal have often lacked Although Kolasinac was not a regular wing-back with Schalke or his country, and has made his reputation as tough, powerful defender, there seems little positional reason why he could not operate as either a left-sided central defender or as a wing-back  as well as in his more familiar full-back role",2
" He has, after all, played 19 games for Schalke as a wide midfielder (and four more in the centre of midfield), even if his more obvious assets are defensive",1
"Whether he has the technical capacity to operate as a wing-back is less certain, but Kolasinac is capable of getting forward and nobody has ever doubted his work rate or commitment He scored three goals and set up five in the Bundesliga last season",2
 No other defender registered so many assists (even if the stat is slightly diminished by the fact that some of them came when he was playing in midfield),1
"That should not, though, be taken to suggest he is a great passer or brilliant crosser of a ball and in that sense he is not an obvious fit for Arsenal  which may, of course, be no bad thing",1
" He is frenetic and aggressive, somebody who relishes a physical challenge",1
" There are not going to be many filigree interchanges involving Kolasinac and, say, Mesut zil, but he is emphatically robust Sead is a tree, said the former Schalke manager Jens Keller He gets hit on the head, but just shakes it off and continues to play superbly",3
"Kolasinac was born in the German city of Karlsruhe, where his father, Faik, works in the Mercedes factory Faik is a Montenegrin from Niksic who in 1969, when he was 10, moved to Capljina in Bosnia-Herzegovina He played amateur football there and shares a similar muscular frame to his son",3
" Its all genetics, his father said When Huub Stevens [then the Schalke manager] saw us sitting together he said it was obvious where he got his physique fromAlthough Kolasinac played at youth level for Germany, he has always identified with Bosnia",3
" He listens to Bosnian music and even when he was at Schalke, living in Gelsenkirchen, he would go back to Karlsruhe once a week to eat his mothers burek and cabbage rolls Until Kolasinac started playing, he would join the crowds watching Bosnias national team games on a big screen at his local mosque Religion played a significant part in his upbringing",3
" Faik remembers that his son would sometimes skip school to go to classes at the mosque and that there were times when he would go hungry rather than eat porkFrom a global perspective, Kolasinac is perhaps best remember for the early own goal he scored against Argentina in Bosnias first game at the 2014 World Cup",2
" Safet Susics unusual tactical gamble meant Bosnia then didnt play with a left-back against Nigeria but Kolasinac returned for the win over Iran Three years on, as the arguments over Susics selection for that second match have begun to fade, the most striking aspect about Kolasinacs World Cup, perhaps, is how untroubled he seemed by the own goal A 20-year-old could easily have collapsed after scoring against his own side at the Maracan three minutes into their first World Cup but Kolasinac was impressively solid thereafter",3
"Given Arsenals tendency to wilt at the first glimpse of pressure, that grittiness will be a useful addition",1
" Again, that suggests that Wenger, at last, has acknowledged that not all the worlds problems can be solved by neat, slight midfielders with nice hair Arsenals May uptick this season felt different to what had gone before because it involved such a radical structural change, such an admission from Wenger that his tactical outlook required modification The signing of Kolasinac suggests that the process of reform, a return to a more physically aggressive Arsenal, is continuingChelsea have won the title in the last four general election years Has any English team got a better record when Britain goes to the polls? asks Jamie Navarro",5
" What governments do title winners deliver?This is right up Gary Faircloughs street It turns out that Chelsea are far from the most prolific title winners in election years, he writes In England that honour lies with Liverpool: they have won seven titles in election years (1906, 1922, 1923, 1964, 1966, 1979 and 1983), scoring three Labour, three Conservative and one Liberal government",3
 But in the rest of the UK that record is dwarfed by our Scottish and Irish brethren,1
"Rangers and Linfield have each won the title 17 times in election years, Rangers delivering the most Labour governments (nine) and Linfield delivering the most Conservative governments (also nine) Rangers third-place finish this season does not bode well for Jeremy Corbyn but Linfields 52nd Northern Irish title looks even more promising than the early polling figures for Theresa May On the plus side, Linfield have also delivered the most Liberal governments but that, like Lib Dem MPs in parliament, is only a fraction of the other parties with two, most recently in 1910",3

"Some years ago my brother and I tuned in to catch a group stage match between Nigeria and Benin during the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, he continues With fewer than 10 minutes remaining in the game we were astonished by the introduction of the fabulously miniature Arnaud Ska, replacing Nouhoum Kobna Listed at just 5ft 1in, the remarkably tricksy attacking player had little time to influence the result in a rather humdrum 1-0 loss to the Super Eagles, courtesy of a Yakubu penalty, but he was majestic to watch",3
" Ska went on to play a further 20 minutes as a substitute during the 2-0 loss to Egypt, taking the place of Mickal Pot Surely he deserves an honourable mention on your list (heres a video  featuring a wonderful dinked goal)?Who was the first player to wear fluorescent boots? wondered our very own Rob Smyth in 2014",2

" Until about three or four years ago a football boot was a football boot, varying only in size and weight, but following a sound basic design Now the latest creation is likely to be in black and tan with silver eyelets, and in a couple of months time it will be out of date, replaced by something else We cant risk building up stocks that wont sellBut the beginning of the end for the traditional black boot came in the early 1970s The German sportswear company Hummel was looking to break into the UK market and signed up several professionals to wear its new white boots",5

" However, he was to come no closer to scoring than the volley, from Donadonis centre, which Van der Sar turned round a post at the end of the first halfWhen it comes to the first luminous footwear, things, ironically, are a little murkier The mid-90s are the turning point once more and the earliest definitive reference weve uncovered comes in a report from Dundees Dens Park",3
" It was perhaps a portent that the afternoon was going to be a rather grim affair, Archie MacGregor wrote in the Sunday Times in November 1996, when St Johnstones Attila Sekerlioglu decided to dispense with his notorious yellow bootsIn seasons 1955-56, 1956-57 and 1957-58 Leeds United drew Cardiff City in the third round of the FA Cup at Elland Road, Stephen Crump writes",3
" The score in the three games was 2-1 to the away team, Cardiff",1
" Has there ever been a similar pattern and coincidence in the FA Cup  or other cup competition?Following the John Terry farewell, have any other games been subject to pre-planned interruptions, either officially sanctioned or not? David Gibson asks",1
"As I was perusing the Liga MX page on Wikipedia, I noticed that Santos Laguna just finished the Clausura in fifth place despite losing only one game, notices Brad Hill",1
 This makes me wonder  what is the lowest position a team has finished in the league despite losing only one game?Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardiancom or tweet @TheKnowledge_GUIt was hard to find anyone who begrudged Cleveland fans their championship 12 months ago,3
" The fanbase had suffered through decades of losing and crushing defeats; there had been tears and screams and, yes, even flames The collective futility of the Cavaliers, Indians and Browns had endured year-round, one failed season rolling into the next And all the sports misery occurred at a time when the city and the entire region of northeast Ohio was struggling just to survive So only the cruelest of souls were upset by the sight of a million people in the streets of Cleveland celebrating the citys good fortuneGood luck finding a person alive who feels the same way about Warriors fans",5
 Golden State are two wins away from winning their second NBA title in three years and entering the conversation about the greatest basketball teams of all time Theyre also two wins away from making Warriors fans perhaps the most despised in all of American sports,2
"All due respect to the widely loathed supporters of the Patriots, Yankees, Cowboys and Lakers, but the Warriors are building a fanbase that could dwarf them all for unlikability",1
" Golden State fans negatives are on a hockey stick growth curve as Oracle Arena increasingly fills with  apologies for the poor attempt at using Silicon Valley lingo  brogrammers who truly believe they offer a value add to the organization (And for the sake of clarity, it is this new breed of fan that attracts ire, rather than the Warriors supporters who pulled for the team even during the bad old days)Part of the problem is simple demographics",3
" Bandwagon jumpers are considered to be the lowest form of fan  even below drunk, belligerent and face-painted  whereas the diehard, thick and thin, fan-since-birth group is the most respected Because of the massive influx of people into northern California with the tech boom, many of those filling the choice seats at Oracle Arena have ties to the region that are tenuous even compared to those of Kevin Durant",2
" Yet theyre cheering their hearts out for their beloved Warriors every night, while across the street the last place As  with the second-worst attendance in all of baseball and portions of the upper deck covered in tarp  dont seem to have captured the imagination of Silicon Valley big wigs The new Warriors fan has not suffered anything near the sports heartache of a Cleveland lifer Their toughest season to endure was one in which the Warriors won an NBA-record 73 games",3
" Sad!The biggest example of the new strain of Golden State fan is none other than Joe Lacob himself, the team owner",1
" Born in Massachusetts, he grew up a Celtics fan before his family relocated when he was a teenager to Los Angeles ",3
" upon which he became a Lakers fan Who knew that kind of swap in loyalty was even legal? But avoiding charges, Lacob started a venture capital firm in the late 80s, became part owner of the Celtics in 2006 (another flip!) and then majority owner of the Warriors after the 2010 season Like the worst Silicon Valley stereotype, he credits tech culture for his teams success, telling the New York Times Magazine last spring: Weve crushed them on the basketball court, and were going to for years because of the way weve built this team",3
" Were light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how were going to go about things Were going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time",2
"Lacob is undoubtedly correct that his team is positioned to win for a long time, but that has more to do with hitting on Stephen Curry in the 2009 draft  a selection that came before Lacob arrived  and the ensuing benefits Currys abilities have afforded (on an under-market contract, mind) than it does with any sort of ingenious tech management style we in the small-brained community cant comprehend The Portland Trail Blazers and Sacramento Kings also have owners with tech backgrounds, dont they? But their tech culture hasnt created much success without the likes of Curry and Durant (who is deeply involved in Silicon Valley himself) on the rosters Having an owner that irks is a near-necessity for despised teams, however  see Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft  and Lacob goes the extra mile there with his comments on how he and his fiancee had sex alongside the Larry OBrien Trophy following Golden States 2015 title win",3
" Thinking of that is like Uber but for vomitingAnyone else see Eddy Cue @cue say ""tell that bitch to sit down"" after @rihanna was cheering court side? #NBAFinals pictwitter",3
com/iwRjjYEqnoLacob and his fellow tech gazillionaires have also priced many of Golden States long-time fans out of the market (and insulted Rihanna while theyre at it) The average ticket price for a Warriors home game increased nearly 300% from the 2006-07 season ($2663) to last years 73-9 campaign ($7984) The Warriors also had the fourth-highest average ticket price in the entire NBA,5
" Lifelong Golden State fans, ones who cant afford to spend $400 on a juicer that doesnt actually work, undeniably exist and in large numbers; the Warriors have always had good support even in down years, but a lot of those diehards have lost their tickets to multi-millionaires who invented an app you have never heard of",1
 Its hard to associate Warriors fans now with anything other than the tech bros we see ringing the lower bowl at Oracle Arena every game,1
" And thats while theyre still at their present venue: they will soon move from their traditional home in Oakland to wealthier (and tech-ier) San FranciscoIs some of it jealousy? Oh, no doubt More than some",3
" If the Warriors didnt win, their fans would be easily ignored",1
 Same with Patriots fans They wouldnt be worth the energy for hatred And few among us would turn down a high-paying Silicon Valley job that afforded piles of cash to spend on seeing the NBAs greatest team up close,3
 But its all too much,1
" Too easy And its being done with a finesse, dont-get-too-dirty playing style that is just too Silicon Valley",2
 The one area of the country where you can get millions dumped on you for conceiving a quarter of a half-baked idea shouldnt also get to have the most dominant professional sports team in a generation Its not fairBut the new Warriors fan will surely take being loathed by the rest of sportsdom in exchange for a string of championships,3
 And all well be able to do is watch it happen on whatever devices they sell us nextArsne Wenger is proactive,2
" Hes dynamic, hes in charge and hes going to sign your player Hot on the heels of Sead Kolasinacs arrival, hes at it again  photographed by a quick-thinking citizen-journalist at Nice airport clutching a pricey-looking bag of shopping and flanked by hisvassal boss Ivan Gazidis Does 2+2=Mbapp? Apparently a higher level of maths is needed for this one: Wenger was in the region to speak with Lyons top brass about trusty Rumour Mill steed Alexandre Lacazette, with the Gunners keen to get most of their big deals done uncharacteristically early",3
"Perhaps Wenger might make a quick hop over to Barcelona, who believe they have won the heart and mind of their former player Hctor Bellern Terms are said to have been agreed with the right-back and now, such is the way football works, the clubs need to get to work over a fee 50m might do it, and reports in Catalonia say Bellern wants out",3
" There could even be another departure from the Emirates, too, with almost-top-class striker Olivier Giroud warning darkly that he wont settle for such limited playing time when Arsenal get next seasons knockabout japes underway",1
"The Rumour Mill values its regular stars and if Romelu Lukaku is soon to flee the nest we do, at least, have James Rodrguez Liverpool are in for the out-of-favour Real Madrid playmaker! And so are Arsenal! And so is pretty much every top-tier club you can name, according to Wednesdays reports, all of which should end up meaning an agent does pretty well in a couple of months timeThat would all be big news but surely not as big as Bournemouth signing a new captain, leader and legend at the same time",3
" So hold the back page, then, for imminent news of the Cherries doing exactly that  with John Terry apparently close to signing a 100,000-a-week deal to continue his top-flight career for a year longer than really seems wise",1
"Another Chelsea product, Southamptons Ryan Bertrand, is in demand, with suggestions that Manchester City could steal in for the left-back amid problems with their bid for Monacos Benjamin Mendy",1
" And if they dont, Liverpool or even the Stamford Bridge club probably willCity are about to bid farewell to one member of last seasons squad, with the lesser-spotted Nolito having touched down in Spain ahead of what is expected to be a loan move to Sevilla",2
" The Premier League could see a new wide forward come in soon enough though: West Ham are looking to stem the flow of discontent at the London Stadium with a move for Jrgen Damm, a Mexican winger who plays for Tigres, with 4m apparently likely to do the job thereAnd in the latest evidence that Championship club Wolvess transfer policy definitely, undoubtedly, assuredly isnt being led by Jorge Mendes, the Molineux side are interested in adding Manchester United stalwart Beb  currently on the books of Eibar in Spain  to their cadre",2
"Ange Postecoglou says the time has come for his Socceroos players to pay back the significant investment put into them The Australian coach is confident the payback will begin in Thursday nights crucial World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia in AdelaideAs the games get more and more important and vital, that is where you want to see all the work we have done in the last two or three years come to fruition, Postecoglou told reporters on WednesdayWe have invested two or three years in them but I think, over this next period, it will be interesting to see how far they can go as footballers and how far the team can goAustralia enter Thursdays fixture three points adrift of group leaders Japan and Saudi Arabia, with three games remaining",5
" The top two nations secure spots at next years World Cup in Russia but the third-placed nation is pitched into playoff roundsPostecoglou was preparing for some stodgy Saudi tactics in Adelaide, noting it had become a pattern of Australias opponents",2
" What we have found is, irrelevant of who we play, in recent times they tend to sit back against us, he said I think its recognition from the opposition that the way we play our football, they will have no choice but to sit backI dont think that is because of the (group) position or consequences",3
" I think regardless, that is what they have to do to try to stop us",1
 Thats what were expecting,1
" But from our perspective, its about our growth and our ability to dominate games of football against all types of opposition and under any circumstances",1
And tomorrow will be another challenge in that area,1
"In the lead-up to the crunch game, players have deliberately kept in the dark about the starting line-up In doing so, Postecoglou has maintained his usual stance of not naming his final line-up until match day",2
"We dont really know the team until match day, captain Mile Jedinak told Adelaide radio station 5AA",1
 Its a thing that keeps everybody on their toes and allows people to prepare as if theyre starting no matter what Obviously theres only 11 shirts up for grabs for that starting positionBut were always made aware that you might not start the game however you may make the biggest impact in the game when you do come on,3
"Jedinak said players were comfortable with Postecoglous selection tactic Its a great way of doing it, he said",2
" Were all used to it now so we just get on with it and were all here to support each other no matter what Whether we start, whether were coming off the bench or whether we dont play at all, everyone is just as importantPostecoglou has a full squad of 23 players to choose from for the Saudi match, with midfielder Jackson Irvine among those awaiting selection news Irvine started the past two games and hoped to secure another starting midfield berthYou want to be involved in as much play as you can, Irvine told reporters",5
 But I also recognise the talent and ability that we possess in this team,1
" If my role is to play from the bench and be more of an impact player, or to play from the start, my mentality wont changeAdam Gilchrist has broken ranks with past and present players by supporting Cricket Australias pay offer, labelling it fair The retired Test great is confident the pay dispute between CA and the Australian Cricketers Association is on track for a resolution by the 30 June deadlineThats despite players standing firm on their opposition to the governing bodys move to scrap the existing revenue-sharing model under the new agreement CA has been spruiking the deals 58% increase of guaranteed payments, benefiting men and women players",5
"Gilchrist has backed players for showing unity, in particular those at the highest level who are concerned the new deal will leave domestic players out of pocket But he suggested CAs argument that the revenue-sharing agreement takes money away from the grassroots of the game had merit",2
"I think Cricket Australia are offering a very, very fair deal for players, Gilchrist told Fox Sports No-ones going to go without and everyones growing and increasing",2
"I do hope that theyre [the players] thinking of the cricketer at the most important level, and that is the kid signing on for his first year Because grassroots cricket is under siege from other sports, like the various footy codesAustralians playing in the Champions Trophy in England have been vocal in their opposition to the deal, as have a number of former cricketers",3
 But CA is maintaining its new pay offer has to be implemented for the long-term good of the gameGilchrist said the two sides will eventually negotiate,2
" There will be an end to it I wouldnt be surprised if theyve been meeting in the last few days  the players association and the board, said GilchristI think both sides are going to have to compromise",3
" Having spoken to people in both parties, I think theyre both starting to say that and understand thatThe more practical concern of Australias players in the coming days is a simple equation: beat England at Edgbaston on Saturday or go home from the ICC Champions Trophy",2
"Eoin Morgans side booked their semi-final spot on Tuesday with an impressive 87-run win over New Zealand in Cardiff to secure top spot in Group A England cruised to victory after bowling out New Zealand for 223 inside 45 overs having posted 310 having been put in to batThe result means Australia, Bangladesh and New Zealand all have a chance of reaching the semi-finals on Saturday Victory for Australia over England, in whats essentially a quarter-final match, will keep their tournament alive by virtue of having four pointsOnly Aaron Finch, David Warner, Smith and Moises Henriques spent time at the crease in the tournament due to the weather but Smith is unconcerned and believes the pressure of needing a result will suit his players",5
"Im sure theyll be OK, Australian captain Steve Smith said",1
" Most of the guys have been playing a lot of cricket, anyway, having been at the IPL and things like that I think once they get out in the middle, things will just click into place, and yeah, hopefully we can play well on the 10th in BirminghamIt makes the equation pretty simple for us We have to beat EnglandShould Australia win, it will extend their stay in Birmingham where they would play in the second semi-final against the winner of Group B - which is likely to be South Africa or India - on June 15",5
" One bonus for Smith in Mondays wash-out at The Oval was the improved performance of his quicks, with Mitchell Starc particularly impressive alongside the consistent Josh Hazlewood",1
It was a much-improved showing on what was served up against New Zealand last Friday and Smith said he was relishing the opportunity to unleash them on Englands powerful batting line-up,1
"I thought all our bowlers were a lot better, Smith said We hit some good areas early on and challenged the defence of Bangladeshi batsmen Everyone that bowled did a pretty good job and it was nice that we were able to turn things around",3
"The Football Association has issued its first life bans after being shown previously unseen footage of England supporters making Nazi salutes and slit-throat gestures amid growing fears among security officials that the national team have become a focal point for a new generation of troublemakersOther footage showed an England follower holding a finger above his lips to imitate Hitler, in between gesturing that he would stab Germanys supporters, during Marchs game in Dortmund that became an opportunity for many travelling Englishmen to go through their repertoire of songs about the second world war",2
"Of 59 people identified by the UK Football Policing Unit, 20 turned out to be members of the official England Supporters Travel Club Sixteen have now been banned for periods ranging from six months to five years and the other four have received warning letters",2
" However, the authorities accept the real number of offenders is significantly higher and that in terms of antisocial behaviour, England have one of the worst followings of any football nationIntelligence reports have also revealed that many of those causing problems are aged 18 to 25 and fit a new profile of troublemaker who operate differently to the old category C hooligans and regard Englands travels with a stag-weekend culture where they take pride in behaving badlyWhen officials from the travel club emailed its members after the Germany game, a 1-0 defeat for Gareth Southgates team that took place with a backdrop of songs such as 10 German Bombers, they even received some replies from people arguing that what happened in Dortmund was fine Those people are now being monitored before the World Cup in Russia next yearTwo supporters were separately identified by travel club officials making Nazi gestures and the FA is so concerned it has banned them for life, in contrast to the kind of punishments that have previously been handed out",5
" One racist incident, for instance, in 2012, led to a supporter receiving a five-year ban However, there are now clear indications the FA wants to take an increasingly tough stanceUsing information from its own staff, the travel club has also banned another nine members for various offences, including aggressive behaviour and ticket scams around the Germany game, with two others receiving warnings and one case pendingA system is being introduced whereby a team of six Wembley stewards will start to travel abroad to Englands fixtures and supporters have been emailed warnings that misbehaviour will not be tolerated around the World Cup qualifier against Scotland at Hampden on Saturday England have a 4,761-ticket allocation for what is always a high-risk fixture and, when it comes to the habit of supporters gathering in a main square, the FA wants supporters to realise that drinking alcohol in the streets is forbidden in Glasgow",5
"The Scottish and English football associations, along with the police, are concerned about the 5pm kick-off, designated by Uefa, and the potential for drunkenness That, however, raises questions about why the authorities have not made a concerted push to persuade Uefa to bring it forward",2
"One of the other problems, namely England fans travelling without tickets, has been exacerbated by the number of supporters who have dropped out of the travel club since a controversial system was put in place in January 2014 whereby ticket-holders were offered two loyalty points for attending Wembley games and only one for going abroad with the team That system has now been changed to two points each but the FA privately accepts it was a mistake to change it in the first place, not least because many supporters now travel independently and get tickets from touts or other meansThe travel club had 57,000 members when the new Wembley opened a decade ago It is now down to 8,000, its lowest total, and officials have noted a substantial drop-off in the number of families One factor is that the next two World Cups, in Russia and Qatar, have drawbacks for visiting fans",5
" Englands poor performances in the past few tournaments have contributed as well, but the dwindling numbers are still alarming bearing in mind there were 15,000 members a year ago and closer to 30,000 at other timesJack Butland has admitted there were moments when he feared he might never play again during his lengthy rehabilitation from a fractured ankle as the goalkeeper, now restored to full fitness, targets a fifth cap in Englands forthcoming games against Scotland and FranceThe Stoke City player last represented his country in the friendly win against Germany in Berlin in March 2016 but was substituted at half-time after breaking the joint just before the interval His rehabilitation proved a protracted process and he did not feature for his club side for over a year, returning in a defeat at Swansea City in April, before starting Stokes final five games of the Premier League seasonBeing out for so long makes you stronger, said Butland, whose form at club level had thrust him into direct competition with Joe Hart to be the national teams No1 prior to his injury",5
" You reach your lowest point There are times when you dont know if you are going to play again, when the next operation or injection might beSo there are times when you are at rock bottom, but thats when you need the people around you: your club, your fans, everything, from little tweets on social media just to give you that bit of reassurance, that bit of positivity I feel like Ive pretty much experienced everything I can in football",3
" Positive things, winning, losing, the injury side of it all the setbacks",1
 Im sure theres plenty more to experience but Im prepared for whatever is next,1
" It feels extremely, extremely good to be back Its been a long time and to get the Three Lions back on my chest after some difficult times is really good, so Im just thoroughly enjoying being back and looking forward to the week ahead",2
 The worst thing about being injured is just missing out on what you love,1
"Butlands recovery stretched to 13 months, ruling him out of Euro 2016, before he broke back into the Stoke first-team for that final handful of games Missing out on being part of a team  it can be a lonely place when you are injured, he said",2
" You miss being out there with your team-mates and just experiencing the highs and the lows It was the drive and belief of wanting to get back to where I was that kept me going I wanted to make up for all the lost time, missing out on the Euros and missing so many Premier League games Its not nice not being able to do something you loveThe 24-year-old, who worked regularly with Gareth Southgate in the under-21 set-up, is one of four goalkeepers in the squad for Saturdays World Cup qualifier against Scotland and Tuesdays friendly against France",5
" The game at the Stade de France would appear to offer Butland the best opportunity of returning to the side, given Hart remains first-choice, with Fraser Forster and Tom Heaton also included",1
"Im wherever I can get myself to, added Butland",1
" I understand that Ive only played five Premier League games, but I feel Ive produced really good performances in those games Whatever rank I am going into these games at the weekend and Tuesday is what Ill accept",2
" I will back whoever is in front of me, or behind me, 100%Michael Keane, who is absent from this squad through injury, travelled down to St Georges Park on Tuesday to attend Southgates team meeting with the manager keen to make the Burnley centre-half feel involved in the set-upWhatever Andy Murray decides to do when he stops playing tennis, queueing up for a job with either of the major parties going toe to toe for the keys to 10 Downing Street this week might not be high on his list of options",3
" Nevertheless, the Scot  who favoured independence in the 2014 referendum and probably would do so again, if given the chance  has an acute social conscience, and he will not be joining the many millionaires in his sport who have chosen to register as tax exilesThe world No1  who is two wins away from reaching the French Open final for the second year in a row  spends little more than a month of the year at his home in Oxshott, the semi-rural idyll favoured by stockbrokers and City workers, so he has every excuse to move abroad The quiet, pleasant patch of north Surrey is a half-hour drive from Wimbledon and has been a welcome retreat for him and his young family during the championships, a rare few weeks away from the hotels on the global tennis circuit",3
"Because of the travelling demands of his sport, Murray  who has career earnings of nearly $60m, a healthy portfolio to top that up and a luxury apartment in Miami, his winter training base  could legitimately live anywhere Indeed, among his peers, half of the worlds top 20 have used just such circumstances to justify living in low-tax havensMonte Carlo is home to Novak Djokovic, Milos Raonic, Marin Cilic, Alexander Zverev, David Goffin, Grigor Dimitrov and Tomas Berdych, while Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gal Monfils live in Switzerland, and Lucas Pouille is based in Dubai",3
" However, as Murray said after his quick but testing win over the next big thing in Russian tennis, Karen Khachanov: I like living at home The only chance of me living somewhere else is if I had a bunch of friends or some of my family were living elsewhere and I would move to spend time with them But I wouldnt want to go and live somewhere not to pay any tax and not to have any of my family and friends around me",3
" I wouldnt do thatMurray always votes even though his constituency, Esher and Walton, is among the safest in the country for the Conservatives He said he has kept an eye on the political debates before Thursdays general election  his choice is sealed in the postal votes he and his wife, Kim, have despatched to reach the returning officer",3
"Weve watched pretty much all of them, he said",1
" With the team, we watched Sky News We didnt watch the ITV debate, which didnt have Corbyn or Theresa May Then we watched the BBC one So Ive tried to keep up with it as much as possibleAfter his match on Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, Murray also demonstrated that he has a social conscience and sense of the wider world that sometimes escapes celebrity athletes when, as the games leading player, he agreed to address the crowd with a brief and moving statement about the London Bridge terrorist attack",5
"I try to follow as much of whats going on back home as I can, he said",1
" When something like that happens, it doesnt matter where it is, that gets reported",1
" There was a terrorist attack in Manila a few days ago, but maybe it didnt get as much coverage as stuff in EuropeFor now, he has to direct his energies towards handling Kei Nishikori on Wednesday Certainly I feel fresher than last year, Murray said The start of that tournament was pretty tough I didnt play well in the first couple of rounds and they were hard matches",5
" I got lucky that I ended up playing [John] Isner and [Ivo] Karlovic back to back, as they were not physical matches, really, after the first couple of rounds [each of which went five sets] I came in then playing a lot of tennis  so the body probably feels a little bit better now than it did last yearNishikori, whose match against Fernando Verdasco on Monday was his third in as many days because of the shifting schedule, was right to describe the 0-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-0 scoreline as, a little bit unusual He explained later: This courts bounce was really high, he was using very heavy forehand and I was running side to side I couldnt do anything first set but I tried to play a little more heavy and a little more aggressive, and it started to work a bit better",5
" Still, it was really, really tough battle There was so many long rallies, second and third sets",2
" Physically, Im OKWhile Djokovic has soldiered on here since Monday without the attention of his celebrity coach, Andre Agassi (who left as soon as he had fulfilled commercial obligations with a coffee company), Murray is happy to be reunited with Ivan Lendl after three months It sounds simple but it is not, he said of resuming the regime with his valued mentor",3
" A lot of the time when things are not going well you start over-thinking things You start wanting to try new things on the practice court, changing tensions in your racket You think all sorts of things to work out what is going wrong",3
"But the one thing we did when Ivan got here, we went right back to the basics The drills we were doing were all pretty simple drills We spent a lot of time on the court",3
" We hit lots of balls  no time in the gym, really",1
" It was just tennis, plain tennis, and literally getting back to doing the basics right, making a lot of balls, making myself difficult to beat",1
"And then, once you start to do that, you get through a couple of matches, you start feeling better, your confidence grows It can be right down here [gesturing low with his hands], and it can go right up here pretty quickly That has been the case so far this tournament",3
"Murrays midsummer high point  and a month of sleeping in his own bed  is not far away He has already restored much of his bruised confidence after an ordinary clay-court campaign If he does well in the second week here, he will be in the best possible heart to defend his title at Wimbledon Home for Murray has always been where the hearth isThe former Formula One driver Robert Kubica has completed a test with the Renault team in Spain, suggesting he may return to the sport he left in 2011",5
"The 32-year-old Polish driver, who also raced for the Sauber team, has not raced in F1 since a rallying accident in 2011 saw him partially sever his right armKubica completed a full race simulation in a 2012 E20 car during a private test at the Ricardo Tormo circuit in Valencia",2
"Renault revealed the test had taken place on Tuesday in a series of posts on Twitter The team wrote: Its true It really is Robert Kubica Back in one of our cars after six years So why did we keep it quiet? It was a private test, for Robert",5
" But we can tell you this  Robert complained about grip, understeer, downforce and had the biggest smile on after his 115 laps!!Kubica, who won the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix for Sauber, returned to rallying after the accident and earlier this year tested a Formula E car at Donington Park",1

twittercom/boMsCARuWJThe sight of an onrushing Sonny Bill Williams is not necessarily a thrilling one for defenders but the Lions centre Robbie Henshaw cannot wait to bump into the multi-talented All Black at Eden Park The Irishman was a big schoolboy fan of Williams and describes the prospect of making his Lions debut against his one-time hero as pretty surreal,3
"While the multi-talented 31-year-old Williams  who has boxed professionally as well as playing both codes of rugby  is by no means the sole threat in an attack-minded Blues backline, he will beHenshaws direct opponent and is setto provide the 23-year-old with a good indication of where he sits in theinternational midfield pecking orderA good game would also propel Henshaw within touching distance ofa Lions Test jersey but swapping shirts with Williams would be almost as excitingI was a big fan of his when I was a kid, whether it was performing in league or for the All Blacks, says the physical Leinster player",3
" To be coming up against him is pretty surreal Its going to be tricky but Im looking forward to playing against him and having a goHenshaw is also vowing he and his team-mates will take the game to the provincial sides they encounter, rather than allow their hosts to take the initiative We need to come with an attack mentality here, says Henshaw, who scored Irelands final try against the All Blacks in last autumns win in Chicago We cant sit off and let these boys play because they can tear teams up in the blink of an eye",5
" Our mentality is to go after these teams, show them were coming here to play and go after them in defence as wellWarren Gatland is also inviting his backs to take calculated risks  If its on to throw a 60/40 offload hes encouraging us to do that, says Henshaw  and his players have stopped using jetlag as an excuse for sluggishness",2
" We have settled in nicely, we are feeling really fresh and are pretty much raring to go, confirmed Henshaw That [jetlag] is out the window now",2
"As someone who studied Gaelic in his youth, Henshaw has already risen to the challenge of speaking in the language to Maori elders at the squads official welcome in Waitangi last Sunday After receiving some tips from his sister Ali, a primary school teacher, he fulfilled his ceremonial duties having received the nod ahead of his team-mate Tadhg Furlong As I played in the west of Ireland with Connacht and its an Irish-speaking area, I was directly in line for it, he says",3
 I was asking Tadhg a couple of days before if he wanted to go for it but he had to prepare for the opening game  so I had to take it on,1
"With Ben Teo having made a promising start to the tour, the onus is now on Henshaw and his defensive partner Jared Payne, who used to play for the Blues, to keep Williamss offloading game quiet: Its obviously the top, top level of the sport for us and to be in this position is unbelievable I just want to go out there and do myself proud, do my family proud and do the best I canIt has also emerged the Lions will face a series of hakas before all their provincial games, in addition to the Tests and the fixture against the Maori",3
" For the first time in the Blues 21-year history, the team will perform a pre-match haka entitled He Toa Takitini which translates as (The Strength of Many)",1
" All credit to the Lions for embracing the opportunity to face a haka before kick-off, said Nigel Cass, New Zealand Rugbys general manager",1
Team New Zealand capsized during the run-in to the second race of their Americas Cup challenger semi-final against Great Britains Land Rover BAR in Bermuda All crew members were later reported safe,2
"After winning the first race on Tuesday against Sir Ben Ainslies syndicate to move 3-0 ahead in the first-to-five contest, the New Zealanders were heading towards the start line under strong winds when the boat rose up on its foils and plunged forward into the water",1
"Ainslie said in a statement on BARs official Twitter feed: In 30 years of racing it is the most full-on, exhilarating sailing I have ever had The most important thing is that everyone is OK on Team New Zealand after their capsize We look forward to seeing them back on the race course",3
At a press conference Ainslie added: I am sure they will recover from that and be out racing tomorrow or the next day Racing is scheduled to resume on Wednesday if weather conditions permit,2
"BAR were awarded the win as a result of the incident, which now means they trail 3-1",1
"The Team New Zealand helmsman, Peter Burling, told the press conference the capsize was was fully our error because the crew were trying to get off the start cleanBurling believes the fair bit of damage to the AC50  which appeared to include a top section of the wing smashed  would not prevent his team resuming racingThe winners are set to progress to the challenger final and whoever wins that takes on the defending champion, Team USA, for the Americas Cup itselfIn the other semi-final series Team Japan won both runs against Swedens Artemis Racing to move 3-1 aheadEngland have long searched for a game-breaking bowler in one-day cricket and the hope coming into the Champions Trophy was that the fast but physically fragile Mark Wood would be Eoin Morgans trump card in this regard",5
"In keeping with his career to date figures of nine overs, one for 32 may not leap off the page but the 87-run win over New Zealand  one that booked Englands place in the semi-finals and now gives them a free-hit to knock out Australia at Edgbaston on Saturday  certainly swung on a crucial intervention from the Durham quickKane Williamson appeared locked on a course that would steer his side to their target of 311",2
" Sat on 87 in the 31st over and with the score 158 for two, New Zealands ice-cool captain had ridden an early storm that included a fierce Liam Plunkett bouncer to the side of the head and looked primed to settle mattersBut Wood, thrown the ball after a groan-inducing opening spell that saw him repeatedly beat the bat, got a cross-seam delivery to rear and flick the captains thumb on the way through to the diving Jos Buttler behind the stumps, with the wild celebrations revealing the value of New Zealands prize scalp",2
"As well as summing up the importance of Wood to the makeup of Englands attack, the wicket of Williamson also neatly encapsulated the challenge thrown up by the Cardiff pitch",1
" Certainly the batsman himself, a player seldom prone to offering emotion, was left shaking his head at the apparent sorcery it had thrown up even if, after the match, he had praise for the bowlerHes a very good bowler, said Williamson",2
" Hes unique in the fact that he bowls at such good pace, off maybe a five-metre, 10-metre run-up, which you dont see too much around the world",1
" And hes performed very well for England over a period of time, especially coming back after injury",1
" He is certainly a strength of their bowling attackThis was billed as the pioneers of modern one-day cricket versus the monsters they created following the World Cup two years ago Instead it became something of a scrap and though the short straight boundaries may have been inviting, the two-paced surface meant the long ones square could not always be cleared",3
"There was still time for some Buttler magic, the highlight of which was his outrageously audacious ramped six towards the riverA strong wind howled all day on the banks of the river Taff too, such that bowlers frequently aborted their run-ups, the bails took on a life of their own and the umpire Bruce Oxenford  he of the bulletproof arm shield  saw his fedora fly from his head and over the ever-moving boundary rope for fourThe flags on top of the pavilion  at half-mast for the victims of the London Bridge attacks on Saturday, for whom a minutes silence was observed half an hour into play  were horizontal for the duration of the match, as the trees that line the ground swayed like drunken festival-goers, and spectators huddled in overcoats",2
"The batting they witnessed from England was a curates egg, in that they passed 300 in the first innings for the 11th time in their last 13 attempts batting first and yet still it seemed like runs had been left behind, with not one top-order batsmen kicking on to three figures Had it not been for Buttlers unbeaten 48-ball 61, it might have fallen distinctly below par",2
"A glance at Buttlers strike-rate of 127 would suggest him simply putting on his latest clinic in power-hitting Instead this was more workmanlike, in his own way, as New Zealands attack began slamming the ball into the surface at varying speeds to leave the batsman needing to force the issueThe situation in which Buttler found himself, with England 188 for four in the 34th over after Joe Roots Welsh drag-on with 64 to his name, was in many ways tailor-made for his talents, and yet it was not until his 24th ball faced that a boundary came",3
"Among the hustled ones and twos there was still some of the Buttler magic, the highlight of which was his ramped six towards the river that was outrageously audacious in its execution With their wicketkeeper now up and running, it means Jason Roy remains the one piece of the batting jigsaw still causing heads to be scratched among the England managementMorgan, speaking after the match, said the no-lose nature of Saturdays match against Australia would see him likely granted a stay of execution",3
" Another walk across the stumps, such as those in his last two dismissals, would test the captains previous backing of the opener for the entire tournament",1
"When the Wallabies play Fiji in Melbourne on Saturday the majority of players on the field will be of Pacific Islander descent Obviously, the Fijians are Pacific Islanders, but 18 members of the Wallabies 34-man squad are of Pacific Islander descent,though centre Samu Kerevi, who was one of seven Fijians, has withdrawn following an ankle injuryAt present, there is also a decent percentage of Pacific Islanders playing for the All Blacks, while there is even a sprinkling in the British and Irish Lions, plus the English, French and Japanese national teams It raises the a question for the game on a global level: are the Pacific Island nations just becoming nurseries for the top cashed-up countries in world rugby?It is not as if Australia, at least, is actively poaching lots of Pacific Island players, but the talent is still finding its way to these shores The vast majority of the Pacific Islanders in the Wallabies squad are the Australian-born sons of migrants, or migrated to Australia at a young age",5
"In this sense they are no different to Wallabies flanker Michael Hooper, who is the son of English migrants",1
 But there is a key difference,1
" England has a population of 53 million, while Fiji, for example, has a population of less than one million (892,000)Rugby is hugely popular in the Pacific Islands, but the populations and broadcast revenues in the nations which comprise it are not big enough to create the professional infrastructure needed to keep their best players at home",2
" As a result the national teams of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga have not really progressed very far since the inaugural World Cup in 1987",1
"Significantly, Pacific Island teams  Fiji (1987) and Western Samoa (1991 and 1995)  reached the quarter-finals in the first three amateur World Cups, but only one (Fiji in 2007) has made the top eight of the tournament in the professional era",1
The performance of the Pacific Island nations is at odds with the enormous contribution players of Pacific Island descent have made to the game around the world,1
" Under rugbys eligibility laws, once a player has played for one country he cannot play for another even if he was eligible by birth or parentageWorld Rugby recently increased the residency period for Test eligibility from three years to five years in an attempt to dissuade major countries from poaching Pacific Island players, but this just means scouts will identify talent at an earlier ageOne practical way to help the Pacific Islanders become more competitive is to allow players who are no longer required to play for their adopted countries to return to their nation of origin or descent",3
" Too often Pacific Island players are capped by a major country, play a few Tests and are never seen again on the international stageA recent example is giant Tongan-born second rower Sitaleki Timani, the older brother of Lopeti, who played 18 Tests for the Wallabies between 2011 and 2013, but has not been required since Timani, 30, started for Clermont in their 22-16 win against Toulon in the final of the French Top 14 last Sunday",3
"Former Wallabies captain Mark Ella has told Guardian Australia he thinks that letting players return to representing their Pacific Island nation of origin could work In principle I agree with it as long as their focus is on their nation of origin, Ella says",2
 They could add value and help build the reputation of the Pacific Island teams,1
" I would have no problem with thatWhich leaves a slightly more awkward question Does the world of rugby really want to help the Pacific Island nations, or is it afraid they could become too competitive?Eoin Morgan heaped praise on his bowlers after Englands 87-run victory over New Zealand sealed a Champions Trophy semi-final berth and a chance to knock rivals Australia out of the tournament in their final group game at Edgbaston on Saturday",3
Morgan saw the wickets shared among his attack as New Zealand were bowled out for 223 in 44,1
"3 overs chasing 311 for the win, with Liam Plunkett picking up four for 55 to top the figuresJake Ball, who was named man of the match, and the returning Adil Rashid picked up two apiece, while Mark Woods removal of Kane Williamson for 87 was pivotal",2
"I thought they did an outstanding job said Morgan They were truly the highlight of the day Our batting performance was probably par or below par, pretty average, so I thought the bowlers as a collective unit were brilliant, really",3
" On the batting, which saw Joe Root top score with 64 but England bowled out for 310 with three balls to spare, Morgan added: I thought we looked like we were getting about 340 at one stage, but we fell away, which is disappointing But the fact that were still trying to win games with the bat, regardless of the situation that were in, I think is testament to the team Were staying true to what we believe in and what weve achieved over the last couple of yearsAsked what approach his side will take into the Australia match, given they have now won Group A, Morgan replied: A very serious attitude We never take any opposition for granted",5
" I think if were truly going to be contenders for this tournament, we need to beat the best teams and Australia are one of the best teams",1
"Williamson, who escaped a ban for his sides slow over rate but was docked 40% of his match fee to go with 20% for his players, had few complaints over the result and admitted Englands attack simply made better use of the two-paced pitchA credit to the way England bowled, Williamson said",2
" They got a lot out of the surface They bowled very consistently, and made life difficult for us with the bat",2
 Maybe the pitch changed just a fraction but they exploited it by cross seamers hitting the wicket hard,1
" Theyre all big lads, and they pretty much hit that six-metre length and created a little variability out of the surface They didnt give us much at all, to be fairChris Woakes, meanwhile, has revealed he is likely to miss Englands first Test of the summer, with the injury that ended his tournament against Bangladesh last Thursday revealed to be a grade-two tear in his left side that will take up to six weeks of recovery",3
England take on South Africa at Lords on 8 June  Joe Roots first Test as captain  and Woakes said: Im probably up against it,1
" Sometimes these things heal quicker, sometimes they take longer, so we have to play it by ear You cant rush back  if you do, it can just ping again The timing of it is frustrating, its terrible, but its one of those thingsRain and wind scudded through Paris on day 10 of the 2017 French Open, punching a three-hour hole in the schedule, but it was worth the wait for the combustible but talented teenager Jelena Ostapenko, and the Swiss outsider, Timea Bacsinszky, who will meet in the semi-finals on Thursday As it happens they share a birthday that day, which is taking Hollywood scriptwriting to absurdity",5
"Ostapenko, who turns 20 on the biggest day of her career, said after beating Caroline Wozniacki in three sets: It was tough because we had to go away two times from the court and Caroline is such a tough opponent Its great to play here on my birthday I am really going to enjoy itBacsinszky, who is 28 on match day, finally got the better of the French favourite Kristina Mladenovic, 17 places ahead of her in the rankings at 14, having led 6-4, 1-1 before they departed Court Philippe Chatrier around 330pm",5
" On resumption she held her nerve to close out the second set for the loss of a further three games over a full course of an hour and 49 minutesShe said: We had all the seasons in one day today  there was a storm, sunshine and I think even snow! It was very tough and to keep concentration was very difficult I am exhausted",3
"On Court Suzanne Lenglen, Wozniacki should have had  on ranking, experience, pedigree and sentiment  the beating of the not-quite-so-popular Ostapenko (who had an infamous bust-up with Britains Naomi Broady in New Zealand last year), but the precocious Latvian showed enormous cool to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-2",1
The former British No1 Annabel Croft said of Ostapenko: She reminds me of a young Monica Seles She hits the line time and time againAt several points on Tuesdayyesterday it looked as if there would not be a single completed match as wave after wave of windswept rain thrashed through Roland Garros,3
"Unfortunately for the men, there was no space left in the day for the quarter-finals between Rafael Nadal, still the outright favourite, and his Spanish compatriot Pablo Carreo Busta, or the match between Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem, whom the second seed beat out of sight in the semi-finals in Rome two weekends ago",1
"The forecast for Wednesday is fine, so they should have no problem completing their obligations and still have a days rest before the semi-finals on Friday In the other mens quarters on Wednesday Andy Murray plays Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka, the No3 seed, takes on Marin Cilic",2
"In a tournament that has had controversy lurking like a cloud, the outspoken Australian Pat Cash entered the fray with a few harsh words for Murrays coach, Ivan Lendl",1
" He is by far the most annoying person in the locker room that I have ever met in my life, Cash said on EurosportThe former Wimbledon champion added: And Im not joking First of all hes got really bad jokes, theyre just horrendous, and hes really loud",3
" Certainly during my career he was always the loudest, he was like the king of the jungleThere was always a bit of chest-thumping going on amongst various players, and certain players liked that Ivan was just one of those guys",3
" He was always making fun of somebody or picking on you and that was his way of putting you down  you probably wouldnt be surprised to hear that I gave a lot back as wellBut he is the complete opposite [to what you see on TV] Ive been down in the locker room today a fair bit and Ivan was doing the same thing, telling jokes",3
 Its kind of cool because it keeps it very light and hes not quite as loud as he used to beIt keeps it light and the players can relax and of course Andys got a full team there Mark Bender [his physio] is there and hes very easygoing,3
" You need people like that But, when it comes down to business, they get on with it They dont mess around",3
 Theyre a very professional teamEngland became the first side to secure a semi-final berth in the Champions Trophy by defeating New Zealand in conditions that would have had gnarled old yachtsmen scrambling for the shore and abandoned umbrellas flying off to the next county,2
" That semi-final will take place in Cardiff on 14 June Before that there is the small matter of a group game against Australia at Edgbaston on Saturday Another victory there would send the Australians homeHere, England won by 87 runs Having batted competently to post 310 they bowled and fielded with superb discipline and intelligence, as polished a performance as they have delivered this season, especially since this was their most important match of the summer",5
"The pace bowlers, who were often blown off course in their approach to the wicket, were bang on target and brimful ofintent They even discovered an uneven patch just short of a length which madea few deliveries misbehave on what hadhitherto been regarded as a blameless surface At last the poor bowlers had something toaim at",3
"Critically one of those mischievous deliveries was directed at Kane Williamson and it would produce the key dismissal Williamson had batted calmly for 87 and New Zealand, on 158 for two, were on course when Mark Wood ran up to bowl The Kiwi captain, disconcerted by steep bounce, ended up gloving the ball to Jos Buttler behind the stumps; he left staring angrily at the surface, a signal that would not have a benign effect on his dressing room",3
Now England seized their chance magnificently,1
" They sensed the Kiwi batsmen had started to mistrust the pitch Liam Plunkett had already caused some consternation when hitting Williamson on the helmet and Ross Taylor on the hand  and they gave them no respite Jake Ball, who had started with two maidens, was as unrelenting as his senior partners and ended up as the man of the match",2
" Ben Stokes, though a little more expensive, was hostile and appeared to bowl without pain Morgan asked him to bowl eight overs He would probably have bowled 10 if the match had gone the distance",3
"Adil Rashid, restored to the side, bowled as well as he has ever done in this format in conditions that offered him very little assistance He is now surely in Englands best side even if the opponents are from Asia After Williamsons departure Englands out-cricket was flawless except for a spurned caught and bowled chance by Rashid",3
 None of the Kiwis could threaten and the wickets fell in a flurry,1
It ended up as a stroll yet at the halfway stage Englands total felt respectable but not invincible Their innings never quite took off but it was never completely grounded either,2
" In these conditions it was remarkable that the quality of the cricket from both sides was so high At times the gusts reached 50mph, treacherously buffeting bowlers, while it was tricky for the batsmen to stand still",2
"Sometimes the electronic advertising hoardings were blown over; so too were the triangular covers stationed over the boundary ropes, which were often tossed infield At least the gales blew away the rainAs a consequence the game was almost unrecognisable, especially when the bowling was from the Taff end",3
" The boundary there is perilously short even in normal conditions so later in the innings the Kiwi bowlers tried to take the straight hit out of the equation Hence they bowled a succession of bouncers, fast and slow, so that the batsmen had to hit towards the long boundary and crucially into the wind Given the exploits of the England bowlers from that end later in the day they might have been better advised to bang the ball in on alength more frequently in pursuit of some of the uneven bounce found by Plunkett and Wood",3
"The England batsmen, marshalled by Buttler at the end, gleaned their runs pragmatically, apart from a barren last over",1
" They might have scored more but every time a promising partnership was about to flourish a wicket fellThat even applied during the opening partnership since Jason Roy lasted a little longer than usual He was there for eight overs and 13 runs before trying something extravagant against Adam Milne He shimmied to the offside, prematurely leaving his leg stump exposed and that is where the ball ended up Roy departed in a fury, presumably at his own premeditation",5
" There can be no guarantees that he keeps his place against AustraliaThereafter England were indebted to significant rather than major contributions from Alex Hales, Joe Root, Stokes and Buttler",2
" As at The Oval against Bangladesh, Hales was dismissed straight after hitting a six, something for him to ponderRoot purred as usual, caressing two sixes off the left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner, in the knowledge that he only had to clear mid-on In his partnership with Stokes he was frequently denied the strike (he faced 15 balls to Stokess 37) and this seemed to upset his rhythm",3
" He wasbowled off his inside edge, almost his first false shotStokes, who hit some wonderfully crisp boundaries, in between the dots was caught at third man and then Buttler did his stuff In fact he was not as fluent as usual; his first boundary came from his 24th delivery and that was an edge over the keeper, but he was never becalmed",3
" Later another shot from Buttler headed over Luke Ronchi behind the stumps but this one was intentional: a preposterous ramp over his shoulder off Trent Boult nearly struck a cameraman high above the sightscreen, who up until then had thought that the gusting wind was his biggest threatBritish Cycling is poised to sever its last remaining physical ties with Team Sky by asking the professional squad to move out of the Manchester velodrome which they have used as a shared home for the past seven years",2
"Board members at British Cycling are understood to have pushed for a discernible split between the two organisations which have shared a base and personnel since Team Sky were founded in 2010 They believe it would be a significant move in the battle to restore British Cyclings reputation, with an announcement expected early next weekThe closeness of the two has been the source of great consternation during the past 14 months as each lurched from one damaging episode to another",3
"While British Cycling was fighting claims of a culture of favouritism and bullying made by the sprint rider Jess Varnish, it was also dragged into the crisis surrounding Team Sky, Sir Bradley Wiggins and a mystery medical package delivered to the rider at the end of the Critrium du Dauphin race in June 2011While Team Sky also have bases in France and Belgium they still rent office space from British Cycling at the velodrome on the outskirts of Manchester which its director of business operations, Fran Millar, uses and where the team principal, Sir Dave Brailsford, regularly holds meetingsBut this is likely to come to an end after various British Cycling stakeholders determined a divide to be the best way forward",3
" Team Sky are thought to be looking for another location in Manchester to set up homeBrailsford was the architect of both teams successes, forming Team Sky on the back of British Cyclings huge medal haul at the Beijing Olympics in 2008",2
" Initially they shared medical personnel and facilities, intellectual property and mechanicsBy early 2010 it was deemed necessary to instruct the consultancy firm Deloitte at a cost of 40,000, shared by UK Sport and British Cycling, to conduct a review into possible conflicts of interest",2
 It determined there was a benefit to Olympic and Paralympic riders from their relationship with the Sky programme,1
" In many ways that has proved to be accurate, with British cyclists continuing to dominate on the world stage in the velodrome and on the roads",1
But the questions about whether the relationship with the media conglomerate left publicly funded British Cycling compromised have endured,1
" For the past eight years Sky have given 25m a year in sponsorship to British Cycling Some of that has been used to develop mass-participation cycling but a chunk has also gone towards supporting the Olympic team, who won eight gold medals at London 2012 and six in Rio in 2016",3
"Last year Sky dropped its backing for the participation programme and was replaced by HSBC but continue to back the professional Team Sky programme, standing by Brailsford and the riders amid a range of controversies",1
"British Cycling insists it no longer shares personnel with Team Sky and that any joint resources have been drastically scaled back over the past three years But there is still a presence of Team Sky riders at the velodromeA UK anti-doping investigation into the mystery Jiffy bag package delivered to Wiggins, which took 1,000 man hours, twice led to the medical room at the velodrome in east Manchester being raided by investigators in searches for evidenceDamian Collins, the chair of the culture, media and sport committee, said the saga left the reputations of both organisations in tatters It emerged that Dr Richard Freeman, who divided his time between the two teams for a period, had received the package",5
"Simon Cope, a British Cycling womens team coach at the time, dropped his other responsibilities and drove to France with the Jiffy bag, working on a freelance basis for Team Sky A sizeable quantity of the controversial corticosteroid triamcinolone, at the centre of the story, had also been ordered into British Cyclings medicine cabinet",2
"The blurred relationship between the two was heavily criticised by Collins and his select committee colleagues, and the British Cycling chairman, Jonathan Browning, said this year it would be subject of further examination He said at the time: There are some areas where there will be benefit of supporting each other and sharing but they need to be very clearly defined and boundaries drawn between the two organisations I would characterise the separation as substantial now",3
"There is still contact between the two organisations and there are no individuals with dual roles, but we are going to step back and look at it again to make sure we avoid any potential conflict of interest",1
The Ukad probe into the mystery Jiffy bag continued to rumble on,1
 The Guardian understands Ukad investigators working on the case travelled to Manchester to meet with the former British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton on TuesdayThe final report into claims of sexism and discrimination at British Cycling made by Varnish and other riders is due to be published next week after six months of delays and the Ukad investigation into the triamcinolone allegations continues,2
"Romelu Lukaku says remaining at Everton next season is not really an option and suggested his agent has reached an agreement over personal terms with a rival club, believed to be Chelsea, as he seeks to make his mark with a team in the Champions League",1
"The striker, who began Belgiums friendly victory over Czech Republic on Monday in the run-up to a World Cup qualifier in Estonia on Friday, cast his future into doubt at Goodison Park in March when he confirmed he had rejected a lucrative new contractHe has now stated his intention is to leave this summer though Everton will seek 100m for the services for a player who is contracted for a further two years, aworld record fee Chelsea will be reluctant to pay for a forward they sold for 28m in 2014",2
"Yet, while he has also attracted tentative interest from Manchester United and Bayern Munich, Lukakus heart is set on a return to Stamford Bridge with the onus now effectively on the Premier League champions to negotiate a deal with his current club",1
"Staying at Everton is not really an option for next season, the striker said I am staying calm about everything There is nothing concrete with another club at the moment, but my agent is busy discussing things",3
" Im not going to make big declarations on my future, but I know where I want to play: in a club who are competing in the Champions League and can win titles in England Staying in England is best for me I know the competition, and Ive almost reached 100 goals inthe league, which is a milestone I want to achieveThe Premier League is a dream for me, but I also want to win the Champions League, the FA Cup and other prizes I dont want to stay at the same level",5
" I wantto improve, and I know where I want to do that",1

" Im just going to rest for a few days and then just prepare for next season I want to put the time in on my holiday to take everything to another level and be better than I was last yearIt remains to be seen whether compromise can be reached between Chelsea and Everton over a fee or, indeed, if the Premier League champions still prioritise Lukakus purchase if Diego Costa is to remain at the club next seasonThe Spain forward is resisting the chance to move to the Chinese Super League, where Tianjin Quanjian were initially prepared to pay 76m for his services, with his preference very much a return to Atltico Madrid instead However the Spanish club are currently operating under an incoming transfer ban and will not be able to sign players until January 2018",5
"The Miami-Dade Commission voted on Tuesday to approve a deal to sell David Beckhams group nearly three acres of county land, representing a major hurdle cleared in the former England and Manchester United stars push to bring a Major League Soccer team to the cityThe commissioners voted nine to four in favor to ratify a recommendation by the mayor to sell Beckhams partnership a county truck-depot at the corner of Northwest Sixth Street and Sixth Avenue, which would become the last piece in a nine-acre site for a planned 25,000-seat stadium on the Miami RiverBy purchasing the last piece of land needed for our privately-funded stadium, Miami Beckham United (MBU) is achieving another major milestone on the way to Major League Soccer formally awarding Miami a franchise, read a statement from MBU",3
" [The group has] assembled a world-class team of partners, presented a vision for building the premier soccer club in the Americas, and assembled the land needed to build our stadium Now is the time for MLS to move forward in helping us deliver the soccer club that Miami has been waiting for",2
Beckhams group will pay just over $9 million for the last piece of land,1
 It has already paid $19 million for the other six acres needed,1
" Beckhams group says the planned stadium would be privately funded, and the stadium would also be subject to county property taxIts a major development in what has been at times an arduously slow  and often frustrating  process for the English soccer icon and his plans for Miami MLS has not officially awarded Miami an expansion franchise, because of the lack of a land and stadium deal",3
"A contract he signed in 2007 with the Los Angeles Galaxy gave Beckham the right to start an expansion franchise for $25 million, and in 2013 he picked Miami as where he would want to put a team The plan has changed many times along the way, most notably because he was unable to get waterfront land that his group first coveted for a stadium site",2
"I will tell you this is probably the best site we have found, for many respects, Beckham group attorney Neisen Kasdin said, before listing reasons that include the sites proximity to several modes of public transportation and the Miami River",1
"The vote in Miami on Beckhams land deal was preceded by several members of the community urging commissioners to vote no, mostly citing noise and traffic concernsThis land has been an eyesore for years",2
 ,3
" Something needs to be done with it, now, said commissioner Audrey Edmonson, who represents the neighborhood where the stadium is planned",1
The deal that allowed the Miami Marlins to get a new taxpayer-built ballpark on the former Orange Bowl site is still the source of major contention for the city and the county,1
" Theres also skepticism about the Beckham groups plan to build a stadium with no on-site parking, with plans instead to rely on shuttles, walking and public transportation",1
"As far as sports deals go with the county, this one isnt so bad, commissioner Joe Martinez saidBeckham is not the only soccer name pursuing MLS expansion these days; Landon Donovan has joined the ownership group that is hoping to bring a team to San DiegoIt has not been easy going for either",3
The victory for Beckham came just one day after San Diegos city council decided not to finance a special election that would have brought plans of building a new soccer complex there to a vote,1
" In a pair of tweets, Donovan wrote that we have to respect the process and that just because were down at halftime doesnt mean we stop trying",1
Much has changed for Lizzie Deignan since her victory in the 2016 Womens Tour,1
" Twelve months ago she was still Lizzie Armitstead  before her marriage in September to the Irish racer Philip Deignan  she was wearing the rainbow jersey of the world road race champion and, most notably, she was racing under the threat of a two-year suspension having just been given a provisional third strike for infringements of the whereabouts system",1
"The first of the three strikes was overturned in late July 2016 by the court of arbitration for sport, so she was not banned in the end, but Deignan has described how hard she found it to compete and appear in front of the public with her fate still to be decided She also explained that, given UK Anti-Doping had yet to confirm that strike from early June, she felt she had no choice but to rideBy the end of the Womens Tour this year I will be strike-free, which is nice, but that whole period is a blur",3
 It feels like old news now,1
" Im supposed to have come to terms with it, but there will always be two camps  people who believe in me and those who dont, says DeignanIm getting there, Im not totally back to normal, Im always on the look-out for the next drama Im reluctant to get too comfortable",3
" Im lucky that within our sport there is always a race just around the corner No one ever asks me about it in Europe, but Im asked a lot by the UK press",2
"Rather than being based in Monaco as usual, Deignan has spent the past month in England building towards her home Tour following victory in the 122km Womens Tour of Yorkshire on 29 April Its been really good The terrain is relentless so Ive been slogging away",3
" Ive just been building a base after the spring, she says",1
 Hopefully the Womens Tour will give me some speed ahead of the national championships Ill be looking to come out stronger than I go in,2
"As last year, she will start as favourite on a course which again includes a hilly stage on the Saturday after three days on the rolling roads of the Midlands and Cotswolds but she admits to being concerned about the threatening form of last years runner-up, the South African Ashleigh Moolman-PasioDeignans Yorkshire win ended a spring in which she scored three second places to her team-mate Anna van der Breggen in the triptych of Ardennes Classics  Flche Wallonne, Lige-Bastogne-Lige and Amstel Gold",2
"I was definitely struggling at the start of the season with illness, and it was hard because I was so successful the year before We had dual leadership in the Ardennes, we dominated and each time Anna went for it so we couldnt ask for more as a team I have to learn to attack after she does as each time Id attack, Id be brought back, then Anna would go for it",3
"Van der Breggen repaid Deignan with strong support in the Yorkshire race, which she describes as really important",1
" It had live television all the way through so we could showcase what we do, how [her team] Boels-Dolmans do our job",1
" It was a very special win because all my friends and family were there and I knew the roads Normally attacking from 50 kilometres out is crazy but I knew what the roads would be doing to the riders behind meAfter this week, Deignans priority will be taking a second world title in September on a course in Bergen which she feels suits her, having visited it in early May",3
" I liked it, its a hard climb to do eight times There in Norway she will be reunited with a Great Britain team for which she has had hard words in the past She has not yet heard from the new performance director, Stephen Parks, but appears to have built a good working relationship with Julian Winn, the coach who looked after the Great Britain women in the run-in to the 2008 Beijing Games",3
"In the four editions since its inception in 2014 the Womens Tour has gradually moved towards maturity, working from the principle that in terms of prize money and logistical back-up  such as hotel accommodation  women cyclists should be given precisely the same treatment as their male counterpartsIt now again shares a title sponsor with the mens race, OVO Energy, the stages have been lengthened and last year it was routed over the Peak District to test the field to the full, an experiment which is repeated on SaturdayThis years innovation is a circuit race in central London on Sunday using the same extended course used in the past by the mens Tour of Britain, which is unlikely to change the final outcome, but will provide a valuable showcase",3
" The final hurdle is British Cyclings unwillingness to let the organisers extend the event to seven days, thinking which could seem distinctly backward if this weeks race is a successTurkeys captain, Arda Turan, has announced that he is quitting the team following a bust-up with a reporter on the flight back from a friendly international in MacedoniaThe Barcelona midfielder admitted he had made a mistake while representing his country, and was ending a career with the national team after 94 caps and 17 goals But he said he did not regret the clash with Milliyet reporter on the flight after Turkey drew 0-0 on Monday, saying Bilal Mese had insulted him during the Euro 2016 tournament in FranceThe broadcaster CNN Turk quoted Mese as saying Turan attacked him shortly after boarding the plane, hurling insults and swinging punches at him despite being restrained by another journalist, a security guard and team personnel",5
 Mese said he would take legal action against Turan,1
"At first I thought he was joking  Then, one of his punches swung by, CNN Turk quoted Mese as saying",1
"Commenting on the events on the flight to Slovenia, where Turkey will train before a World Cup qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday, Turan said the reporter had spread rumours and insulted his family values while covering Euro 2016He said: I made a mistake while wearing the national team uniform It was something that should not have happened on the national team plane, he said Do I regret it? No, I feel like a bird because I never forgot what was said about meI am putting an end to my national team career",5
" I am speaking as someone who has served at every level of the national team, who loves his country and is in love with this jerseyTuran was widely criticised for a disappointing performance at Euro 2016 The the 30-year-old joined Barcelona from Atltico Madrid in July 2015Turkey are fourth in the World Cup qualifying Group I with eight points from five matches, five adrift of the leaders Croatia and two behind second-placed IcelandOnly three players in the Premier League have the ability, when at their awesome best, to make everyone else on the pitch look like immature creatures, toddlers trying and failing to compete with giants",5
 Two of those players are on the wane  Yaya Tour and Zlatan Ibrahimovic  but the other should be approaching his prime,1
" If Liverpool sign Virgil van Dijk they willbe making the ultimate upgrade to their teamOn one level it could be argued that to splurge 60m or thereabouts on any player is to blare a huge scouting or coaching failure, since a really savvy club might be able find or develop a less obvious solution But in terms of forking out for a surefire success, there is no better signing than Van Dijk that Jrgen Klopp could make to improve his rickety defence, no single purchase that could demonstrate more clearly Liverpools determination to clamber back atop that long-vacated perchDoubts about the seriousness of that ambition gained traction recently as the clubs apparent willingness to make do with half-cocked solutions suggested that their American owners might be satisfied with becoming the new Arsenal, full of tempered hope rather than true-blooded conviction Signing Van Dijk would dispel such a notion",5
" Of course if Van Dijk really has set his heart on a move to Anfield, then failing to complete the deal now, especially due to gauche antagonisation of the potential seller, would make the new Arsenal tag so apt that Liverpool might as well bang a cannon on their crestVan Dijk was majestic at Celtic and has been regal at Southampton, where, as soon as he arrived two years ago, he assumed a lordly guise, healing everyone who pined for Toby Alderweireld",2
" Powerful, fast and perceptive, he dominates in the air and on the ground, often with seemingly effortless grace Simon Mignolet and Liverpools defenders have seemed locked into the opposite of a symbiotic relationship, a mutually debilitating bind in which the flaws of each sap the confidence of the other and ensnare the lot of them in a vicious circle of decrepitude Van Dijk is commanding enough to break that chain and impose order and confidence",3
" That does not mean, of course, that Liverpool would not benefit from enriching their squad with a goalkeeper and left-back as solid as Fraser Forster and Ryan Bertrand respectively, but Van Dijks arrival would make such additions less urgent",1
"Liverpool badly need a wholesome meat-and-potatoes centre-back, a stalwart who excels at defendings fundamentals",1
 Picture Mamadou Sakho on a good day Now picture Sakho having a good day nearly every day But Van Dijk is much more than that,3
" He is that most precious of talents, a ball-playing centre-back of the sort that John Stones can supposedly become, a stopper who also creates",1
" He can sashay forward with even more finesse than Jol Matip and, to boot, is a potent aerial threat from set pieces and can even take a mean free-kick",1
" Whether in a back three or a back four, he could be Liverpools answer to David Luiz, and moreIf Van Dijk is sincere about wanting to join Liverpool despite more lucrative offers from elsewhere, that speaks well of his character and that of Klopp",2
" It suggests that he distinguishes between merely winning and winning gloriously, being a champion and a hero At Liverpool his aim would be to become a leader in the team who satisfy one of English footballs most intense cravings, that generation-long yearning for the restoration of their domestic crown, and maybe their European one too Nothing he could achieve at Chelsea or Manchester City could beat that",3
"If Southampton were to be seen to sell Van Dijk without a fight, meanwhile, then that, on the back of so many other sales, would confirm that they have different ambitions To be acclaimed as canny scouts and developers would appear to be enough for them, and would make them, in one sense, a definitive success story ofthe Premier League age: expert and very well-paid middle menSometimes the transfer market resembles one of the more elaborate submissions for the Turner Art Prize, as if conceived primarily for shock value rather than any reasonable standard of beauty or efficacy One day it will be revealed that Mesut zils Arsenal contract was created from microscopic reproductions of Dr Crippens moustache, that the fee Manchester United paid for Paul Pogba was delivered to Juventus entirely in the form of pickled sharks, and that David Luizss towels are fashioned out of kitten eyebrows interweaved with hyper-absorbent rhino ear-hair Meanwhile an entire wing of the Tate Modern will be dedicated to the works of Mino Raiola, where men with metal-rimmed glasses and hipster beards will stroke their chins pensively while discussing, on a vaguely related theme, whether it is indeed the case that the first two initials in JMW Turners name stood for Jorge Mendes",5
"It is currently hard to tell if Virgil van Dijk is actually still a footballer, or some kind of installation who exists only to provoke debate and controversy Is he staying or going? What is his value? What is value anyway? If a footballers price in the market is a reflection of his on-field performances, how has Van Dijks managed to rise by 20m over the last five months, when he has been knacked for four-and-a-half of them? Does he intend to join Manchester City, Chelsea, Everton, Arsenal or Liverpool, or to remain in Southampton? Is harmony achieved in the composition through formal, asymmetrical, or intuitive balance devices?The story in brief: 13 months ago the Dutchman penned a new six-year contract with Southampton, legally tying himself to the club until his early 30s Im so pleased, Im so happy, he trousered",3
" The club is growing and I definitely want to grow with them, thats how I feel Hopefully we can make it happen Now he feels he has outgrown them, while the only thing he still hopes to make happen is a move to Liverpool His six-year contract quelled transfer speculation for less than six months, by which time rumours had started proliferating like rats in a particularly fetid sewer According to the national press in January, Southampton were valuing him at 50m, in May at 60m and in June at 70m, while chairman Ralph Krueger publicly insisted all along he was going nowhere",5
" Virgil is committed to us for a long time, he said in February, and we dont see anything but that in our futureIn the last 24 hours widespread media reports have claimed Van Dijk has decided to join Liverpool because, to quote the Mirror, of the vision Jrgen Klopp sold to the defender Southampton read these reports with arched eyebrows, in the belief that the only people actually permitted to sell Van Dijk anything to do with vision would be opticians and double glazing salesmen, and then they phoned the Premier League and said something along the lines of, Oi",3
" The Premier League is investigatingAnd thus we are presented with another summer Southampton-Liverpool transfer saga, which will be welcomed by fans of seminal 2014 pieces Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren, the 2015 conceptual work Nathaniel Clyne and 2016s Sadio Man, but which others will inevitably consider somewhat derivative Sure, its not groundbreaking, but in The Fivers view compared with the artists previous work the composition on this occasion is more refined, the colours more vibrant, and yet it still conveys the same essential message which  and our art appreciation isnt always up to much but we think weve got the measure of this one  is something along the lines of: Dear God please make it stop",3

" King is alleged to have forced the woman into sex acts in a bathroom before inviting Corley and Vance into the room separately, where she was forced into oral sexCoach Mark Dantonio says all three players have been dismissed from the football program They had already been suspended from the program in February after the school became aware of the allegations Sexual assault has no place in our community, and I want to share my deep concern for the young woman affected and her family, said Dantonio via statementThis is an extremely challenging situation that we have taken very seriously and has affected everyone in this program",5
" The high standards I have established for this program will not change, and the values that we teach to everyone in this program will be enforced I expect all of our players and staff to conduct themselves in a manner that reflect the ideals of this university",2
"Four of the 20 football players who joined Michigan State as freshmen in 2016 have now been charged with sexual assault Auston Robertson was charged over an alleged rape in April and was dismissed from the program Karen Truszkowski, who is representing King, Vance and Corleys alleged victim, said that the schools internal investigation had not looked at whether sexual assault was endemic to the program",3

"Vance, 20, is a redshirt defensive back from Detroit Corley, 19, is a receiver from Detroit King, also 19, is a freshman defensive end from Darien, IllinoisIts said that when Sultan Abdulaziz saw his very first game of cricket, between two teams of British officers, he told them that he thought the sport was wonderful but wondered why, since bowling seemed so needlessly exhausting, the men didnt get their servants and concubines to perform it for them The Sultan, who was eventually overthrown, imprisoned and murdered, had what you might politely describe as some eccentric ideas about how society should function, but with cricket, at least, he was on to something",5
"There is more glamour attached to batting than bowling, Don Bradman once wrote, since the majority of people go to cricket hoping to see a scintillating innings",1
" Bowlers, Bradman reckoned, must possess a tremendous love for cricket What else would drive them to such exertions?The bowlers lot is a rough one",2
" If the workload is lighter now, the job has seldom seemed so utterly thankless In the first four days of the Champions Trophy, we had successive totals of 305 for six and 308 for two, 291 and 53 for three, 299 for six and 203, 319 for three and 164",2
" The 45 bowlers in the thick of all this managed exactly eight maidens between them Altogether, they took just 42 of the 80 wickets on offer, at an average of 46 and an economy rate of 5",2
"92 Before the tournament, we had Englands 328 against Ireland at Lords, their 339, and 330 against South Africa, and in the tournament warm-ups, totals of 318 and 319 in Australias match against Sri Lanka, 341 and 342 when Bangladesh played Pakistan, 324 by India, and then 356 and 359 between Sri Lanka and New ZealandParse all that as the numerical expression of a whole lot of pain It seems there are now two ways to keep a team to a total under 300 One is to pray for rain, and the other is to hope they stumble in their own hurry to score quickly and collapse in a heap",5
" Which, if youve been paying close attention, wont come as much of a surprise, because scoring rates have been rising steadily since the start of this decade",1
"Its that exact reason, in fact, that makes it easy to forget just how large a leap forward the game has taken in the last 10 years I watched Englands second ODI against South Africa with an old friend whos moved to the US",2
" It had been a while since hed seen a one-day game Remind me, he said at one point, is 300 still a good total or not?Well, no, not really In 2009, the overall bowling economy rate in ODIs topped five for the first time In 2014 it grew again, to 519, and in 2016 it reached 5",5
"40 So far this year, its running at 5",2
"32, which is two runs higher than it was when they started playing ODI cricket back in the early 70s Then, in 2013, the overall batting strike rate rose up above 80 for the first time And then it shot forward in another leap in 2014, to 83",3
"30 Since then its crept higher still, to 869 in 2015",3
" Midway through 2017, its running at 8573 for the year Ten years ago the figure was 77",3
"43, and 10 years before that it was 7281 Imagine all this on a graph, and youll see the rising line take a sharp upward tick in the last few yearsThe evolution of batting is coming on in a rush For years, it has moved in fits and starts, advanced by the radical acts of individuals whose successful innovations would be widely adopted",5
" Whether that was Fuller Pilch (ask your great, great, great, great grandfathers), who first had the idea of coming out to meet the ball at its pitch, or WG Grace, who taught everyone how to play both forward and back, Ranjitsinhji, who opened up the leg side, or, years later, Doug Marillier with his scoop-shot and Kevin Pietersen with his switch-hit These days everyone is at it",2
" Constrained for years by the orthodoxies of correct technique, the idea that there is a right and a wrong way to play, batsmen are free now, and have even been forced by necessity to explore all the possibilities",1
" Theyve untapped the latent potential of a sport in which you can hit through 360 degreesIts not just that batsmen have more shots now, or hit more fours and sixes, but that theyre more intent on scoring off every ball T20, when each ball counts as 0",3
"83% of the total available to the team, has taught the value of every single delivery, each too precious to waste by blocking or waving through A ball that passes by the bat without being played at now seems like a surprising event in itself",2
" The bowlers, then, are under more pressure than ever before And their own arsenal is starting to look a little thin",2
" A couple of their key weapons, the bouncer, say, or the doosra, have been legislated against Others  the wide yorker, or the slow short ball  were solved soon after they were introduced Theyre being outgunnedThe Sisyphean futility of bowling was never more apparent than in the final overs of Indias innings at Edgbaston last Sunday, when Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya unleashed a storm of such intensity, such great vengeance, such furious anger, that Pakistan were broken like a ship on the rocks They hit 117 in the last 10 overs, and 72 in the last four",5
" Mohammad Amir left the field with cramp, moments later Wahab Riaz went off too, with an injured ankle Amid the tatters of their attack, there were no servants or concubines to call on, only poor left-arm spinner Imad Wasim, who had the unenviable job of bowling the last over of the innings",2

"Sheikh Mohammeds Godolphin operation lost its racing manager for the second time in three years on Tuesday when John Ferguson quit, having apparently lost the trust of one of its key trainers",1
" Ferguson, a 25-year veteran in the Sheikhs employ who has also been was also serving as chief executive, felt he could not stay on after it emerged that he was being bypassed in the chain of command by Saeed bin Suroor, who has instead been seeking his instructions directly from the SheikhBin Suroor used a pre-Derby interview with the Racing Post to make undisguised criticisms of Fergusons regime, with particular reference to how it had impacted the Dubaians ability to do his job",2
" The trainer complained about being instructed to use the jockey James Doyle for the first part of last year and about the quality of two-year-olds he had been sent this year and the way in which they were delivered to him, which he blamed for the fact that he has yet to have a single juvenile runner this yearPerhaps most damagingly of all, Bin Suroor harked back to the time Simon Crisford managed Godolphin, saying everything was top class at that time and that he was now trying to rebuild his training operation to get back to that level Crisford was Godolphins racing manager from its creation in the mid-1990s until 2014, when he chose to step down a year after the organisation was engulfed by the steroids scandal involving the trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni, who had been recommended by Crisford to the Sheikh Crisford has since set up as an independent trainer in NewmarketFerguson, who became Godolphins chief executive in December 2015 after holding a variety of senior roles, decided his position had become untenable as a result of Bin Suroors pronouncements",5
"In times such as these, what matters is the future and my stepping down will allow everyone to draw a line under things and move forward, he addedAll the staff at Godolphin are wonderful people who work so hard for the greater good and I want to thank each and every one His Highness Sheikh Mohammed has given me so much over the years: trust, opportunity, amazing experiences and, perhaps most importantly, his kindness and counsel",3
 For all these things I thank him with all my heart,1
"Joe Osborne, managing director of Godolphin in Ireland and a key figure in setting up a branch of the operation in China, will now serve as interim chief executive of Godolphins global operation and is well placed to keep the job long term Based at Kildangan Stud, Osborne is another longstanding employee of the Sheikh and the son of Michael Osborne, credited by the Sheikh with establishing the Dubai World Cup as a major international race",2
"Ive known Joe a long number of years, said Jim Bolger, who trained Dawn Approach to win the 2000 Guineas for Godolphin Hes a thorough gentleman, very familiar with all aspects of thoroughbred breeding and racing",2
Bolger said Osborne is more than capable of handling the new role which has suddenly dropped into his lap Hes very efficient and what you see is what you get Its a big job but hes got square shoulders,3
"An early job for Osborne will be establishing a working relationship with Bin Suroor, who will require assurance that he is getting the same quality of stock as Charlie Appleby, Godolphins other trainer in Newmarket, whose assistant is Fergusons son, James This year we are behind by miles in regard to what we received for two-year-olds, Bin Suroor told the Post Ive never seen anything like it They need plenty of time, and a lot of them will not run this yearIt is a disaster",5
" Normally the two-year-olds come here  at the end of October, or early November This year some came in January, some in February, some in May",5
" They are very, very backward I cant train them, have no chance to run them",2
 The system is not quite great this year And two-year-olds are the future of any yard,2
"Bin Suroor is yet to have a two-year-old runner in Britain this year, while Appleby has had eight winners from 13 runners in that age group",1
" Bin Suroor also referred to the fact that his stable, which he described as the main Godolphin stable, had won just a single Group One race outside Dubai in three years Appleby, meanwhile, won one in France last month and had the second and third in Fridays Coronation Cup at EpsomNow Sheikh Mohammed makes the decisions at Stanley House, nobody else, Bin Suroor said I like things this way Last year it didnt suit me at all",5
" Everything was top class in past times, from the work-riders to the people in the office Now Im trying to build that up again for the future",2
" The last three years without Simon Crisford has not been the same, has not been easyIt is very good that now the yard is a happy place again  look at the results so far this season Now I am very positive about the futureSouthampton have reported Liverpool to the Premier League for allegedly making an illegal approach to Virgil van DijkThe south-coast club were furious to see stories on Monday that suggested Liverpool were in the driving seat to sign the defender this summer, in the face of interest from other leading clubs  namely Chelsea and Manchester City",5
"They argue that there is no way the stories could have been run unless Liverpool had spoken to Van Dijk and, thereby, put themselves in breach of Premier League rules over tapping up Several of the stories contained the line that Van Dijk wanted to move to Anfield because of Jrgen Klopps involvement in his recruitment  which Southampton suggest adds up to an illegal approach It is understood that the Dutchmans preference is to move to AnfieldSouthampton have made it clear to the Premier League they have received no official approach from Liverpool for Van Dijk and, more generally, they have stressed the player has five years to run on his contract, meaning they are in a strong position regarding where he does playLiverpool are reportedly willing to pay a world-record sum for a defender  expected to be around 60m  to break Southamptons resistance and they are also prepared to match Citys offer to Van Dijk of a contract worth around 200,000 a week",5
 Van Dijk would become Liverpools record signing and highest-paid player should the deal go ahead,1
 They declined to comment on Southamptons accusationsThe league has written to Southampton and Liverpool to ask for their version of events Liverpool have spent 96m on five Southampton players since the summer of 2014,3
" In that transfer window they took Adam Lallana (25m), Dejan Lovren (20m) and Rickie Lambert (45m) Nathaniel Clyne (125m) and Sadio Man (34m) followed in the summers of 2015 and 2016 respectivelySouthamptons position with their manager, Claude Puel, remains delicate and complicated given that he has all but left the club and they are actively pursuing a successor",5
" Yet Saints will not confirm his departure until they have lined up the new man, who would have to represent an upgradePuel, who arrived in June of last year, led Saints to the EFL Cup final, which they lost to Manchester United, and an eighth-placed finish in the league But his style of football has frequently been derided as turgid, the team have struggled for goals and when the French manager was booed by the St Marys crowd on the final day of the season against Stoke City, the writing was on the wall",3
"Puel sat down with the board for an end-of-season review, which did not go well, and there have since been no messages of support for him from the hierarchy",1
" He is away on holiday and has emerged as a target for the French club St-tienneSouthampton accept that Puel will be entitled to a pay-off on the final two years of his contract and they want a manager who is receptive to promoting players from the academy and with a vision for attractive, passing footballThere was something familiar about Gianluigi Buffon hoisting the Serie A trophy aloft after the game against Crotone at the end of May",3
" Now, when had we last seen that? Ah, yes, in 2016",1
" Oh, in 2015 as well 2014? Yep, very much so",2
 2013 and 2012? Of course,1
"Juventus have racked up six consecutive Serie A titles In those six seasons they have picked up nearly 200 points more than Internazionale Their dominance has been spectacularIt is very much the same story in Germany, where Bayern Munich have won the Bundesliga five years in a row since Borussia Dortmund secured the double in 2012 In France, Paris St-Germain have won four of the past five league titles",5
"Where is the fun in that True, England and Spain have had a slightly better spread of teams who have won the league and the main cup (six different teams over the past six years in England and three in Spain) but the dominance of a few clubs means that, at least in Italy and Germany, we pretty much know in August who is going to win the leagueSo why do we still care? Why do we still watch? We asked our writers how the dominance of a few teams is affecting their league and whether there are signs of fans turning off their TVs or not going to the stadiumsAfter Juventus won a record-breaking sixth consecutive Scudetto, its fair to say that things are getting repetitive at the top of Serie A The problem is that they have pushed the bar so high",5
Back in 2011-12 Juve claimed their first title in this sequence with 84 points,1
" Roma and Napoli exceeded that number this season, and yet neither has looked close to dislodging the Bianconeri",1
"The standard of the league is decidedly uneven Juventus have re-established themselves as one of the best teams on the planet, and to some extent have dragged the chasing pack up with them",2
" Napoli play some of the most entertaining football in Europe, and acquitted themselves better against Real Madrid in the Champions League this season than the 6-2 aggregate defeat suggested Roma, too, have improved",2
"But there is a significant gap between those teams and the next tier Lazio and Atalanta  the latter especially impressive for their development of homegrown talent  were compelling, but neither truly threatened the top three",2
 The Milan clubs seem to be trapped in permanent disarray  albeit both are expected to spend big under new Chinese owners this summer,1
" Fiorentina remain frustratingly flakyAnd as you drift into the bottom half of the table, so talent levels fall steeply",2
" Hardly surprising when you consider that 13 teams posted total revenues below 68m on their 2015-16 accountsOverall, it is a mixed picture Juventuss European exploits have restored some prestige to Serie A, but also highlight how far others have fallen behind",3
" Calls for the division to be reduced back to 18 teams are growing louder but the Italian Football Federations president, Carlo Tavecchio, called them pure utopia",1
Has the leagues TV deal suffered? Serie As TV deal works out at around 1,1
"13bn per year Predictability may have harmed the leagues marketability but Juventuss strong performances in Europe are also a counterbalance Half-empty stadiums, the poor performance of the Milan clubs and a struggling national economy are more tangible concerns",3
" PBThe accusation is as relentlessly repetitive as it is tiresome, not to mention a little baffling Who chants for a league rather than a team? And why get so wound up about it? Why does it occupy people so much, to the extent that any reference to Spain, however innocuous, is guaranteed to immediately get a least one pub league or similarly dismissive comment in reply? The accusation is flawed, too, but that doesnt mean that it is entirely falseSpanish football does have more than two clubs: Atltico Madrid won the title three years ago and have reached two of the past four Champions League finals That underlines the fact that if Spain is a two-horse race  and theres an element of that, Madrid and Barcelona having won all bar one of the past 10 titles  it is not because the rest are a bunch of donkeys Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao, Celta Vigo and Villarreal have in recent years reached semi-finals or beyond in Europe, which Spanish football has dominated",5
" Celta, 13th in La Liga, were one dreadful miss away from eliminating Manchester United and taking yet another Spanish team to yet another final in this seasons Europa League",1
"Meanwhile, this season has not lacked surprises Madrid dropped points against Eibar and Las Palmas",2
" Barcelona lost the title against Deportivo, Celta and Mlaga",1
" For much of the year, Sevilla looked as if they might challenge for the title Teams did compete with Madrid, the champions, who needed goals in the last 10 minutes in a quarter of their games It wasnt a stroll  and if their B Team kept winning in the final weeks, just look at how good those reserves are",3
" Few doubt that Madrid or Barcelona would win the Premier League too; they dont just dominate domestically, they dominate Europe in this super club eraAnd yet Sevilla fell away, were knocked out of the Champions League by Leicester (whom they had overrun in the last-16 first leg), and it is true that by the end of the domestic season it was a familiar duo competing on the final day, as they had been all season, and there were few real shifts: the same top four, same next three and same bottom three all year It is also true that at the bottom some of the teams could not really compete (although Madid needed a last-minute winner to defeat relegated Sporting Gijn, for example), and there simply is not the money that other leagues have  even if that is improving a littleIt is not Scotland in the sun but there are problems, even if the last couple of years have seen them mitigated a little, not as bad as it was six or seven seasons ago Spains other clubs cannot compete economically and are a long way off Premier League teams in that regard",5
" Another thing: fans are treated horribly in Spain, with kick-off times decided late and dictated entirely by TV (whose coverage is poor) and subject to change, with supporters criminalised and utterly voicelessMadrids and Barcelonas enormity does eclipse everyone else and however brilliant they are  and they are brilliant  that can be discouraging It is impossible to imagine it ending, too But, then, everyone thought that the season that Atltico ended up as champions  a colossal, almost miraculous success that was rightly celebrated but might have hidden a deeper, troubling realityHas the leagues TV deal suffered? The new TV deal, at last managed centrally and negotiated collectively, as enshrined in law, was designed to increase the amount raised and redistribute the money",5
" The plan was to help to reduce the huge inequalities in the league, although Madrid and Barcelona will still take far higher amounts than the rest under a new formula that calculates earnings based on league position, historical position, social base and audience Barcelona and Madrid will expect to make around 140m this year, while teams at the bottom can expect closer to 42m  a huge leap from figures that were close to 15m as recently as last season",2

" Yet though this has been a reasonably lively and absorbing contest at the top of the table the big six are not the whole storyBeneath the top six this season are Everton, seemingly stuck in a permanent no mans land between the achievers and those with relegation concerns, followed by a long gap and then Southampton in eighth place with 46 points",2
" To put that in perspective, 46 points is less than half of what Chelsea accrued and only five points more than Swansea and Crystal Palace managed after seasons haunted by fears of dropping into the Championship",1

" PWThat Bayern Munich have just sealed a fifth successive Bundesliga title  and by a margin of 15 points despite looking under-par for much of the campaign  is undoubtedly a concern Its only the second time that German footballs behemoth has managed such a run The truth is, though, that Bayerns dominance is partly a result of competitiveness, with Borussia Dortmunds successive title wins in 2011 and 2012 almost provoking them to become their best-ever",3
"The other part of the equation is the club adopting a more internationalist strategy Despite the image of Bayerns approach being to take away their competitors best players, and signings such as Robert Lewandowski and Mats Hummels accentuating that feeling, they have been more adventurous in the transfer market in recent years, buoyed by profits from the Champions League and the Allianz Arena, which they now fully ownBayerns dominance does drive international interest to the Bundesliga, and discovering the full picture often keeps people glued",3
" Even if the title race was a non-event this year, there was drama throughout the rest of the table, in terms of the European places and at the bottom On the seasons final day, almost half of the teams still had something to play for The success of Europe-bound Freiburg, and the struggles of giants such as Hamburg, show its not always about money correlating to success",3

" Predictability had hit French football as in the nineties with Marseille and the noughties with LyonThen, Monaco had a freak season where they exceeded all expectations but deserved to win their first league title in 17 years Nice pushed PSG all the way for second place and for the first time the top three teams finished the campaign with 78 points (for Nice) or more (87 for PSG and 95 for Monaco)",3
Marseille have started their American revolution since the takeover of Frank McCourt and will invest up to 200m in the summer to compete for the title,1
" Lyon, thanks to some investment from China, will also be ready to splash some cash, especially if they lose their two best players Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso, which is looking likelyBordeaux are going in the right direction under their bright manager, Jocelyn Gourvennec It will be fascinating to see Lilles progress under Marcelo Bielsa next season, and Srgio Conceio has worked wonders at Nantes since taking over in December",3
"Overall, PSG have been the perfect driving force for Ligue 1, with the other historic clubs trying to catch them up The Parisians are still the richest and most powerful but Monaco showed this season that winning Ligue 1 is not a given any more",2

 I got a good feeling,1
 It was a respectful discussion,1
" I am convinced that we can work very well togetherWatzke added: We had a very, very good feeling about Bosz from the outset, the feeling that something can really grow together here",2
"Reports in Holland claimed Bosz fell out with officials at Ajax in much the same way Tuchel supposedly did at Dortmund It was reported he did not see eye to eye with some of the technical staff already at the club when he arrived last summer, such as former Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp",2
"Asked about the alleged disagreement, Bosz said he would only look forwards before adding: What I can say is that I had a great time at AjaxAjax confirmed on their official website that an agreement had been reached with Dortmund, with the general manager, Edwin van der Sar, describing it as a good deal The former Manchester United goalkeeper said: I have mixed feelings about this move When we brought Peter to Ajax last summer it was not the intention that the partnership would end after one yearWe have had a great season, especially in the Europa League",5

"This week will bring the launch of the Racecourse Associations Showcase & Awards for 2017, designed to highlight the good things achieved by Britains racecourses while encouraging all tracks to learn from their rivals and copy their successes I was on the panel of judges for the first time last year and have signed up to do it againI was struck by the effort made by some courses to impress the judges, with pages and pages of well thought-out submissions, and it certainly seemed in some cases that that reflected the effort made by the track to impress its customers and give them a memorable experience",3
" I learned a lot that would otherwise have sailed below my radar and was especially taken with Pontefracts Art Of Racing raceday and by this charitable effort by staff at Cheltenham racecourseThe awards have been going in their present form since 2011 and now appear to have caught the attention of most tracks and racecourse groups, with the result that the Showcase event was highly commended at the European Association Awards in Brussels early this year",2
" Yes, I realise that having awards for awards nights is a bit circular",1
" No, I didnt get an invite to that one",1
The great hope about Showcase is that it encourages racecourses to keep improving and to keep learning from what others are doing,3
" The entries are not secret but are sent out to all other racecourses, in the hope that best practice standards can be quickly adopted elsewhere I gather staff at one major track have a full day set aside to pore over the entries submitted by others in case theres a good idea that can usefully be pinchedThe England & Wales Cricket Board is apparently among the other sporting bodies whose interest has been piqued by the Showcase system and they are now in regular contact with the Racecourse Association, so you may see a similar approach being adopted in county cricket",3

"Balancing out these two obvious ones is Hitman (410), who appears friendless at 33-1 for a mile handicap at Wetherby Hes only 3lb higher than when winning a Newbury handicap for William Muir last summer and, although that was followed by a couple of lifeless efforts, it doesnt require a great deal of imagination to see him returning to his early form of last year, now that hes had a break, been gelded and joined a new trainer in Rebecca Bastiman, whos had a couple of recent winners",3

" Missing James Pattinson and Stuart Broad (36 wickets at 147 and 281 runs at 468 in 2017), Notts lacked firepower and Derbyshire can count themselves unfortunate not to have registered their first red ball win for two years",3

" I averaged 270 yards off the tee, and I consistently outdrove competitors by 30 to 40 yards",1
" When I played in pro-ams (mostly with men) Id be told I hit it far for a girl To which I would retort, Yeah? Well, you hit it short for a dudeBut the truth is, I did hit the golf ball far for a woman, and particularly for someone my size Recently, PGA and Champions Tour veteran Fred Funk came under fire for comments about the length of modern courses I feel like I should be on the ladies tour right now, he said",5
" I didnt mean that in a derogatory sense, not at all Just because Annika [Sorenstam) outdrove me [in a recent skins game], Im a little bitter The USA Today columnist Christine Brennan called Funks comments sexist",3
" In her article, she called into question Funks views of women, This was a man who sounded quite comfortable delivering a snide remark about womens golf",1
"This sparked an interesting debate about the difference between mens and womens golf, and in particular, about female and male athletes Its tough to dispute that, on average, men are stronger and faster than women",2
 Look no further than stats for driving distances among PGA and LPGA players,1
 The women on tour swing their drivers on average at about 95mph The men? 113 mph,2
Does this make men better golfers? No And recognizing the differences in our bodies should not take away from acknowledging what makes male and female athletes greatLets look at scoring average on each tour: currently LPGA player So Yeon Ryu has averaged 69,3
"21 this season, compared to Jordan Spieths 6941 on the PGA Those figures are far from an anomaly  averages across both tours are comparable And there is a case that women could be considered superior: Dana Finkelstein on the LPGA is ranked No1 in driving accuracy, hitting 882% of fairways this season",5
" Her counterpart on the PGA, Steve Stricker, hits 72",1
"85% In addition, Lexi Thompson leads the LPGA with an average of 798% of greens in regulation this season, compared to Dustin Johnson, who is No1 on the PGA tour with 726% Looking at these stats alone, women are more accurate than men",5
" What they lack in power, they make up for in finesseThe former US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy, said as much last year I especially like to see [women] hit shots with hybrids",3
 Its a joke how talented they are with those clubs,1
" Im actually prepared to believe that Lydia Ko is better than the vast majority of male pros from, say, 200 yards out She is ridiculously good",2
" In fact, Id go as far as to say that the top women players consistently hit closer to where they are aiming than do the top guys, Ogilvy wrote in an article for Golf AustraliaSo while Brennan found offense with Funks comments, I only saw him pointing out something that most of us know: men in professional golf hit the ball further",2
" Its not sexist, but a fact Acknowledging what makes men and women distinct  for example, male players huge drives or female players unerring accuracy  should only highlight the very things that make professional athletes so extraordinary",2
"What we should take offense to is when people think that women are not elite athletes simply because their bodies do not perform in the same way as those of their male counterparts And what most critics of womens sports should take into account is that any weekend warrior, male or female, could never get close to matching the performance of a professional athlete of any genderAs a sportswriter, I hate differentiating between male and female athletes",3
" I feared that by writing this article I would only be playing into the internalized sexism Ive been raised to believe about women in sports growing up: that women arent as good of athletes as men But my case is that female athletes are just as exceptional as their male counterparts, but are skilled in ways that men are not",2
 Accepting this and embracing this provides a foundation for women to continue to flourish in their sportsBy the time the Lions return to Eden Park for the first Test against New Zealand on 24 June they will either be roaring or whimpering The next five games  all inside 14 days  really will be a test of manhood and there is not a single local who anticipates the touring team returning unbeaten from their bruising provincial mini-tour,3
"If a talented, but occasionally flaky Blues side are not defeated in the opening midweek fixture on Wednesday, things will only get tougher",1
" The Crusaders are currently heading the Super Rugby standings, the Highlanders are tucked in behind, a pumped-up Maori XV can make the All Blacks appear demure and the Chiefs play the most eye-catching rugby on Earth Pick the easy option out of that lotThe Lions are also battling on two wearily familiar fronts: gelling unfamiliar players and combinations over an impossibly short period in front of rugbys least-forgiving audience",3
 Most New Zealanders are charming to visitors but this is not immediately obvious in the rugby sections of the newspapers,1
" As Warren Gatland is already being reminded, beating the world champions in their backyard requires rare resilience on and off the fieldEven with the tour still in its infancy, the news wires are awash with barbs Gatland has been derided as the wrong man for the Lions job, with his team dismissed as less enthusiastic than a chicken heading towards KFC and incapable of finding their own hotel, let alone the formula for a victorious series",3
" Knockabout insults, maybe, but an instinctive lack of respect for northern hemisphere rugby oozes from many media orifices",1
The only way to chip away at such ingrained perceptions is on the pitch,1
" And even if the Lions do somehow win all their next five games, howls of criticism of their style, the refereeing or some other perceived slight will inevitably follow If a highly rated New Zealand team lose, particularly at home, the notion of the other side having outplayed them comes well down the post-match listThis may well have underpinned Gatlands irritation this week when the unflattering phrase Warrenball was predictably wheeled out in a press conference, albeit by a British reporter",3
" This is a man who has coached winning teams all over the world  with Wasps, Waikato and Wales, among others  yet is still widely portrayed as a coach who merely picks a crash-ball centre and invites 14 other blokes to pile in behind him I dont know what Warrenball means, protested his assistant, Rob Howley, who has coached alongside Gatland for much of the past decade",2
" Have we played that over the last few years? Im not too sureRugbys eternal truth is that every professional coach adopts the approach he believes will win him the most games with the players available to him at the time Which is why the Lions management are now talking repeatedly of the need to stretch opposition defences, as opposed to simply seeking contact or relying on forward power",3
 Attacking scrums and lineouts largely depend on the opposition dropping the ball or kicking it out of play,1
" If nimble, quick-thinking Kiwi sides do neither, where does that leave the Lions hopes of set-piece dominance? Teams are smart, they know how to counteract physicality alone, confirmed the ever-thoughtful Leicester prop Dan Cole You cant just have one way of playing against those guysHence Howleys recurring use of the phrase rugby chaos to describe the high-intensity training sessions the squad are taking to sharpen their reaction skills for what lies ahead",3

" Thats the message we keep giving them You have to get numbers around the ball sometimes but, ultimately, its about playing with some talent and playing some intelligent rugbyYet in almost the same breath Howley was conceding it would be unwise of the Lions to reveal their full hand until the Test series starts: We need to hold back on certain elements and make sure we put our players under the same fatigue and chaos in training that the All Blacks will doThe odd provincial defeat would not, he suggested, be the end of the world: If we lose one or two games but get a good picture of how the All Blacks will play, well be a better side for those experiencesPerhaps, even more importantly, the Lions need to display a greater lust for life than in their opening game in Whangarei",5
" Training has certainly been getting feisty  according to Howley it has become pretty heated this week  and even an experienced Test Lion such as Johnny Sexton will need to shape up to feature against the All Blacks I suppose the word is inconsistent, said Howley I spoke to Johnny and he admitted itIt was tough for him but hes a world-class 10 and hell bounce back Hes a very intelligent rugby player",5

 He also worked as a pornographic actorMost of the British Cycling directors accused of covering up a report into claims of bullying within the GB team will be replaced in reforms set to be voted on at an extraordinary general meeting on 22 July,2
The governing body has been under the spotlight since the spring of 2016 when the former GB track sprinter Jess Varnish made allegations about the former technical director Shane Sutton and claimed there was a culture of fear in the organisation,1
 The independent panel investigating the affair is expected to produce its final report next week,1
"On top of the Varnish allegations the organisation has also been faced with the UK Anti-Doping investigation into claims of wrongdoing in the sport, and the reforms mean that at least two thirds of the directors who have been dealing with both issues will have departed",1
"The independent panels preliminary report, which was leaked in March, was scathing about how an internal investigation led by the British Cycling board member Alex Russell had been handled The report, sent to the boards of British Cycling and UK Sport in December, accused Russells fellow directors of sanitising and even reserving her findings, which resulted in Sutton being found guilty of one relatively minor offence out of the nine with which he had been chargedA Freedom of Information Act request by Press Association Sport then revealed that UK Sport also had serious concerns about the boards treatment of Varnishs complaint",3
"Sutton, who has always maintained his innocence, quit in April 2016, with the former chief executive Ian Drake leaving his post in January Since then British Cycling has appointed a new chairman in Jonathan Browning, brought in Julie Harrington from the Football Association as chief executive, hired a new human resources executive and revamped its code of conduct",2
"But even more radical surgery is required if British Cycling is to comply with the sports minister Tracey Crouchs new governance code From November, any organisation seeking funding from Sport England or UK Sport must comply with the code, which is intended to raise leadership standards across sportSport England has allocated 17m to British Cycling and UK Sport has said it will provide 26m for the GB Olympic and Paralympic teams preparations for Tokyo 2020, but both payments depend on code compliance",3
"With any major reform needing a vote from the 130,000 membership and the next annual general meeting not scheduled until November, British Cycling was forced to call the EGM The new senior team have been travelling the country to sell the proposed reforms to its members",2
"The key changes are a reduction in the number of elected regional directors from six to four, permanent seats for elected representatives from Scotland and Wales, an increase in the number of openly recruited independents from three to four and the appointment of an independent chair",1
" Harrington will also be added to bring the board up to 12 membersIt means the president, Bob Howden, who gave up his role of chairman in February, will lose his position on the board and Browning will have to reapply if he wants to continue as independent chairman, as he must go through an open recruitment process It is understood the former motor industry executive is considering his options and will decide on what he wants to do after the EGM",3
"But the other major change is the introduction of a limit for directors of three three-year terms This means six of the eight elected members on the current board must stand down, with only the Eastern regions Dr George Gilbert and the Welsh representative, Nick Smith, being eligible to continue",2
" Current independents, Russell and Marion Lauder, can also continue and are expected to do soGreat Britains Land Rover BAR were dealt a severe blow in their attempt to reach the Americas Cup after a failure in their wing handed Team New Zealand the initiative in BermudaSir Ben Ainslies syndicate suffered damage to the wing in the opening race as they rounded the leeward gate, forcing them to retire from the opening race of the challenger semi-finals",3

"June is the cruellest month  or at least, it is for Australians at this rather damp ICC Champions Trophy On a drizzly, doom-laden day at The Oval Australias attempt to chase down a modest Bangladesh total was interrupted by heavy evening rain four overs short of a completed game",2
" Maddeningly for Steve Smith, who blocked the final ball of the day before trudging off in exasperation, the Australians were 44 runs ahead at that stage on DLS calculations and strolling it before the skies closed in",1
"Cue three hours of hoofing bits of kit around the Oval dressing room, desperate to get back out for 20 minutes to prevent a wash-out In the event a second no result after New Zealand at Edgbaston leaves Australia perilously placed",2
" Bangladesh, who were outplayed here, could now sneak into the semi-finals by beating New Zealand should results fall their way If England win in Cardiff on Tuesday, Eoin Morgans men will be through with a free shot at knocking Australia out in BirminghamAs a lone, sodden cheerleading beefeater scampered through the evening puddles and a scattering of Bangladeshis cheered wildly at the return of the billowing covers, there were elements of farce to the proceedings Had this game not been a day-nighter all would have been done and dusted by the time rain made it up the M4 On the other hand Australia probably would have lost to New Zealand in Birmingham, so their points tally is more or less par",5
" But they were deprived here of a chance to boost their run rate by putting a tottering Bangladesh away, which could yet prove key",1
"And so the tournament goes to Cardiff for a potentially fun, adrenaline-laced encounter between England and New Zealand that is again threatened with the prospect of heavy rain",1
" That game will mark a third of the way through a tournament that has fizzled and sputtered gamely without quite catching fire Three of five matches staged have been affected by the weather, with a daunting forecast for the week ahead",2
"For all the discomfort at the intrusion into the International Cricket Councils carefully planned extravaganza, this is not an uncommon experience in the first half of June Damp early summers and bone-dry Septembers have become such a feature in recent years that there was, briefly, a move among schools to shift cricket a term back either side of the summer holidays",2
" Four years ago in the last Champions Trophy seven of 15 matches played were affected by rain at exactly the same stage of the summerThere is, of course, nothing to be done about this, although a useful tweak might be to introduce a little flexibility for drinks breaks and intervals Four overs short of a full game in a match interrupted by people coming on with water bottles and the full whack for lunch: at times crickets enjoyably rigid routines can look unintentionally comic",3
"At The Oval there was at least a reversal of the batting dominance to date, a function of tight, assertive Australian pace bowling mixed with a supine performance from Bangladeshs lower order In keeping with a lop-sided tournament this was only ever going one way from the moment Bangladesh were bullied batting first by Australias pace attack, the top order falling away steadily and the tail visibly quaking at the sight of Mitchell Starc bounding in to bowl his death-over toenail-crushers",2
"Starc hoovered up four wickets in nine balls at the end of his spell, three of his victims bowled while leaping away towards square-leg to reveal all three stumps, like a waiter whisking the cover from a particularly appetising evening meal Starc can be a daunting prospect",2
" But this was pretty abjectAs it had been for the tournament opener The Oval was alive with a powerful Bangladeshi support on Monday afternoon Mashrafe Mortaza won the toss and chose to bat, signal for boisterous cheers at every show of batting aggression on a muggy morning during which Australias pace attack confirmed its standing as the most powerful in this tournament, zinging the ball past both edge and grille regularly on a fairly docile pitchJosh Hazelwood showed the zip and guile Englands openers will have to contend with this winter Pat Cummins bowled with speed and fire, touching 91mph",5

" Then came the rain and an unsatisfying slow death, the floodlights gleaming eerily off the slick covered square, stands long empty There is still plenty of time for this tournament to catch fire even if, right now, it all looks a little soggyThe prospect of Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup has been plunged into the most serious doubt after the countrys neighbours broke off diplomatic relations and blockaded its borders",3
" In a culmination of hostilities simmering for years and accusations that Qatar is a major funder of terrorist organisations, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have closed the only land route into the tiny peninsula and refused to allow use of their sea ports or airspaceThe multibillion-dollar preparations to host the 2022 tournament, which involve building nine stadiums and huge infrastructure, is put into perspective by local reports that Qataris are so worried about the blockade that they are stocking up on food The border with Saudi Arabia is the only road route into the country; Qatar relies on sea ports for its materials and the blockade of airspace is a huge logistical handicap to the country and its flagship airline, Qatar Airways",3
"The supreme committee responsible for building the 2022 World Cup facilities did not issue a public statement but a source acknowledged that the seriousness of the crisis is greater than any of the formidable challenges Qatar has faced since winning the vote in 2010 from Fifas now discredited executive committee The tournament has been switched to the winter to avoid searing summer temperatures, a series of investigations has been held into strongly denied corruption allegations and there has been worldwide criticism of the countrys treatment of its migrant construction workersSaudi Arabia said in a statement that it had broken off physical and diplomatic contact due to Qatars embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region",3
" Resentment has been growing for years, principally over Qatars support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, an organisation which the UAE vehemently opposes, but Saudi Arabia also accused Qatar of supporting al-Qaida and Islamic State, extremist groups which have carried out atrocities in the Middle East and Europe",1
Qatar has always denied the accusations that it funds terrorist groups and its foreign ministry said in a statement responding to the blockade: The state of Qatar has been subjected to a campaign of lies that have reached the point of complete fabrication,1
" It reveals a hidden plan to undermine the state of QatarQatars ruling family and emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, have always intended that hosting an event as globally captivating as the World Cup will dramatically boost the tiny but wealthy countrys profile, and that such soft power could help be a bulwark against interference from its neighbours Now, although there are five years to go, the entire project is facing major doubt",3
"The English Football Association did not comment on the crisis but the German FA (DFB) president, Reinhard Grindel, said he would discuss it with the German government and Uefa Grindel promised to look for a political solution but said: The football community worldwide should agree that  major tournaments should not be played in countries that actively support terrorFifa, now sponsored by Qatar Airways, declined to comment except to say: Fifa is in regular contact with the Qatar 2022 local organising committee and the supreme committee for delivery & legacy handling matters relating to the 2022 Fifa World CupHampshire lead the County Championship by 14 points and showed their clinical quality by taking Warwickshires last eight wickets for 65 to win by an innings and 94 runs The contrast with the side whose relegation led to their reprieve last season is stark and unavoidable: Durham are bottom of Division Two on minus 21 points after their fourth defeat in five",5
"When, early on, Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, having shared 93 for the third wicket, fell in consecutive overs, Warwickshire were left at the mercy of the weather The rain came but not early enough or for long enough to save them  they were eight down and off the field for only minutesKyle Abbott, a signing exceeding even the loftiest expectations, finished with four for 32, Mason Crane claimed two wickets, including Trotts, while Sean Ervine, the double-centurion and architect of the victory in his record-breaking stand of 367 with Jimmy Adams, took the final two with his new-fangled off-spinThat result meant Warwickshire slipped below Somerset, who played out a typically dour Lords draw with Middlesex, to the foot of Division OneFor Somerset, after Lewis Gregory dismissed Tom Helm and Tim Murtagh to bowl Middlesex out for 358, a first-innings deficit of 85, there was a welcome return to form for their young captain, Tom Abell",5
" He looked in fine touch for his first half-century of the season and was unbeaten on 71 (although the last few did come off the bowling of John Simpson and Nick Gubbins, so might need expunging from the record books) when hands were finally shaken",1
"Middlesex, who took 10 points to Somersets 11, won the title having drawn their first six matches in 2016 and their first four games this time have been stalemates, too",1
" Scheduling quirks mean they have played two fewer games than Hampshire but already they are 37 points adrift and 14, rather than 16, Championship games means making up lost ground will be tough They await news on the fitness of Adam Voges, who the captain, James Franklin, expects to be missing for some weeks Swelling meant a scan on his groin injury, which saw him retire hurt on Sunday, had to be delayed until TuesdayThe theory that Division Two has already splintered into two halves suffered a blow as Worcestershire lost their unbeaten record in a thrashing (by an innings and seven runs) at Sussex, and only rain saved Nottinghamshire from defeat against Derbyshire",3
" The rain arrived at Trent Bridge with the visitors  who have not won a Championship match since July 2015  five down, and only 26 from victoryNorthamptonshire pulled off a remarkable two-wicket win with a ball to spare at Durham",2
" Paul Coughlin, leading the attack in the absence of six seamers either injured or on international duty, bowled unchanged for 20 overs in Northants chase of 205",1
" Defending three off the final over, he took two wickets to complete his maiden 10-wicket haul but the ninth-wicket pair scrambled home for a bye to seal the win Alex Wakely had earlier made 84 to lead an impressive chaseIt does not get easier for Durham Their next assignment is on Thursday at second-placed Kent, who welcome the Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah for a four-game stint, including visits to their promotion rivals Nottinghamshire and WorcestershireBy August 2008 the word had already got out among Premier League scouts that a 22-year-old midfielder from the Ivory Coast, recently signed up by FCTwente after an eyecatching season on loan at RodaJC, had something about him",5
 It would be instructive to see how he fared at a higher level and a Champions League qualifier for Steve McClarens side against Arsenal provided an early chance to find out just how quickly Cheick Tiot was learning,1
" The sight of him sticking to Robin van Persie like glue during Twentes home leg, subduing the striker into irrelevance with an insistent performance that at times cared little for the boundaries of the law, lingered in more than a few minds and memories would be jolted firmly enough in due courseTiot eventually joined Newcastle, who had been attracted by his tenacity and undeterred by an inconsistency in possession that led some suitors to waver, in 2010 and would find himself working for McClaren again five years later",2
" Both had seen better days than a 2015-16 season that reflected appallingly on the Tyneside club but, while McClaren ended up being sacked and scarcely mourned, Tiot was one of the few who rode out a turbulent interlude with his standing among supporters relativelyunimpaired",1
"Given the revolving door at StJames Park over the past decade, that says plenty",1
" But there had always been good reason to enjoy the presence of Tiot, a wholehearted and proactive performer who played at the kind of intensity fans appreciate even when things are not going well I dont like to make a lot of noise, he said a few months after his arrival but he had non-verbal ways of making his point",2
" It helped that, in only his 19th appearance for the club  having already picked up eight yellow cards and one red  he produced the kind of flourish that, in the blink of an eye, moulds a cult hero The left-footed 25-yard volley that pegged Arsenal, opponents he always warmed towards, back to an improbable 4-4 draw was perfect in both execution and timing The moment was etched instantly in Premier League folklore, never mind that of his club; a bolt from the blue that had never seemed likely and would rarely come close to happening again",3
It would be his only goal for Newcastle; the tally of bookings would reach 14 by the end of his first season and discipline was never something he fully mastered,1
" But that was how Tiot operated; there would never be any compromising when a ball was there to be won You take that side of the game out of Cheick and you dont get the same player, his team-mate James Perch said after a costly red card against Sunderland in October 2012 A Tyne-Wear derby is never an occasion for mistakes, but if anyone could be forgiven such an error it was Tiote",3
" The idea of leaving anything on the pitch was anathemaTiots was not simply a tale of unchannelled aggression Between 2011 and 2013 he and Yohan Cabaye formed one of the leagues best midfield partnerships  an efficient blend of vision, vigour and tactical intelligence whose apex came in a 3-0 win against Manchester United in January 2012",3
" This was Tiots peak but, while Cabaye would move on, he stayed at Newcastle despite intermittent talk of interest from Champions League clubs  in particular Arsenal, a move he would certainly have welcomed As Newcastles fortunes ebbed, his own form and fortune did too, injuries dogging his final two seasons and ensuring that, by the time he moved to Beijing Enterprises in February, disappointment about his departure was more sentimental than directed towards its impact on a revitalised teams promotion campaignJoining a club at the highest level may have eluded him but Tiot appeared twice in Ivory Coasts Africa Cup of Nations-winning campaign of 2015",3
" That success meant everything; little had come easy during his early days in football, starting out at the semiprofessional club FC Bibo in his home city of Yamoussoukro and finessing his qualities without the aid of proper boots until the age of 15",1
"Thats what made me who I am today, he said of an upbringing that guaranteed nothing Tiot, though, would turn into a player who guaranteed every ounce of perspiration he had as soon as he stepped on to a pitch",2
" The frayed edges were there, but for a time he was one of the best; it is a tragedy that football, and the world he inhabited beyond it, should be mourning him nowEoin Morgan was not the first great Irishman to suggest that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness but he may be in agreement with Oscar Wilde",2
"For Morgan at least acknowledges that his England side, transformed since the calamitous World Cup of 2015, has now acquired many of the qualities of the Kiwi side that humbled them in Wellington, New Zealand, in February 2015 On that dismal day for English cricket Morgans team were beaten by eight wickets with 374 overs to spare",3
 The New Zealanders required 124 runs for victory and were none too circumspect in their response Brendon McCullum hit 77 from 25 ballsMorgan was reminded of that contest for want of a better word while the rain was falling at Cardiff,3
" It was sort of men against boys, he said before adding to noones surprise, but I think its completely different now, two years down the line Weve got a completely new team pretty much [in fact five of those who endured that match at Wellington could play in Cardiff on Tuesday] And hopefully we are moving forward",3
"No doubt England have progressed and their template was very much in the image of New Zealands 2015 World Cup campaign McCullum and Morgan are good friends and Englands captain, being an intelligent man, is bound to have picked the brains of the former Kiwi captain",2
Morgan was not too keen to emphasise how England have learnt from New Zealand To adopt the pupil/teacher pose just before a vital clash between the two countries might not be appropriate But he acknowledged the impact of that 2015 World Cup,3
"If you look at the top four teams that got to the semi-final stage in the World Cup, they all seemed to score regular totals over 350 So I think theyve contributed to the change as a wholeThe way New Zealand went about playing their cricket was probably closer to the way we go about it now We have very similar characteristics and values as a side and its probably the easiest relate to them out of those four teams that made the later stages I think the dominant factor with New Zealand was that they had that crucial confidence within the group at the time, whereas we didnt have it",5
Morgan can claim with justification that there is that confidence within his squad now This helps to explain a reluctance to tinker with his team  or at least his batsmen,2
 Faith in Jason Roy remains and he will open the batting,1
That yearning for consistency also enhanced the chances of Steven Finn getting the call-up once Chris Woakes side strain had been diagnosed,1
"Morgan said Finn was the straightforward choice, backing up consistency of selection and the trust they have shown in their players recently Weve tried to go like for like [when choosing replacements] as often as we canBut when we cant we go for a guy we can throw the ball to at any stage in order to try to make an impact on the game",3
 And Finny is one of those guys,1
 Id have no hesitation in playing him tomorrow if we felt it was the right thing to do,1
"It all depends on the wicket, Morgan said, before remembering to mention the quality of pace bowling already in hissquadHowever, he did not mention Finns chilling experience in that Wellington match more than two years ago Sometimes bowling figures lie but, however one stares at 2-0-49-0, they do not look good",3
" The one-word explanation is McCullum At least on Tuesday the Kiwis World Cup captain will be in some commentary box, where he can cause little damage",2
"The make-up of the bowling attack will occupy Morgans mind on Tuesday morning Mark Wood, Liam Plunkett, Ben Stokes  recovering fast from his knee problems  and Moeen Ali are bound to play Then England must pick two from Adil Rashid, Jake Ball, David Willey and Finn",3
"A sweaty pitch favours retaining two pace bowlers; so, too, do the short, straight boundaries in Cardiff However, there isalso the notion that the Kiwis might not play Rashid as well as some of the Asian nations And the legspinner, though left out against Bangladesh, has been a trusted performer in ODIsNew Zealand were probably robbed of victory when the rain fell at Edgbaston in their match against Australia They retain the no-holds barred approach that McCullum insisted on two years ago, have three hostile pacemen in Tim Southee, Adam Milne and Trent Boult and some dangerous strikers of the ball as well as Kane Williamson, the Kiwi Joe Root  or is it the other way round?Martin Guptill hits a long ball at the top of the order for such a mild-mannered man and a former opening batsman for Derbyshire",5
 Like Morgan he did not wish to exaggerate the similarities between the two sides but he recognised that England have a similar brand of batting to the way weve gone about our business over the last few years,1
He said: So its probably going to be a pretty exciting game tomorrow and I think the fans are looking forward to itThere is indeed much to savour if the puddles disappear An opening pair of Guptill and Luke Ronchi does not let many deliveries pass harmlessly by; or as our great Irishman (still not Morgan) once admitted they can resist everything except temptation,3
"Morgan reports Stokes to be pain-free and nearly thereEngland are bubbling with an optimism that defied the thick grey clouds and long white tarpaulins visible on arrival in Cardiff on Monday Eoin Morgan, the captain, may have lost the services of Chris Woakes with a strained side but he is bullish about the advance of Ben Stokes, his totemic all-rounder with the dodgy left knee for a match against New Zealand where a win would secure a passage into the semi-finalsI think hes very close to full fitness",3
" He came through the other day [when England played Bangladesh at The Oval], bowling more overs [seven] than we intended But I think were nearly there",2
" Hes had no pain in five days now So, if that continues, theres a chance he may bowl 10 oversSome of Englands players, including Stokes, were staying very close to the scene of the latest atrocity in London but Morgan is confident his men can deal with the climate of uncertainty and the nature of the security measures in place",3
Within our team there are no concerns,1
 I think we sort of proved that we can cope in Leeds after what happened in Manchester [England played South Africa at Headingley immediately after the terrorist attack at the Manchester Arena],1
" Obviously the guys are chatting about it constantly because its not very far from where we stayed and a lot of us live nearby So were always talking about it and making sure that everybody feels they can talk about it and not hide away from itThe make-up of Englands team is undecided, mostly because of the torrential rain that fell on Cardiff on Monday Morgan has glimpsed the surface It looked like a reasonably good pitch yesterday [Sunday] but an extra 24 hours under the hot, sweaty cover might change things in the morning",5
" Theres normally a lot of grass here, not necessarily green grass, but with quite a thatchy feel to the wicket Ill think about it for another 24 hours",2
"Morgan will be thinking about his best bowling attack rather than his batsmen He implied that Jason Roy, his out-of-form opener, will stay in the side for at least one more game Jason has obviously lacked runs but certainly everybody in the team, the squad and the backroom staff feel that a score is around the corner",3
 So hopefully it is tomorrow And hopefully Roy is of the same mind as everyone else,2
"The choice of bowlers is dictated by various factors: there are two short straight boundaries to consider but perhaps more significant is the sweatiness of the pitch, which will be minutely examined this morning",1
 The think-tanks observations will decide whether England opt for two spinners by recalling Adil Rashid  surprisingly omitted from the first game against Bangladesh having played in 41 of Englands previous 44 ODIs,1
"Rashid might have been deflated by that decision but Morgan said: Adil is quite relaxed about things Everybody wants to play, all 15 Its not easy leaving guys out sometimes",3
 We select the man we think is the best chance of winning that particular game The prize for winning this game for England is unusually significant Victory for Morgans side would guarantee them a semi-final berthWarren Gatland is demanding more physicality and intensity from his British and Irish Lions players but has dismissed claims he is a one-dimensional coach whose sides only play one way Instead he has urged his reshuffled team to go out and be positive against the Blues on Wednesday under the captaincy of Scarlets hooker Ken Owens,5
The Lions underwhelming display in their opening tour fixture in Whangarei has generated some unflattering local media coverage and Gatland is already sick and tired of the phrase Warrenball being applied to his methods,1
" He insists he merely encourages sides to play to their strengths and blames the former England attack coach Brian Smith for inventing the phraseLook, a few years ago Brian Smith coined a phrase Warrenball, and I dont know whether that was because he was jealous of how much success we had We had a group of players who came through Wales at the time who ended up being pretty big physical players",3
" The modern game of rugby is about getting across the gainline, trying to get front-foot ball and playing to space if that is possibleI think in a way it is an opportunity for people who want to be critical We experienced that four years ago (in the 2013 series in Australia) when people decided to be critical and a lot of people got caught with their pants down afterwards, didnt they?Far from relying on a simple crash ball approach on this tour, Gatland believes the Lions will have to vary their game if they want to win a series against the All Blacks for the first time since 1971",3
"To match the All Blacks you have got to display a bit of X-factor If that X-factor means an offload or doing something that is a little bit outside the box, the players are being encouraged to do that because that is what we are going to need to beat them We dont want to be prescribed and we dont want to play by numbers",3
"Hopefully, we can show that on Wednesday and the players can perform what they are being encouraged by the coaches to do The message to the players is that we want to play positive rugby, we want to be able to move the ball and shift it and create chances",2
" We know we didnt play so well on Saturday and it gives us an opportunity to go out and against the Blues and be positiveGatland was also interested to hear from his son Bryn that Saturdays game against the Provincial Barbarians was more physical than a typical Super Rugby encounter No one is suggestng the Blues, with eight current or former All Blacks in their ranks, will be a soft touch but the Lions management do want their forwards to make more of an impact at Eden Park",3
" Weve got to be able to ramp that physicality up in the games leading up to the first Test, confirmed Gatland These games will help us get to grips with the intensity of what New Zealand rugby brings",2
"The Lions have opted for a completely fresh XV against the Blues, with Owens leading a team containing 11 new Lions, including the Irish centre pairing of Robbie Henshaw and Jared Payne and English wingers Elliot Daly and Jack NowellSix of the eight forwards will be making their Lions bows, including James Haskell at 6 and Maro Itoje in the second-row Pencilled in at inside centre for the Blues is Sonny Bill Williams, who is expected to play despite a slight knee problem, while the experienced Charlie Faumuina starts in the front row",3
" Back-row forward Jerome Kaino (knee) and Englands current Argentina tourist, Piers Francis, are missing but a clutch of younger players will be hoping to use the occasion to further their reputationsWith over 40,000 tickets already sold, a near sell-out is anticipated, although head coach Tana Umaga is conscious of his teams recent heavy schedule: Theres no doubt it will be a challenging turnaround for us In the last 30 days we have played four Super games in New Zealand, South Africa and Samoa and now the British and Irish Lions",3
" But it is a special occasion and I hope the guys do themselves, their families and their club proudUmagas last meeting with the Lions was in 2005 when he was involved in the fateful incident in the first Test in Christchurch that brought a premature end to Brian ODriscolls tour Memories of that episode have inevitably been rekindled this week but Umaga believes it is time to move on",3
" That was 12 years ago, he said",1
" If people cant put it behind them then I suppose they never willItoje, meanwhile, has spoken of his personal shock following the terror attack in his native London Its tough, admitted the Saracens lock These things are happening a bit too often for anyones liking Its a real dark and crass situation which we all wish doesnt happen again",5
 My heart and condolences go out to all those involved,1

" Unfortunately, Ashoka has been taken out this morning and each-way punters will now need to find one of the first two home That promises to be a much more difficult task in a race where five of the runners are currently trading between 5-1 and 6-1, and there is a fair case to be made for the 14-1 outsider, Magie Du Ma",2

"40Ice Age810Open Wide840Arsenio Lupin(all times pm, BST)On Sunday, Jrgen Klopp gave a wildly optimistic interview to Liverpools own website",3
" We can really improve, thats what Im really looking forward to, he trilled Im really optimistic for our future, not because Im crazy but only because I know what we have, I know what we will get, I know what we can get",2
" Journalists immediately got to work discovering what they can get, and the answer they came up with was: Lyons wildly coveted 60m-rated striker Alexandre Lacazette, whose future is once again up in the air after the team he was set to sign for, Atltico Madrid, were hit with a transfer ban",1
" Klopp has set his sights on signing a big-name striker this summer and Lacazette certainly fits the bill, screech the Express, while less encouragingly the Lyon chairman, Jean-Michel Aulas, said the decision to let Alexandre go is now under scrutiny and that I would prefer that he staysLiverpool arent going to stop there, and are unwilling to meekly yield to Manchester Citys massive chequebook in the race for Southamptons Virgil van Dijk: the Liverpool Echo reports that they are prepared to match any offer made by City or Chelsea  with bidding set to open at 50m  and that, more encouragingly still, they believe money will not be the decisive factor and have been encouraged by the feedback received from Van Dijks representatives",2
"Another rumour concerning Klopps side is all over the back pages of several papers this morning, who reflect widespread excitement about the impending conclusion to their pursuit of Romas Mohamed Salah, with all parties concerned on the verge of agreeing a 35m deal to take the Egyptian winger back to England Another much-mooted move that could be imminently completed is that of Tottenhams Kyle Walker to Manchester City, with the Star revealing that Etihad chiefs are confident of completing the move once Englands games with Scotland and France have taken place",2
"If only everything were so straightforward For example, Eden Hazards weekend pronouncements over his future have been carried by the Sun under the banner Staying: Hazards not sub-standard while in the Star the headline of choice is: Hazard hints he may join Gareth and the Express goes for Im open to Real deal says Hazard So, in short, he is either staying or goingElsewhere there is plenty of news about transfers that are not going to happen Celtic, for example, will not entertain any offers for Moussa Dembl, at least unless they are eliminated from the Champions League in Augusts qualifying round, whereupon hes yours for 30m",5
" Also, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is happy at Arsenal, Gareth Bale is even happier in Madrid, and Anthony Martials agent says there is no reason for him to leave Manchester unless Ed Woodward tells me they want him to leave which, just to clarify, he hasntWhat would have come of Swansea last season if they didnt have the one-man goal-and-assist-machine Gylfi Sigurdsson among their otherwise rank ranks? It is a question with only the miserable of answers, but thankfully for the Swans it is only speculation",2
" Less happily next season they could find out for sure, with Leicester first to dip their toes in the Icelandic waters by tabling an official enquiry Sigurdsson, adds the Mail, is valued at 30m and also wanted by Everton as Ronald Koeman looks to add more goals from his midfield Swansea will strengthen this summer, though, and have held talks with PSV Eindhoven over their 12m-rated Chilean defender Santiago Arias  also being monitored by Everton, West Ham and Tottenham  though according to the Star they may end up with Barnsleys Andy Yiadom insteadEvertons pursuit of more goals from midfield might also be achieved by snaffling Leicesters own Riyad Mahrez, though the player would prefer Arsenal or Chelsea to sign him please, while Koeman  linked over the weekend with a move to replace the outgoing Romelu Lukaku with Jamie Vardy  has also identified a goalkeeper who would come cheaper than Sunderlands Jordan Pickford, in the shape of Gents Lovre KalinicThe Cavaliers put up a strong fight but still fell 132-113 in Game 2 of the NBA finals to the Golden State Warriors, a superteam who are starting to look  and this postseason literally are  unbeatable",5
"The Cavaliers played significantly better than they did in the first game of the series, but a triple-double from LeBron James, 20 forced turnovers and 15 steals still werent enough to topple the best team in decades",1
" It was Golden States 14th consecutive win in the playoffs, besting the longest postseason win streak in league history",1
"After the game, James summarized how it must feel to face the Warriors in this sort of form Asked what he needed after the game, he replied simply: some food ",3
" and some wineLeading the Warriors effort  again  was Kevin Durant, with 33 points",3
 He did it all,1
" He made incredible plays off his own rebounds He swatted away the ball from several defenders, including James He even made a shot while falling to the ground",3
"We cant give up 23 points off our turnovers Especially a championship team like that, theyre going to thrive off it, Durant said We could play hard every possession, but can we play smart?Team-mate Steph Curry danced circles around his defenders with some nasty crossovers, and ignited the offense with 32 points in his triple-double performance",3
" The crowd shot to its feet whenever Klay Thompson scored The Splash Brother has been struggling in the postseason but slipped out of his slump, adding 22 points and 7 rebounds JaVale McGee continued to be impactful, with a huge block and a massive dunk over Kevin Love after he came off the bench Andre Iguodala also had a colossal block on Channing Frye that brought the crowd to its feetKD x JaVale on #NBAonABC!#NBAFinals pic",5
"twittercom/PAiXU5MoGyBased on the first two games, the next NBA champion appears a done deal Now it could just be a question of who will be finals MVP",3
"But it should be remembered that the Cavaliers were 2-0 down at this stage last year, and they didnt take Sundays loss lying down",1
" Indeed, they were just three points down going into halftimeIts been a great run, but none of that matters unless we can finish the job, said the Warriors head coach, Steve Kerr Heading to Cleveland were gonna have to be a lot smarter If we play that game in Cleveland, were not winningJames carried the team on offense and defense, scoring 29 points and stealing the ball several times",5
" He even joined Magic Johnson and Jerry West as the only players to reach 300 career assists in the finals Kevin Love caught fire early, assisting James with 27 points and 7 rebounds",2
" Kyrie Irving managed 19 points after being guarded heavily by ThompsonThe Warriors had a standout performance, but the loudest cheers at Oracle Arena went to Kerr He returned to the bench to coach the Warriors after missing most of the postseason due to health issues Each time the camera turned to him the crowd went wild, and they gave Kerr a standing ovation when the lineup was announcedAnother standing ovation for Steve Kerr",5
" Everyone's very glad to see him back and healthy #NBAFinals2017 pictwittercom/zQeFBmO9PoWith the series heading to Cleveland for two games, the Cavs must hope they can improve again and level the series on home turf",3
" But based on the evidence so far, the Warriors may be simply too good to beatLiverpool are close to agreeing a 35m deal for Romas Mohamed Salah, with reports suggesting the Egypt winger could finalise a move to Anfield this weekTalks have been continuing between the parties for some time and Roma rejected an initial 28m bid from Liverpool a few days ago",3
" However, Jrgen Klopp is determined to acquire Salah and, with the player also believed to be keen on the switch, it appears an agreement is close to being reached following an increased bid from the Merseysiders",1
"Should the transfer happen it would be a case of second time lucky for Liverpool, who wanted Salah in 2014 only to see him move to Chelsea instead from the Swiss club Basel He struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge, however, and in 2015 moved to Italy, joining Fiorentina on loan before moving to Roma, also on loan, soon after",2
"That became a long-term move last August and Salah has subsequently flourished for the Giallorossi In the 2016-17 Serie A season the 24-year-old scored 15 goals and assisted 13 others in 31 league appearancesKlopp believes Salah can provide Liverpool with an injection of pace in their attacking front line, something that is all but absent when Sadio Man is unavailable, as he was for the whole of January after travelling to Gabon to represent Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations and then for the final six weeks or so of the campaign just finished after collecting a knee injury in the 3-1 victory over Everton on 1 April",3
"Such is Liverpools determination to acquire Salah that they are willing to make him the joint most-expensive signing in their history, following on from the 35m spent on purchasing Andy Carroll from Newcastle United in January 2011",1
" Salah is expected to earn in the region of 90,000 a week at AnfieldLiverpool have already signed one player in the close season  the England Under-20 striker Dominic Solanke, who will arrive on Merseyside on 1 July following the end of his contract with Chelsea  and, with the club having reached the Champions League qualifying stages, Klopp is determined to add to his resources between now and the first leg in August",2
"As well as targeting Salah, the German is also believed to be keen on acquiring Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from Arsenal, Naby Keita from Red Bull Leipzig and the Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk",1
"Gareth Bale has insisted that he has no intention of leaving Real Madrid this summer amid speculation that Manchester United may attempt to sign the Wales international for a fee of more than 100mBale was a second-half substitute in his home city of Cardiff as Real became the first side to retain the status as European champions since the Champions League era began with a comprehensive 4-1 win against Juventus on SaturdayThat victory ensured Bale became the first Welshman to win club footballs most prestigious tournament for the third time at the end of a season during which the 27-year-old has been plagued by injuryBale made only 19 league appearances for the club as they won a first La Liga title since 2011 Having attempted to prove his fitness for the final, Bale did not start against Juventus with the manager, Zindine Zidane, opting instead for Isco",5
" That has fuelled rumours that United could turn to Bale after cooling their approach for Antoine Griezmann after the Frenchman confirmed on Sunday that he would not be leaving Atltico Madrid this summer after the Spanish clubs transfer ban was upheld by FifaBale, who agreed a new deal in October lasting until 2022 worth 350,000 a week after tax and with a 1bn buyout clause, was adamant that he wants to remain at the club he joined in September 2013 from Tottenham Hotspur for 85m, which was then a world-record fee",2
"Ive signed a long-term contract at Madrid, he said My family is happy and I am happy so, yeah, we will continue what we are doing We are winning trophies and I am happy",3
"Ive worked double sessions for three, four weeks to get myself ready for this, to get myself fit, recover from the surgery  which still has a little more healing to do  but I will be able to rest in the summer, do some more rehab and then come next season stronger Its been a tough year with a lot of football and the injuries, but the main thing for me is to get my ankle sorted and give it that rest it needs I came back too early from the surgery But I still finished the season happy, its a great finish with another trophyUnited tried to sign Bale in 2013 when David Moyes succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford but were beaten to his signature",5
" The Welshmans representatives have dismissed reports linking him with a return to the Premier League, stressing that he has no desire to leave the most successful club in global football Given that he has now won seven major trophies in only four years in Spain, it is hard to argue that this Madrid side is up there with some of the most successful in historyWere used to this, Bale said We have won three Champions Leagues in four seasons so we have to be in that category All we can keep doing is keep working hard and hopefully there will be more to come",5
" I think we can get betterWe are still quite young as a whole team and we have a great squad We havent just got a great eleven, we have a great squad so if any injuries come along there are other people who can do a job We are strong and confident and the plan is to win moreThis adds to the history of this club",5
 This club is the biggest in Champions League history ever and now we have even more Its great to be a part of,2
"Since John McEnroe turned the air blue in the 80s, memorably at decorous Wimbledon but without fear or favour across the tennis landscape, the sport has struggled to accommodate what it regards as unsportsmanlike conduct, as quaint a notion as unparliamentary behaviour at WestminsterThere have been some classic outbursts in the first week of this French Open Nick Kyrgios brought his fines for the past 12 months to 25,000 with a racket smash during his exit at the hands of Kevin Anderson, and Novak Djokovic was soundly ticked off for gesturing to throw his racket at the umpire at a stressful moment in his tortured win against Diego Schwartzman on FridayAndy Murray internalises his angst, beating himself up verbally rather than abusing his racket, the ground or the ball kidsEnroute to the fourth round against the young Russian Karen Khachanov on Monday, Murray has chuntered, cursed, smiled and shushed  all in rhythm with his sense of comfort and the level of his play",5
" After a lot of shushing to himself and a few wicked glances towards his box in his tense win against Juan Martn del Potro on Saturday, he was happy to explain, perhaps for the first time in detail, what makes his verbal tics tickI was still muttering a lot today, he said, maybe not so much at the beginning  but I was losing at the beginning I dont know how much of an impact it has on my tennis What is actually relevant is not what I say the four or five seconds after a point is finished; whats relevant is the 10, 15 seconds before the next point starts, what is actually going through my headIf Im thinking about the next point and what Ive done wrong or what Ive done right in the previous point, thats very positive",5
" If Im muttering for 20 seconds, then that isnt going to be a good thing because Im not thinking about the next pointI felt like when I was getting frustrated [on his way to defeating DelPotro 7-6, 7-5, 6-0] I stopped myself fairly quickly and got back to playing the right way",3
 I turned it around quickly  and I deserve credit for doing that I know my head right now is in the right place because I am working things out on the court and thats what I care about,2
"It would be a shame if Murray ever succumbed to the urgings of those who find his on-court ramblings odd or disturbing They are part of who he is He has discussed it with professionals, he reveals  although he has not considered using a psychologist this year, which is proving difficult after the non-stop highs of 2016",3
"I feel like when Ive used sports psychologists in the past, Ive done it when I felt like I wanted to Thats the most important thing",2
" If it is forced upon you, I dont really think that that works You need to be the one deciding I want to do thisMurrays is the contentment of the driven champion, not necessarily that of a banker, coalminer or journalist",3
" The adrenaline that rushes through him in moments of tension during a big match is surely what keeps him coming back for moreI wasnt playing well enough last week to win the tournament, he also admitted When I was practising, I wasnt playing well enough",3
" But things can change very quickly You dont become a bad tennis player overnight It can only take one or two good practices, providing youre trying to do the right things in practice",3
" It wasnt going to be easy but I feel like Ive done a good job of that Im playing way better than I was a week, 10 days agoAnd thats the beauty of Murray: it is impossible to predict which version of him will turn upBut which Khachanov will we get? Murray takes a walk into the relatively unknown at the beginning of the second week  against a boy named Karen (with the emphasis on the second syllable, he reminded us on Sunday), who played some tough tennis to get the better of John Isner over four sets in three hours on the claustrophobic court 2The 21-year-old Russian has not quite lived up to the 2013 assessment of his compatriot, the former world No1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who said of him: He will be in the top 20 by the end of 2015",5
" But he reached a career-high of 42 last month before slipping to 53, four places behind Kyle Edmund and two ahead of Dan Evans",1
" He did look like a top-20 player against Isner, who struck 14 aces to go with the 66 he had already accumulated at the top of the tournaments serving statistics",1
"Khachanov beat the stubborn American at his strong suit as well, prevailing in two of the three tie-breaks to win 7-6 (1), 6-3, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (3) He is unlikely to need motivation in the biggest match of his life but he might draw inspiration from trying to avenge Murrays win over Del Potro",2
" The Argentinian was Khachanovs favourite player growing up in MoscowBut, he said, he will not explode like his other hero, the eccentric Russian Marat Safin",2
" Khachanovs off-court obsession is chess, so there will be plenty of room for mind gamesThe British & Irish Lions management have called for a rethink on tour scheduling following their teams sluggish opening display on Saturday",2
" The Lions hierarchy say the squad need more time to prepare, having been required to play their opening game within 80 hours of arriving in NewZealand",1
"John Spencer, the tour manager, remains confident his players will swiftly improve but he wants this Lions squad to be the last to embark on a major series on the opposite side of the world within a week of the domestic season endingI certainly hope so, Spencer said when asked if he wanted future tour itineraries to be amended in the light of his sides lacklustre 13-7 win against a Provincial Barbarians XV in Whangarei",2
"There are also those who believe the Lions should reduce the amount of corporate and community work they do and allocate more time to their rugby The players, still struggling to shake off the effects of jet lag, spent Sunday morning in Waitangi, where they received a stirring Maori welcome before returning to Auckland to prepare for their second game of the tour, against the Blues onWednesday",2
"Spencer, who said the squads thoughts and prayers were with the victims of the London Bridge terror attack, is hoping the Lions will be allocated a more helpful slot in the global timetable from 2021 onwardsWe have always been disappointed in the preparation time, the former England centre said It is arranged for us and we have to take our lot",3
" We hope that, when the global calendar is eventually resolved, just once every four years we will get an extra week at homeThe Lions manager, however, has defended the decision to sign up to a tough 2017 schedule and not to fly out players early to prepare for the opening fixture",2
 We think it can be very divisive to split the squad and then try to get it back together again It isnt a great difficulty to bond four nations but you dont want to add distractions to that,2
We dont mind the schedule of matches and it is welcomed by the coaches and players You cannot come to New Zealand and try to win Test matches without being tested to the core I dont think we need any knee-jerk reactions,3
The first match of the tour is always difficult because you have just travelled I remember in 1971 we won all our provincial matches here,2
 We won 20 provincial matches but lost the first one in Queensland,1
 These things happen,1
"However, Sam Warburton, the Lions captain, has acknowledged that his team need to play significantly better against the Blues and the Crusaders",1
" We want to be tested, the Welsh flanker said We dont want to be playing teams where were winning by 40 points",2
 Theyre the best teams for us right now to compare,1
On Saturday we lost the physical battle in the first half and I dont think we won enough collisions in defence,1
 Thats the way it is over here; nothing is going to happen easily,1
 Weve got three weeks now to get as good as we can Its how good we are in three weeks time thats reallyimportant,2
"Ben Teo confirmed several Lions players were feeling the effects of jet lag before and during the match on Saturday The boys are still a little bit jet-lagged but no excuse, the centre saidWe had to come here and play hard",3
 They were a good side and we got tested,1
" If Im honest, the last three days have been really tough: waking up at 1am, some guys getting one or two hours sleepBoys were really, really tired before training, before games But weve got to push through and over the next few days its going to get a lot easier",3
" The guys playing on Wednesday will probably be feeling a lot betterIn 2013, dual Brownlow medallist Greg Williams described Joel Selwood as too courageous for his own good, and a walking time bomb who needed to be protected from himself",2
 That Williams had been diagnosed with a degenerative brain condition that he linked to repeated head-knocks provided his caution with a hint of menace,1
"Responding on Nines Footy Classified shortly after Williams warning, Selwood said there were many things that hed learnt as a kid that he couldnt take out of his game Its just so hard to change, Selwood said",2
" There are times in games when you have to go for the footy, and thats one thing that Ive never had a problem withHere we are, four years later and still not much has changed The atmosphere of a siege still pervades Selwoods game and he consciously ignores every self-preserving impulse any normal person should have",3
" He ignored them again during the first quarter on Friday night at Simonds Stadium, when he had a tte--tte with Andy Ottens elbow This time Selwood hit the ground hard, getting to his feet with a head that looked as if it had come out Kathy Griffins prop bagNotwithstanding the chunk missing from above his right ear, Selwood pushed away the clubs medical staff to try and return to the contest, ten years of hard-at-it football fashioning his stride, his face again painted in blood As he reluctantly sought treatment on the bench, the editors at Sevens Friday night football coverage began splicing together film of the collision to add to a Selwood showreel already crammed with enough blood and hits to the head to make the Rocky films seem tameSelwood returned to the ground early in the second quarter with 12 stitches and another scar on the side of his head",5
" He doesnt need any more [scars], said his younger brother and teammate Scott after the Cats posted an impressive 22-point win against fellow Premiership hopefuls Adelaide He has got enough scars and he is ugly enough as it isHes also got enough Brownlow votes (without having won it), but will probably end up with three more after another best afield performance  21 contested possessions and nine clearances that continued the Crows sorry record at Simonds stadium, a venue at which theyve not won since 2003",3
Selwoods game had been infused with iron long before he first walked through the door at Kardinia Park at the dawn of a Geelong era,1
" The comedian Jerry Lewis once confessed that he tried to get his father to show some emotion by offering him $50,000 to smack Lewis around Selwood had his two talented older brothers do it for freeLike a lot of kids, Selwood played his first competitive game of football when he was eight The difference was that Selwood played his in his brothers under-12 team We were short, so he bobbed up in his first game as an eight-year-old playing against 12-year-olds and he kicked two or three goals off the forward flank, older brother Troy recalled to The Ages Michael Gleeson in 2007",5
"All sporting eras contain a little bit of luck, and Geelongs may have been that Selwood had to undergo knee surgery after just six games into his final season with the Bendigo Pioneers in the TAC Cup This is the only reason why a kid who AFL national talent manager Kevin Shifter Sheehan rated as the best 17-year-old in Australia fell to Geelong after Hawthorn took luckless Mitchell Thorp with pick six",2
"From his first game of AFL football, Selwood has personified a harder and more talented Geelong",1
" His early years were a reminder that its not always just the old guys who know what toughness means But not only is Selwood the Cats hardest (its almost as if he seeks the stitches and scars), for a good part of his ten-and-a-half seasons he has also been the most influentialBy any conventional measure, Selwood is a champion of the game: three Geelong best and fairest awards, five all-Australians nods (three as captain) and three premierships Selwood also has four AFLPA Robert Rose Awards for Most Courageous After he won his last three in 2012, 2013 and 2014, you suspect the AFL now just award it to the runner-up",5
"But despite his burgeoning trophy cabinet, Selwood has been the star who hasnt seemed to care much about being one If Patrick Dangerfield has assumed the superstar mantle at Geelong, you sense that it suits Selwood just fine",2
" Reflecting the impact of footballs most devastating one-two punch, Dangerwood has quickly become footballs most exhausted portmanteauYet in many ways the term would be relevant even if Dangerfield didnt return home to Moggs Creek, a one-hour drive from Geelong Danger is what fires Selwood, and it is this danger and an appetite for the contest that makes him such a compelling figure in a game, particularly for fans",3
"While eighteenth-century philosopher Edmund Burke didnt see a game of AFL, his theory of the sublime goes some way to explain our pleasure in watching Selwood",1
" Part of Burkes thesis is the notion of negative pain, the idea that a feeling of fear  paired with a sense of safety, and the ability to look away, can produce a feeling of delight For those who dont consume themselves with demands for him to appear before The Hague for his ducking, watching Selwood for the past ten years has been just that  a delightWeek after week, the Geelong champion plays in a fearless style that brings into relief the plastic macho of those of us who write about football and question the mental toughness of players",3
What cannot be questioned is Selwoods hardness and his impact on the club where he has played all of his 239 games,1
" In an era where a players worth is increasingly defined by multi-year, multi-million contract offers, Selwood is a generational player who not only defines Geelongs most successful era, but personifies it And he has the scars to prove it",2
"The Republic of Ireland secured a morale-boosting 3-1 win over Uruguay in a friendly match, with Jonathan Walters, Cyrus Christie and James McClean all finding the target in Dublin",1
"Ireland had taken a 28th-minute lead through Walterss sumptuous effort and, although Jos Gimnez levelled before the break, Christies strike and a well-executed third from the substitute McClean rounded off a good evening for the manager, Martin ONeillHe made eight changes to the side who lost 3-1 against Mexico with only the goalkeeper, Darren Randolph, and the defenders Christie and Shane Duffy retained, and his big names engineered a significant improvement on the performance at the MetLife Stadium to boost spirits before Austrias visit to Dublin next Sunday for a World Cup qualifierONeills opposite number, scar Tabrez, named only five of the men who started Ururguays last World Cup qualifier in Peru, among them the Paris Saint-Germain frontman Edinson Cavani",3
In the event Cavani lasted 12 minutes before over-stretching in a vain attempt to reach Randolphs nonchalant pass across his own penalty area to Duffy at the start of a first half which was to move from the sublime to the ridiculous before it drew to a closeIrelands 4-2-3-1 formation gave them a more solid base than they had enjoyed against the Mexicans when ONeills three-man defence simply did not work but Robbie Brady found himself operating on the right and initially struggled to have his usual influence,2
"Walters enjoyed some early success in getting behind the Uruguay rearguard but it was Brady who tested Esteban Conde with a swerving 13th-minute effort before Duffy only just failed to connect with a diving header from the Burnley midfielders cross seconds laterCavanis replacement, Cristhian Stuani, failed to trouble Randolph with a tame 18th-minute volley and the home side took the lead in some style 10 minutes later",2
"Glenn Whelan surged on to Jeff Hendricks pass and stabbed the ball towards Walters who, having urged his team-mate to step aside, took a touch and then curled a dipping right-foot shot past Conde and into the far cornerUruguay were level seven minutes before the break when Gimnez made the most of Randolphs ill-judged decision to come for Egidio Arevalo Rios free-kick, although he needed a piece of good fortunate as the ball came off his shoulder as he attempted to head it and looped into the unguarded netHowever, Ireland would have gone in ahead at the break had Walters been able to summon up even a morsel of the quality he had demonstrated earlier when meeting Bradys volleyed cross in front of an open goal but he contrived to steer his shot against the crossbar from three yards",3
"Christie did restore the advantage within six minutes of the restart, though, when he cut inside the full-back Martin Cceres and deceived Conde with a low left-foot shot which Sebastin Coates failed to blockWith Brady now playing in his more accustomed left-sided berth, the Republic were more of a threat despite ONeill making five substitutions by the hourOne of them, Keiren Westwood, announced his return to the fold with a fine one-handed save from Gimenezs towering 68th-minute header but it was Ireland who finished the stronger",3
"Daryl Murphy tested Conde with a low drive and then set up his fellow substitute McClean to cement the win in clinical fashion McClean stepped on to Murphys pass, skipped over Gimnezs desperate lunge and thumped a shot across the keeper and inside the far postVirat Kohli hailed a massive win against Pakistan as India delivered the message that, for all the talk of issues behind the scenes in their camp, they are more than capable of defending their Champions Trophy title this summer",3
"Kohli delivered a batting masterclass, with an unbeaten 81 from 68 balls as his side posted 319 for three in a rain-reduced 48 overs In the reply Umesh Yadav took three for 30 as Pakistan were bowled out for 164 chasing an adjusted 289 from 41With Yuvraj Singhs 29-ball half-century also wowing the Edgbaston crowd, India looked anything but a team reportedly looking to see their head coach, Anil Kumble, replaced when his one-year contract expires at the end of the tournament",3
"Its a massive win for us, said Kolhi, who struck six fours and three sixes in a brutal late assault The way we played and the confidence we showed was very pleasing as a captain The way Yuvi batted was the game-changing innings",3
The middle order was outstanding and Yuvi was outstanding,1
 I felt like a club batter next to him,1
" With bat and ball we were nine out of ten, in the field we were six today",1
" If we tune that up to eight or nine we will be a strong side, it was a very complete game for us",1
"Yuvraj added: We started well with the bat and the bowlers came and stuck to the plan and took wickets at regular intervals India-Pakistan is very special - the Indian fans make it special for usMickey Arthur, Pakistans head coach, fronted up after the match, describing the result as a reality check for a side who are lowest ranked in the eight-team tournament while lamenting the two dropped catches that gave reprieves to Yuvraj and Kohli on eight and 43 respectively",2
"We didnt take opportunities and they made us pay for it, Arthur said The worrying thing for me is we do the basics wrong We dropped simple catches",3
 We dont run well enough between wickets We dont hit the keeper with our throws But well bounce back from it,3
"Asked how long before performances improve, he replied: How long is a piece of string? I dont know Were trying every day",2
" Every time we go down to training, we try and get the basics right We didnt do it today And thats disappointingAmid the hustle and bustle of the Edgbaston Road one man stood quite still The crowd flowed around him like a river past a rock, men, women and children on their way to the game, all sporting splashes of brilliant green and bright sky blue",5
 Nearby a band banged drums while fans danced giddy circles around them,1
" Off to one side, pedlars cried out hats, horns, scarves and masks and touts looking for spare tickets muttered muted inquiries under their breathTheirs was a slow business, since noone was selling TV crews cut back and forth across the stream, looking for people to interview",3
" And over the back someone took a match to a pack of fireworks, so plumes of blue smoke swirled overhead",1
" In the middle of it all the standing man held a homemade sign: London, Manchester, Mumbai, Terror NeverWins",1
"In the morning the International Cricket Council put out a press release confirming that the tournament would go on, just as the Ashes had after the London bombings in 2005 Security was already tight after the attack in Manchester and the police had warned spectators to expect long queues So a lot of people were delayed getting into the ground But no one seemed to mindBesides, Indias openers took it especially slow and steady in the first few overs, so the latecomers did not miss anything much",5
" India took their time measuring Pakistans attack They scored 72 runs in the final four overs, more than they managed in the entirety of the first 15",2
" By the end of the innings one could spot the Pakistan fans by looking for the flat patches in the stands, because they were the only ones sittingdownTime was when was the crowds at these games needed to be policed, not protected India v Pakistan is one of the most fervid fixtures in all of sport and in the 1990s feelings ran so hot that matches boiled up and over Games between the teams were often interrupted, sometimes abandoned In 1996 a fight even broke out on the pitch during the final of the Under-15 World Cup between the teams, at Lords of all places",5
" It got so bad that during the 1999 World Cup the England and Wales Cricket Board asked the government to introduce emergency legislation to outlaw pitch invasions at cricket stadiums after Indias captain, Mohammad Azharuddin, warned that somebody was going to get killed during the match between India and Pakistan at Old Trafford",1
The fixture still carries a lot of baggage The two teams have not played a Test in a decade and their last limitedovers series finished in January 2013,2
 Both boards say they are keen to play again but the Indian government will not allow it,1
" This week the sports minister, Vijay Goel, said that India and Pakistan would not be playing a bilateral series any time soon because cricket and terrorism cant go hand-in-hand Lately they have played only when they have been drawn together in ICC tournaments, something which, luckily enough for the fans, sponsors and TV networks, seems to happen with uncanny regularity",2
" But despite all that, or perhaps because of it, the fixture does not seem to generate as much heat as it once did",1
"Nothing different, to be honest, was Virat Kohlis blunt assessment before this match I know it sounds pretty boring but this is exactly what we feel as cricketers Kohli could afford to be blas",3
" India have now won eight of the nine games the two teams have played in tournaments this decade, the only exception being a match in the Asia Cup in 2014 So the gulf between the two teams feels as wide now as it has ever been",2
" Partly this is because Pakistan are rebuilding their team The last time they played a one-day international against India, in the 2015 World Cup, they had Shahid Afridi, Umar Akmal, Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq in the teamThree are retired now, and the fourth, Akmal, was kicked out of the squad because he failed a fitness test",3
" This is a callow Pakistan team then, out-matched by an outstanding Indian side hardened by all those seasons of intense limited overs cricket in the Indian Premier League",1
" When the game started to escape the Pakistanis they were not able to regain any measure of control over it They ran flush out of luck too, which did not help",2
" Their bowling attack collapsed in the final overs as Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz had to leave the field, injured In the end the match was not much of a contest but it never stopped being an occasionAt twenty past ten, almost exactly 12 hours after the attack in London, Edgbaston fell quiet in a minutes silence",3
" It was the only moment between dawn and dusk in which the streets around the ground were not loud with the sound of screams, shouts, whistles, horns and drums",1
" There was succour to be found in the crowd, in their determination to go on with the frivolous business of singing, dancing and cheering to celebrate sixes and wickets It was the largest attendance they have ever had for a one-day game at Edgbaston, just under 25,000 people altogether, a 50-50 mix, part Pakistani, part Indian, all proudly British The fixture, which in the past has often split supporters apart, served to bring everyone a little closer togetherAuthorities say former Los Angeles Lakers player and ex-New York Knicks head coach Derek Fisher has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving after he flipped his vehicle on a California highwayThe California Highway Patrol says neither Fisher nor his passenger, former Basketball Wives reality star Gloria Govan, were injured in the crash early on Sunday",5
"Authorities say Fisher was driving on US 101 in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles when his 2015 Cadillac veered onto the right shoulder while approaching an interchange The car hit the shoulders concrete curb and guardrail, overturned and came to a rest on its roof",2
"The Highway Patrol says officers discovered that Fisher had been drinking and he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcoholIndia are up and running in the defence of their Champions Trophy title following a brutal exhibition of ball-striking from Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh that, on the ground where they lifted the trophy four years ago, simply crushed their arch-rivals PakistanBut while the result  a 124-run win by Duckworth-Lewis  may have met pre-match expectations in terms of the current gulf between the two sides, the atmosphere at least exceeded them as a record crowd of 24,165 throbbed throughout a day that required patience given its regular stoppages for rain",3
"This was a match strewn with errors, perhaps because of the magnitude of the occasion given a global TV audience tipped to approach one billion, but at least it ended with the brollies packed away and the ground bathed in glorious sunshine Pakistan, faced with an ever-increasing run-rate, were bowled out for 164 in 33",2
"4 overs with the No11, Wahab Riaz, failing to emerge due to injury Umesh Yadav led the Indian attack with three for 30Sarfraz Ahmeds side had been chasing a rain-adjusted target of 289 from 41 overs but always looked up against it after India had stuck 319 for three on the board in 48",3
" It was a total that was heavily bloated by the power-hitting at the end during which Kohli hit an unbeaten 81 from 68 balls, Yuvraj creamed 53 from 32 and Hardik Pandya launched three late sixes in his six-ball 20 not outA hostile opening burst from Mohammad Amir notwithstanding, the decision to stick India in at the toss by Sarfraz resulted in an ominous start",2
" Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma eased to 125 by the 25th over, laying the platform for their sides late assault while bringing up their ninth century opening stand in ODIs and a record third in Champions Trophy cricketDespite Pakistans head coach, Mickey Arthur, talking up their preparation leading into the match, his side were shabbier in the field than some of the items for sale in the nearby Moseley vintage fair and, though the two rain breaks that wiped out 75 minutes of play gave them a couple of chances to regroup, they instead got progressively worse",2
" By the end, when Kohli and Yuvraj were clubbing boundaries for fun, the wheels were off completely",1
Sharmas 91 from 119 balls was an old-style affair from the owner of the world record ODI score of 264,1
" Monopolising much of the strike first thing, he was duly first to his fifty off 71 balls when launching the 18-year-old Shadab Khan over midwicket for six The much-denied Dhawan then briefly crackled in bringing up his own milestone before, on 68, the leg-spinners friend  aka a rank full toss  was plopped into the hands of Azhar Ali in the deepKohlis arrival to a wall of noise, one that doubtless left Edgbaston locals wondering why their glassware had begun to shake, brought with it a relatively sedate passage of play",3
" A stand of 56 with Sharma, interrupted by the second downpour, came from 121 overs with the opener at one stage going 44 balls between boundariesSharmas eventual demise came to the surprise of many",3
" A seemingly innocuous run-out attempt from point ended with the bat over the line but pushed up by the dive such that the third umpire, Richard Kettleborough, judged it not to be groundedWith 10 overs of to go and Yuvraj new to the crease, the score was 202 for two and Pakistan were still in it provided they could apply the squeeze",2
" But instead two regulation drops handed lives to both batsmen and, with Amir and Wahab succumbing to cramp and an ankle problem respectively, 117 runs were flayed, including an astonishing 72 from the last 24 deliveriesYuvraj was first to profit in the 39th over when, with eight to his name, he duffed a googly from Shadab to Hasan Ali at long-on only to see the ball grassed on the slide From there the left-hander went into overdrive, carving a 29-ball half-century with short-arm bunts down the ground for four and one heaved six before eventually being trapped lbw by a Hasan yorker with 10 balls remaining",3
"Kohli, who was dropped on 43 in the deep by the substitute Faheem Ashraf, was not to be outdone and having hit four fours in his first 55 balls, joined the violent dismantling of Pakistans attack",1
" Wahab was particularly to his taste, with the left-armer taken for two fours and one screaming six before hobbling off with his ankle apparently crocked and his figures  84 overs, none for 87  in tattersIt meant Imad Wasim, the left-arm spinner who had bafflingly been given six overs with the new ball, had to see things out",3
" It could not have started worse as the new man, Pandya, slapped him for three successive sixes before Kohli capped off the innings with a sixth four laced through extra cover; it summed up the dominance",1
"Pakistans reply, with an original adjusted target of 324 cut after a 35-minute rain break early on, hinged on Azhar converting his 64-ball half-century into an innings of substance and given support at the other end Neither materialised, with Ahmed Shehzad trapped lbw for 12 by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Babar Azam slashing Yadav to point on eight before Azhar himself swept Ravindra Jadeja to deep square-leg the ball after reaching his 50 After Shoaib Malik was brilliantly run out by Jadeja and Mohammad Hafeez clubbed the left-armer up in the air on 33, the lower order simply disintegrated",3
Castleford took another step towards finally securing the title after almost a century of trying with a narrow home victory against St Helens,1
" The win was notable also for the fact that they were without a number of key front-line playersDaryl Powell, the Tigers head coach, made no secret of how, with this third game of a gruelling 10-day period, he would rest several big names to not only make a point to the sports schedulers but also to ensure that his Castleford players do not burn out in the long termPowell was without more than 1,000 games worth of Super League experience , with England internationals such as Luke Gale, Zak Hardaker and Michael Shenton all missing",3
" And while they have already beaten some of their opponents with remarkable free-flowing rugby on many occasions this season, given the circumstances this win surely ranks as their best of the year so far",1
"The added bonus for Castleford was that with Salford Red Devils losing at home against Wakefield, it extended the their own lead at the top of the Super League table to four points Its one of the biggest wins Ive been involved in, honestly, Powell said",2
" We cant get carried away with having a buffer at the top but weve got something special going hereSt Helens had a 10-day turnaround for this game: another bone of contention for Powell pre-match given that his side played as recently as last Monday Yet despite two earlier encouraging performances under their new coach, Justin Holbrook, the 12-4 half-time lead they established was eventually overturned with Tom Holmess late try nine minutes from time to inflict a first defeat on the Australian as coachIts a missed opportunity, Holbrook said later They have the luxury of where theyre sitting in the table to rest players and theyve earned that, but for us to fall just short is disappointing",5
"Saints led when Mark Percival rounded Kieran Gill, one of several Castleford youngsters handed an opportunity in a much-changed side, to break the deadlock  though Gill would respond with a try of his own on debut as half-time approached Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook extended the lead to eight points with a close-range finish on 37 minutes, and from there the visiting side appeared to be in controlHowever, the Tigers were able to keep their opponents scoreless in the second half, scoring two tries of their own to secure a precious victory",3
"First, Mike McMeekens wonderful solo effort on the hour set up a dramatic finale, with Castleford going ahead for the first, and only, time nine minutes from the end when Holmes reacted quickest to a desperate kick to touch down and extend the Tigers lead at the top of the tableRight now it would take a brave man to back against Castleford staying at the top for the duration of the season",2

Steven Finns summons to the Champions Trophy squad was confirmed on Sunday and he was understandably delighted that he has been chosen to replace Chris Woakes,1
 But being a conscientious student of the game he must be aware that he has not been invited to a picnic for bowlersSo far it has been a batsmans tournament between the exasperating showers,2
 The pitches have been brown and true and the ball has declined to deviate Often bowlers have been in survival mode and Finns experience made him the more obvious choice ahead of Tom Curran or Toby Roland-Jones,2
Finn made his one-day international debut six years ago; has 69 matches under his belt and he was in Englands Champions Trophy squad in 2013 when he played one game against South Africa,1
"Its great to be here, Finn said on arrival at a damp Cardiff",1
" It is obviously very sad for Chris Woakes, who is a good friend of mine, but Im glad I have got the call",1
" Ive been on the periphery for a little while You have always got a point to prove when you have been out of theteamThe problem for the bowlers has been avoiding the middle of the bat Moreover the middle of todays bats occupies far more space than it did in the 20th century There are two ways to do it: by lateral movement which can be achieved by seam, spin or swing, or by exceptional/ uneven bounce which can cause the ball to hit the bottom or shoulder of the bat and go nowhere",5
"So far there has been minimal swing, seam or spin, which helps to explain the absence of David Willey and Adil Rashid from Englands team at The Oval against Bangladesh The current batch of white balls stubbornly refuse to swing and this is a source of frustration for such as Willey as well as being a minor stain on the tournament It is a better game when the bowlers have a chance at some point in theinnings",3
"This state of affairs makes tall bowlers who can gain exceptional bounce more appealing to on-field captains, who have often been as harassed as the poor groundsmen heaving the covers on and off Finn at his best can hit the shoulder of the bat; two years ago he was arguably Englands premier one-day bowler, who was regularly tossed the new ball Then he did not play a game between September 2015 and March 2017",3
" Now it is just conceivable that, having been brought into the squad, Finn could play against New Zealand on Tuesday ahead of Jake Ball, who has conceded more than 80 runs in two of his last three outings, and WilleyOff the field Finn is a mild-mannered, contemplative man (on it he is no Dennis Lillee) but he is prepared to outline what he brings to the squad I think Ive got a good record in one-day cricket, he says",3
 I am slightly taller than the other guys and can therefore get a bit more bounce,1
 Ive played a lot of ODIs There is experience there,2
 I think we have got a really well balanced squad and hopefully my personal attributes can bring something to thatHe has seldom been regarded as a miserly bowler yet his economy rate compares well with those of his peers (in fact it is much better than that of any other bowler in the squad) but that is partly explained by his longevity  there has been hyper-inflation in run-scoring over the past 18 months But he does satisfy the demands of the modern ODI game since he has always been a wicket-taker,3
"Taking wickets is always something I try to do, he explains, which sounds an obvious thing to say but has a particular significance in the context of ODI cricket I never take a backward step or try to be negative or defensive I think trying to take wickets is the mantra we have tried to adopt as a one-day bowling side and I can help thatOn Saturday he was playing for the England Lions against South AfricaA and he was aware that he was under scrutiny after the injury to Woakes In a straightforward victory he finished with two for 49 from 8",5
3 overs,1
"I knew James Whitaker and Mick Newell were there, he said You feel that pressure knowing that they are watching you to call you up for this game But that is no different from every time I pull on an England or Lions shirt",3
" I had a bit of a stiff back in the Lions game at Nottingham on Thursday so it was a case of making sure my back was 100% So it was a mixture of seeing my fitness and how I was bowling If I had bowled a bigpile of garbage, then I wouldnt be standing here now",3
"Rafael Nadal is looking every inch the champion he was here five years ago and it is clearly going to take someone playing special tennis to stop the Spaniard winning his 10th titleWhether that person is Novak Djokovic was difficult to say after another win that mixed waywardness with brilliance on Sunday eveningThe defending champion, who also looked lost at various points over five sets against Diego Schwartzman on Friday, has hardly had a sound preparation for a likely semi-final against Nadal, the rival who has won the title here nine times",3
" But he finished a patchy assignment against Albert Ramos-Violas  Andy Murrays conqueror in Monte Carlo  going through to the next round with a 7-6, 6-1, 6-3 winWho else can stop Nadal at Roland Garros? With all the generosity one could muster, it probably will not be Pablo Carreno Busta, who took 4hr 17min to defeat Milos Raonic over five gruelling sets on Sunday for the honour of playing his Spanish friend in the quarter-finals on TuesdayWhen Nadal won his seventh championship in 2012, he gave up only 19 games on his way to the last eight",3
" On Sunday he raced into the quarters ahead of the field in a mere 1hr51min, dismissing another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2",1
" This time his first four matches have cost him 20 gamesEna Sharples had fewer numbers against her trying to win Friday-night bingo than Busta has against Nadal but after defeating Raonic 4-6, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 8-6 he insisted: Maybe Ill lose easy, maybe Ill win easy",2
"Those two maybes are about as far apart as the players professional records Nadal has won three tournaments this year and 72 in his career; Busta has won three titles in the eight years he has been playing tennis for a livingFive years ago Nadals first four opponents had a combined ranking of 216 Here he has beaten Benot Paire (45), Robin Haase (46), Nikoloz Basilashvili (63) and Agut (18): a total of 172Having turned 31 on Saturday, Nadal, statistically and by common agreement, is playing tennis as awesome as when he was at or near his peak",5
" In 2012 he won four titles and 42 of his 48 matches; this year he has won 36 of 42If Nadal defeats Busta, he will post his 100th win in best-of-five matches on clay, against two defeats Both of those were here, against Robin Soderling in 2009 and Djokovic two years ago",3
" There cannot be a record like it in sportWhile that blizzard of statistics might be a lot to take in, pity the plight of Agut, who had to soak up 31 clear winners in less than two hours, 18 of them ripped on that forehand by the left wrist that last year gave up on Nadal after two matches He is hitting the ball with as much venomous top-spin as he has done in a long while and he is without question the most dangerous player remaining in the draw",3
"Probably I didnt play as well as I did the other day, he said later, which is not as arrogant as it sounds",1
 I made a few mistakes but not important ones,1
 In general terms I played well,1
The most important thing for me is I was able to play with no injuries and not too many problems since [Carlos Moy joined his team],1
 We have been able to practise as much as we wanted and the way that we wanted,1
"There have been suggestions that his uncle, Toni  who will give up his main coaching role at the end of the year  admonished Nadal at the start of the season for what he perceived to be a lack of motivation",1
" Nadal replied: I believe that my attitude never was wrong, so is not a question of attitude; its a question of tennis and is a question of health If youre healthy, its easy to play with good attitude and easy to practiseWhat is obvious is that Busta, who has had a decent season and a solid tournament, will find this match tougher than any of their previous three, all of which he lost",3
" Raonic kept the world No21 on court to contest 382 points and the Spaniard said later: It was really tough I suffered but I enjoyed it And, of course, you enjoy it more when you win",3
 He played very well on match point [the Canadian saved six of them] The rallies were very long He was defending well all the time,3
"If I didnt think I had a chance, I would not play Of course it will be difficult because Rafa is the best player on the surface in history",2
 I am maybe tired but I have one day off We will see on Tuesday Hes a really good friend It will be a really special match for meThe short odds are that it will be a special occasion for Busta but not a match that will change his career,5
 Nadal told Spanish journalists: I fully respect each opponent and I fully respect the tournament,1
" Just because things go well for you it does not mean things are going to continue like this You have to be ready so that you can react to bad moments that might happenA tearful Garbie Muguruza hit out at the crowd after her title defence was ended by Frances Kristina Mladenovic The Spaniard, who defeated Serena Williams in the final 12 months ago, walked off wagging her finger at the fans on Court Suzanne LenglenThere has not been a French winner since Mary Pierce in 2000 and Mladenovic was cheered raucously during her 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 victory",5
" But Muguruza felt the support went too far, saying: I think the audience was really tough today I cant really understand I dont know how to explain",3
" If you had been in my shoes on the court, I think you would have understood",1
"She broke down in tears in her press conference and had to leave the room for a few minutes before returning It appeared there was no love lost between the players either, with Muguruza asked about Mladenovics habit of shouting forza in Italian at key moments",2
" I think she speaks like 25 languages, I heard, said Muguruza",1
"Along with intense disappointment, there was also relief for the Spaniard, who has struggled to cope with the expectation since her triumph here last year I lost confidence, and my opponent was on home turf, so it created a lot of tension, she said",2
 Of course Im sad Its a very painful defeat here at the French Open,2
" I love this tournament no matter what happens Im going to be super happy to come back Its going to sound weird, but Im actually happy that this stage of the year is done",3
"I wanted to go as far as possible, but even if I didnt, I think Im going to feel much better now to continue the year, and everybody is going to stop bothering me asking me about this tournamentMladenovic, though, praised her supporters The courage and the force you give me is just unimaginable Its thanks to you that I fought for every point And were in the quarter-finals",5
" Yes!She has been struggling with a bad back since the eve of the tournament and served 16 double faults, but the rest of her game made up for it She said: Everything wasnt perfect There were a few concerns She then joked: I made about 35 double faults today, but everythings OKVenus Williams, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Sam Stosur also went out, meaning the womens event will have a first-time champion this year",5
"Williams, who had been hoping to win the tournament for the first time in the month of her 37th birthday and add to her seven grand slam titles, lost 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 to Timea Bacsinszky, the second year in a row the Swiss has beaten her in the fourth roundI think she just played really well, Williams said She had so many answers today I just give her credit for playing well every point, even in the first setCaroline Wozniacki, with two grand slam final appearances to her credit the most experienced player left, continued her fine year with a surprise 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 victory over the 2009 champion Kuznetsova",5
" Despite facing an opponent proficient on clay, which is not the Danes best surface, Wozniacki showed unexpected aggression on her forehand, matching her opponents tally of 26 winners Kuznetsova did not help her cause with 41 unforced errors Wozniacki next faces the Latvian teenager Jelena Ostapenko, who knocked out Stosur 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 to reach her first quarter-final",3
"Four third-round matches were carried over from Saturday, and the top-five seeds Karolina Pliskova and Elina Svitolina went through",1
 The Croatian qualifier Petra Martic defeated the No17 seed Anastasija Sevastova while Vernica Cepede Royg of Paraguay reached the fourth round for the first timeMichael Carrick paid tribute to the Old Trafford crowd for supporting his testimonial but his Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney may have bade farewell,2
"Carrick marked 11 years at the club with a match to benefit his charitable foundation in front of 70,027 fans and, while the midfielder will be around for another 12 months after signing a contract extension, fans may have witnessed Rooneys final appearance in a Red Devils shirtHe played the entire first half and the final 17 minutes of the second and in that time the clubs all-time leading goalscorer, who has fallen out of favour with the manager, Jos Mourinho, and appears destined to leave this summer, lobbed one early effort on to the roof of the netWhile Rooney could be excused to some degree, having flown back from a family holiday in Barbados to play in the friendly, it was perhaps indicative of his current situation that he did not particularly stand out in the company of a host of long-retired former professionals At the final whistle he gave a quick wave to fans before heading down the tunnelCarrick, who saw a deft first-half chip drift wide of the angle of crossbar and post, scored the equaliser in a 2-2 draw draw eight minutes from time before departing to a standing ovation",5
Despite more than a decade at United the pre-match team sheet somehow managed to spell the main mans name wrong  he was originally listed as Carrtick before the error was quickly corrected The names of Clarence Seedorf and Harry Redknapp were also spelt incorrectlySpot the error,5
#MUFC pictwittercom/o5UZAsgsPyCarrick offered his condolences to the families and friends of victims of the London attacks on Saturday and those in Manchester a fortnight ago,3
"Kick-off for the game was brought forward so as not to clash with the One Love Manchester concert being held at the neighbouring cricket ground later in the evening, in aid of the those affected by the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena on 22May which killed 22 people",1
"A number of victims families were in the Old Trafford crowd, as were about 300 members of the emergency services who dealt with the aftermath of the atrocityObviously this game has extra significance in the wake of what has happened in the last two weeks, said Carrick, who laid floral tributes before a minutes silence for victims of both attacks",2
Id like to extend my condolences to those affected by the events in Manchester and also those in London My heart goes out to all those affected and my message is stay together and stay strongOn my behalf Id like to welcome some of the families of the victims,3
 Id also like to welcome about 300 of the emergency services who were heroic in their efforts in the last couple of weeksRegarding the testimonial he said: The atmosphere was incredible,2
 There was no way I could have hoped for anything like this I know we get full houses here every week but it is not something I take for granted and to get so many here today is sensational,2
I have to thank the fans for their support Lets not forget were back here next season to try to win some more trophies,2
"And finally a thank you to Sir Alex [Ferguson], the man who brought me to the clubWe all know how great he is and his achievements at the club but hes been a massive influence on my career Thanks very much boss",3
"The former Lazio, Barcelona and Middlesbrough midfielder Gaizka Mendietas 22nd-minute goal was cancelled out by Nemanja Vidics header for the Manchester United 08 XI before the half-hour Midway through the second half Robbie Keane put the All-Stars XI ahead only for Carrick to have the final wordITV has joined Britains bookmakers in celebration after the 40-1 success of Wings Of Eagles in the Investec Derby at Epsom Viewing figures for the channels coverage of the Classic showed clear improvement on those recorded by Channel 4 last yearITV Racings coverage drew a peak audience of 1",5
"7m viewers for the race at 430pm on Saturday, versus a peak of 1374m for Channel 4s broadcast in 2016 ITVs peak figure was also better than any of those recorded by C4 during its four-year contract to cover the race between 2013 and 2016  but well below the 33m peak achieved by BBC Sport in the final year of its contract in 2012",5
"The average audience for ITVs coverage was 820,000, an increase of around 30% on the figure of 628,000 in 2016, while ITVs audience share of 113% was also the highest for the Classic since 2012",2
This years Derby was one of the most open races for many years and Wings Of Eagles was the biggest outsider to win since the 1970s and the first winner at double-figure odds since 1998,1
"The colts unexpected success under the little-known jockey Padraig Beggy, allied to the improved viewing figures for the race, also suggest that racings finances should receive an unexpected boost from the outcome, since bookmakers contributions to the sport via a reformed Levy system are linked to their gross profit",1
"The Derby is normally the third-biggest betting race of the year, after the Grand National and Cheltenham Gold Cup, and a large field in which Cracksman, with Frankie Dettori aboard, started favourite at 7-2 is likely to have produced strong turnover",1
"Cracksman, who was having only the third start of his career, ran in snatches before staying on in the final quarter-mile to finish third behind Wings Of Eagles and Cliffs Of Moher, the apparent first string in Aidan OBriens six runners in the raceOBrien said on Sunday that the first two horses home could go their separate ways for their next starts, with Wings Of Eagles a possible runner in the Irish Derby at The Curragh on 1 July while Cliffs Of Moher drops back to a mile-and-a-quarter in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park a week laterThey seem to be fine, OBrien said Obviously they havent done much today but they seem to be fine so farWe might have a look at the Irish Derby with Wings Of Eagles and its possible we might have a look at the Eclipse with Cliffs Of Moher, but were not sure yet",5
" It will be a week or 10 days before we decide anything but thats what we are thinking at the momentWings Of Eagles was OBriens sixth Derby winner at Epsom but the trainer has yet to win the French equivalent at Chantilly and his blank will extend for at least another 12 months after his three runners in Sundays renewal of the Prix du Jockey Club finished unplaced behind the favourite, BrametotBrametot took the French 2,000 Guineas at Deauville last month and was a 7-4 chance to follow up on Sunday but his prospects did not look good in the early stages of the race as Cristian Demuro sat at the back of the field after a slow start",3
"Demuros mount made some progress from the rear as the race developed but still had plenty of ground to make up as the 12 runners turned for home The colt did not hit the front until the final stride, beating Andr Fabres Waldgeist by a short head with Recoletos in third Bay Of Poets, from Charlie Applebys yard in Newmarket, fared best of the three British-trained runners in seventh, while William Haggass Rivet, last years Racing Post Trophy winner, was eighth",3
"No winner of the French Derby has gone on to win the Prix de lArc de Triomphe in October since the distance of the Classic was reduced to 10 furlongs in 2005 Brametot is top-priced at 10-1 to become the first to do so, in a market headed by Almanzor, last years French Derby winner, at 6-1David Dandy Nicholls, the trainer whose exploits with sprinters over the last quarter of a century had earned him the nickname the sprint king, has died at the age of 61",3
" He saddled six Group One winners in his career, including Continent in the July Cup at Newmarket in 2002 and Ya Malak  with his wife Alex in the saddle  in the 1997 Nunthorpe Stakes at York, and won almost all the Flat seasons major sprint handicaps at least onceNicholls began his racing career as a jockey, recording more than 400 winners and forming a brilliant partnership with Soba, a filly who won 11 races in 1982 including the Stewards Cup at GoodwoodRetiring from the saddle and turning his attention to training in 1992, Nicholls soon established a reputation for finding improvement in other trainers cast-offs, and apparently exposed sprinters in particular",3
Ya Malak was a prime example of Nichollss ability to spot a bargain,1
" The gelding was bought as a five-year-old having shown occasional glimpses of serious ability for Pip Payne and Ian Balding  and dead-heated for the Group One Nunthorpe less than a year later, making his rider the first woman to win a race at the highest level in BritainNicholls saddled Bahamian Pirate to win the same race in 2004, while Continent, originally trained for Prince Khalid Abdullahs Juddmonte operation in France, took the Ayr Gold Cup in 2001 and then two Group One events the following season after being bought by Nicholls for 40,000 guineas Continent was eventually retired at the age of 11 with career earnings of almost 450,000In all, Nicholls took the Ayr Gold Cup six times, and the Stewards Cup on three occasions Redford, a useful horse on a 15-race losing streak, took the Ayr handicap in impressive style barely a month after joining the Nicholls stable, while Regal Parade, a 425,000gns yearling, joined the yard for 16,000gns before winning the Ayr Gold Cup, a handicap at Royal Ascot and the Group 1 Haydock Sprint Cup",5
"Nicholls announced in March that he was closing his training operation due to financial problems He was also due to stand trial in August on two charges of sexual assault, relating to incidents at his yard near Thirsk He denied the chargesAdrian Nicholls, the trainers son and former stable jockey, said on Sunday that his father passed away in his sleep at home this morning Hed been battling a few problems of late",5
"Everybody knows in racing what he did He was a very good jockey and an even better trainer and probably an even better dad His record speaks for itself There are a few other people snapping at his heels to take the sprint king title, but theyll be doing well to do what he didLeicester2",5

"10 West Drive 740 Ice Age 810 Open Wide 840 Arsenio LupinYorkshires Roses victory came with the minimum of fuss On day three they clinically swept away Lancashires last six wickets for 68, then knocked off the required 60 for a 10-wicket win",5
" From start to finish we dominated was the succinct and entirely accurate assessment of Andrew Gale, their coach Whisper it, but this performance, which takes Yorkshire within two points of the leaders, Essex, was reminiscent of those seen when they won twin titles under Gales captaincyOn a pitch full of juice  one of the best Ive seen at Headingley, Gale said, before lamenting that it would probably be rated average under the England and Wales Cricket Boards grading system  they had bowled relentlessly throughout, did not shell a chance (a welcome change from recent games) and in Adam Lyths battling century, achieved the games only score of more than 50 If I could show the academy a video of how to bat at Headingley, that would be it, Gale said of LythThe bowling on the third morning was almost as excellent as it had been on the first, when they dismissed Lancashire for 123",5
" As good as youll see in county cricket, Gale added with a grinRyan Sidebottom, now 39 and who every Yorkshireman should be begging not to retire, had Dane Vilas caught at slip, then Ben Coad had Shiv Chanderpaul edging behind, all before Lancashire had a lead Coad had dismissed their prize scalps, Haseeb Hameed and Chanderpaul, twice each and ended with eight wickets in the matchRyan McLaren and Jordan Clark ensured Yorkshire would bat again, putting on 48, before Tim Bresnan made his first major contribution He took three wickets in 16 balls and Sidebottom got rid of Tom Bailey, all caught by the wicketkeeper or cordon (like 22 of the matchs 30 wickets), to ensure the target remained so low that sweat would not be broken",5
"Indeed it was not With 21 runs required for victory off they went for lunch, perhaps because there was a do being thrown for former Yorkshire players  having not given them an inch all match they generously invited a few Lancastrians,too",2
What remained was a formality as Lyth and Alex Lees milked Lancashires spinners  who were bowling to avoid the loss of points because of their poor over-rate  with any semblance of intensity gone; even Hameed served up three overs,1
" Eventually, Lees grew bored and carted Steven Croft wide of mid-on to put Lancashire out of their misery",1
"They had been playing catch-up since choosing to toss, then bat On a pitch that would have suited him down to the ground, Glen Chapple, the coach, was adamant that it was the performance, not the captains call, that cost them The quality of our bowling did not match theirs",3
" We have to take that on the chin, he saidChapple said the return from injury of Jimmy Anderson, who was bowling at about 50% before play, is coming on very well and added that he is a fast healer, though not fast enough to face Middlesex at Southport on Friday, alasJonathan Trott was in Birmingham on Saturday, sorting out a family issue",3
" When he returned to the Ageas Bowl on Sunday, he was confronted with another problem: Warwickshire had tumbled to 49 for six in response to Hampshires 515There remain few better at burrowing out of a crisis and, from No8, he made his 43rd first-class century but could not avert the follow-on Thirteen balls into Warwickshires second innings, which they began 261 behind, he was back in With the openers, Ian Westwood and Andrew Umeed, falling cheaply, he and his skipper, Ian Bell, put on an unbroken 66 They closed still 186 runs behind but Trott, with 17 from 58 balls, had shown his team the way",5
"First time round Trott shared 32 with the nightwatchman, Grant Thornton, and 104 with Keith Barker, who made 63 Finally there was the 54 across 20 overs with the last man Sunny Singh, which delayed tea and brought a second batting point",2
" Trott eventually fell lbw to one that stayed low from Kyle Abbott, first ball after tea, but he was not gone for long",1
"The only team below Warwickshire, Somerset, toiled manfully against Middlesex at Lords but the hosts avoided the follow-on late on, ending 298 for seven with Adam Voges also having retired hurt for 86 Somerset lead by 132, and require something remarkable to earn their first winAt Hove, Worcestershire put on 215 for the first wicket, with Daryl Mitchell making his third hundred in as many matches, only to be bowled out for 312, and forced to follow-on by Sussex",3
" Jofra Archer took four wickets and Vernon Philander three, including his 500th in first-class cricket",1
" Mitchell, again, held Worcestershire together, making his sixth half-century in six innings, but they closed 143 behind with six wickets in hand, having lost 14 for 221Nottinghamshire head into the final day against Derbyshire 179 ahead with four wickets in hand, seeking to extend their advantage at the top of Division Two Samit Patels first half-century of the season carried them to 313 for six",3
"Cameron Steel made his maiden first-class century, brought up with a six as winless Durham made 376 against Northamptonshire, for whom Mohammad Azharullah took five for 72",1
" That left Northants requiring 205 to win and Paul Coughlin immediately dismissed Max Holden as they closed 44 for one If the weather allows, a thrilling final day awaitsAfter six years away cricket made a welcome return to the BBCs television schedules last week with highlights of the opening match of the Champions Trophy between England and Bangladesh Shown on BBC2 at 1120pm on Thursday night due to contractual restrictions that dictate the programme can only start once Skys coverage is off air, it attracted barely 200,000 viewers, according to early estimates, at a time when most people have already turnedin for the night",5
"Those who wanted to catch up with the abandoned match between Australia and New Zealand on Friday had to wait even longer  25 minutes into Saturday  in what appears to be a spectacularly bad piece of scheduling at a time when the England and Wales Cricket Board is desperate to increase participation among young peopleThe ECB may point to more than 500,000 views of the replay clips available on the BBC websiteas evidence that interest in the game is still alive and well, although it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to convince the national broadcaster to outbid potential offers from the Discovery Channel, ITV and Channel5 for a slice of the ECBs fiveyear rights deal for English cricketfrom 2020, which will be decided later onthis monthIt is now almost two decades since the BBCs 61-year exclusive coverage of home Tests came to an end with a 10-wicket victory for a Muttiah Muralitharan-inspired Sri Lanka in a one-match series at TheOval in August 1998",3
" Within a year England had crashed out of their home World Cup in the group stages and sank to the bottom of the Test rankings with a series defeat against New Zealand  only the second time the Black Caps had tasted victory in a series on English soilWhile things have gradually improved for England since then, with Joe Root due to begin a new era as Test captain with the team ranked fourth-best in the world and Eoin Morgans side making an encouraging start to their latest attempt to win an International Cricket Council one-day tournament, participation has been in steady decline since the turn of the century The latest statistics, released last year, showed that only 278,600 people in the UK regularly played cricket  almost half of what it was 20 years ago",3
"It is hard to be certain just how much of the blame for this can be pinned on the absence of the sport from terrestrial television, although it seems likely that most children these days would struggle to recognise many of Englands top-order batsmen if they walked past them on the street That was not the case for previous generations, when even in the dire days of the 1990s players like RobinSmith and Graeme Hick were almost household namesMeanwhile the sport faces a challenge from Major League Baseball, which will host a Baseball Battlegrounds event in Hyde Park on 4July with a home-run derby and hopes to stage regularseason games in Europe from 2019",3
" This represents an exciting statement of intent, says MLBEuropes managing director, Charlie Hill",1
"Perhaps, following on from the innovation of Twenty20, crickets future lies in the shorter form The BBCs cricket accounts on Twitter and Facebook have been heavily pushing their clips service since the start of the Champions Trophy and the figures are expected to increase as the tournamentreaches its climax, especially if England progress past thegroup stages",2
"Just as with Saturdays Champions League final between Juventus and Real Madrid, which BTSport was obliged to stream for free on its YouTube channel despite having paid 12bn to renew its exclusive rights to footballs most prestigious club competition until 2021, there is a growing recognition among broadcasters that exposure is everything",2
" In other words, what is the point of shelling out a fortune when noone is actually watching? The increasing trend for viewers to search out illegal streamingservices as a way of evadingconstantly rising subscriptionfees shows the battle is already well under way",1
"While there appears little prospect of live Test cricket returning to terrestrial television for the time being, the divvying up of television rights for the new domestic T20 competition could be a game-changer",1
" Skys deal, worth 280m, expires in 2019 and the ECB has made it clear that it would prefer to sell at least one of the five packages of rights to a terrestrial broadcaster, with another reserved exclusively for digital content on socialmedia channels",1
"That would mean broadcasting around eight matches every season for free: enough, potentially, to attract some new fans to a competition that, it is hoped, will rival the Indian Premier League and Australias Big Bash Whether the BBC is the vehicle to spearhead crickets brave new era is a question that will be debated ferociously in the corridors of power at Lords over the coming weeks This article was amended on 4 June 2017 to correct the date and opponents in the last Test match to be televised live by the BBCEden Hazard has admitted he would consider an approach from Real Madrid and that he is yet to begin negotiations with Chelsea about extending his contract at Stamford Bridge",3
"The Belgium international still has three years to run on his 200,000-a-week contract at the Premier League champions but has been a longstanding target for Real, who won a third Champions League title in four seasons on Saturday night with victory over Juventus in Cardiff",1
" Five years to the day since Hazard confirmed he would be signing for the champions league winners [sic], the forward, who will miss Belgiums internationals against Czech Republic on Monday night and a World Cup qualifier against Estonia next week with an ankle injury, hinted for the first time he could leave Stamford Bridge",1
"The Belgian Football Association confirmed that Hazard fractured his right ankle during a training session in Tubize on Sunday, with the forward expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeksOf course I would consider it if Madrid made an offer, Hazard said I am keen to win trophies",3
 It would be great to win the Champions League,1
 But Chelseas goal is to win the Champions League as well Honestly I do not know what will happenI only know that I still have a contract with Chelsea for three seasons and that we just had an amazing 2016-17 campaign,3
 We want to continue on this path and want to build on this in the Champions League,1
 I am feeling very well at Chelsea But you never know what will happen I have not met the board yet to discuss a new deal,3
" Denied the forthcoming internationals, he added: I want to think about football as little as possible",1
Antonio Conte reiterated his desire to keep Hazard after he was instrumental in helping the Italian win the title in his first season in the Premier League but admitted that his future would depend on the will of the player,1
"I think Eden is very happy to stay in Chelsea, to stay with us and work with us, he said I can tell this",2
" But the future? I havent a crystal ball, no I think everything is possible Everything is possible in football and not only for Eden but for every single player",3
" You must understand that there are different wills to compare and then to take the decisionThe Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has previously expressed his interest in Hazard, who scored 16 goals in the league as Chelsea won a second title in three seasons But any move could potentially cost Real a world record fee in excess of the 100m Manchester United paid to sign Paul Pogba last summer",3
"Rory McIlroy has allayed fears over the rib problem which has disrupted his year by confirming he will be fit to participate in the USOpen next weekMcIlroy, who will be in pursuit of a fifth major title at Erin Hills, withdrew from recent events in the United States and Europe because of the injury which has troubled him since the start of 2017 That backdrop meant the questioning of whether or not he would feature in the USOpen but McIlroywho has been boosted by recuperation work during a fortnight at the five-star Quinta do Lago resort in Portugal, will return to competitive action on Thursday next week",3
"This marks a boost to the tournament as well as the Northern Irishman himself, especially after news that Phil Mickelson plans to skip the second major of the year to attend his daughters high school graduationI am ready for Erin Hills and looking forward to playing there for the first time, McIlroy, 28, said The last few weeks have obviously been frustrating  I never like to miss events either on the PGATour or European Tour  but it was important I got back to a level of fitness where I felt like I could give myself the best possible chance at the USOpen",3
"As I have said many times before, majors will ultimately determine my golf career but I have had the rest of this busy season to consider as wellEvery aspect of the facilities at Quinta do Lago has been first class",2
" I cant thank the people there enough for the way they have looked after me I have been able to work on fitness and golf without any distractions at allThis was McIlroys second such visit to the Algarve venue, where firstclass shortgame facilities meant he could attend to that aspect of his play even before hitting full shots this weekend In 2015, he spent time there after the ankle injury sustained when playing football which caused him to miss the Open Against all odds, McIlroy was back in action a matter of weeks later at the USPGA Championship",5
"The US Open, which McIlroy won in 2011, marks the start of a busy spell for the world No2 His charity foundation successfully hosts the Irish Open, which will be held in Portstewart before the Open and USPGA take place",2
" McIlroy is also the defending champion of the PGATours FedEx Cup, which finishes after themajorsInjury has not proven the sole McIlroy story of 2017; he was married in late April and signed an equipment deal with TaylorMade, worth $100m, on the eve of The Players Championship the followingmonth",2
"Mickelsons surprise decision  his daughter Amanda will graduate in San Diego on the same day as the USOpens first round  means he will have to wait at least another year to win the only major to thus far elude him We certainly understand and support that Phils family commitments are of paramount importance, the tournaments executive director, Mike Davis, said",2
"Alex Honnold has free-soloed El Capitan, completing a ropeless ascent of the legendary California cliff in just under four hours on Saturday morning, making the summit in time for breakfastThe 31-year-old rock climber is the first to achieve the feat and indeed was regarded as the only climber capable of attempting itAfter completing the climb, Honnold tweeted: So stoked to realize a life dream today, including a photo of himself ascending along a wide crack near the top of the route",3
"This is the moon landing of free-soloing, fellow climber Tommy Caldwell told National Geographic, which filmed the ascent for a documentary and first carried the news on its website",1
"Caldwell won fame outside the climbing world for his 2015 ascent with Kevin Jorgeson of El Capitans Dawn Wall route, setting a new standard of difficulty on the Yosemite valley cliffFree-soloing is the practice of climbing without a harness or rope, leaving zero margin for error The route Honnold climbed, known as Freerider, is 2,900ft tall and near the top of the ratings system for difficulty, at 5",3
"12d (6b UK)At multiple points on the route, Honnold was obliged to make off-balance moves on widely spaced holds the width of raisins, with hundreds, and then thousands, of feet of air beneath him",2
Honnolds preparation for the exploit was the subject of rumor even as it was written off as impossibly daunting and risky,1
" The Sacramento native, who has repeatedly shocked the climbing world with ropeless ascents of forbidding routes, had been discreetly training for the route for more than a yearHonnold backed off of an earlier attempt at a free-solo, last November, after judging conditions to be suboptimal He most recently climbed the route with a rope, and Caldwell as partner, on a Monday late last month",3
"Alex was on fire, Caldwell told National Geographic of the ascent Ive never seen him climbing so well",2
"Describing his preparations, Honnold said he had expanded his comfort zone until he was ready to commit to the routeYears ago, when I first mentally mapped out what it would mean to free-solo Freerider, there were half a dozen of pitches where I was like: Oh, thats a scary move and thats a really scary sequence, and that little slab, and that traverse, Honnold told National Geographic",2
"There were so many little sections where I thought Ugh  cringe But in the years since, Ive pushed my comfort zone and made it bigger and bigger until these objectives that seemed totally crazy eventually fell within the realm of the possible",2
Honnolds historic ascent began with the first hint of dawn at 532am on Saturday,2
" He reached the top three hours and 56 minutes later, at 928am Most roped ascents of El Capitan take hours, days, or longer",3
"The route was first ascended by a climber pulling only on stone  as opposed to pulling on gear drilled or cantilevered into the stone  in 1995, by the German climber Alex Huber",1
" Huber wore a harness and was attached to ropes that would have caught him had he fallen For much of its length, Freerider follows the Salathe Wall route, which was established in 1961 by the wall-climbing pioneer Royal Robbins, who died in MarchHonnold grew up in Sacramento and began climbing in the local training gym at age 11",3
" He dropped out of the University of California at Berkeley, where he had been studying engineering, at age 19, to commit to his climbing careerHis previous exploits have been widely documented One of his corporate sponsors, North Face, produced a 2014 film of his free-solo of the 2,500ft El Sendero Luminoso in Mexico",3
" A National Geographic film crew captured Honnolds revolutionary 2011 free-solo of the north-west face of Half Dome, in Yosemite, including a hair-raising moment of truth near the top in which Honnold struggled, uncharacteristically, to keep his coolAs his stature in the climbing world and beyond has grown over the last decade, Honnold has maintained an itinerant lifestyle, living in a converted van and traveling the world His training for Freerider took him to Europe, Morocco and China, according to National Geographic",3
 The climbers who trained with him were sworn to secrecy about the project,1
"On his 20th Champions League night, Zindine Zidane left with his second European Cup  as many as Pep Guardiola, Jos Mourinho or Sir Alex Ferguson It was way after midnight by the time Sergio Ramos carried it out of Cardiff and Zidane had already departed, slipping away quietly, pausing only to embrace the Juventus manager, Massimiliano Allegri, as he went",2
" As the Real Madrid players paraded the trophy around the pitch Zidane had stood aside with his wife, watching them, a fond look on his face The key is that they get on bloody brilliantly, he insisted Cristiano Ronaldo said: He believes in us",3
"Zidane had believed himself, too, quietly",1
" Now everyone does It has all happened so fast, history made swiftly",2
 At the side of the pitch he was asked if he was the best manager in the world,1
" Once that question might have been laughed at but in Cardiff it was legitimate It will be asked again, too, even as there are those who resist, clinging to his own line that it is all about the players No, Zidane said here",3
" Not that, noYet look what he and his team had just done, the men he had matched His Madrid had become the first team since Arrigo Sacchis Milan, 27 years earlier to defend the European CupNo one had done it in the Champions League era Zidane had done it in a season and a half",5
" Ramos had called it a date with history, which it was, even for the biggest, most successful club of all The next step is to mark a generation It might sound strange to talk about this as the start of something when Madrid have won three European Cups in four years  Gareth Bale admitting were getting used to this  but that is how it felt",3
" Perhaps because their manager is only just starting out But what a startWhen he was presented, hastily pushed on to the stage in January 2016 as Rafa Bentez was dragged off it never to be spoken about again, Zidane was asked what constituted success",3
" Winning everything, he replied",1
" In less than two seasons he has won two European Cups, the European Super Cup, the Club World Cup and the league title  Madrids first in five years",1
 They had waited 59 years to win a league and European Cup double,1
" No one expected this, not even Zidane, the man who says he has a star somewhere, guiding himZidane has empathised and encouraged rather than imposedEven if the promise had been made a long time before, this was not the way he anticipated it",2
" In the buildup to the final, the sports newspaper Marca recovered an old interview with Zidane, tagging it The Prophecy",1
" Conducted in 2002, just after his wonderful volley in Glasgow had given Madrid their ninth European Cup, Zidane said he wanted to win their 10th, 11th and 12th as well Eventually he has done so: it has taken 15 years, 17 months of them as manager",2
"A player in Glasgow, in Lisbon in 2014 he was Carlo Ancelottis assistant, while he led the team in Milan in 2016 and Cardiff this year Zidane the manager has been more successful even than Zidane the player Quietly does it",3
" That has always been his wayA former team-mate barely remembers him saying a word, describing him as shy, which is just one of the reasons why his success is unexpected",2
" Even as assistant players did not see it, one member of the side who won in Lisbon admits Yet the shyness was superficial and tranquillity has proven part of his successHe might not say much but when Zidane does, people listen  perhaps precisely because he does not say much",3
" It was always his personality, although get him alone and he is unexpectedly engaging, and now as a manager it is a conscious policy too: dont complicate it, dont overload A member of the coaching staff says messages expressed to footballers should be limited to two clear concepts; beyond that you lose them And as for long video sessions, forget it",3
"Zidane is familiar with footballers, attuned to their attitudes and concerns, especially at this elite level He has made it about them, always; he wants them to be themselves, to feel important, but he has to guide them",2
This is especially so when it comes to Ronaldo,1
" No one has connected with him quite like this or convinced him to take a step back like this before, preparing and protecting him like this Asked who would be the star if he had played with Ronaldo, Zidane replied: I could play quite well but him for sure He scores goals and thats the hardest thing of all",3
" In Cardiff, Ronaldo scored two, as he has often of late The manager has been intelligent, the forward saidZidane has empathised and encouraged rather than imposed",3
 Bentez tried to stop Luka Modric playing those passes with the outside of the foot; Zidane offered up his admiration instead,1
" But he has adjusted, too Modric said after the final: He tells us what we need to do in the defensive part and in the game to express ourselves, to keep the ball, to play for the team and to try to do our best If he can see something that we can do on the pitch, he tells us",3
" He also explained how, at half-time, Zidane told his team to push higher up the pitch, demanding they be more aggressive",1
" [The turnaround] was definitely the mister, Modric added",1
"That aggression is part of it, part of Zidane",1
" There was always a presence about him, a quiet authority It came with the player he was but also the man he is and the coach he wanted to be The apparent timidity hid a toughness to which others testify, a competitiveness",3
" A sense of honour, too  this is a man who publicly spoke out against Marine Le Pen, whom Jacques Chirac called a man of heart and conviction As a footballer people said he was effortless but that was not a description he shared or welcomed",2
 He saw himself as a competitor,1
" Im not there to perform, Im there to win, he said",1
"After his retirement as a player, Zidane remained connected to Madrid For everything he symbolised  the clubs president, Florentino Prez, described him as the most emblematic signing he had ever made  he was useful to have around However he was given roles that were largely empty and did not fulfil him  so he went his own way He wanted to do something real His word",5
" He wanted to winDespite Saturday nights showpiece in Cardiff, the season is not quite over yet",2
" A round of internationals can be found tagged on almost apologetically next weekend, with England involved in a World Cup qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow on Saturday before a friendly in France takes place three days laterA return to France will inevitably evoke memories of another tired tournament campaign coming to an even more cataclysmic end than usual with defeat by Iceland, though it might be more positive to reflect on how much has changed since then When England take on Scotland it will be a year since Euro 2016 kicked off, with France overcoming a stubborn Romania through a late Dimitri Payet goal",3
" Payet was still a West Ham player at the time, and when he scored his next goal a proud Slaven Bilic climbed on the desk in the ITV studio set to express his excitementOn 10 June last year Roy Hodgson was still England manager, about to be frustrated the following day by a 1-1 draw with Russia, Wayne Rooney was still captain, Gareth Southgate was in charge of the under-21s and Sam Allardyce had last been seen dancing the night away in Marbella in celebration of Sunderlands Premier League survival",2
"When it all began to unravel last summer things happened so fast it is hard to believe England are now on their second manager since the tournament ended, and even more ludicrous to consider that Allardyce has had three different employers in the same timeframe, doing as solid a job for Crystal Palace as he had done for Sunderland but crucially bungling the big opportunity in the middle It seems odd that Allardyce is now ostensibly out of the game, his England potential untested, while a manager with a far less impressive club record is learning on the job, though at least Southgates enthusiasm for keynote speaking, pints of wine and making a large amount of money for just a few hours work is unlikely to prove his undoingResults might, but so far England have been making smooth progress",3
" At the half way stage in World Cup qualifying they are four points clear at the top of Group F, the only side still unbeaten, with two of the trickier away trips  Slovakia and Slovenia already out of the way In theory, those games ought to prove the most difficult in what is far from the toughest of groups, though Scotland away will always be uncomfortable for England, even if Gordon Strachans side are in fourth place with two wins from five games",2
" This could reasonably be regarded as Southgates biggest test to date and that should be borne in mind when evaluating the quiet yet determined way in which the manager has gone about his jobPerhaps dropping Rooney was an easy decision, given his limited number of games for Manchester United and his relatively muted impact when played, though Southgate made sure he left the door open for the future It is possible that Rooney might find some form with a run of games for a different club next season and should that happen there would be no obstacle to a return",3
"Southgate would simply do the sensible thing, just as he did when recalling and then keeping faith with Jermain Defoe Despite the age of each player and the perceived closeness to retirement Defoe has been playing more games than Rooney and proving more effective on the pitch so he deserves to be in the squadAt the other end of the age scale Southgate was right to stick to his guns over Marcus Rashford, who made it to Euro 2016 and does not need a return to the under-21s after establishing himself in Uniteds first team Jos Mourinho did not want his player with the under-21s for a tournament in Poland anyway but, as Southgate says, the decision on internationals who could still be important parts of the England setup in 10 years time has to be that of the England manager Somebody has to protect him, somebody has to manage the development of a young player, and that has to be my call, Southgate pointed out",5
"Marcus is in the senior squad on merit, and has been for a year",1
 His performances warrant him being in the senior squad He could still have gone with the under-21s afterwards but that would not be right,2
 He is a 19-year-old player who has had an exceptional season but by that point he will be close to 60 matches,1
"Southgate is also correct in saying Rashford is not the only England forward in good form  Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Defoe have had strong seasons  and with Dele Alli, Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling to choose from in the support positions Scotland must be quite worried about how to contain the English attacking threat",1
"With few exceptions, now that the obligation to use Rooney in the starting lineup has been sidestepped, England travel to Scotland with a young yet experienced squad, full of players who have been performing consistently well for their clubs As such times managing a national team can look simple, and perhaps it is, though there is an art to keeping things simple and not being distracted by peripheral considerations",2
 Allarcyce could tell Southgate all about that,1
"Most of the previous England managers would tell him what he already knows, that he will stand or fall by tournament performances rather than results in qualifying",1
" Yet looking back at what happened to his immediate predecessor Southgate can take heart At least he is likely to get to a tournamentAntoine Griezmann has pledged his immediate future to Atltico Madrid, saying it would be a dirty move to leave the club after their transfer ban was upheldThe France forward, 26, had been heavily linked with a potential world-record transfer to Manchester United, but any such move is off after the court of arbitration for sport last week upheld a ban on the club registering new players in this transfer windowSpeaking on Sunday morning during the French television programme Telefoot, Griezmann said: The ruling of the CAS has come through",5
" Atltico cannot recruit With my sporting adviser, Eric Olhats, we decided to stay Its a hard time for the club",3
 It would be a dirty move to leave now,1
" We talked to the leaders and we will be back for next seasonAtltico, along with their city rivals Real Madrid, were handed two-window transfer bans in January 2016 for multiple breaches of global footballs rules on the registration of under-18s and both clubs failed in their appeals to Fifa last SeptemberThe two Spanish giants then took their cases to the CAS but, while Reals ban was halved to one transfer window in December, Atltico announced on Thursday that the only reduction they had been given was regarding their financial penalty  down from 720,000 to 440,000That leaves them unable to sign new players until the January window, ending the clubs bid to bring in the Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette, who was seen as a likely replacement for GriezmannGriezmann, who has a release clause in his contract set at 100m(87m), scored 26 goals in 53 appearances for Atltico this past season",5
"A test opening of St Petersburgs Zenit Arena in February treated 10,000 spectators to car racing, motorcycle tricks, dancers and a performing bear introduced as Russias greatest hero But the patriotic ceremony failed to note that the stadium, in which Russia kick off the Confederations Cup in a fortnight in preparation for next years World Cup, was built mostly by immigrant workers from Asia, including from one of the worlds most repressive countries, North KoreaA subcontractor who asked to remain anonymous said at least 190 downtrodden North Koreans had worked long hours with no days off between August and November last year and that one, a 47-year-old, had died on site These guys are afraid to speak to people They dont look at anyone",5
" Theyre like prisoners of war, the subcontractor said",1
"An employee of a North Korean state company that brings workers to Russia told the Observer at a St Petersburg construction site that the men often worked long hours and had to give part of their pay to the regime in Pyongyang to facilitate the countrys defence, which includes its nuclear weapons programme",1
"Tens of thousands of North Korean labourers in Russia work in often slave-like conditions, according to Marzuki Darusman, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea The companies that hire them become complicit in an unacceptable system of forced labour, he saidAlthough a law passed in Russia in 2013 exempts employers connected with the World Cup from much of the countrys labour regulations, the North Koreans work at the stadium calls into question Fifas and Moscows commitment to human rights in the preparations for the tournament In a blanket statement in response to questions about the use of North Korean labour, Fifa told the Observer it monitored conditions for migrant workers and would continue to follow up any allegations made with regards to human rights violationsThe St Petersburg construction committee said the authorities had conducted regular inspections to make sure conditions at the Zenit Arena site met Russian labour laws",5
" But according to the subcontractor, North Koreans at the site worked at least 11 hours a day for $10-$15, seven days a week",1
" They not only earned less than other migrant workers but lived in more cramped conditions, six to eight workers sharing one construction caravan",1
"The North Korean had died from a heart attack, the subcontractor said",1
 He added that fatigue was a danger,1
" When you lose your reaction time due to fatigue, you can get hurt out of the blue, just like that",1
"While Russias World Cup preparations have not had the same number of fatalities as those for the 2022 competition in Qatar, where hundreds of migrant workers have been killed during a huge construction boom, the Observer found in 2015 that at least five workers had died in accidents at the Zenit Arena The subcontractor said another five had died between August and December 2016, including the North Korean",2
"Allegations of exploitation of North Korean workers are only the latest chapter in the spotted history of the Zenit Arena When St Petersburg started planning a new stadium in 2006 for Zenit, the project was scheduled to finish by the end of 2008 and cost 67bn roubles (92m at todays exchange rate) As construction finally neared its end almost a decade later, the citys vice-governor, Igor Albin, said the cost of the 68,000-seat venue had risen more than sixfold to 43bn roublesThe actual cost is very likely to be much higher  owing to corruption, mismanagement and fluctuations in the exchange rate  making it one of the most expensive stadiums per seat in the world, according to Dmitry Sukharev, a former construction worker who heads the St Petersburg branch of the global anti-corruption NGO Transparency International",5
" The St Petersburg construction committee did not respond to a request for comment about costsDespite the huge spending, Fifa reportedly found last year that the Zenit Arenas removable pitch did not meet its shock absorption standards Vladimir Putin is said to have told Fifas president, Gianni Infantino, that the stadiums scandal-ridden construction was a very sad story and promised that all defects would be fixed",3
" After the city fired the general contractor last July over delays and cost overruns, the vice-governor Albin managed to gather more than 4,000 workers at the site for a final push to finish it That is when three companies brought in North Korean workers, the subcontractor said",2
"Pyongyang has been exporting manpower to Russia since Soviet times, including to logging camps in Russias far east In testimony provided to the Observer, Choi Myong-bok, a refugee who escaped a logging camp in the Amur region in 2002, said the camp was a living hell, it was an open-air prison, wardens watched us around the clock",2
" He said he lived in inhumane conditions in crowded construction caravans infested by lice and bedbugs and subsisted on melted snow, rice, salt and whatever mushrooms and berries he could gather",1
"Pyongyang earns up to $23bn (18bn) a year sending workers such as Choi abroad, mostly to China and Russia",3
" This is despite UN sanctions meant to deprive it of foreign currency for developing nuclear weapons Moscow has recently signed agreements with Pyongyang to increase trade and employment of North Korean workers at agricultural and timber operations According to the federal migration service, 30,000 North Koreans were estimated to be in Russia as of 2015Last year the two governments signed a treaty to extradite citizens who illegally enter either country, an agreement condemned by the UN as a mechanism to send North Korean workers who seek asylum back to face torture or death But only a handful have sought asylum",5
" They all have families and if one runs away then it wouldnt be good for his family, because its a communist order there, like we had under Stalin, said Maria Trush, the administrator of a branch of Apart Hostel, a five-storey dormitory in an industrial zone outside St Petersburg close to where a North Korean subcontractor has an officeTrush has been housing construction workers on and off for the past five years",2
" She said the North Koreans typically worked like ants, starting at 8am and ending at 11pm In the little free time they had, they watched North Korean state television or dubbed Soviet filmsMalsar Khuseinov, the director of Soyuz-Stroi, a construction company that employs 200 North Koreans, said workers were allowed to extend the work day as much as they need to meet a deadline",3
" Pyongyang commands and controls them through captains on the ground, he said They have the right kind of discipline, he said, adding that it was out of the question that any of them would run awayAnother construction firm, Dalpiterstroi, employed 60 North Koreans at the Zenit Arena, the companys PR and advertising director, Anna Bochenkova, said",3
" But they worked eight, not 11, hours a day, and she denied allegations of low pay and overcrowded construction caravans They work in good conditions with standard pay, like all workers on St Petersburg construction sites, at market price, and have good living conditions, she said",2
Bochenkova said she could not comment on the North Korean worker who died but denied it could have been caused by overwork,1
" A person can die from a heart attack just walking down the street anywhere in the world, she said",1
"On a recent night in the suburb of Shushary, this reporter found a two-storey, metal-sided dormitory where North Korean workers live in a large cluster of similar housing A man preparing food in the small, low kitchen immediately made a call on his cellphone and within minutes a well-dressed man who gave his name only as Choi arrived He said he was a translator for the North Korean state company that brings workers to Russia",3
"Thirty-two men lived in the Shushary dormitory, he said, and another 100 were working in the suburb of Pargolovo A North Korean fell to his death from a nine-storey building there in June, Choi confirmed",2
" The men are sent to Russia for five years, work 12 hours a day with two hours for lunch, rest on weekends, and make 50,000-60,000 roubles a month (685-825), of which they give 5%-10% to the Pyongyang government, he saidNearby, a group of North Korean workers were still pouring concrete on the 22nd storey of a residential tower at 1030pm",3
" When asked, one of them at the base of the tower said he made 50,000 to 60,000 roubles a month A security guard quickly ended the conversation",2
"The Observer also ran into Choi and another worker on a muddy track between the dormitories and the building sites The worker said he started each day around 830am or 9am and carried on until 7pm or 8pm, with two hours for lunch That day, a delayed batch of concrete had pushed work later, he said I came to see this city, which is beautiful and famous around the world, he said, adding that he had worked in Russia since 2014",5
"Asked how much he made, he also said 50,000 to 60,000 roubles a month The conversation was cut short by security guards who briefly detained this reporter in a construction trailerThe Norwegian football magazine Josimar recently found another group of about 100 North Koreans who were living in construction caravans and working long hours at another Dalpiterstroi site, surrounded by barbed wire and guards with dogs",3
"In reality, the workers are likely to make far less than the figures they cite as the Pyongyang regime takes 30%-50% of their income, according to Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert Nevertheless, working abroad was one of the few ways for North Koreans to improve their financial situation, he added",2
"While there are many exceptions to the standard 40-hour week stipulated in Russias labour code, working at least 10 hours a day for most of five years, like the North Koreans said they do, would violate the law, two lawyers told this newspaperLast week it emerged that Infantino had admitted that Fifa was aware of the issues In a letter dated 22 May to Nordic FA presidents who had raised the issue, he said: Fifa is aware of and firmly condemns the often appalling labour conditions under which North Korean workers are employed in various countries around the world He acknowledged that an inspection team for Fifas decent work monitoring system, set up to address concerns about human rights abuses, did find strong evidence for the presence of North Korean workers on the construction site in St Petersburg on a visit in November The issues found were subsequently raised with the respective company and with the general contractor, Infantino wrote",5
" Fifa said a further inspection in March found no more North Koreans working at the siteAccording to Svetlana Gannushkina, a veteran migrant rights activist who helps North Korean refugees, the authorities rarely raise any questions about these workers The rights of people working on our territory should be respected, no matter who their overlords are, but this isnt done, she said",3
" Its an area of complete lawlessnessGianluigi Buffon stood with his hands on his hips, staring vacantly into the distance and not moving for what felt like an age Behind him the Real Madrid supporters were raucously celebrating their third goal and their second in the space of three minutes, flooring Juventus and leaving Buffon looking like a man who knew that the dream was over long before the clock had ticked downThis was anything but the perfect finale Buffon had talked about 24 hours earlier, when the 39-year-old expressed his hope that he would get his hands on the only major trophy to elude him in a distinguished career that has spanned three decades Buffon has won eight Serie A titles, a World Cup in 2006 and represented Italy 168 times, yet there is no Champions League winners medal in his trophy cabinet and, realistically, probably never will be",5
"It was an evening that brought with it an uncomfortable sense of deja vu for Buffon and Juventus, who have now lost seven of their nine European Cup finals and could be forgiven for fearing the worst whenever they get to this stage of the competition Buffon has appeared in three of those showpieces and the latest ended in humiliating fashion as Real Madrid demonstrated once again why they are the most accomplished team in Europe by a distanceIn one respect Buffon was proved right",3
" Asked beforehand whether this would come down to a contest between himself and Cristiano Ronaldo, the Juventus goalkeeper replied: Im not so conceited as to say that, I would never put myself on the same pedestal as Cristiano Ronaldo My role is to defend; we are complete opposites",2
 He is able to determine the outcome of a game more than me,1
That was certainly the case as Ronaldo struck Madrids first goal and inflicted further damage with his second,1
" Casemiro and Marco Asensio got the other Madrid goals on a night when Buffon was beaten four times, twice via deflections It was that kind of occasion for the veteran goalkeeper and his team-mates, who totally lost their way in the second half as Luka Modric and Toni Kroos took control of midfield and Ronaldo does what he does bestWhat a transformation from the opening 45 minutes, when Juventus took the game to Madrid, attacking with conviction and scoring a goal worthy of winning the Champions League, let alone merely equalising in a final",3
"Unfortunately for Mario Mandzukic, the spectacular overhead kick that he speared beyond Keylor Navas, the Madrid keeper, at the end of a lovely move involving Gonzalo Higuan and Alex Sandro, brought only ephemeral joy",1
" Juventus could not sustain that high-tempo approach after the intervalPaulo Dybala, who scored twice in the quarter-final win over Barcelona and is so highly regarded, never imposed himself on the game and was withdrawn",2
"Higuan, other than the assist for Mandzukics goal, carried little threat, while the influence of Sami Khedira and Miralem Pjanic, who was also substituted in the second half after picking up an injury, started to waneThe sight of Juan Cuadrado receiving a red card in the 84th minute for a second bookable offence rather summed up the second half It was a poor decision from the officials, with Sergio Ramos not for the first time in his career guilty of play-acting, yet by that stage everything Juventus tried to do seemed to be going wrong",3
The solid defensive base on which this Champions League campaign has been built evaporated Juventus conceded more times in 90 minutes against Madrid than they did in the previous 12 matches in the competition put together as the Old Ladys experienced back-line started to look their age,2
"It was impossible not to feel some sympathy for Buffon, who trudged across with the rest of the players to applaud the Juventus supporters that had stayed behind as Sergio Ramos hoisted the European Cup into the Cardiff sky Buffon has been an extraordinary servant to Juve, the club he joined for a world record 51m in 2001 to replace Edwin van der Sar, and it will be a strange day when someone else is wearing that No1 jersey for the club that have dominated Italian football for the past six seasonsIt feels like he has been around forever When Buffon made his debut as a professional footballer in 1995, George Weah and Roberto Baggio were lining up for Milan against him, two legends of the game who are now in their fifties He has clocked up more than 1,000 games since, including 108 appearances in the Champions League, and is the only player in this Juventus squad to also have featured in the defeat against Milan on penalties in the 2003 final",5
"Although Massimiliano Allegri left the door open to the possibility of Buffon trying again next season, with the Juventus manager refusing to accept the idea that several players in his team have reached the end of a cycle and that it is time to usher in a new era, age and history appear to be against the Italian goalkeeper Perhaps that was going through his mind when he stood alone on his penalty area after Madrids third goal",2
"Ive always wondered why anyone would want to race cars or motorbikes on the road A normal, narrow country road lined with brick walls, hedges, telegraph poles and iron gates; road furniture as its known in racing circles That need for speed is something Ive experienced both on bikes and in cars, but Ive always opted for the soft option of a purpose-built track with width and run-off areasDuring two decades of working in motor sport, Ive been gripped by road racing  the countless laps of on-board footage, the absolute speed and the imminent danger Ive also been lucky to build great friendships with riders like John McGuinness, the legendary Isle of Man TT racer, and others who have turned their backs on the soft option to embrace the road",5
"But until April, Id never actually been to a road race So I was a novice spectator at the Cookstown 100  a 2",2
"1-mile circuit in County Tyrone that forms one date of a 10-race season with five tracks each side of the border Id heard about three female riders  Melissa Kennedy, Veronika Hankocyova and Yvonne Montgomery  who are at the heart of this male-dominated sport and when the BBC asked me to do a fly-on-the-wall on how and why they do it, I jumped at the chanceSet just outside Cookstown, the paddock is as grassroots as you can get",3
" It was essentially a field of dogs, vans, tents and plenty of bikes, but youre immediately struck by the overwhelming friendliness and family vibe that comes from this hardened bunch of riders",1
 The place is lit by smiles and I instantly felt adopted,1
" For the weekend I was part of the gang They let me in, each family, each tent holding its own storyOne of the starkest aspects was seeing up close how, as amateurs, these riders have to fund everything themselves and how in many cases it takes over their lives They all work full-time and rely on good-natured bosses to take the odd extra Friday off to go racing Some bosses get it, some dont, and as a result not everyone gets to race every weekend",5
Pretty much all their cash goes into it,1
 Take Yvonne,1
 She wont get her nails done because that equates to a can of fuel,1
" Its those kinds of choices that these riders are making to follow their passion But in truth, it turned out that this was probably the least extraordinary thing about YvonneWhen I met her, she was in her leathers waiting for the call for her class She races both 400cc and 600cc bikes and her crew consists of one friend Incredibly, she hadnt turned a wheel on a bike until she was 47, only taking it up following the break-up of her marriage",5
 Within a year she was racing That was 13 years ago and she celebrates her 60th birthday in August,2
" I know she wont mind me headlining this; shes adamant that as you get older you should do more because youre running out of time Its hard to argue with thatNot that you could ever have a cross word with Yvonne, her soft Irish lilt is as enchanting as her personality Im addicted, she says Shes also the happiest she has ever been",5
Yvonne reminds me of someone: Valentino Rossi The nine-times world champion who is also a racing addict,2
" He loves winning Its what he lives for He and Yvonne are leagues apart in many ways and yet identical when it comes to the force that drives them To race any bike, in any discipline, you have to be passionate and want to do itThat passion is evident in the paddock at Cookstown",5
" It couldnt be more different from the MotoGP set-up of Mugello in the rolling Tuscan hills when it comes to backdrop and facilities, but they are equally matched on desire and the love of racing One is the sharp end, dripping in sponsor money, flashy hospitality and top-notch technology The other is as raw as racing can beVeronika drives her truck from her home in Prague with her fiance, Indi, so that they can both partake Theyve fallen in love with Northern Ireland and made it their second home",5
" Like the rest of the field, their lives are dominated by the need to get to these races The 32-yearold Veronika tells me they feel most alive when they are racing and despite being together for nearly a decade, it keeps them too busy to getmarried",2
But the dangers of road racing are ever-present and the fragility of flying down country lanes at speeds of up to 200mph is real here Five years earlier at this same event Indi broke his back in a crash We chat as Veronika watches him qualify and she is more terrified looking on than racing herself,3
" I can understand from the point of it being beyond her control Ive seen the same nerves throughout the World Superbike and MotoGP paddock from mums, wives and girlfriends the worldoverI ask Melissa, a 25-year-old from just outside Enniskillen in the west of Northern Ireland, if its selfish She nods Her mum, Letitia, has kittens every time she goes out",5
" I feel for Letitia when Melissa races her Moto3 bike, she is 4ft 11in and the rest of the field dwarf her in size and strength",1
 But she is a demon when the visor comes down I find myself wanting her to do well,2
" This is Melissas MotoGP; this is her chance to do what she loves She gets that, her family does too and thats what mattersto her",2
"Personally, I still cant totally understand why they do it I couldnt But I have a huge respect for these riders",3
 They take dedication to another level,1
" They operate under the most incredible pressures on the mind and body, making big sacrifices to ensure they can get back on the bike and do it all over again the following week",1
"In a world where things are becoming increasingly sanitised, Im heartened that this freedom of choice can still happen despite the danger Of course its dangerous, all motor sport is, but road racing comes with its own special danger The roads are narrow and the walls are close, but equally this provides the thrill for those who choose to take part and those lucky enough to watch them in action",3
Suzi Perrys Queens of the Road will be shown on Monday at 730pm on BBC OneThere is no better time for an honest review than after a flawed victory,2
 England have a win under their belts against Bangladesh and by 6pm on Thursday it was all reassuringly straightforward But earlier there had been disconcerting moments and some of them took place before the match began,2
"The first ones came with the teamsheet Might Jake Ball become the new Gary Ballance? These two are very worthy cricketers But in the 2015 World Cup the selection of an out-of-form Ballance for Englands first match came to personify the insecure safety-first instincts that were to bedevil the side throughout that (much longer) campaignAt the Oval the pitch was brown, true and slow There was not much there for the pace bowlers, yet England chose five of them with Ball preferred to Adil Rashid",5
" This hinted at a lack of self-belief, which, to be fair, has not been a characteristic of Eoin Morgans clear-sighted regime since that calamitous World Cup",1
 This was a surprise since Rashid had been selected for 41 of Englands past 44 ODI matches,1
 The conditions demanded variety rather than a battery of five right-handed pace bowlers plus Moeen Ali,1
" For Englands most important match in 45 ODIs, they declined to pick their wrist-spinner (Mind you, Bangladesh were equally cautious when deciding to omit their specialist spinner, Mehedi Hasan, who gave England such a roasting in two Tests in the winter)So this suggested that England do not have absolute faith in Rashid, who, according to his self-effacing spin partner, Moeen, has many more variations and is therefore a more likely wicket-taker",2
" Morgan keeps telling us that he is always chasing wickets: for the record Moeen has 47 in 55 matches, Rashid 63 in 46However, the preference for Ball rather than Rashid probably reflected a greater lack of faith in the fitness of some of Englands bowlers, which was subsequently justified Ben Stokes has had all the attention and out of necessity he was compelled to propel seven overs on Thursday",3
" But Chris Woakes, who had missed Englands last two ODIs, could manage just two before his left side was strained, the only two overs he will bowl in the Champions Trophy Was Woakes compensating in his delivery stride because of his recent thigh problem? We will never know Now Ball may become a legitimate selectionPerhaps there has been an element of wish fulfilment in Englands assessment of the fitness of Stokes and Woakes They are Englands engine room, two all-rounders near their peak; vital players long since inked into the best side",5
" Why would you not be desperate for them to play?This yearning stretches to Andrew Strauss, Englands cricket director, who gave this pair permission for an extended stay in the Indian Premier League They were first choices in their teams, unlike Morgan or Jason Roy, so they were kept busy",2
 Both are adamant that the Indian experience has enhanced them as cricketers,1
 But both are battling with their bodies,1
" Is that merely an unlucky coincidence? Something for Strauss to ponderThat wish fulfilment may also extend to Roy, who has reached double figures once (when scoring 20 against Ireland at Lords) in six ODIs this summer Morgans faith in Roy is admirable and almost absolute  he has hinted that he would keep picking the Surrey opener in this tournament come what may However, such faith cannot last indefinitely; soon it may border on superstitionTo replace Roy with Jonny Bairstow (albeit an inexperienced opener) would not be another Ballance moment betraying a loss of faith in Englands oft-quoted positive approach",5
" Bairstow may have a different technique to Roy but his approach is similar To use a couple of old-fashioned adjectives, seldom used now, he is strong rather than stableAgainst better attacks than that of Bangladesh, England might need a full quota of batsmen as well as the bowlers most likely to conjure up some wickets on true tracks In tournament cricket the short-term goals prevail; showing the faith and being consistent by backing your chosen men has to give way to picking the bloke likely to score the most runs at some point Roys rope may not extend beyond the New Zealand game if he remains in his trough",5
"Still, England produced a rather better performance than when they last encountered Bangladesh in an ICC tournament in Adelaide (defeat by 15 runs and an early flight home in 2015) It will be trickier in Cardiff on Tuesday against the Kiwis Surely they were the Antipodeans at Edgbaston who were denied victory by the rain on FridayNew Zealand always seem undaunted when playing against their noisy neighbours and they are unlikely to be overawed by the prospect of facing England Against Australia, they tossed in Luke Ronchi, a wildcard, as an opening batsman; Kane Williamson became the tournaments second centurion after Joe Root  the cream is already coming to the surface  and in a brief period in the field their trio of pace bowlers demonstrated the benefits of bowling with genuine hostility at the start",5
" They are not compromising their modern, aggressive approachThe Edgbaston no result means that one more victory for England in Group A  either against the Kiwis or Australia on Saturday  will allow Morgans side a passage into the semifinalsIn the spring of 2005, the first postcards arrived",3
" Theyll be ready, the cards read, are you? Soon after, wristbands came, sent by special delivery They had Power of Four written on them, which, it turned out, was the official motto of the 2005 British & Irish Lions tour It was all part of Clive Woodwards grand plan",3
" Woodward had spent 12 months scheming and made no apologies for believing this is the best-prepared tour in the history of Lions rugbyThe last card he sent out had What The Fuck Is Going On? written on the front, and if you feel like this in any meeting, hold up the card  overleaf",2
 It turned out to be the most useful of the lot,1
" Within four months, Woodwards hard-earned reputation was shot, and the Lions had been whitewashed for the first time in five tours",1
"Between them, Ian McGeechan and Warren Gatland have spent a lot of time in the past 12 years unpicking the mistakes Woodward made and putting the Lions back together again Even now, Gatland says the Lions mission in New Zealand this summer is to go there and mend some stuff from 2005, that he wants his squad to engage with the community, to play some good rugby, to get the public on our side, and to be great tourists All things they failed to do 12 years agoWoodward picked 44 players and 28 support staff, including 10 coaches, a legal adviser, a former referee and, of course, Alastair Campbell as his head of media relations His attention to detail was remorseless, said Gareth Thomas",5
" The players were given iPods loaded with specially chosen songs, including the Lions own new anthem Woodward expected everyone to learn the words by the time they arrived in New Zealand McGeechan, an assistant coach, felt Woodward had overlooked one thing I kept asking Clive when we were going to talk rugby, when we were going to sit down to say: This is how we are going to beat the All BlacksFirst, the Lions had to play Argentina, in a match arranged to help cover the 10m cost of the tour",5
" The training sessions for the game were interrupted by a series of classes and seminars We were working on our questionable lineouts, recalled Lewis Moody The session was interrupted midway through because we had to attend a meeting with Alastair Campbell, to discuss how to deal with the media",3
" So 48 hours before taking on the Pumas an unprepared team working desperately hard to perfect their set-piece are told to attend media studiesThere was also a team-building class, in which the squad co-operated on a painting There was a fair amount of grumbling, Campbell wrote in his dairy, but when the whole thing was done, we had painted a giant mural with the logo and a sense of what we wanted the tour to be It was actually pretty breathtaking He was impressed",5
 Donncha OCallaghan wasnt It was basically colour by numbers It did nothing for me,3
" I had to draw a rhino in my corner of the canvas and I stuck a cigarette in his mouth There are, OCallaghan felt, two ways to bond a new group of players Neither involved murals Let them kick the shit out of each other on the training field or let them go out on the piss for a nightEddie OSullivan thought the tour already felt like a three-ring circus",5
" McGeechan was more diplomatic He described it as a brave attempt to update the Lions Either way, everyone agreed with Moodys verdict after the Lions had drawn with Argentina, 25-25 as Jonny Wilkinson kicked a penalty in the final minute I trudged off the pitch, with three Tests looming against an All Black side that were on fire, Moody wrote I couldnt help but think: Fuck, this is going to be difficult",5
"The Lions won their first game of the tour, against Bay of Plenty, but lost Lawrence Dallaglio, who flew home injured He was not the only player who felt his tour was over already Some guys would have a hard job playing themselves off the team, I didnt have that luxury, wrote Ronan OGara By half-time, OGara was sure his tour was done Why? Because I missed three tackles",5
 OGara suspected Woodward had made up his mind about the team long before they got to New Zealand His poor performance in the opening half made it easy to leave the Irish fly-half outWoodward had said there was no way you can dissect a tour party into two separate groups,3
 But that was exactly what he did,1
" This has never been done before, Brian ODriscoll wrote in his diary",1
" Soon enough well find out why The midweek team, who were being coached by McGeechan, adopted Traviss Driftwood as their own anthem  Were driftwood, floating with the Lions, we only play on Tuesdays, TuesdaysOn 11 June, the Lions lost to the New Zealand Maori 19-13",3
 It was Shane Williamss first game of the tour,1
" I got absolutely battered, Williams wrote I can remember thinking afterwards: My God, I hope all the games arent as physical as this",2
" Panic began to set in The coaches picked the guts of the Saturday team to play again against Wellington the following Wednesday After that, OCallaghan wrote, it was obvious to a lot of fellas that the XV for the first Test was already picked, probably before wed even left home",3
"In the run-up to the first Test, the midweek players found they were locked out of the video analysis room What did they think we were going to do? Sell our secrets to the All Blacks? OCallaghan asked There was an element of paranoia about the place that was uncomfortable",3
" The Lions surrounded their training ground with an 8ft tall fence Before one session, they had their security remove a group of schoolchildren from the ground We came across as arrogant, McGeechan thought, and it made the All Blacks and the country desperate for us to get beaten",3
"Meanwhile, Williams felt there were too many chiefs The coaches kept chopping and changing from one session to the next, with different people giving us different messages",2
" Wales had won the Grand Slam that spring, playing a very different way to the England team which had won the World Cup two years earlier, the difference epitomised in their two fly-halves, Stephen Jones and Wilkinson I had just won a Grand Slam with Wales and wanted to attack and play from anywhere, Jones wrote, while Jonny had won a World Cup with England by playing mistake-free rugby and to the strengths of a great pack",2
"Unable to pick one or the other, the coaches chose both, Jones at fly-half and Wilkinson at inside centre Which meant leaving out Gavin Henson According to Thomas, Campbell made a hamfisted attempt to manage the fall-out",3
" He distributed misleading quotes from Henson, and arranged to have a hidden photographer take shots of Clive and Gav, without their knowledge, to give the errant impression that all was well Campbell, Thomas said, had been parachuted in from a world with different parameters and principles and struggled with the nuances of a rugby dressing roomThe coaches paranoia peaked three days before the first Test, when they convinced themselves that they should junk all the teams lineout calls because they were worried about spies",3
" The upshot, Matt Dawson recalled, was that we went into the game with the most complex set of calls I have ever known, so complex that the players didnt understand them",1
" Two days before the first Test on supposedly the best organised of all Lions tours, no one knew where the ball was going",1
One thing the Lions had nailed down was how to handle the haka Woodward had sought advice on it from a Maori elder,2
" We spread out in a half-moon shape, with me out front as the leader and the youngest member, Dwayne Peel, standing behind me, recalled Brian ODriscoll When the haka ends, I pull up some grass and throw it at them, as if pulling the ground from underneath their feet Dawson, a substitute that day, remembered the All Blacks look at us with an expression that does not suggest gratitude at the respect we believe we have just paid to their heritage",3
"Forty seconds into the match, ODriscoll charged into a ruck",1
" The All Blacks hooker, Keven Mealamu, grabbed his left leg and the All Blacks captain, Tana Umaga, came in from the right Together they hoisted ODriscoll up and tipped him over",2
" ODriscoll stuck out an arm to break his fall, and broke his shoulder too",1
" Eleven minutes later, Paul OConnell, pumped up on a specially brewed energy drink, was sent to the sin-bin, and seven minutes after that Richard Hill wrecked his anterior cruciate ligament, and was carried off to join ODriscoll",1
" The game soon became what Thomas called the damage limitation exercise from hellThe conditions were atrocious, wrote Jason Robinson, the rain was falling horizontally and it was blowing a gale Thomas was as cold as I have ever been on a rugby field",3
" My hands were numb and I had a single thought frozen in my brain: Lets get off here, and assess where we are Inside, Wilkinson was desperate We are cannon fodder",3
 Its helpless I get so frustrated and very fired up,2
" I start looking for big hits everywhere, whether they are on or not, to try and change the game",1
 I dont know how else we are going to achieve anything It was the first time he had ever felt so helpless on a rugby fieldThe Lions lost 21-3,3
" In the aftermath, all anyone wanted to talk about was the injury to ODriscoll The Lions liked it that way",2
" Campbell showed reporters video footage of the incident in slow-mo The citing officer decided that Mealamu and Umaga had done nothing wrong, but did ban Danny Grewcock for biting Mealamu From this point to the end of the trip there is no other topic of conversation than how Brian was treated and how those responsible got away with it, Dawson said",3
 Every day we are briefed on what we should and should not say It becomes all encompassing and a distractionMcGeechan felt the Lions seemed to lose the moral high ground in the dispute when Campbell came out with a stream of statements and interviews,3
"ODriscoll gave a press conference early the next morning I dont possess the equanimity to take a pounding like that and say nothing, to put it down as part of the game Because it isnt, he wrote",3
" I describe it as deliberate foul play, dangerous, a cheap shot His team-mates agreed",2
" It was awful, unforgiveable, and duly swept under the carpet, Thomas wrote It was one of the worst home-town decisions I have ever seen",2
"Thomas took over as captain He felt the Lions were being derided as a bunch of spineless whingers, and that Woodwards decision to bring along a refereeing consultant and a legal adviser had spawned accusations of arrogance Campbell had put up a war wall of negative cuttings to motivate the players",3
" But after three days there the wall was overflowing and was taken down Under all the pressure, Thomas was worried the natural cracks and fissures were starting to show And the fact each player had his own room was making it worseTheir rooms became bunkers almost, wrote OSullivan Before the tour, the joke had been that the one problem the Lions would not suffer from was loneliness",5
 But Paul OConnell found it to be one of the loneliest experiences of his career,1
" He holed up on his own, and even started smoking Until that tour I hadnt smoked one in years",2
 I was brushing my teeth six or seven times a day: I wanted to brush away the smell of smoke,1
" I wasnt getting a whole lot out of the tour and I remember thinking there might be one benefit when it was over At least I might have white teeth by the end of this fucking tripMorale flatlined when Woodward allowed Campbell to give a team talk For reasons known only to Alastair, he thinks it is a good idea to compare our tour of duty with that of soldiers in Iraq, recalled Dawson He suggests we lack desire and tries to use the example of a theatre of war to put our situation into perspective",5
" As OConnell recalled it, Campbell told us that in every campaign and every crisis, there comes a moment when the people in the thick of it realise they need to dig deep but that he didnt get that feeling looking at us",1
" He didnt have the sense that we were fighting backEveryones expression is one of disbelief I am getting angry inside, Dawson wrote",3
 At the end we are bristling According to OSullivan: You could have heard a pin drop The speech was lunacy,3
" The next morning, OConnell was still stewing on it I decided what I was going to do when the session was over: find Alastair Campbell and knock him out There wouldnt be any need for questions or explanations",3
 Everyone would know what it was forThomas tried to bring the team together in his own way They called him Captain Clean Off,3
 As in clean off his head,1
" A lot of the guys from other countries, Williams reckoned, probably hadnt experienced leadership like it in their livesDuring one particularly bleak training session the day before the second Test, Thomas called everyone into a huddle Just got two words to sum up our situation at present: Dont fucking panic, he said He waited a beat, then realised, Shit, thats three isnt it? Unfortunately, Thomas put it, I also lost count of the score the following dayHe scored the first try of the second Test, and, as Williams put it, for a couple of minutes, we felt that they were beatable",5
" The All Blacks won 48-18 It didnt feel like a collective loss, wrote OCallaghan Nobody was thinking about the giant painting back at the Vale of Glamorgan and the unity it was supposed to bring",3
" Thomas went postal and launched himself into a post-match bender which resulted in a two-day hangoverThe midweek team, meanwhile, won every game But their success only seemed to make everything worse Thomas heard the midweek players were resentful that they had not been rewarded with a shot in the Test series OCallaghan pointedly observed that there was a feeling of unity and togetherness in our group which was reflected in the results",5
McGeechan felt that the Lions had become something we were not Moody agreed,2
" Clive treated it like a business, a well-oiled machine, he wrote, but old school methods, at least to a degree, are essential on a Lions tour",1
"Not everyone bought that OSullivan, who had one eye on the top job for the 2009 tour, was sick of hearing about it The Midweek Massive was a myth, reckoned OSullivan",3
 Bullshit,1
" They were beating teams that amounted to little more than a Kathy Berry XV and trying to hold it up as some kind of higher calling than being part of the Test side To me, this became more toxic as the tour went on",2
 I said it to people The Wednesday side would beat the likes of Manawatu by 103 points and celebrate it as some kind of Herculean deed,2
It was certainly nearer to it than anything the Test team managed They lost the last game 38-19,2
" In the end, Moody reckoned, I felt as if we were a pub team getting hammeredWoodward gave a bizarre final press conference, in which he said its actually been a successful tour, and has been great experience After that, the team left New Zealand in drips and drabs, rather than as a team, wrote Thomas There were no heartfelt goodbyes, or reaffirmations of faith But there was, Williams wrote, a real sense of relief that the tour was over",5
"Each man had his own opinion about what had gone wrong I dont think we ever stood a chance, thought Dawson",2
" Williams wrote: We had no answer for what they threw at us, and that was not only a shedload of skill and physicality, but a pride I had never previously encountered There was no way they were going to allow a British & Irish Lions team to come to their territory and winOConnell was closest to the mark when he said we came across an excellent side and we never became the team we needed to be",3
" The one thing everyone agreed on was that, as Thomas put it, all the wristbands and postcards in the world couldnt prepare us for the intensity of it",1
"Predators coach Peter Laviolette heard all the questions and criticism of Pekka Rinne after the goaltenders struggles in the Stanley Cup Final in Pittsburgh Well, Laviolette never thought of switching goaliesA change of scenery helped Rinne and all his Nashville teammates as they dominated once again on their own ice for the biggest piece of franchise history yet",3
"A victory in the Stanley Cup finalRoman Josi and Frederick Gaudreau scored 42 seconds apart in the second period, and the Predators beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 5-1 Saturday night to pull within 2-1 in the best-of-seven series",2
" Rinne started and made 27 saves against a Pittsburgh team that continued to struggle on the power play and lacked the same zip they had in winning the first two games at homeThere was no decision, Laviolette said of changing goalies",2
 He was terrific I said that after Game 2 Hes been the backbone for our team,3
 Hes been excellent,1
 His game tonight was rock solid,1
"PK Subban and Sidney Crosby also exchanged words in third period Afterwards the Predators star revealed the reasons why He told me my breath smelled, but I mean, I dont know, I used Listerine before the game, Subban told NBCs Pierre McGuire after the game",3
" So I dont know what hes talking aboutThe Predators capped the biggest party in Nashville history with a victory that gave thousands of fans inside and outside of the arena reason to celebrate Country star Keith Urban and wife, actress Nicole Kidman, were high-fiving inside the arena and they had plenty of company",3
" Credit Rinne for coming through with a stingy performance and helping the Predators improve to 8-1 at home this postseasonThe 6-foot-5 Finn looked so shaky in the first two games, giving up eight goals on just 36 shots Laviolette benched him in the third period of Game 2 when Rinne gave up three goals in the first 3:28 of a 4-1 loss",3
"Rinne said he changed nothing and knew he was playing all the time Nashville fans did their best to lift his spirits by chanting his name in pre-game warm-upsCollectively we came into the locker room, and we were telling each other weve never seen anything like that, Rinne saidJosi also had two assists James Neal, Craig Smith and Mattias Ekholm also scored for Nashville as the Predators worked out some frustration against the Pens",5
"Like our team has done the whole playoffs against Chicago, St Louis, Anaheim, we showed really good composure, said Subban, who had predicted a win in Game 3 Were going to take that into the next gameGame 4 is Monday nightPittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said he thought his Penguins gave up a couple of easy goals",5
"Were disappointed we didnt get the result, but we also understand that this is a series, Sullivan said Our guys, theyve been through this They can draw on their experience",3
" Were not going to let this certainly get us down Were going to learn from it, move by it and get ready for the next gameCrosby did not have a shot on goal, and neither did Evgeni MalkinHopefully a game like this is something thats a hard lesson, Crosby said But weve got to make sure were better",5

"The Predators got it started with a three-goal flurry in the secondJosi scored his sixth goal off a slap shot at 5:51, tying it at 1-1 and finally giving nervous fans something to enjoy",2
" Then Gaudreau, who scored his first career NHL goal in Game 1, scored 42 seconds later to put Nashville ahead with his wrister from the high slot, taking advantage of a screen by Penguins defenseman Ian Cole to beat Murray glove-side",1
"Just after that go-ahead goal, the Penguins had a rush on Rinne, and the three-time Vezina Trophy finalist made back-to-back big saves",1
" First, he stopped Phil Kessels wrister from the right circle The rebound bounced back into the slot, and Rinne made a save on Chris Kunitz with an assist from Subban sliding over to helpNeal made it 3-1 with 22",3
"6 seconds left in the second, banking the puck off Murrays left arm for his first goal in the series and sixth of the playoffs Smiths goal on a breakaway at 4:54 was his first of the playoffs, and Ekholm padded the lead with a power-play goal with 6:50 leftWe played some good hockey in those first two games, just a couple little breakdowns and they jumped all over us and it was in the back of the net, Neal said",3
" It was a good job of limiting that tonightAs for Rinne, Neal added: We felt we left him out to dry a few times in the last game I thought we did a better job tonight",3
"Smith is the 18th different Nashville player to score a goal this postseason, and Ekholm became the 19th",1

" During the second half of the match loud bangs led to a sudden rush in the middle of the crowd, causing a surge that flung people against barriers",1
"Many were trampled as people began to run out of the centre of the square, screaming in fear The stampede may been started by the explosion of a loud firecracker that was mistaken for a bomb, some witnesses suggestedI heard an explosion, which must have been a huge firecracker, a witness told La Stampa, one of Italys daily newspapers",3
" However, another suggested it may have been the result of a security barrier falling over",1
"They shouted, theres a bomb, evacuate the square, a member of the audience told the paper So we ran away",2
" There were people on the ground, and blood and glass everywhereOne of the fans, who was caught next to the barriers, said: I felt I was being lifted up",2
" It was terribleAlthough initially police said 200 people needed hospital treatment, the Italian news agency Ansa later put the figure at 1,527, using hospital talliesMost of the injured were treated for cuts and light contusions, but three people, including a seven-year-old boy, were reportedly in a serious condition",3
"The root cause of this was panic, said the local official Renato Saccone Well have to wait a while to understand what triggered it",2
"In a statement, local authorities said the crowd was seized by panic and by the psychosis of a terror attack fearing that the loud noise was caused by attackersShoes and bags littered the ground in the aftermath of the stampede, and people were seen limping and searching desperately for friends and relatives Police have set up an information point to help people find their loved ones, and are now investigating what caused the panic",3
"I saw the entire piazza went in the direction next to the screen to escape, all in a panic, Brian Hendrie, an Associated Press reporter, said They ran, fell on the ground on the glass He said some reported having heard a small explosion, others a shot I heard five or six different versions It sparked a panic",5
"Within minutes, dazed fans in Juves black-and-white jerseys returned and milled about the piazza amid the broken bottles and rubbish littering the cobblestones, with the match largely forgotten",1
"Verletzte in Turin! - Panik beim Public Viewing https://tco/IS7rZC7qGySome injuries occurred after a railing around the entrance to the underground parking beneath the square gave way under the weight of the crushLocal media cited older Juventus fans saying the panic had evoked painful memories of the 1985 Heysel disaster in which 39 mostly Italian fans died when fans were crushed by a collapsing wall before the start of that years European Cup final, against Liverpool",3
"The mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, who had returned from watching the Champions League legends match in Cardiff, held a meeting with police on Sunday morningShe was then due to visit the local hospital where the seven-year-old boy was being treated",2
" His condition, which includes injuries to his head and torso, was described as serious but stableFollowing the stampede, Appendino tweeted: Im shocked at what happened in Piazza San Carlo in Turin",2
" Were monitoring the situation minute by minuteZinedine Zidane hailed an historic day for Real Madrid as the Spanish champions became the first club to retain the Champions League with an emphatic 4-1 victory over Juventus, on a night when Cristiano Ronaldo wrote his name into the record books with another two goalsRonaldo became the first player to score in three Champions League finals and took his tally of career goals to 600 with a man-of-the-match performance against a Juventus side that started brightly but badly lost their way in the second half Mario Mandzukic equalised for the Italian side with a spectacular overhead kick after Ronaldo had put Madrid ahead but the complexion of the game changed after the intervalMadrid scored twice in three minutes through Casemiro and Ronaldo, with Marco Asensio adding a fourth in the 90th minute after Juventus had been reduced to 10 men following Juan Cuadrados harsh dismissal",5
" Zidane described Madrids second-half performance as spectacular and was thrilled that the club won the Spanish title and the European Cup in the same season for the first time since 1958 Incredibly, it is Madrids 12th European Cup in totalYou can say today is an historic day for all Madrid fans, for the players and for myself, Zidane said I feel extremely happy because the truth is its been a special year, you couldnt dream of anything better We won the league on the last day and we know its very difficult to win a Champions League final for the second year running  weve managed to do it",5
"Ronaldo, who was given his man-of-the-match award by Sir Alex Ferguson, pointed to his list of staggering career statistics when reminded that some people have criticised him in the recent past and also suggested that, at the age of 32, he feels as good as he has ever doneWhat is important is that I did again, an amazing season, me and my team-mates won the double, said Ronaldo, who has now scored 108 goals in the Champions League",2
 I think the people dont have words to criticise because the numbers dont lie,1
" Im very happy, its one of the best moments in my career  I seem to say that every year My head is just a number I feel like a young boyZidane, who has presided over those back-to-back Champions League successes, admitted that Madrid struggled in the first half, when Juventus played with no shortage of belief We started with difficulties but I think in the second half we were clearly superior, the Madrid coach said",5
"We kept the ball, pressured higher up and physically I think we won the game there as well because of the determination we showed",1
"It turned into a chastening night for Juventus, who have now lost seven of their nine European Cup finals and five in succession Massimiliano Allegri, the Juventus manager, admitted his players were unable to respond mentally when Madrid regained the lead and also recognised the difference that Ronaldo made on the big occasion once againIn the first half we played beautifully, Allegri said",3
" In the second half Real Madrid pushed the accelerator and we remained too static and sat back too long We knew we were playing against a very strong team Its obvious that if somebody wins the Ballon dOr and scores so many goals its a big advantage for Real Madrid The only criticism I can make of my players is that after conceding the second goal we should have stayed in the game mentally to try to find solutions and equalise but we couldnt do thatAsked whether this was the end of an era for some of the Juventus players, Allegri replied: No, I dont think that Juventus has reached the end of a cycle",5
" [Gianluigi] Buffon will still be the Juventus goalkeeper next year, Andrea Barzagli will still be with us These players still have a lot to giveAustralian grand slam tennis great Margaret Court says that the US gay lobby is conspiring to strip her name from an Australian Open stadium",3
" Court, 74, and now a Christian pastor, has been criticised for her condemnation of same-sex marriage and for saying that tennis is full of lesbiansAnother grand slam champion, Martina Navratilova, says that Court has revealed herself to be a homophobe and that the stadium should be renamed in Evonne Goolagongs honourNavratilova, a lesbian herself, has a point  theres no disputing that Court has been making bizarre remarks, even making reference to Nazis",3
" Nor does Court seem to realise that if gay lobby means people who refuse to tolerate homophobia, then thats going to include heterosexuals, too",1
"The comment about tennis being full of lesbians says it all  do you ever hear anyone complaining that a sport is full of heterosexuals? How are young sporty girls, whatever their sexuality, supposed to deal with this? Its said that the Wimbledon tournament may have faced calls to ban Court had she been attending this year (she isnt) In the light of these events, perhaps something needs to be done anyway",2
"Just when you thought it might be all about the man its never about, it was about the man its always about In the buildup to this final, Casemiro had insisted that hes there to plug holes, claiming that it is robbing the ball, not scoring goals, that brings him pleasure, and yet he had just reached a higher plane, thumping in the shot that put Real Madrid back into the lead and looked set to bring the night in Cardiff to a close",2
" Three minutes later, though, another man stepped centre-stage",1
" Him, again Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro",2
"Never write him off, never say its over",1
 Dont even laugh when he says he wants to play beyond 40; listen instead He decides when it ends,2
" This season, more than any other season, well past 30, he has decided how it ends too In Cardiff, it ended in a way it has not for 59 years: with Real Madrid champions of Spain and Europe Although Marco Asensio added a late fourth, Ronaldos second was the moment Madrid knew they were the first team to defend the Champions League",3
"As Luka Modric went up the right just after the hour, Ronaldo dashed towards the near post and, when the ball came to him, he steered it first time past Gianluigi Buffon Ronaldo kept running, heading towards the same corner Casemiro had occupied just moments before, with the fans chanting: This is how Real Madrid win",2
" Recently, it has been too, more than ever before Ronaldo had opened the scoring; now he had the second, taking him to 12, one for each European Cup Madrid have won, and making him the first player to score in three finals",2
 It also made him the competitions top scorer for the sixth time,1
"That was appropriate, and yet for so long it had appeared impossible Some even wondered if it would ever be possible again How foolish we were Unknown to most, something had already happened to seek continuity In August, Zinedine Zidane spoke to Ronaldo",5
" The moment was perfect, two elements contributing: Ronaldo had just become a European champion with Portugal and he was injured For each of the last three seasons, he had struggled towards the finish line, which was something that his coach wanted to avoid Zidane had devised a plan; now he presented it Here at the Millennium Stadium, that plan came togetherZidane convinced Ronaldo that there had to be more rest, more rotation, protecting him so that he could peak in the most important games",5
 It would also allow the 32-year-old to prolong his career Ronaldo had to take a step back occasionally and as the months passed the process was accelerated,2
" Of Madrids final seven away games in the league, Ronaldo sat out four It worked At full time here, he was named man of the match, a European Cup winner for the third time with Madrid",3
" He had been the image of the last two finals, sure, but not in truth decisive, as he was here",1
"Weve been intelligent, Ronaldo would say I have been saving myself: it is these games when titles are decided",2
" When he played, he decided He had just two goals in the competition, none since the autumn, when Madrid headed into the quarter-final against Bayern Munich By the time he arrived here, he was on 10 He left with two more and another trophy Two hat-tricks and eight goals were scored across four games against the Germans and then Atltico, two more against Juventus",5
" He also scored the goal that clinched Madrids first league title in five years, with his sixth in the final four gamesRonaldo has evolved, becoming more of a No9, a striker whose movement is more honed With every passing year, the stats confirm the sensations: he is dribbling less, covering less distance",3
" But he is astute and deadly: this season he has taken fewer shots for each goal than ever before The opener here was an example: once, the striker might have slipped the ball wide for him to burst into the area; this time, he was the striker, slipping it wide and showing for the return",2
" Carvajals cutback was hit, like so many of Ronaldos goals, first timeHe leapt and drew down his arms, as he does  a celebration seen often, copied by five-year-olds everywhere",2
 One that was destined to be repeated when he got his second,1
" Like the first, it was turned in first time Another night, another final, another goal More astonishing, more impressive, even than those previous nights",3
" His best of all at the end of a career that was already barely believable More records falling: the first player to reach 100 goals in the Champions League was the competitions top scorer for a record sixth timeThis was different, though",3
 Different and better,1
 This is Ronaldos worst goalscoring season in seven years,1
" The thing is, his worst is pretty much everyone elses best  over the last six seasons he scored 51, 61, 51, 55, 60 and 53 goals, while this was only his 41st  and then theres the fact that his year has quality over quantity",1
" It is not simply how many goals Ronaldo scores that matters, although there are many of them, it is which goals",1
" Bayern, Atltico, Juventus Quarters, semis, final It might have felt like his moment had gone but when the moment arrived so did he",3
 Him again,1
6 Gianluigi Buffon Unlucky with deflections for two of the goals and had similarly scant chance for the others Champions League success remains elusive6 Andrea Barzagli The veteran looked comfortable before the break but became stretched later on and was replaced by Cuadrado as Juve chased the game,3
"7 Leonardo Bonucci Supreme 60-yard ball to Sandro began the move for Mandzukics goal, but his tiny deflection had already helped Ronaldo beat Buffon6 Giorgio Chiellini Uncompromising as ever but it was not enough and, as Juve lost control of the game, he and his defensive colleagues became flustered",2
"7 Dani Alves Ageless performance for the most part, with one superb tackle on Ronaldo, but could not match his semi-final influence going forward6 Miralem Pjanic Tested Navas with a crisp low drive early on and helped run the midfield during the opening period but his influence faded as Real improved Booked",3
7 Sami Khedira Cruel deflection took Casemiros blast beyond Buffon and changed the games dynamic Consummate and authoritative until then,2
7 Alex Sandro Pinpoint volleyed cross from the byline brought the equaliser Dangerous down the left throughout and almost pulled a late goal back Booked6 Paulo Dybala Twinkling feet caused problems in the space between midfield and defence at times but he rarely got into areas that could really hurt Real Booked,5
"8 Mario Mandzukic His overhead volley was one of the great Champions League final goals and will be replayed for years; it will, though, be scant consolation6 Gonzalo Higuan Astute set-up for Mandzukic, having threatened earlier on, but was subdued after a good start and his hex in major finals continues",2
"SubstitutesJuan Cuadrado 3 (for Barzagli, 66): Even if Ramos made the most of their contact it was some achievement to be booked twice having been brought on to make an impactClaudio Marchisio 5 (for Pjanic, 71): Juve had long since lost the midfield when he arrived and there was little change thereafter6 Keylor Navas Three early saves included a fine one-handed stop from Pjanic",2
" Could do little about Mandzukics goal and was rarely troubled after that7 Dani Carvajal Laid on the opener and, despite being up against the impressive Sandro, generally stood solid defensively Suspect hamstring held up well",3
" Booked7 Sergio Ramos Involved, not very tastefully, in Cuadrados red card and was booked himself earlier on But if you lose the edge, you lose the winner that he is",2
" Booked7 Raphal Varane Had a more comfortable night than seemed likely at the start, with a lot of the play in front of him One good first-half block from Higuan",2
8 Marcelo Much more involved after the break and enjoyed himself as space began to open up,1
" Excellent run and centre to assist Asensios goal7 Luka Modric Came out for the second half looking a different player and, having warmed Buffons hands, crossed superbly for Ronaldo to make it 3-17 Casemiro Looked off the pace in the early stages and was lucky to go unpunished, but that will be forgotten after his decisive bolt from the blue8 Toni Kroos Opened up the pitch with the driving run that ultimately brought Ronaldos first goal Helped Real gain firm control of the midfield after half-time",5
 Booked7 Isco Began to knit moves together for Real after an anonymous opening spell Kept possession intelligently and carried the ball forward well7 Karim Benzema The striker was given little change around the penalty area but was involved in the move for the opener and worked tirelessly before going off,3
"9 Cristiano Ronaldo His first real involvement saw the ball end up in the net; his second finished similarly and capped a remarkable tournament from the 32-year-oldSubstitutesGareth Bale 6 (for Benzema, 77): Denied a fairytale goal in Cardiff by Bonuccis fine block shortly after coming onMarco Asensio 8 (for Isco, 82): Thrilling young talent who wasted little time in making an impact with a clinical finishlvaro Morata 6 (for Kroos, 89): Too little time to make a real impactA rugby tour to New Zealand is a bittersweet pleasure for every player There is nowhere better to test yourself but no more painful place on earth to lose This applies every bit as much to the provincial matches as the looming Test series Woe betide any naive Lions anticipating a low-key midweek hit-out against uninterested Kiwi opposition before the serious stuff begins",5
Even a cursory glance at the 2017 itinerary induces a shiver down the spine,1
" Starting with Wednesdays game against the Blues in Auckland, the Lions face perhaps the toughest midweek schedule ever compiled",1
" The Highlanders in Dunedin, the Chiefs in Hamilton and the Hurricanes in Wellington on successive Tuesday nights directly after Saturday fixtures against the Crusaders, the Maori All Blacks and New Zealand? Brutal does not even begin to describe it",1
When Warren Gatlands midweek Wales side played the Chiefs last year the home team romped to a 40-7 victory,1
" Gatland himself was a key member of the Waikato team that thumped the 1993 Lions by 38-10 Small wonder those set to feature against the Blues at Eden Park sense a difference in intensity compared with the early stages of the 2013 tour to Australia You just sense it from the whole organisation, says Conor Murray, the outstanding Irish scrum-half preparing to form a new half-back partnership with his current room-mate Dan Biggar",3
" There is an air around the place that theres something bigger coming than four years ago Thats the way it needs to be because the All Blacks are better than Australia were I think the coaches, players and staff are all aware its going to be a lot tougher  its going to be a hell of a few weeks",3
"If there is an upside it will not be long in coming: the selectors will swiftly find out who can cut it Murray, who started the 2013 tour behind Mike Phillips in the pecking order, suspects competition for Test places will be fiercer than normal as a result",2
 Last time round you had a feeling of the Test team after a couple of weeks whereas I dont think that will be the case this time I think were going to push each other right to the week of the announcement of the first Test teamMaybe Warren and the lads have a few ideas in their heads of combinations and people they may want to play but its just so tight it will probably come down to who goes better in the midweek games and the weekend games leading up to the Test,3
" Theres an air of red-hot competition which is greatThe impressive Munster No9 is still a slim-priced favourite to make the first-choice XV, having been Irelands guiding light in last autumns victory over the All Blacks in Chicago Strong yet dextrous, confident yet approachable, the 28-year-old has all the hallmarks of a key Test Lion but is presuming nothing: I think its OK to say you want to be the Test starter, that you want to play in the Tests, because theyre the games that are remembered",3
 But its going to be really tough to get into that team,1
 I think this squad is massively talented,1
 the Test team you could pick could beincredible,2
Jonathan Sexton will be prominent among those hoping the fit-again Murray comes steaming out of the blocks; an all-Irish half-back pairing in the opening Test would also help save Gatland and co precious training ground time,1
" If Owen Farrell or Biggar end up at 10 instead, an instant connection will have to be established in the most demanding of circumstances",1
" Its not necessarily about looking at videos, Murray says Its just about spending time chatting with these guys, getting to understand them and how they see the game of rugby Sporting telepathy tends not to be plucked out of thin air",3
"Knowing Sexton as he does, Murray also expects plenty of straight talking on the training pitch as the tour progresses I was talking to Dan about it All three fly-halves are pretty fiery and really competitive Youve three guys there that want to win all the time and if standards arent upheld they will let it be known theyre not happy It will be interesting to see what happens",5
 I am sure there will be a few barking orders over the next six weeks,1
"There is certainly no time for Murray and his Munster team-mates Peter OMahony and CJ Stander to dwell on their disappointing Pro12 final defeat to Scarlets If there were suspicions that a long, uniquely emotional season might just have caught up with them, all those unavailable for the pre-tour training camps in Wales and Ireland have been urged to set the recent past aside",2
" Weve spoken about the harsh nature of this tour, Murray saysFor the 11 of us guys who were involved in finals its just been about catching up Youre straight into looking at another goal with a group of players who hadnt lost a final so you cant afford to feel sorry for yourself For midweek dirt-trackers and Test contenders alike, there will be no respite from this Wednesday onwardsIf he had a cap for every week he has been banned, Dylan Hartley would still be a veteran, on 60",5
" As it is, the England captain  barring injury, Lions call-up or, perish the thought, suspension  is about to win caps 85 and 86 Had he been a good boy, he would be on 100-plus by now And he would be a Lion, certainly in 2013, possibly even nowRegrets? No, he says, quietly but firmly It doesnt define me",5
" Im OK with itIts hard to square any notion of a serial offender with the thoughtful and amusing interviewee Hartley has always been But for his reputation, he could, maybe should, have been England captain for most of his career",3
 He is relishing the chance to play that role to Englands young squad on their two-Test tour of Argentina and there wont be a thought about the LionsTheres no point dreaming or thinking about it All my focus is towards that first game [next Saturday] I dont want to get sidetracked by maybes I have had that many setbacks,5
 You just learn to say OK and move on I drew a line under [the Lions] straight away,2
"His record as England captain is enviable and interwoven with that remarkable unbeaten run with which Eddie Jones opened his term as coach Jones and Hartley seem to enjoy a certain chemistry, both of them hookers, both feisty, unconventional and intelligent",2
" That relationship has earned Hartley an opportunity to play his way into form that is rarely extended to players at this level The irony is that he was finally awarded the captaincy just as his status as Englands best hooker came under threat, just as injuries started to bite",2
"If the length of the season is a cause for concern, Hartley is relatively fresh and in form after a disrupted campaign",1
" He even played 80 minutes the other week, most unusual for a front-row forward",1
" I can do it, he says with a grin",1
 Just give me the chance,1
"He is set to continue his captaincy for the foreseeable future, subject to the usual provisos",1
" Therell only be changes if I dont get better Its in my hands, and Eddies made that very clear to meNext are these two Tests, in San Juan and Santa Fe, against Argentina, the side he made his first England start against  during the Lions tour of 2009 As ever, Argentina will challenge in Hartleys department, the front row, but these days they are just as adept at the running game Regular wins remain elusive for their Super Rugby side, the Jaguares, but they will benefit from a familiarity with each other that England, just like the Lions, are frantically trying to engineer",5
"England will build around a core of experience, led by Hartley with Chris Robshaw, Danny Care and Mike Brown, but beyond that some very young players are being introduced Nevertheless, Jones has insisted that some of their recent training has eclipsed what they did in the Six NationsIts the youngsters, says Hartley",3
 Theyre driving it Before they came into camp they knew the expectation and they are certainly delivering,2
 I rang all of them I got a lot of yes sir and thank you sir from the Curry boys,2
 I worked out how old they were afterwardsThe twins from Sale turn 19 between the two Tests,2
" Ben was picked on the bench for the Barbarians game last Sunday but had to pull out, so Tom stepped up, came on early and was man of the match",1
" No one knows which twin is which, but then no one knows a lot of these players",1
"It is certainly a new dynamic and Hartley appears to love being the grown-up in the middle of it allIt ended, as it so often does, with that familiar smile Cristiano Ronaldo  gelled hair, dazzling teeth, magic in his boots  will never forget the night he scored the 600th goal of an almost implausible careerIt was the moment everyone knew the Champions League trophy was on its way back to the Bernabu and, once again, that the four-times Ballon dOr winner had left his imprint on anotherfinalRonaldo had scored twice on another exultant night when he also leapfrogged Lionel Messi to announce himself as the competitions leading scorer for the fifth season running",5
" He will enjoy that, too, but the real prize here was to be part of a side that have now lifted European footballs most coveted silverware three times in four seasons Cardiff 2017 will fit neatly with Milan 2016 and Lisbon 2014 whereas, for Juventus, this was a familiar story of regret and hurtThis was their seventh defeat out of nine finals, including five in a row, and the second half was a chastening experience for the Serie A champions, culminating in them sieving more goals in one match than in the rest of the competition put together",3
" It was a full-on collapse and, by the end, the players in black and white stripes looked in need of smelling saltsIt was certainly rare to see a Juventus team lose their way so badly bearing in mind it was 1-1 at the break and, if anything, Massimiliano Allegris players had looked the more rounded side Yet the second half was a dreadful ordeal for the team from Turin and all those supporters who had held up thousands of black and white cards before kick-off to spell: The Time is Now",3
" Yes, Juve were unfortunate, in the extreme, with the deflected goal from Casemiro that gave Madrid a 2-1 lead just after the hour From that point onwards, however, it was staggering to see a team renowned for defensive structure crumple this way",2
"Juves indignities in that period also featured a sending-off for Juan Cuadrado, one of their substitutes, and a late goal from Marco Asensio when the thousands of Madridistas were already going through their victory songs Gareth Bale, deemed too short of fitness to start, had joined the party by that stage and no one from Zinedine Zidanes team should really care that the games outstanding moment was conjured up by one of the losing players",2
Mario Mandzukics goal was the paradox of the night,1
" Indeed, has there ever been a better goal in a European final? Zidane himself is on the all-time list for his spearing volley against Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park in 2002 Yet it is a legitimate debate and Mandzukics 27th-minute effort here might even edge it given that it involved the ball going between four different players without touching the floor",2
"Leonardo Bonucci was first with a long, diagonal pass out to Alex Sandro on the left and, after that, it was a blur of exhilarating speed, colour and movement",1
" Sandros cross to pick out Gonzalo Higuan was a beauty: a cushioned, left-footed volley on the run",1
 Higuan controlled the ball on his chest and flicked it towards Mandzukic,1
" And then, finally, it was the big mans turn, teeing himself up and then twisting his body to launch himself at the ball Volley, chest-volley, chest-volley: five touches in total, mid-air; left, right, left and right again It was like something from a computer game and, at the end of it, Mandzukics improvisational shot was dipping and swerving into the top corner of Keylor Navass goal",3
"Ultimately, though, the more prosaic goals carried the greater significance in this contest Madrid have managed only one clean sheet on their way to winning this competition Yet there is another statistic about Zidanes team and the player, more than anyone, who carries the teams dreams",3
" They arrived in Cardiff with the best goals record of any side in the competition  32 from 12 ties  and Ronaldo, being Ronaldo, rarely lets a big game pass him by without making some kind of contribution",1
"To begin with, he had found it difficult to get too much of the ball in and around the Juve penalty area",1
 But he also had periods in the other finals when he drifted to the edges,1
" Then this one reached its 20th minute and he came alive, exchanging passes with the overlapping Dani Carvajal before pulling back his right boot to take aim",1
" His shot was low, directed towards the bottom corner, and skimmed off Bonucci to elude Gianluigi BuffonIf we were to be kind about the losing side, Madrids first two goals both came from deflections and, in Casemiros case, the trajectory of his shot completely changed once the ball had struck Sami Khedira The truth, however, is that Juve, having conceded only three goals en route to this final, chose a bad night to lose their defensive organisation and never recovered from that momentThree minutes later, Luka Modric scampered down the right, clipped a cross to the near post and Ronaldos clipped finish gave the remainder of the match an air of inevitability The people who always criticise Cristiano are going to have put their guitar back in its case, he said afterwards, modest as ever",5
"There was still time for Sergio Ramos, as devious as a bag of weasels, to help engineer Cuadrados second yellow card with a bout of pretend agony but Madrids second-half performance had a lot more good than bad",1
" Marcelo set up Asensio to sweep in their fourth goal in the last minute and Zidane joined Brian Clough, Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola and Jos Mourinho among others on the list of managers who have won the European Cup twice",1
"Phil Mickelsons wait to complete a clean sweep of major championships will go on for at least another year, after it emerged the 46-year-old has withdrawn from the upcoming US Open so that he can attend his daughters high school graduation Given Mickelsons reputation in the United States, this marks a serious blow to the eventMickelson, who has endured a series of near-misses at his home open, was scheduled to join the field at Erin Hills from Thursday week",3
" However, speaking at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio  where he is playing this weekend  Mickelson said he will put family before professional goals",1
"Mickelsons daughter Amanda will graduate on 15 June, the day of the US Opens first round As I look back on life, this is a moment Ill always cherish and be glad I was present, Mickelson told the New York Times",2
" Theres no greater joy as a parentMickelson is believed to have already informed the United States Golf Association of his decision, out of respect for the number of final qualifying places they can make available on Monday As one of the finest golfers in the history of the game, Mickelsonneeds only the US Open to become the sixth player in history to achieve a grand slam of majors",3
"Sceptics might sense an undertone either of Mickelson feeling he is unable to compete at what is a new host venue  Mickelson has not won at all since the Open Championship of 2013  or holding a dim view of the USGA Recent US Opens have been overshadowed by bad publicity, including the rules furore which provided a backdrop to Dustin Johnsons success last year When asked last month whether a successful US Open was necessary to improve the reputation of the USGA, Mickelson replied: I dont know if one thing right is going to fix that",3
"Steven Finn will be drafted into Englands squad for the remainder of their Champions Trophy campaign on Sunday, replacing the injured Chris Woakes in what is a show of rigid consistency by the selectors and the captain, Eoin Morgan",1
"Finns international career has been mercurial over the last four years but, having opened the bowling on Englands one-day tour of the Caribbean this winter and played in their third one-dayer against South Africa last Monday, he retained his place as next in line following the side-strain suffered by Woakes during their opening win against Bangladesh on ThursdayEngland were waiting for official sign-off for Finns inclusion from the ICCs event technical committee on Saturday evening, having submitted the relevant forms after watching the 28-year-old pick up two for 49 as their Lions team beat South Africa A in NorthamptonThe call-up means Finn, who has 102 wickets from 69 one-day caps and reached the heights of No2 in the world rankings back in 2012, has seen off the challenge of his Middlesex team-mate Toby Roland Jones and Surreys Tom Curran and could come straight into the side to face New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday  where victory would seal a semi-final place",3
"Adil Rashid, the leg-spinner who was dropped for the Bangladesh match, and the left-armer David Willey represent Englands other bowling options but whoever gets the nod in the final XI, Woakes will certainly be missed as a go-to man for Morgan at the end of an innings",1
"Having closed out Englands pre-tournament series win over South Africa last Saturday by nervelessly defending seven off the final over at Southampton, Mark Wood has joined Liam Plunkett  the man entrusted at the end of the first innings on Thursday  in sticking his hand up for further death over dutiesIm comfortable doing it and we have got a number of people that can also, said Wood, who bowled with good pace against Bangladesh and was unfortunate to go wicketless Liam Plunkett did it at the Oval, Ben Stokes has done it in India and in Twenty20 cricket, and done it really well We have optionsOn his own mentality at the death, Wood added: At times you can almost rush through it, so sometimes its nice if the captain comes up to you and you have a little chat",5
" I know my run-up is very short and stop-start, but if you can have that little break, take a breather, that helps",1
"The manic behaviour of the one-day game at the minute  especially at the end  means the ball is flying here, there and everywhere, so youve just got to be so clear with your plans I wouldnt be too disappointed if Idisappeared around the field if I stuck to my plan and executed itNew Zealand, whose opener with Australia was ruined by rain meaning both sides picked up one point, represent the first of two chances England have to qualify for the semi-finals",3
" Their attack leader, Trent Boult, played with Woakes at Kolkata during the recent Indian Premier League and knows first hand the quality of bowler that has been lostI think hes a massive payer for them, said Boult Hes played extremely well for them over the past few seasons but Im sure they have the depth to replace him",3

" Anything can happen and the rankings dont mean anything  its whos on it on the dayNew Zealand were certainly on it against Australia, having emerged from the washout in Birmingham the more upbeat of the two sides and with their captain, Kane Williamson, up and running following a typically classy 100 that epitomised his level-headed, almost Zen-like approach to the sportAsked if he has ever seen Williamson gets worked up, Boult replied: Not on the cricket field, no",3
 He gets more flustered on what to wear on a dinner date with his missus I think he gets it right but Im no fashionista,2

" Four teams headed into a nail-biting final round of matches with a chance of clinching the title but Chelsea got their hands on the trophy, ahead of Manchester City on goal difference, following goals from Karen Carney, against her old club, and Fran KirbyI thought that overall it was a very professional performance by us and it showed that were winners, a team that just wants to go out there and win, Kirby said",2
" Manchester City have been winning titles so this was an important one for us, this is our trophy and were going to take the impetus into next season",1
"On a personal note Ive had a long journey on the road back from injury, Ive had to push myself to the limits to get myself fit again",1

"The value of Adam Lyths century, surely the hardest-fought of his 22 in first-class cricket, was seen in its celebration; having spent 41 balls across 16 overs and 71 minutes hanging in the nineties, he involuntarily leaped into the air while completing a single The next ball he faced, drained by his 234-ball stay, produced his first truly loose shot, and he was caught behind driving",2
"But Lyth, whose next highest score this season is 30, had chiselled Yorkshire towards Roses dominance: a first innings lead of 150, which their potent seam attack then capitalised on, dismissing Lancashires top four cheaply In their way stand Shiv Chanderpaul and Dane Vilas, who shared a sprightly 60 late in the day Still, Lancashire are nine behind and face a battle to save the game, although they will be heartened by Mondays rotten forecastA measure of Lyths inningss quality is that the only other batsman to pass 40 is Chanderpaul Lyth played totally against type for a man normally stylish and gallivanting",5
" With Lancashires bowling  all 82 overs were delivered by seamers  never easy to get away due to a defensive line and the favourable conditions, care was required and Lyth obliged Lancashire badly missed Jimmy Anderson, but he emerged at stumps to do some sprints, and England are increasingly optimistic he will be fit for the summers first Test",2
"Yorkshire lost Gary Ballance, his 600th run of the season ticked off, to Ryan McLaren in a funereal morning but, with lunch approaching, Saqib Mahmood, the pick of the bowlers, found two wickets in two balls  Jack Leaning caught brilliantly at second slip and Tim Bresnan nicking to first Lancashires bowling improved and with Lyth rightly watchful, Andy Hodd, Azeem Rafiq and Jack Brooks provided some lower order roister",2
" Jordan Clark, who dismissed Lyth, ended with three wickets, like MahmoodAnd so Lancashire embarked on a 48-over final session deep in arrears, with the ball talking, against an attack tailor-made for the conditions",2
" To Brooks they lost the punchy Alex Davies, then to Ben Coad went Haseeb Hameed; both made 10, both were lbw Hameeds was perhaps high, but he has 26 runs in six innings Three of them are ducks, and his 10 here is the highest score in that torrid sequence",3
" Runs are badly needed against Middlesex next weekAt this stage Lancashire would have rather liked the services of Liam Livingstone, who spent his day smashing South Africa A around Northampton, for an 83-ball 129",2
" Instead, Luke Procter flashed at Brooks and was caught at first slip, then Steven Croft nudged half-forward and edged to second Lancashires hopes lie with ChanderpaulSomerset may be winless and bottom but, as Dean Elgar and Lewis Gregory showed against the champions, Middlesex, they are not lying down With a stand of 249, they each scored centuries, Gregorys 137 his first in first-class cricket, to lead them from the wreckage of 80 for five to a position where a declaration was possible  on 443 for nine Middlesexs opening Nicks, Compton and Gubbins, made it through 22 overs to stumps",5
An even more extraordinary stand gave Hampshire total control against Warwickshire,1
" Having come together at 31 for three, Sean Ervine (203) and Jimmy Adams (166, his first ton since 2015) put on 367, breaking a host of records, including the largest ever fourth-wicket stand for Hampshire, and against Warwickshire Sunny Singh, the 21-year-old left-arm spinner, dismissed both on his way to six for 144, a maiden five-wicket haul in just his third match, as Hampshire racked up 515",2
"Warwickshire closed looking doomed: they had lost their top six for just 49 Jonathan Trott, absent fielding a family issue but returning on Sunday, has a frightful job on his handsDivision Two leaders Nottinghamshire face a mighty battle to save their unbeaten record They head into the third day against Derbyshire two down in their second innings (having lost Jake Libby and Che Pujara), but still 67 behind after Billy Godlemans 121, his third century in the season, guided the hosts to 363, a lead of 144 Life without James Pattinson and Stuart Broad was a little tougher, learned Nottinghamshire",5
"An enthralling day at Chester-le-Street, brimful of dropped catches, saw Durham fight back against Northamptonshire, yet they remain 94 behind for the loss of Keaton Jennings, stumped sweeping Rob Keogh, in their second innings Earlier, Max Holden, on loan from Middlesex and not 20 until December, scored his maiden first-class century and Josh Cobb made 96 as Northants posted 338",2
" With the end of their stand of 162 for the sixth wicket came a burst of wickets for Paul Coughlin, who picked up his maiden five-wicket haul, and Northants lost five for 11And in a run-fest at Hove, Worcestershire closed 139 without loss (with the in-form Daryl Mitchell on 86), a fine response to Sussexs monstrous 579 for eight declared Luke Wells, who has 413 runs in two innings at Hove this year, laid the foundations with 155, but the contributions continued all the way down",3
" Luke Wright, freed from captaincys shackles, made 87 (20 of them coming in four balls before his dismissal), while David Wiese contributed 66, and his dismissal brought the declarationIt is undoubtedly an exaggeration to suggest Wigans season is in crisis just yet, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the reigning Super League champions are running out of excuses and, more importantly, fixtures",2
"The Warriors have now gone six games without a win after this latest defeat, and while there are still the Super 8s to follow later this summer, the fact Shaun Wanes side are closer to the bottom four makes their remaining six fixtures before the split essential to remain in touch with the leading packWigan certainly have injury problems aplenty, and the fact they lost their captain, Sean OLoughlin, pre-match certainly did not help  but their recent performances have been so concerning that such mitigation is unconvincing",2
"Hull too came into this fixture with problems, without key personnel and on a run of three consecutive defeats; yet they were still far too good for the Warriors here, moving back into the top four after completing their first double against Wigan in Super LeagueTo their credit, the Warriors improved immensely after half-time but by then they were 26-4 down and the damage had been done, a point not lost on Wane afterwardsWe just left ourselves with too much to do in the second half, he said",3
 We played poorly It was six tries apiece but they were the better team Its a big game against Leigh next week,3
"There were four Hull tries in the first half, including two to the winger Steve Michaels, who on both occasions brutally exposed Wigans deficiencies in defenceWigans opening half was perhaps summed up by a moment of madness from the forward Willie Isa, who tripped Mark Minichiello to concede a penalty that Jake Connor kicked with ease to open up that 22-point lead at the interval",2
"Perhaps the one crumb of comfort for Wigan in that half was that they survived a 10-minute period without Liam Farrell relatively unscathed, after the England international was sent to the sin-bin for dissent After half-time they were much improved, and by the hour they had reduced the gap to 12 courtesy of tries from Liam Marshall and Lewis TierneyWith Wigan on top, it would need something special to quell any hope of a comeback, and the Hull full-back Jamie Shaul provided it with an instinctive chip, chase and regather to end Wigans revival before Albert Kelly secured victory with a long-range effort",3
" Late tries from Marshall, Tom Davies and Joe Burgess were mere consolations for a side already well beatenAgainst all the odds last year, Wane produced the best from his players to not only get an injury-hit Wigan side to Old Trafford, but win the title full-stop If he can do so again this season, it would rank as an even greater achievement given where his side currently find themselves",3
"The troubled passage endured through the Derby by Wings Of Eagles is mirrored in the previously troubled career of his journeyman jockey, Padraig Beggy, who must have feared his days in the saddle could be over when he was banned for a year in Australia at the end of 2014 Entertaining company, as well as a manifestly talented rider, Beggy talked his way into additional trouble after a positive test for cocaine, providing not one but two false explanations before accepting that he had deliberately taken the drugFor a jockey who had been kicking around for a decade or so without making much of an impact, there is no guarantee of being able to come back from that kind of self-inflicted disaster That Beggy has been able to do so is testament to his own determination but also to the willingness of the winning trainer, Aidan OBrien, to give a man a second chanceAfter dismounting from his 40-1 winner, Beggy was relating how he packed his bags and quit Australia soon after an appeal hearing failed, returning to Ireland, where he had grown up in Dunboyne and acquired a love of horse racing during childhood visits to Fairyhouse",5
" Two friends, working at OBriens Ballydoyle stable, introduced him to the trainer and he was given a job riding out the next month",1
"I got into a bit of trouble in Australia, a bad mistake and something that Ive put behind me, the 31-year-old said I was knocked down then, I had to pick myself up and Ive come back out fighting and today I think Ive proved thatAidan had a chat with me and said, Padraig, you keep working, some day well repay you",3
 I dont think he meant the Derby So I got into Ballydoyle and I worked hard He was good to me,3
 I owe him a lot,1
"Beggy started in Ireland in 2003, rode for eight seasons with some level of success but never achieved more than 22 winners in a year in a country that has never been short of riding talent He came to Britain in 2011, basing himself with John Quinn one year and David Evans the next, adding another eight wins before deciding to try his luck in AustraliaIve never rode big winners, he said, and I thought riding big winners or Classic winners had gone by me, till Aidan started giving me the rides in them races It means the world to meAnother Derby winner doubtless means plenty to OBrien, though he seemed genuinely stunned at the quarter from which it came",5
" But he rallied to tell Beggy he had given his horse a peach of a ride and added: Padraig is a world-class rider, always has been and hes been with us a good while now We really appreciate his work, day in, day out, every morning",2
"In his two and a half years at Ballydoyle, Beggy has now ridden a total of four winners, so there is no disguising that he is not at the top of the pecking order, for all that OBrien is happy to use him The trainer ran six in the race and Wings Of Eagles was his fifth string according to the betting odds OBriens shock suggests he saw it that way as wellBut the cheerful Beggy radiated knowledge of his enormous good fortune as he spoke of the belief he had in his unfancied mount during the buildup Cliffs Of Moher was what we thought was probably the best of all our horses, but we were talking on the plane on the way over, saying theres barely 1lb between them",5
 And every one of them horses is trained by Aidan OBrien for the Derby,1
" So it doesnt matter if one is 4-1 or one is 33-1, hes trained them to come here to run the race of their lives",1
"You could run the race tomorrow and maybe one of our others would win itId never get a leg-up on the likes of that big, strong, three-year-old colt, without having been at Ballydoyle",2
" Ive won the Derby, so I cant say much moreOn a sunlit, boisterous afternoon at the home of the unceasing beer tap supply system, South Africa eased to a 96-run victory over Sri Lanka in their Champions Trophy Group B opener",3
" South Africa always looked ahead of the game Batting first they posted a solid-looking 299, driven on by an effortlessly fine hundred from Hashim Amla, his 25th in one-day internationals, another high-class batsman showing the value of reading a pitch and accumulating with careIt was an amazing innings, AB de Villiers, his captain, said",3
" He did really well to assess the conditions, there was quite a lot in that wicket early onIn reply Sri Lanka were hauled in mid-chase by a fine, aggressive spell of leg-spin from the ever-exuberant Imran Tahir, a bowler who greets every wicket, even a dragged-down mishit to deep cover, with a wildly joyful sprint, like a man fleeing a burning building while simultaneously hearing news of a million-pound jackpot win",2
Tahir took four for 27 and bowled with accuracy and aggressive variation,1
" If South Africas batting did not really fire, the bowling looks to have plenty of edge and they also fielded with vim De Villiers spoke at length about the need for calmness and intensity Tahir only qualifies for one of these, but De Villiers rated his performance close to a 10 out of 10",3
"To make things worse for Sri Lanka a dawdling over rate was punished with an uncontested two-match ban for the stand-in captain, Upul Tharanga, whose team were four overs short of where they should have been towards the end of South Africas innings All the players lose 60% of their match fees, tooThe regular captain, Angelo Mathews, had one too many debilitating twangs and strains",3
" Tharanga won the toss and bowled, fearful perhaps of some nibble in the air on a sunny south London morning with dark clouds still skudding overhead after the end-of-the-world thunderstorms of the previous dayHis bowlers were tight early on",2
" Lasith Malinga was back for the first time in a year and a half and he mixed tight lines with wides and full tosses, still able to dip the odd full ball on to the batsmans toes The feisty Quinton de Kock was becalmed, eventually nicking Nuwan Pradeep fiddling outside off stumpFaf du Plessis was dropped in slapstick fashion by Malinga, dithering under a top-edged pull",3
" After which he ran hard to reach his 50 off 52 balls, facing some ordinary change bowers In this team the entire Sri Lanka top-six moonlight as wicketkeepers, depriving Tharanga of the usual strong hand of fill-ins and part-time dart merchantsAmla eased along, lifting Asela Gunaratne over mid-off, cuffing and slapping anything short square on both sides He is often a little obscured by De Villiers and the Virat-Kane-Joe rat pack but Amlas record bears comparison with any of these Only Virat Kohli has more ODI hundreds while averaging more than 50",5
"De Villiers appeared briefly before spooning a catch to midwicket via a wild, splay-footed pull off something flat and short from Seekkuge Prasanna Chris Morris biffed usefully JP Duminy spanked the last ball of the innings into the groundsmans shed But South Africa still looked a little shortSri Lanka have a fine lineage of spiky little wicketkeeper-batsmen and Niroshan Dickwella set off at a decent lick in their reply, walloping Wayne Parnell through cover and then punting Kagiso Rabada high over midwicket",5
"For a while Sri Lanka attacked the chase with some hunger before Dickwella was winkled out by Morne Morkel for 41 At which point three moments of brilliance in the field killed the gameFirst De Villiers took a standing jump to catch Kusal Mendis at midwicket with one hand just as the ball seemed to have cleared him This soon became an AB double, the captain hurling down the stumps to run out Dinesh Chandimal Three balls later Chamara Kapugedera was lbw first ball to Tahirs excellent googly, never the greatest fate for an international batsman",5
At the halfway point Sri Lanka were 154 for four and still on target At which point Tahir turned the screw,2
" Tharanga, who will only play again in the tournament if his side reach the semi-finals, had completed a fluent half-century but he was caught, playing a pointless lofted drive to David Miller at deep cover, sparking further excitement from the bowler who could probably produce a competitive time at the world indoor 60m heats if the starters gun could be synchronised with a successful lbw appeal",1
With him went Sri Lankas best hopes and the match ended in a rushIt used to be said that a trainer who felt there were several potential Derby winners in the stable did not in truth have even one But not any more,3
" Aidan OBrien once sent eight horses to the Classic and left Epsom empty-handed but his six-strong team on Saturday produced a 40-1 winner in Wings Of Eagles, a colt with just a handful of backers among the countless thousands crammed on to the Downs",1
"The victory of Wings Of Eagles was the biggest surprise in the Derby since Snow Knights success at 50-1 in 1974, and the first for a horse at a double-figure price since High-Rise at 20-1 in 1998 On the day, however, there was no fluke about it, and while Wings Of Eagles and Padraig Beggy hit the front only a few strides from the line, they won a shade cosily in the end",2
"There were echoes of Pour Mois charge through the field to victory in 2011 as his son Wings Of Eagles passed horse after horse in the Epsom straight, building momentum all the time and closing steadily on the leaders Two furlongs out, though, most eyes were glued to his stable companion, Cliffs Of Moher, and OBriens principal jockey Ryan Moore, as they glided past market rival Cracksman and into a useful leadThe stage was set for Cliffs Of Moher to stride clear but he simply stayed on without quickening as the race reached its climax, as Wings Of Eagles and Beggy chased them down and claimed victory by three-quarters of a length",3
"Before the race, some might have questioned OBriens apparent wish to run almost every three-year-old colt with a pulse in Saturdays Classic",1
" A few minutes later, the wisdom of covering every possible base was unarguable, as Wings Of Eagles fulfilled the promise in his pedigree, which has the family of the 1995 Derby winner Lammtarra on his dams side to complement Pour Moi",1
"This was OBriens fourth Derby success in the last six years and his sixth in all, one more than Sir Michael Stoutes (current) total of five between 1981 and 2010, and just one behind the all-time record of seven wins in the Classic",1
" All three of the trainers to saddle seven winners  Robert Robson, John Porter and Fred Darling  were active in a much less competitive era, and sent out their final Derby winners in 1823, 1899 and 1941 respectively OBrien, though, is closing in and seems sure to catch and pass them all before too many more seasons are outThe trainer made it clear that Wings Of Eagles had been seen as a possible winner beforehand, despite his starting price and a defeat at the hands of Venice Beach, who finished 12th, on his previous start at Chester",3
" That said, he may still suspect that Cliffs Of Moher will prove to be a better horse in the long term",1
"He was working very well and we were delighted with him at Chester, OBrien said",1
" Padraig was always going to take his time on him and produce him and he gave him a marvellous rideHe added of Cliffs Of Moher: I was delighted with the second horse All those really well-bred, good-looking horses, they can make dramatic improvement from race to race, and we knew that they had all improved [from their trial runs]",3
I didnt really know what was going to happen,1
" I thought Ryans horse was open to the most improvement, which he was and he did, but Ryan said he got there and he just got tired in his hands I was half-afraid that that could happen, but wed just about made the race If he hadnt run at Chester, he wouldnt have made it here",3
" He came with his long, sustained run and in the last 100 yards it just told, the lack of preparationMichael Tabor, a former bookmaker and one of the co-owners of Wings Of Eagles in John Magniers Coolmore Stud syndicate, said that he had felt before the race that any one of their six runners could make the step up to win We knew Wings Of Eagles was in the mix, but no more than that, Tabor said",3
" Hes proved to be a very, very good horse for the future but Im afraid I didnt back him and I didnt have a bet in the raceThe betting suggested beforehand that this was one of the most open Derbys for years but the fact that a 40-1 chance crossed the line in front does not necessarily mean that it was a sub-par renewal That will become apparent only in his remaining starts, but however his career plays out, Wings Of Eagles and Beggy are Derby winners, and nothing will ever change thatVirat Kohli moved to quell the growing talk of a rift between his India players and the head coach, Anil Kumble, on the eve of their hugely anticipated Champions Trophy opener with Pakistan at Edgbaston, insisting there are no problems whatsoeverKumble, the former wrist-spinner and national team captain, has been told he must re-apply for the position after his current one-year term expires at the end of the tournament and, despite 19 wins and four defeats across all formats during his time, change may be afoot",5
"The team, according to reports in India, have told the administrators running their countrys embattled cricket board that Kumbles style is overbearing and now former players Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, who comprise the three-man panel overseeing the appointment, must sort the truth from conjectureKohli, the India captain, has previously said the process is no different to what has occurred in the past but before his sides meeting with Pakistan  a rare encounter given bilateral ties are currently on hold  much of the focus remained on KumbleThere are no problems whatsoever, said Kohli As I mentioned before, if something is put in place as a process, I dont see why people are creating so many speculations about it The team is totally focused on the Champions Trophy",5
"Asked about his own relationship with the head coach, Kohli said: Its been really good The whole journey has been goodThe situation was not helped this week when Ramachandra Guha, who was part of the Committee of Administrators that runs Indian cricket, resigned and in the letter explaining his reasons  published by ESPNCricinfo  raised the issue of problems in the current set-upGuha criticised the way Kumbles future had been left hanging by his contract not being renewed automatically and questioned whether it would give players the belief of their having a veto on the subject in another example of superstar culture gone berserkThe state of affairs adds an extra layer of intrigue to the start of Indias title defence that begins against their neighbours  against whom they have won their past six encounters in global tournaments  and was something the Pakistan head coach, Mickey Arthur, looked to sidestep",5
"Thats Indias problem, said Arthur, whose captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, was sitting next to him",1
 All I know is that the captain/coach relationship is almost like a marriage Youve got to be on the same page all the time And if youre on the same page you get correct decisions and you give clarity to your team,3
"Ive had the privilege of working with so many good captains in my time and Saffy is right up there as one Im really going to enjoy working with, in terms of our relationship going forwardAndy Murray enjoys few experiences more than proving people wrong and so the most stubborn man in tennis goes into the second week of the French Open for the eighth time in 10 visits with a ringing endorsement from the rival he beat to get there, Juan Martn del PotroThere were plenty of people at the start of the week who feared the Scots form and fitness were at such a low ebb he had no chance of reaching the final for a second year in a row, and diminished prospects of getting past the quarter-finals",3
" He is not quite there yet, but he is in the fourth round again, and deservedly so after beating the occasionally inspired Argentinian by the misleading score of 7-6 (10-8), 7-5, 6-0 in just under three hours on a mild and pleasant afternoon on Court Philippe Chatrier, not long before the rain arrivedDel Potro, making his first appearance here in five years after the most wretched time with injury, said of their 10th encounter, and only the second to finish in straight sets: It was another good battle",2
" The first two sets [took] two hours and a half, really long setsAndy, hes very smart on court He has all the shots, but also is great mentally",3
" Thats why hes No1 in the world and I know how important this tournament is for him I wish him all the best and, hopefully, he can go farA few players on the Tour would not bother with such compliments",3
" But Del Potro is a man apart, encouraging genuine warmth in the crowd as he fought with tigerish intent to bring the best out of Murray Del Potro should have won the first set but a blistering forehand in the tie-break was out by so tiny a margin that the chair umpire conferred with the line judge before awarding the point and set to MurrayThe second frame was just as intense but Murray gradually got the upper hand over Del Potro, who had to take painkillers for a groin strain he picked up in his match against Nicols Almagro two days before",3
" He did not use that as an excuse and said he played pain free, but it was clear he was not moving as well as he might have wishedPartly that was down to what he identified as Murrays court intelligence There were so many artful exchanges between these two wonderful players that it was difficult to pick when the winning shot would arrive",3
" Murray concentrated on keeping as many balls away from his opponents lethal forehand as he could, then, having peppered him on the other flank, used the open court to tease him with drop shotsDel Potro was hardly surprised by the strategy and, when not slicing backhand returns to keep the point going, ran around those shots to unleash his forehand He struck 16 clean winners with the shot, but only one in the final set, which came and went in 28 minutes",3
" Fighting to the end, however, he made Murray save three break points before completing the bagelMurray was in understandably good spirits  although little has unsettled his mood for some time, win or lose",2
" The self-absorption of his youth is long gone, even if there is the odd on-court explosion still He said after a couple of such outbursts in his second match, against Martin Klizan on Thursday, that he sometimes struggles to contain those emotionsPerhaps it is no bad thing, though If he were to go totally against his true nature he might create confusion that would further undermine the state of his game head He had it on here, with just a fleeting curse or admonishment for his box, where Ivan Lendl sat in his customary state of expressionless concentration",5
"By the standards of a year ago, when he launched the most extraordinary assault on Novak Djokovics No 1 world ranking around this time, he has under-performed He arrived here having lost early in tournaments to excellent but lower-rated opponents in Dominic Thiem (Barcelona), Albert Ramos Violas (Monte Carlo), Borna Coric (Madrid) and the dangerous and unpredictable Fabio Fognini (Rome)But Murrays clay game is improving by the match He agreed that this might have been his best 2017 showing I played some good matches beginning of the year, he said, but definitely, in the clay court season, those second andthird sets were the best I have played, for sure",5
"He might have paid scant attention to the pessimists, but his mood is lifted",1
" He is ready to raise his level another notch, as all the really good players do whenit matters He expects to get better, because he has done it so many times beforeLast year here, he reached the final after coming close to losing in his first two matches, each of which went to five sets This time, he took four sets to overcome Andrey Kuznetsov and Klizan before hitting an ominous beat against Del PotroTo be playing him this early on in the slam is not easy, but it can be a very positive thing, Murray said",5
" You play someone that good, maybe youre a little bit more switched on Your focus is maybe a little bit higherThere was one moment of minor irritation when he was asked why he was shushing himself",3
"He arched his eyebrows and replied, I dont know why I was doing it Why does it matter? Whats the big deal? I dont get it",2
" If I say something and you guys ask me what I was saying, if I say nothing, you ask me why I dont say anything",1
" What do you want me to do? What do you want me to say? Its irrelevant Whats relevant is what happens during the pointsHes not wrongThe last time two British players made it to the fourth round of the French Open, the Beatles were No1 in the charts and Harold Macmillan was serving out his closing months in 10 Downing Street Kyle Edmund, 22, might not have listened to From Me to You or know who Supermac was, but the 22-year-old with the booming forehand would dearly have loved to match that 1963 achievement alongside Andy Murray at this tournament",5
"For long stretches of his third-round match against Kevin Anderson, Edmund looked like being part of a little bit of tennis history, but he found the resilience of the tall, powerful South African too much after nearly four hours of grinding tennis on the compact Court 2Anderson, seven places behind Edmund in the world rankings at 56, outlasted him to win 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 and book a place in the last 16 against the former US Open champion Marin Cilic, who made short work of the Spaniard Feliciano Lpez, to win 6-1, 6-3, 6-3Edmund was simultaneously disappointed and satisfied, pointing out that another five-setter was a useful part of his tennis education, especially as he held up well physically",3
" Now, he says, he is looking forward to Wimbledon, with preparation at Queens and Eastbourne  challenging the suggestion that it was a surface on which he did not feel comfortableI dont quite remember me ever saying that I dont like grass, he said in his ultra-polite way I just enjoy playing on clay and hard a lot more",3
" Well, I play on them a lot more So I have more time on them",2
"There was little in this match for nearly three hours, as they traded big shots from behind or near the baseline Each of them loaded up with full-force groundstrokes, averaging only three shots a rally until near the end of the match As Edmund said after his quick-fire win over Renzo Olivo in the second round: Theres not much point having weapons if you dont use them",3
"Jim Courier said after that performance that Edmund has the potential to be a top-10 player Apart from a dip during the fourth set on Saturday, he looked worthy of the assessmentAnderson came to life down the stretch to put the pressure back on Britains No2, although breaks were hard to come by for each of them",3
 Edmund held from love-40 for 3-3 in the fifth but could not sustain his level all the way to the end,1
"No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, you know being black in America is toughLeBron James sat in front of dozens of news cameras to discuss racist graffiti that was spray-painted on the front gate of his house By the time the majority of news reporters arrived at the home, the offensive language had already been painted over",3
"Some casual observers of all the media coverage might have thought that all the hoopla over a word painted on the gate of a rich and powerful mans $21m home was a bit overdramatic How tough is it really, for a multimillionaire to endure a single racial slur for the short amount of time that it appeared before staffers painted over it?But when James said being black in America is tough, he was speaking to a fundamental truth of blackness in America It is tough, and we are never allowed to think otherwiseWhen I discuss issues of racial oppression  particularly racial oppression of black people, Im often countered with examples of rich and famous black Americans What about Beyonc? What about Serena Williams? What about Obama? The implication is  how can things be as bad as you claim when these black people are able to amass so much wealth and power?But Beyonc was inundated with racist hate for daring to perform at the CMA awards, Serena Williams is regularly mocked for her black features and compared to an animal, and Obama was for eight years branded a radical Muslim",5
" There is no amount of fame or fortune that can fully protect black Americans from racist hateOne of the most painful ways to kill someone is to continuously rob them of their peace of mind That is the aim of these racist attacks like the graffiti painted on James front gate, or the noose found at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC",3
"These are not imminent threats of physical bodily harm These are reminders that at any time, the horrors of this nations murderous racist past can be revisited upon you",2
" These are reminders that you are never safe, and you should never get comfortable These hateful actions aim to keep us afraid, unbalanced and distractedI myself receive with some disturbing regularity, similar reminders of how unsafe I am as a black woman",3
" I receive emails with images of lynched black bodies, I receive tweets stating that a van is coming to collect me for re-education, I receive promises that I will pay for the work I do writing about race in America People have created fake online accounts for the sole purpose of reminding black people in hundreds of messages a day that they are never really safeHow powerful it must make someone feel to know that by sending an image, they can invoke 300 years of racial terror How powerful it must feel to know that with a can of spray-paint they can make a rich and famous professional athlete feel unsafe?These messages work because they are true We, as black Americans, are not safe",5
" We are 28 times more likely to be killed in encounters with police than white Americans, black mothers are three to four times more likely to be killed in childbirth than white mothers, black Americans are five times more likely to be incarcerated than white Americans, black Americans are seven times more likely to be wrongly convicted of murder than white Americans, black kids are four times more likely to be suspended from school than white kids, black Americans are almost three times more likely to live in poverty and more likely to live in areas of highly concentrated poverty",2
We are not safe,1
" We are not safe when driving down the street, in our schools, in our doctors offices We are not safe and as black Americans there is not much we can do about it",2
 This is why the messaging of these hate crimes are so effective,1
 They are a reminder of the reality that we as black Americans live with every day,1
These messages should be taken seriously as the hate crimes that they are,1
 They are weapons of psychological torture aimed at making black Americans feel unsafe,1
" And as violent racists have been further empowered in the wake of our last presidential election, it is more important than ever that we stop these terror campaigns that not only lead to psychological harm against black Americans and other people of color, but also help inspire physical attacks against people of color But if we really want to reduce the impact of these hateful acts, we need to address the systemic issues of racial inequality that make these acts so impactfulWe must work to address the real life barriers to health and safety that are impacting black Americans every day",3
" We must look not only at the hateful message, but at the reality that the message is representingWhen we address the ways in which black Americans are threatened every day by the realities of life in a racially oppressive society, these messages will still be hateful and criminal reminders of horrors of the past  but they will no longer be a promise of horrors to comeThe rustiness of the Lions was evident from the first whistle, when they failed to gather the kick-off and proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes camped in their own half",3
" It must be remembered, however, that they were up against a scratch side, with even less time to prepare",1
" More pertinent to the Lions torpor, then, is the fact that they only arrived in New Zealand on Wednesday and were clearly sluggish  in thought perhaps more than body  as a result Assuming the Lions are acclimatised by Wednesday, there should be a far faster start against the Blues but there was still a concerning lack of intensity, particularly up front from a forward pack that is supposed to be the tourists biggest advantage Stuart Hogg fumbling with his first touch was an inauspicious start and he then butchered an overlap with Anthony Watson outside him and looking to go over",3
" It was not Johnny Sextons day at all His kicking was poor, which is only asking for trouble in New Zealand, and the Irish standoff fired out a few rank passes",2
"Bryn Gatland has just a handful of Super Rugby appearances to his name but what would his old man have given for a flyhalf displaying such composure? Gatland Jr approached the contest determined to enjoy himself and intent on showcasing the full extent of his kicking repertoire He was not the only Barbarian to impress: Sevu Reece caught the eye on the wing, as did Luteru Laulala at full-back, as well as the replacement back-row Matt Matich",2
" Many of the Barbarians are parttimers and their ranks included shop owners, sheep farmers and nurses How comfortable they were on the ball, however, showed an inbuilt skill set that simply does not exist in the northernhemisphereWhile they are not in abundance, one of the main plus points for the Lions was the impact of their replacements",3
" George Kruis made his presence felt at the lineout and Owen Farrell upped the tempo, even if he missed a routine penalty Mako Vunipola, too, made a telling turnover  there is a Saracens theme developing here  and Justin Tipuric was ferocious in defence",2
" The Lions had a bit of difficulty in getting all their replacements on when they wanted  if that was poor administration on their part they cannot afford it to happen later down the line  but once they were on the field, there was a bit more direction and verve to the touristsplay",1
"There is no doubting that coach Gatland was accentuating the positives when, straight after the match, he was pointing to the Lions being held up over the line four times True, but their failure to convert their chances should be far more worrying",2
" Anthony Watson might have had a hattrick had heads stayed a little cooler and there was a concerning moment in the first half when Greig Laidlaw, admittedly not known for his sniping, missed a huge gap that one of the Barbarians props was practically ushering him through Laidlaw was already committed to the pass and it is worrying because it was clear evidence of the Lions muddled thinking If they cannot learn to play what is in front of them before the Tests they are in trouble",3
"Without wishing to take any pleasure in the misfortune of others, it has not been a perfect weekend for the All Blacks either and Steve Hansen will be anxious about the injuries sustained by Ryan Crotty and Ben Smith (left) in the Crusaders victory over the Highlanders",1
" Crotty suffered a rib injury and, as the Crusaders coach, Scott Robertson, put it: I think that Steve Hansen will be tucking into his notebook and thinking whos next",1
" Smith, meanwhile, suffered concussion and would be a big miss for the All Blacks Add in the fact that Kieran Read is doubtful for the first Test and Dane Coless concussion problems are continuing and Hansen will be relieved indeed that Super Rugby goes on hold after this weekend",2
"Two French outsiders who have frustrated their admirers with their serial inconsistency, Aliz Cornet and Caroline Garcia, will meet in the fourth round of their home slam after wins of contrasting style on a day when rain ripped through the schedule at Roland GarrosThe unseeded Cornets was the bigger, quicker win  6-2, 6-1 in an hour and 19 minutes over the world No10 Agnieszka RadwanskaGarcia, the No28 seed, had a significantly lesser opponent in the world No109 Hsieh Su-wei  who was good enough to put out Johanna Konta in the first round and the talented American Taylor Townsend in the second  but struggled over two hours and 39 minutes before winning 6-4, 4-6, 9-7",3
" That might be scant consolation for Konta, the world No8, who had expected to be here at least until the end of the first weekThe ever-smiling Cornet said later: I was feeling just very happy Its a lot of emotion to qualify for the second week of your home slam  big relief, also, because I beat Aga just once in maybe nine matches that we played",3
"This was, in fact, her second success against the elegant Pole in eight attempts, but she got the numbers that mattered right As she told French reporters later: Whether I play against a top 10 or top 100 opponent, anything can happen, so I dont focus on numbers",2
"Radwanskas collapse was a major shock but she had no answer to Cornets fierce determination I enjoyed my time on court a lot, but I was very stressed before the match, the French player said Even during the match, because I felt like I could beat her",3
" When you have this feeling, you have to be focused from the first to the last point Thats what I did",2
"She will be just as wired up for Mondays match against Garcia The crowd is going to be excited to see Caro and me play, to see two French women playing for a place in the quarter-final I think they will not [favour] one or the other, but we will try to give them a good show",3
"Garcia said of her trial against the Taiwanese star: So many games were very tight at the end Even when I was down, I kept fighting, tried to be more aggressive The last week for me was very difficult",3
" Its good sometimes when you have this period to learn about yourself, about your team, about the people around you",1
"She will know plenty about Cornet, of course, and will start as the underdog given that she is No43 in the world  although this has been an unpredictable tournament from day one",1
" Also, she won their only previous match: 7-5, 5-7, 6-3 on the clay of Marseille seven years agoI dont need to prove anything to anyone, Garcia said Ive played tennis a long time",3
" I already have done well, but I want to do better, for sure",1
"Garcia is a fiery individual and has bounced back with resolve from a suspension handed down by the French Tennis Federation last year, along with her doubles partner, Kristina Mladenovic, for what they considered was unprofessionalism at the Rio Olympics Their crime was to contravene Olympic regulations by turning up for their match in outfits that did not match They were favourites and lostMladenovic, meanwhile, is already through to the next round, after her rousing comeback against the American Shelby Rogers on Friday, and plays the defending champion, Garbie Muguruza, on Sunday in what could be the match of the dayElsewhere in the weather-wrecked round on Saturday, Carla Surez Navarro, the 21st seed, beat the Russian 14th seed Elena Vesnina 6-4, 6-4 without fuss, and the world No4, Simona Halep  who doubted before the tournament started if she would be fit enough to compete at all  beat 26th seed Daria Kasatkina, of Russia, 6-0, 7-5",5
Warren Gatland insists there is no huge reason to panic despite the British & Irish Lions lacklustre start to their tour of New Zealand The head coach cited jetlag as the main explanation for the Lions unimpressive 13-7 win over a NZ Provincial Barbarians XV composed largely of part-time players and believes it will be a different story when his squad have spent more time in their new surroundingsThe touring team have been in New Zealand since Wednesday and it emerged many are finding it difficult to acclimatise,3
" These guys are still recovering from the travel, Gatland said",1
 A number of players in the squad still havent got into regular sleep patterns Andy Farrell also went to the doctor last night to get a sleeping pill He went to bed at 11 or 12 oclock and was up at four oclock this morning in the team room because he couldnt get to sleep,3
Weve just got to try and recover and adjust as quickly as possible,1
 So hopefully in the next two days were going to get into a cycle where were feeling fresh,1
"Gatland and the teams manager, John Spencer, have made it no secret they would have loved more time to prepare the squad We would have preferred to have had a week in the UK with the full squad and a week in New Zealand before the first game, said Gatland Perhaps the schedulers need to look at that for future tours",3
None of the Lions are looking to make unnecessary excuses but their preparation for the opening fixture has clearly been hopelessly inadequate,1
" In addition to their late arrival in New Zealand, a quarter of the squad were involved in domestic finals last weekend and they have also been doing community visits that have necessitated long car journeys Two players, Ross Moriarty and Kyle Sinckler, required treatment for back spasms that Gatland felt was largely down to being wedged into the back of a 4x4 vehicle so soon after flying in The squad is due to attend an official Maori welcome at the Waitangi Treaty grounds tomorrow before relocating more than two hours south back to Auckland",3
"Gatland, however, was encouraged by the efforts of Ben Teo, Taulupe Faletau and several of his replacements as the Lions fought back from 7-3 down at half-time Weve learned a lot in terms of how tough it is to come to New Zealand and how motivated the teams are going to be against us",2
 That game is going to put us in good steadWhen I look back four years ago we played the Barbarians in Hong Kong and had a comfortable victory that didnt test us Tonight tested us,3
" It was a good first game to have Youd much rather that than a 50-point win In 2009, the first game in South Africa was against a Royal XV in Rustenburg and we struggled a bit in that opening game as well",3
"Gatland also said it had been special to come up against his son, Bryn, who impressed at fly-half for the Provincial Barbarians",1
" He played pretty well, said Gatland Sr He caused us a few problems, particularly with his kicking game",2
" That definitely put us under some pressure in that first halfThe Lions were ultimately grateful to Owen Farrell, who came on to replace an out-of-sorts Jonathan Sexton, and the influential Teo",2
" Ive said all along that we didnt pick Ben Teo just to bash up over the gainline, Gatland said",1
" His footwork and some of the subtleties in his game were impressive and he had a really strong performance carrying It was a good start for him: he was accurate, played well and caused a lot of problems",2
"Asked if Sextons difficult night leaves him trailing the Saracens man for the No10 Test jersey, Gatland said: Thats pretty unfair in making an assessment like that",1
" Owen Farrell has a big match temperament, theres no doubt",1
" I would have been happier if hed knocked over that one he put against the post, that might have given us an easier last 10 minutes But hes played some pretty good rugby in the last 18 months and hes one of the standout performers in northern hemisphere rugbyGatland will stick to his plan of fielding an entirely different starting side at Eden Park Asked how many changes he will make on Wednesday, Gatland said: Fifteen The plan is everyone gets a start in the first three games",5
"The All Blacks, meanwhile, are sweating over fresh injury doubts to two key backs with the first Test against the Lions just three weeks away Ryan Crotty (ribs) and Ben Smith (concussion) both had to leave the field in the second half of the Crusaders 25-22 Super Rugby win over the Highlands in Christchurch Smith has now been concussed five times in the past five years and hooker Dane Coles is also still suffering from recurring concussion symptoms",3
 Crotty is now certain sure to miss the Crusaders match against the Lions next Saturday with the All Blacks captain Kieran Read also sitting out the game,1
"Next season, assuming Liverpool can negotiate the play-off round, there will be five English clubs in the Champions League",1
" That is a large number, though it does not necessarily follow that a greater representation will lead to a better chance of English success",1
" Premier League sides have been struggling to impose themselves in Europe in recent years From a position a decade ago when finals were being reached on a regular basis and Uefa had genuine concerns when two English clubs faced each other in Moscow in 2008, the strength of the Premier League now seems to be an obstacle to progress in Europe rather than the money and attention grabber that once threatened dominationChelsea were the last English team to appear in a final, when they won the event on penalties in Munich in 2012, though the reality of the past five years has been that English clubs have rarely been around to contest the later stages of the knockout rounds",3
" Leicester City did surprisingly well to reach the quarter-finals this year, which was better than more experienced teams such as Arsenal and Manchester City managed",1
"City had reached the semi-final stage a year earlier, though in Manuel Pellegrinis final season there was no real expectation that they could summon the self-belief or strength of character to see off Real Madrid and they duly went out without scoring a goal over two legs The year before that, none of the four English teams managed to reach the last eight, and Liverpool did not even survive the group stageVarious theories have been advanced as to why English clubs have fallen off the pace in Europe Some say the Premier League is too difficult and unforgiving, leaving little spare energy for extra commitments in midweek Others believe the English competition is vastly overrated and its crash-bang-wallop players are quickly found out when confronted by continental levels of technique and organisation",5
"Leaving that argument for another day, the fact is that English clubs have ground to make up on their European counterparts, particularly Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich Short of signing up three-quarters of the Monaco team, a good idea but probably not a practical one, what can English clubs do to put themselves back into contention for Champions League finals? Is there any hope of significant improvement next season, or will we simply end up with five disappointing campaigns instead of four? Everyone is promising a busy summer, even Arsenal, who are only in the Europa League, but here is a quick look at what each of the Champions League contenders might need to boost their chances",2
"By far the most robust team in England last season, with a simple system that not only works but suits all the players at Antonio Contes disposal, there were nevertheless signs towards the end that the champions could be stopped Though NGolo Kant and Nemanja Matic are good at the destructive duties required of defensive midfielders there could be a little more creativity in that area, otherwise too much of the burden falls on Eden HazardChelsea will also have to resolve the Diego Costa situation, either by keeping him or by bringing in a striker of similar quality There are not too many of those and even Romelu Lukaku would strike some as an inferior replacement Chelsea have been linked with the unsettled Real Madrid forward lvaro Morata, though the Spain international reportedly favours a move back to Italy",5
"Spurs were great at home last season but out of Europe by Christmas, partly down to playing their Champions League games at Wembley They will be playing all their games there this season so they had better get used to it, though it is still reasonable to pose the question of what Mauricio Pochettino considers his priority Spurs would not mind a good run in Europe but they probably do not see themselves as potential finalists just yet whereas, with a favourable wind and a couple of tweaks to the team, they ought to have a very good chance of winning the Premier LeagueTottenham have not won the title since 1961 but first things first Some of the Spurs players are already attracting interest from other clubs, so a concerted effort to finish on top in England next year would be a logical and desirable next step",5
"A defensive rethink is needed at the Etihad, beginning with the goalkeeper",1
" News that City are signing Benficas Ederson at least means Pep Guardiola has recognised the mistake he made with Claudio Bravo, after being in denial for most of the season City are fine at the front, they boast the Brazil and Argentina No9s in Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Agero and have plenty of quality in the support positions but they need a couple of full-backs and, as ever, cover at centre-half for Vincent Kompany",2
"Keeping both Agero and Jesus happy might be a problem but City mostly need to tighten their defence to stop conceding stupid goals, an observation made by Pellegrini at least three years agoLike Tottenham, Liverpool might be more tempted to put most of their energy into a title challenge rather than an extended run in Europe, though extended runs in Europe will never be disdained at Anfield",2
" Most feel Liverpool need a reliable goalscorer, having failed to end up with anyone in the Premier Leagues top 10 last season, though Jrgen Klopp may continue to trust Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man to contribute enough between them",1
" Apart from that a commanding goalkeeper and centre-half would not go amiss, and perhaps a driving presence in midfield Klopp also needs to evaluate his tactics Even without European involvement last season, Liverpool looked tired at the end",3
 This does not yet look like a side capable of terrorising Europe as of old,1
"United could do with Uefa relaxing Atltico Madrids transfer ban, if that is what is preventing Antoine Griezmann coming to Old Trafford The Frenchman has the class and imagination to be a crowd-pleaser at United and, if his long-predicted move must wait to January at the earliest, it could be too late to galvanise the European campaign",2
" United must keep hold of David de Gea, whatever the cost, and bring in a striker to take over from Zlatan IbrahimovicEven before the Swedes injury United were not scoring enough goals and, working on the theory that Jos Mourinho likes a big chap up front  Didier Drogba, Costa, Ibrahimovic, etc  Lukaku has been mentioned It has yet to be established whether Mourinho rates the Belgian any higher than he did when letting him leave Stamford Bridge, and United may end up trying to outbid Chelsea for MorataThe Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, has given his backing to the 2030 World Cup being held in England  or a combined British bidThe Slovenian said earlier in the week that it will be Europes turn to host the tournament, following 2022 in Qatar and a 2026 event tipped to take place in North America",5
" Ceferin has now gone further by backing a return to Britain for the first time since England hosted and won the 1966 World CupFor me, they are absolutely capable of organising it from an organisational point of view, from an infrastructure point of view, he told the BBC",2
" But of course its a decision not just for the FA, probably the government and all the others too But you know everything about English or British football, so they deserve to have a World Cup in the near futureI dont know how much encouragement they need, but they are capable of organising the World Cup, Im sure Thats the decision of the Football Association and if they decide to go, we will strongly support them They will have all our political support",5
" I just hope we will not have two European bidders, because that would not be good I think the ideal situation would be to have one European bidder, and then all of Europe stands together and we can achieve itCeferin also addressed the corruption scandal which saw his predecessor Michel Platini and the former Fifa president Sepp Blatter suspended from football for four and six years respectively",3
" The pair each had their bans cut from an initial eight years after appealing against sanctions relating to an illicit payment from Blatter to Platini in 2011With those  lets call them Fifa matters, even Uefas image was damaged, he said And it was not our fault",3
" OK, we also had some problems, but it was not to such an extent",1
 But I still think that Fifa is improving Things are changing,2
" Im sure its not easy, there are many internal interests, there are many, many people that were involved in Fifa and want to stay there But at the end, Fifa will have to change completely, or  it will hurt all the football organisations around the world",2
"Britain gets a taste of hosting a major event on Saturday evening with the Champions League final, between Juventus and Real Madrid, taking place in Cardiff It brings Reals Gareth Bale back to Wales after he helped his country memorably reach the semi-finals of Euro 2016, and Ceferin feels the occasion will help further Waless developmentIts quite different if you bring the Champions League final to a city like Cardiff compared to a city like London, he said London will not change if the Champions League final comes to town For Cardiff its a fantastic experience",5
 Its a bit of a challenge for us because of the lack of infrastructure  hotels and things like that  but Im sure that they will never forget it,1
" Its very important also for the development of football They had some fantastic results last year, especially at the Euro, and they have one of the best players in the world For a small country like that, its a fantastic result",3
"An underwhelming first night does not always mean a major production is in trouble Even the most gushing West End impresario, however, would struggle to claim the 2017 British & Irish Lions launched their tour of New Zealand in emphatic style Having been in the country just three days, they played like a team whose minds and bodies were still somewhere north of the equatorJetlag was clearly a factor, along with the ludicrously short amount of time the entire squad have spent together Then again, everyone knew that would be the case 12 months ago, once it became obvious the domestic finals would again be played a week before the first Lions game",5
" On this occasion it is less the players who should be blamed for underperformance and more the administrators who keep permitting these conflicts of interest to arise Add it all together and what should have been a gentle loosener against scratch opposition developed into something altogether less comfortableFor a while it looked as though the unthinkable might happen against a bunch of part-timers whose ranks included a sheep farmer, a shopkeeper, a nurse and a fruit picker",3
" The Lions have lost their opening tour game three times  in 1903 and 1924 in South Africa and in 1971 against Queensland  and they will be suitably grateful for the small mercy of victory, undistinguished or not Aside from the pre-match fireworks, the evenings brightest sparks were probably Ben Teo, Kyle Sinckler and Taulupe Faletau who all showed up well",2
" Sadly, at least half a dozen others did their chances of making the Test team no good at all, for all Warren Gatlands insistence this performance was no big deal Jonathan Sextons form urgently needs rebooting and not many New Zealanders went away overly impressedLittle went right from the outset, with the home side looking much the brighter team and deservedly leading 7-3 at half-time Only after Owen Farrell replaced the out-of-sorts Sexton on 48 minutes, and his fellow Saracens Mako Vunipola, George Kruis and Jamie George were thrown into the fray, did the Lions edge ahead through a face-saving try in the 52nd minute from Anthony Watson The last quarter, with Rhys Webb also making a difference at scrum-half, proved marginally less uncomfortable",5
"With a desperately tough schedule ahead, Gatland will be particularly concerned at the lack of penetration up front and the failure of his backs to outshine a team composed of players from below the top tier of New Zealand provincial rugby His only real consolation was the excellent performance of his talented son, Bryn, at fly-half for the Barbarians Otherwise, he has a raft of issues to address before Wednesdays first midweek game against Auckland at Eden Park, with the unbeaten Super Rugby leaders, the Crusaders, to follow in Christchurch next Saturday",3
"Then again, it could always have been the craftiest of double bluffs If it was, it worked spectacularly There are no shortage of harsh judges in New Zealand and some were already dismissing these Lions before the game had reached the half-hour mark",3
" Hogg, youre the worst full-back ever seen in New Zealand, you muppet, yelled one wag Why isnt Susan Boyle playing? It is going to be an extremely long six weeks if the Lions do not improve very, very quickly but, equally, credit should be given to the sprightly BarbariansDrawn from lower-ranked New Zealand provincial sides, they have been waiting a long time to show these Lions what they can do and were a credit to the coaching of, among others, the former Bath and Saracens winger Joe Maddock Their captain and hooker, Sam Anderson-Heather, scored a good first-half try and the full-back, Luteru Laulala, may now find himself fielding inquiries from interested suitors By comparison, the Lions looked as leaden as the skies around Whangarei in the buildup to the game",5
"Looking at the pristine surface it was hard to believe the biblical pre-match weather had been the primary topic of conversation A lack of moisture is rarely a problem in this part of the world but even by local standards the 24 pre-game hours of torrential rain were extreme Had the fixture been played on Friday evening, both sides would have needed snorkels",3
" History, instead, will record a Lions victory in front of a sell-out crowd, with both sides failing to take decent chances close to the lineThe Northland public would have liked to have seen their one-time local favourite Jared Payne, only for injury to intervene and deprive him of a return to the so-called House of Payne In the event they saw Teo, who spent part of his youth playing north of Auckland in Silverdale, lay down a challenge to the other No12s on the trip with a smoothly composed performance that supported Gatlands assertion there is much more to the centre than running straight and hardOverall, it was yet another iffy opening game to set alongside the broiling 2013 affair in Hong Kong and the rusty 2009 fixture against a Royal XV in Rustenberg On both occasions the Lions went on to either win or threaten to win the series, while even the illustrious boys of 1971 lost their opening fixture en route to New Zealand",5
" Not necessarily the end of the world, then, but absolutely nothing to be enthused about eitherThe former Bundesliga team 1860 Munich face demotion to Germanys fourth or fifth tier after failing to meet a deadline for a third-division licence",2
"1860 were due to make a payment of reportedly 5m to 10m to the German football federation for the licence by Friday afternoon, but their financial backer Hasan Ismaik said through his company HAM that he was not prepared to pay it because 1860 refuses to make necessary changes to solve the many issues facing the club",1
" Ismaik, a Jordanian billionaire who owns 60% of 1860, was the clubs only hope of meeting the payment deadline1860 were relegated from Germanys second division on Tuesday after a play-off defeat to Jahn Regensburg, a team who were playing fourth-tier football the season before",2
"Despite missing the payment, Ismaik said he will continue to support the club at the fourth or fifth level and push forward necessary changes The statement added: His emotional ties to 1860 and his loyalty to the fans remains strong The financial commitment to the beneficial work of TSV 1860 is also not affected by the aforementioned business decisionIsmaik is at loggerheads with those remaining at the club over changes he wants pushed through that 1860 said on Thursday the club cannot fulfill for legal and organisational reasons The Sddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that Ismaik, who only has 49% voting rights at 1860 in line with the Bundesligas 50-plus-1 regulation, has made his financial support dependent on conditions that would have given him more power",5
" The 50-plus-1 rule seeks to limit the influence of external backersIsmaik, who did not attend Tuesdays play-off defeat, has denied any responsibility for the clubs plight and accused management of unscrupulous power struggles",2
" President Peter Cassalette and chief executive Ian Ayre resigned on Tuesday, leaving vice-presidents Heinz Schmidt and Hans Sitzberger in chargeThe play-off loss at home was marred by violence from angry fans Around 1,000 riot police lined up to prevent the situation escalating as the game was held up for 15 minutes",3
"1860 had the third most expensive squad in the second division after Stuttgart and Hannover, who both secured their return to the Bundesliga",1
" 1860 finished third from bottom, leading to the play-off against the third divisions third-place finisher",1
"1860, who won the Bundesliga in 1966 and played in the top flight as recently as 2004, returned to the third level for the first time in 24 years, but Fridays missed deadline means they will drop even further",1
" 1860s under-21, under-19, under-17 and under-16 teams were also relegated this seasonScoring goals is not something Real Madrid usually have a problem with",2
" They have scored in every game this season and have not failed to score since Manchester City stopped them in the Champions League semi-final last year, a run of 64 games in a row in which they have found the net If any team can stop them, though, it is Juventus, who have let in only three goals in 12 European games this season and only 27 in 38 in Serie A, and are equally comfortable in either a back three or a back four",2
" So how do you score against Max Allegris side?The first question, perhaps, is what shape Juve will use",1
" Juve began the season with a back three but seemed to struggle to accommodate two of their new signings, Gonzalo Higuan and Miralem Pjanic From the beginning of December, the 4-2-3-1 became more prominent and, after a 2-1 defeat at Fiorentina with a back three in January, it became the default, producing Juves best football of the seasonBut the back three returned for the semi-final against Monaco, for two reasons",3
" Monaco play a 4-4-2 with the midfield very narrow and attacking fullbacks Using three central defenders meant both that Juve were competing three v two at the back, four v four in the middle (albeit in differing alignments) and that their wing-backs could then engage the Monaco full-backs high up the pitch, something that worked so well Dani Alves set up three and scored one of their four goalsWhat shape Juve use in the Champions League final probably depends how they expect Madrid to line up",3
" If Gareth Bale starts then it will probably be a 4-3-3; if Isco plays, as seems more probable, Madrid will be in more of a 4-3-1-2 Then the challenge for Juve becomes more similar to the one Monaco posed: two central forwards, a midfield that plays narrow and attacking full-backs, which may encourage the use of a the 3-4-2-1 againThat presents Madrid with a number of problems",3
" Cristiano Ronaldo remains a wonderful footballer and his finishing is remarkable, as his eight goals over the last two rounds have proved, but he is not as mobile as he once was He will not, as he might have done in the past, move into the area behind Dani Alves, isolate and beat Andrea Barzagli Against Atltico Madrid in the semi-final, in fact, it was noticeable that it was Karim Benzema pulling into those wide areas behind the full-backs that led to Iscos goal in the second leg",3
Perhaps that is an avenue for Madrid to exploit but forwards have been looking for the space behind Dani Alves for years without a huge amount of success (even if Monacos goal in the semi-final did come down his flank),1
" Besides, this is not the back four of Atltico, it is a back three and there is probably no side that has been as comfortable in that shape defensively as Juve over the past few seasons The match-up between Dani Alves and Marcelo on that flank will be key, and while its probably true that the younger man has improved over the past couple of seasons, its not insignificant that, in 19 previous meetings between the Brazilians, Marcelo has lost 13 times and won just threeBoth Benzema and Ronaldo, of course, are capable of a moment of brilliance that could turn any game, but Juve will be confident enough in the capacity of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Barzagli to handle them",3
" Besides which, the ball has to get to the Madrid front two Isco looks like having the playmaking role but he will probably be up against Pjanic and either Sami Khedira or Claudio Marchisio Given Pjanic will push forwards, Juve have in effect four and a half central players deep against three",3
That makes two factors vitally important if Madrid are to break Juve down,1
" One is that their midfield three of Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos can dominate with their slight numerical advantage against Mario Mandzukic, Paulo Dybala and half of Pjanic And the second is that their fullback pairing of Danilo and Marcelo can make some inroads against Dani Alves and Alex Sandro",2
"There is, of course, always the possibility of Sergio Ramos scoring from a set play in a third final  and Madrid will note that six of the 27 goals Juve conceded in Serie A this season were from corners  but Juventus, if they go with the back three, look as well equipped as anybody, both in terms of shape and personnel, to thwart MadridThat may be a case for Madrid to start Bale despite his lack of match fitness, or perhaps Marco Asensio, and operate a 4-3-3  or play Isco wide in that system",2
" Either way, Zinedine Zidane cannot let the game become too channelled down the centre, and in this case, he probably cannot rely on his full-backs, who have been excellent this season, to provide widthIt is customary when India play Pakistan at cricket to dwell on the astonishing scale and sweep of the spectacle",2
" The usual starting figure of half a billion global television viewers is expected for both teams opening Champions Trophy game on Sunday at Edgbaston There will, of course, be the usual fascination beyond the sports pages, too, at a group-stage game of a moderately sized competition in a glitzed-up old colonial sport that can still feed out into a wider geopolitical obsession Perhaps the notion of cricket diplomacy will once again be raised, the idea that playing one another at cricket might somehow act as a balm to an irreconcilably raw neighbourly partition",3
"In which case everyone involved had better get a shift on The Kashmir border between these two nations remains one of the most dangerous places in the world, stage for a constant dirty war, with the shadow of scattered short-range nuclear weapons always lurking For all the hands-across-the-boundary-rope noises around Edgbaston, Indias sports minister, Vijay Goel, announced only this week that there would be no return to bilateral relations, declaring that cricket and terrorism cant go hand in handWith this in mind, it is easy to forget just how profoundly Pakistan and India have grown apart on a sporting level, too, with a decade of debilitating isolationism on one hand and a hothoused cricketing boom on the other The English summer will see the 10-year anniversary of the jumping-off point for this, the 2007 World T20 final in Johannesburg, first in a series of events, sporting and otherwise, that have seen the cricket war swing irreversibly one way",5
To an extent Indias players have even outgrown the current occasion The spectaculars tend to come thick and fast in the year-round riches of franchise cricket,2
" A billion sets of eyeballs also tuned in for this seasons IPL, a World Cup that India win every year, and from which Pakistani players and coaches have been excluded since 2008Twenty-five years ago Pakistan were one-day world champions and one half of what was then the most lucrative summer staged in England, that febrile 1992 tour that left Imran Khan declaring that no Pakistan team would ever visit England again",2
" A quarter of a century on, Edgbaston will see a meeting between crickets new financial power and a shrunken, scattered Pakistan, nomadic, broke and eating off its knees in the sculleryAt which point the screen freezes, wind chimes tinkle and were back in September 2007 at The Wanderers",2
" India had come into the first World T20 with little expectation but sailed into the final on an updraft of thrilling off-the-cuff cricket Still Pakistan seemed to be in charge at the death, nine wickets down but with Misbah ul-Haq leading the chase and needing six runs from the last four balls At which point Misbah ambled across his stumps and ballooned a horrible standing sweep into the hands of Sreesanth at short fine leg India erupted India hasnt really stopped erupting since",5
" And the rest is (Indian) historyCue instant ignition as board, government and corporate sponsors piled in",2
" The India players were given an instant $3m cash bonus (Yuvraj got a quarter of a million dollars for hitting Stuart Broad for six sixes) Joginder Sharma, the bowler as Misbah cranked out that sweep, received $50,000 cash from a local government department",2
" The civil aviation authority handed out years of free flights for all involved Within four months the first IPL auction had been held History was falling into place, that gleaming future lining itself up",3
"From that moment of playing parity in Johannesburg, Pakistan began to head off the other way almost instantly Bruised by various gambling scandals, cast in shadow by the car bomb outside the New Zealand team hotel in 2002, it was the attack on Sri Lankas bus in Lahore in 2009 that signalled the start of Pakistani isolation",2
" The spot-fixing affair of 2010 capped a sense of drift and debauchery within the team itselfAs the captain, Misbah offered stability and grace in the lost years Pakistan were, briefly, Test crickets No1 team last year The old, mad, damaging individualism has been reined in But it is hard to avoid the obvious sense of drift",5
" Despite a culture of vibrant, aggressive cricket apparently suited to the new white-ball world, Pakistan instead have been left behind, a skeleton team stuck on the wrong side of history",1
There has been brilliance in Younis Khans batting and Yasir Shahs Test-match bowling,1
" But this is, out of necessity, a more pious, mannered, careful Pakistan, without the exoticism, the wildness, the urbane qualities of the years before the domestic ban They are eighth in the official one-day international rankings and only just made the cut-off for this Champions Trophy",2
" Fielding has been a problem for some time The batsmens strike rates are noticeably down on modern trends, a startling development in itself for the heirs of Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar and the great all-rounders",2
And yet  as ever in a nation that sweats cricket out of every pore  there is still hope,1
 The departure of Misbah and Younis was rightly mourned Both had moved on from white-ball cricket but the old lions passing coincides with a wider sense of pruning back Only two members of the team that lost to India at the 2015 World Cup are likely to play in Birmingham,3
" Ties with the dreaded Akmals appear to have been severed, Umar Akmal failing a fitness test in Birmingham this month, having previously passed one under the aegis of the renowned fitness fanatic Inzamam-ul-Haq",1
" Shahid Afridi really does seem to have suffered his final silver-bullet retirement, nailed down at last inside hiscasket",1
New talent is emerging,1
" Sadly the bullish Sharjeel Khan is missing, touched by the Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal But Sarfraz Ahmed is both a fine attacking bat and an interesting captain in this format Shadab Khan is a prodigious leg-spinner who rips the ball and is exactly half as old as his team-mate, the enduring Mohammad Hafeez",3
" In the warm-up against Bangladesh Faheem Ashraf, a seam-bowling all-rounder, spanked 60 from 34 balls to win the gameBest of all Mohammad Amir, the superstar that might have been, shows signs of rediscovering his swing after working with Azhar Mahmood during the tour of the West Indies Amir is a walking, breathing metaphor for Pakistans state of suspended animation, the most prodigious talent in cricket in 2010, brought low by his own weakness, but a bowler who has still played only 32 ODIs, eight years after his debut",3
"There could be no better time to rediscover not just Amirs own world-class nip but that wider sense of Pakistan-issue aggression, the verve and skill that is so suited to modern white-ball cricket, but which has for the last decade been left to wither a little in the shadow of an all-conquering neighbourOh my goodness, me? Run? You are joking, arent you? No, honestly, Im so unfit,look at the state of me, practically expired getting here fromthe car park, no, I think Ill sitthis one out, thanks very much",2
" God, look at her doing stretches in her leggings and everything, anyonewould think it actually mattered",1
" The last competitive sport I did was the egg and spoon when I was about six, put me off for life You know, Im not even suremothers races actually set agood example for the kids, all thecoming first and body shaming that goes on No, darling, Mummy is absolutely not running  well Iknow I did last year, got talked intoit, came first, amazingly, didnt I,darling, but Im sure Ive gained acouple of pounds since then",3

"Jack ONeill, the eye patch-wearing surfing pioneer who helped invent the wetsuit and created one of the worlds best-known surf brands, has died at the age of 94ONeill  who went on in later life to champion marine environmental causes  died of natural causes on Friday at his oceanfront home in Santa Cruz, California, his family said in a statement He was 94",3
"The ocean lover wanted to be able to surf longer in the frigid northern California ocean and experimented with various materials to create a lining that made the first neoprene wetsuit wearableHis death comes a week after California lost another of its treasures: Surfer magazine founder John Severson at age 83 His magazine, which started out as simply a promotional pamphlet for his surf films, became required reading for surfers in the 1960s and carried spellbinding images and tales to an audience starved of such rich mediaONeills wetsuit discovery came about after he moved with his wife to San Franciscos Ocean Beach neighbourhood in the early 1950sONeill said that at the time his friends didnt have much faith in his invention",5
" All my friends said, ONeill, you will sell to five friends on the beach and then you will be out of business, he would remark, according to his family",1
"In San Francisco he opened one of the areas first surf shops but in 1959 moved his growing family 75 miles (120km) south to Santa Cruz, where he opened his second shop to cater to the citys growing surf scene",1
" The surfing accident in which he lost an eye came about in the 1970sBy the 1980s, ONeill had become the worlds largest recreation wetsuit designer and manufacturer and the ONeill surf brand had reached Australia, Europe, Japan and other corners of the globeHe considered ONeill Sea Odyssey, a marine and environmental education program for children, his proudest achievement",3
" Founded in 1996, it has taken nearly 100,000 school-aged children in his personal Team ONeill catamaran to the Monterey bay national marine sanctuary to learn about the ocean",1
"The ocean is alive and weve got to take care of it, ONeill said about the program",1
 There is no doubt in my mind that the ONeil Sea Odyssey is the best thing Ive ever doneAssociated Press contributed to this reportSamantha Stosur believes she is peaking beautifully for another second-week tilt at the French OpenAustralias lone singles survivor headed into the fourth round for the sixth time in Paris with a 6-2 6-2 dispatch of American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands,3
Stosur blew Mattek-Sands off the court in barely an hour to set up a last-16 meeting on Sunday with Latvian Jelena Ostapenko,1
"A quarter-final against former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova or Caroline Wozniacki looks imminent as Stosur showcased her title credentials with four aces, seven service breaks and some of the fastest deliveries of the championshipsYet to drop a set all tournament, the victory in Stosurs milestone 50th match at Roland Garros was her eighth in a row on European clay and thrust the 33-year-old firmly in the frame for overdue glory after a series of shattering near-missesIm really pleased that Ive been able to continue this form and get another straight-sets win, Stosur said",3
"I feel like I probably played a bit better again today and, yeah, Im just really, really happy",1
"Bethanie can be a really dangerous player She obviously likes to play really aggressive and coming to net, kind of play big, and do all these things, and if youre not on and doing the right things against her, then she could make life very difficultBut I felt like every time she maybe had a bit of an opportunity or something like that, I was able to play a bit better and, yeah, kind of squash that and then get myself ahead againSo just really pleased that I was able to play as well as I didMattek-Sands trudged onto Court 3 with her left thigh heavily strapped and made a horrible start",5
The six-time grand slam doubles champion was flabbergasted when foot-faulted on the second point of the match,1
"No way, Mattek-Sands repeatedly protested to the chair umpireI never foot faultRattled, she dropped her opening two service games as Stosur steamed to a 3-0 lead for the loss of only three points",3
"Mattek-Sands finally got on the board in the fourth game but Stosur broke straight back before clinching the first set in 31 minutesThe pair traded early breaks in the second set as Australias former finalist sloppily dropped serve from 40-15 up in the fourth gameBut as hovering storm clouds threatened to stall Stosurs progression, the 23rd seed wrestled back control with some piercing backhand return passes and her trademark forehand power",3
Clapping thunder almost forced the pair off court with Stosur five points from victory,1
"But after consulting officials, the umpire allowed the combatants to play on, with Stosur eventually wrapping up the match in one hour and 10 minutes",1
"Luck in running may play a significant part in todays Derby, for which the 19-runner field is the biggest in more than a decade Anything that misses the kick as the stalls open will probably be trapped in the back half of the field for the first mile and will need things to fall right if they are to catch the front-runners in time",2
"That must be a concern for fans of the two market leaders, Cliffs Of Moher and Cracksman, neither of which bounced from the stalls with much alacrity when last seen",1
" It may be a particular issue for the inexperienced Cracksman, who was helped by a steady pace and a small field when taking a prominent early position despite his slowish start here in AprilThe Epsom surface still seemed to be riding quick despite the rain on Oaks day, so the percentage call must be to find something that can take a reasonably handy early position before staying on strongly, a formula that turned up Harzand last year Venice Beach (4",3
30) could be the one this time at odds of 14-1,1
"It has been slightly surprising to see this one allowed to remain at such big odds despite winning the Chester Vase last month Aidan OBrien generally runs a strong Derby contender in that race, did the double with Ruler Of The World and has also been second in the Derby with two other Vase winnersVenice Beach has taken time to show ability but that is hardly surprising for quite a stoutly bred sort, being by Galileo out of the mare who produced Danedream",3
" That pedigree suggests he should be on a strong upward curve at this stage of his careerOn jockey bookings he is only OBriens third string but the race may pan out well for him and his pilot, Donnacha OBrien, son of the trainer",2

"50 Annie SaltsIt is at such moments, in the final game of a demanding period which involves playing three times in eight days, that one may learn most about a side However, in a week which has featured criticism aplenty from coaches and players alike, the most obvious lesson of all was how it is perhaps more important to seek out quality, rather than quantity, if the sport is indeed to undergo a restructuring this winter",2
"For those arguing that the sports stars are playing too often, this was the ideal night to press home their case",1
" If any of the Rugby Football League came along to watch a game which featured almost as many penalties as points, they would have surely found it hard to disagree One double-header weekend over Easter is congestion enough but another  squeezed in to allow an England pre-season training camp in Dubai which never actually happened  is clearly too much of a strain",2
"Im pleased we won and its obvious some things in offence werent right but what do you expect? Its three games in eight days, said the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott",1
 Where we are now is crazy It just doesnt work Rugby league is one of the hardest sports in the worldWhether schedules with two such weekends in six weeks continue into 2018 is unconfirmed but on this evidence a sport which prides itself on the quality and entertainment it so often provides is being cruelly let down by congestion in the calendarThere were some positives for both sides,5
 For Leeds there was the response from Mondays defeat by Widnes with two hard-earned points strengthening their place in the top four as the final rounds of the regular season approach An eight-day break before their next fixture will feel like a pre-season nowLeigh arrived buoyed by their first Super League victory in more than two months last weekend and with quiet confidence that they could become only the second team to win at Headingley this year,3
" Amid the conjecture they produced a heartening display which will give their fans hope they can yet avoid the Qualifiers and a battle against relegation this summerBoth sides played their part in the first half but inevitably fatigue took its toll after the break That there were 26 penalties did little to improve the occasion, with James Childs whistle contributing to a lacklustre second half",3
"The sin-binning of Antoni Maria two minutes after half-time allowed Leeds to improve their four-point half-time lead to 16-10 and after a sustained period of pressure on the Centurions line, the hosts further increased their advantage when Danny McGuire kicked through for Adam Cuthbertson to touch downLeeds had further opportunities to kill the game but their attack had the look of a side who had been pushed through the rigours of three games in a week Fortunately for the hosts, Cory Patersons late try was no more than consolation for the Centurions, who had fought valiantly throughoutLeeds Sutcliffe; Briscoe, Watkins, Moon, Hall; McGuire, Burrow; Singleton, Parcell, Garbutt, Ferres, Jones-Buchanan, Cuthbertson Interchange Galloway, Ablett, Mullally, Handley",5

"Referee J Child Attendance 13,445Andy Murray believes he and Juan Martn del Potro left an equal number of psychological bruises on each other in two epic five-set matches last year but he discounts the notion he is not playing well enough to beat the Argentinian in the third round of the French Open on SaturdayThe Davis Cup [which Del Potro won] was physically tough for me because it came off the back of a long summer, Murray said after a four-set struggle to get past the world No50 Martin Klizan on Thursday",2
" The Olympics [which went Murrays way] was physically and mentally hard  and psychologically but I had also come off a period of rest and trained and prepared for it When we got to the Davis Cup, Id played the Olympics, gone to Cincinnati and then New York That was tough After that I didnt feel great for the next couple of days, [playing] the doubles and singlesBut he also will remember those matches",5
" They werent easy for him, either, they were tough",1
" I will try to make it the same for him again on SaturdayFor insight from close to the Murray camp but sufficiently detached to lend perspective, his brother Jamie was the go-to source on Friday, after his own doubles success with Bruno Soares: 6-1, 7-6 (7-2) in an hour and 21 minutes over the Russians Mikhail Elgin and Karen KhachanovHe has had a rough year from a results point of view, but also because his health has not been good at all, the elder Murray brother said",3
" He has been really unlucky He had shingles, then he had his elbow stuff and then he has been ill in Miami and ill again here He has been ill in between that",3
 So it has not been easy  he has not had a clear run at anything I think that has been frustrating for him,2
"He has been unfortunate but things can turn around fast If he has a great tournament here, he can feel great going on to grass and have a great Wimbledon In six weeks time, you guys will be writing that he is great again",3
" Things can change fastNor did he share the downbeat assessment of his brothers chances at Roland Garros Greg Rusedski, the former British No1, said if Murray played as poorly as he did against Klizan he would struggle to beat Del Potro  which is a fair enough view  but Jamie sees an upside",3
"If he keeps winning, his tournament can change quickly He has not played amazingly in the first two matches but he is winning  that is what matters at the start of a tournament You can see in the doubles here, all the seeds are losing so all you can do is keep trying to win and take advantage of that if you get the chanceBut that stuff happens in grand slams If he can hang around long enough and he finds himself in the quarters or semi-finals, he knows what it takes to win those matches",5
That is true,1
" Last year, Murray survived two five-set matches at the start and reached the final against Novak Djokovic The players at the very top of the game have gears the others do not If Murray gets into the second week of the tournament and has shaken off the last dregs of the cold that laid him low at the start of this week, he will be as dangerous as a world No1 should be",3
"Murray Sr said Kyle Edmunds excellent run into the third round will be mutually beneficial to them, as well Edmund looked superb on Thursday beating Renzo Olivo in three sets, after the Argentinians heroic performance to put Jo-Wilfried Tsonga out of the tournament Edmund will play the hard-serving South African Kevin Anderson on SaturdayFrom my point of view, if he is doing well in a tournament and Kyle or Dan [Evans] or the girls are doing well, it is cool You can kind of feed off that a bit",5
" It is a nice atmosphere to have somebody else to root for in the tournament I am sure everybody else likes that as wellNevertheless, Murray might find it tougher beating Del Potro than Edmund will against Anderson",3
 The British pair can only meet in the semi-finals  but that is a dream for later,1
Twelve thousand miles away from Downing Street there is another race for No10 going on The British & Irish Lions management have their own big decision to make this week and it is not as clear-cut as it looked a couple of months ago either,2
" Once the Lions have finished their third fixture of the tour against the Crusaders next Saturday, they will have little option but to nominate their preferred fly-half to face the All Blacks",1
The opening tour match against a New Zealand Provincial Barbarians XV in a rain-lashed Northland on Saturday is unlikely to supply all the answers,1
" Barring something remarkable, a comfortable Lions win is anticipated and the fixture will not solely determine whether Irelands Johnny Sexton retains the shirt he filled with such distinction on the 2013 tour to Australia The respective body language of Sexton and his main rival, Owen Farrell, nevertheless, will tell the coaches plentyWith Waless Dan Biggar also in the mix, the Lions could hardly have named a more competitive trio of fly-halves",3
" Sexton is theoretically the man in possession but he is four years older now Farrell, an apprentice last time, is snapping at the boots of his one-time master and has just steered his club to consecutive European triumphs Biggar has long been one of Warren Gatlands key lieutenants Those who assume Farrell, as he does with England, will shift to the No12 jersey alongside Sexton for the big games are getting slightly ahead of themselvesSextons selection at Whangareis Toll Stadium underlined the sense of uncertainty",5
" The Leinster pivot endured such a grim evening in the Pro12 final defeat to Scarlets last month he needed to get back on the first available horse Picking Farrell on the bench also offers Gatland and his coaches the chance  potentially at least  of giving the Sexton-Farrell 10-12 axis a brief whirl With preparation time so limited, they need to know as soon as possible if that idea is a runner on grass as well as paper",3
Hence why the body language matters,1
" Sometimes a combination clicks immediately; other pairings can resemble two unrelated fish On the 2009 Lions tour to South Africa the instant midfield rapport between Jamie Roberts and Brian ODriscoll was a gloriously snug fit from the outset Should Sexton and Farrell be half as comfortable in each others company, Gatland will be hugely encouraged",3
"The alternative scenario is rather more awkward The chances are Sexton and Farrell will start together against the Crusaders in Christchurch; if the touring team are picked apart by Super Rugbys team of the moment, Gatland may well opt to go with a stronger-running 12 such as Ben Teo or Robbie Henshaw and consider Farrell primarily as a 10",2
" Any hint of a sluggish start to the tour by Sexton and the possible ramifications scarcely need spelling outNor does the necessity, for the Lions, of picking a fly-half who can shape the entire series",2
" This is not any old job: whoever wears the red Lions No10 jersey in New Zealand will inevitably hear plenty about Barry Johns brilliance in 1971Last time around in 2005, Dan Carter delivered a classic fly-half performance in the second Test in Wellington",2
" If the modern All Blacks are to be outwitted, the Lions chief playmaker will have to relegate the gifted Beauden Barrett to a supporting roleSexton would not be human if some, or all, of the above have not flashed across his mind in recent weeks",2
" As recently as March he was orchestrating Irelands Six Nations win over England in Dublin but he has endured a stop-start season and his pale features do not currently exude total confidence Gatland is certainly giving him no guarantees We want to see how those players go at 10 in the first three games, the coach said",3
" Thats our first instinct at the moment: were considering them as 10sRegarding Sexton specifically, there was also a revealing pause when the Irishmans prospects were mentioned He knows he needs to get some games under his belt, murmured Gatland, choosing his words carefully",3
 He knows the competition is pretty fierce in that position but hes a competitor and thats what has made him one of the best 10s in world rugby,1
"There is certainly no sense from Sexton that Farrell will be playing at 12 Honestly, youd have to ask the coaches, the 31-year-old said They havent given any hints that Owen will play there Hes had some great success with England at 12 but also hes had great success with Saracens at 10 Maybe theyll try him there, maybe they wont",5
" Hes obviously coming in as favourite to start somewhere Ive got to concentrate on bringing the best performances out of myself and see where that gets me If its not good enough, well I can live with that",3
" Hopefully it will beThe 27-year-old Biggar will have something to say about that, particularly if he gives an authoritative performance against the Blues on Wednesday All three contenders also know this tour will be physically draining, with injuries certain to play some part",3
" Its the hardest place to tour because of how attritional the games will be, Sexton said Youre playing against the best in the world andthis tour will be different from the last one because the pre-Test games will be really tough",2
 That will be good forus; if we can perform well and get some confidence well be match-hardened come the TestsThe first few games will be particularly instructive; if the Lions are still undefeated by next Saturday night they will be highly encouraged,2
" Downing New Zealand takes some doing but Ireland managed it last autumnYou cant sit back against them, thats the one thing I think the Irish guys might tell the other guys, Sexton added",2
 Youve got to keep attacking no matter what the scoreline You saw that in Chicago,2
 When we sat back we conceded two or three tries,1
" Its not just attacking with ball in hand, it can be an attacking kicking game and defence as well Sexton knows how to win this Lions series but first he has to get himself re-elected",2
"Matt Mullan is relishing the chance to lock horns with Argentinas scrum on Englands forthcoming two-Test tour and believes a strong showing against the Pumas may enhance his claim to hold on to the No1 jerseyWith Joe Marler and Mako Vunipola away with the Lions, the Wasps loosehead prop is vying with Ellis Genge for a starting berth against Argentina, traditional heavyweights at the scrum Of the 30 players unavailable to Eddie Jones 10 are front-rows but the head coach has challenged his current squad to keep those injured or away out of the side when they return",3
"If you get a chance when you are out there, then you want to try and play as well as you can, said Mullan",1
" If you are the last person in that shirt in Eddies eyes, then that could stand you in good stead next time he selects a group Against Argentina there is a combination of technique and size and they pride themselves on that area  it is traditionally a strength of theirs and we know it is going to be a challenge We will have to do our homework but that scrum battle is going to be important out thereIn an effort to build camaraderie and encourage competition Jones arranged a quiz night for his 32-man squad  split into four teams of eight  on Wednesday The referee Wayne Barnes wrote it, Englands defence coach, Paul Gustard, was quizmaster and Dylan Hartleys side won",5
 This competitive element has continued in the gym and around the training camp,1
Its a bit of a challenge and it picks up each team,1
" Having not met some of the boys before you get the chance to sit and talk to them, added Mullan It is just a really nice way to interact and get to know each other a bit quickerChris Robshaw trained alone at a public session at Twickenham on Friday because of a sore ankle but Gustard is confident he will be fit to take part in the first Test, a week on Saturday Marland Yarde, who joined up with the squad at the start of the week and went on stand-by in case Denny Solomona failed to recover from his ankle injury, will travel to ArgentinaThe fact Northern Ireland took on this friendly at all, sandwiched between training camps in England and Turkey, is testament to a level of diligence which continues to bear fruit",5
The key aspiration was not to beat New Zealand  albeit that will maintain confidence in a squad which now punches well above its weight as standard  but to build towards next Saturdays crucial World Cup qualifier in Azerbaijan Back-to-back tournament appearances is a legitimate aim for a team consigned to international footballs wilderness for years,2
"Northern Irelands manager, Michael ONeill, also has a selection dilemma he may well have predicted Ross Countys Liam Boyce notched his first goal for his country in an excellent 45-minute display",2
 Boyces claim to start in Baku before more established players is now a serious oneFor New Zealand this was a low-key opening to their Confederations Cup preparations,2
 Northern Irelands tempo was always vastly superiorBoyces career path has hardly been orthodox,2
" After a successful spell in the Irish League with Cliftonville, the Belfast boy was recruited by Werder Bremen If there was no shame in Boyce failing to make the grade in Germany, it was a surprise that he ended up back with his first club Another prolific period followed before joining Ross County",3
"The faith shown by the Scottish top flight club has been well founded, with Boyce returning 48 league goals in 80 starts In the campaign just ended, the 26-year-old was the top scorer in his domestic league Boyces next task is to carry this record into internationals, easing the burden on Kyle LaffertyLafferty, whose future is unclear after an unhappy spell at Norwich City, was left among ONeills substitutes here Boyce took full advantage of the faith bestowed on him by confidently cutting inside and lashing a left-foot shot beyond Stefan Marinovic after six minutes",5
" Only a fine Marinovic save prevented Boyces strike partner, Josh Magennis, from doubling the hosts lead in their next attackThat flow of pressure remained until half-time with the Leeds United striker Chris Wood barely afforded a touch Conor McLaughlin had the ball in the visitors net, with an earlier foul denying the full-back proper credit for a stunning half-volleyWith his work done, Boyce remained inside at the interval Laffertys impact was almost instant, the 29-year-old turning a Magennis cross from the right just wide",5
"Magennis was the next to try his luck, his header skimming the crossbar New Zealands best opportunity of the match came with 25 minutes to play, with substitute Kosta Barbarouses thwarted by the inside of the postSergio Ramos described it as a date with history, and it is one they have waited a long time for",3
" The last time Real Madrid were in this position, Alfredo Di Stfano played his final game for the club, departing bitterly after defeat by Helenio Herreras Internazionale",1
" Two years before, Ferenc Puskas scored three, but Eusebios goal denied them in Amsterdam; and the time before that, the last time they achieved what they seek to emulate on Saturday, Paco Gentos extra-time winner defeated Milan 3-2 at the Heysel StadiumThat was 59 years ago now, victory securing Madrids players 50,000 pesetas each, 25,000 per trophy: the bachelors earned 20 a month, married players 29, but all of them left Belgium 148 better off They had earned it: Madrid had just completed a league and European Cup doubleIt had happened before, in each of the two previous years, but it never happened again Until now? Madrid have won 27 league titles since and eight European Cups, but not in the same season",5
" Like in 1964 and 1962, they are 90 minutes away Inter and Benfica denied them then; Juventus stand before them and history now  and history, as Ramos said, really is the word, even for the biggest, most successful club there is",2
" Madrid have won 11 European Cups, but the last eight have come alone, stretching back to Brussels These players could achieve what Puskas, Amancio, Snchez, Butragueno, Zidane, and the original Ronaldo never didThroughout our history, Madrid are the team that has won the most",3
" We cant live off the past, but that badge imposes upon you and we know our obligations, Ramos said Our history is not coincidence For us this is an opportunity that this wonderful sport gives usIt is an opportunity to eclipse some of their most successful generations To do what Di Stfano, [Hctor] Rial and Gento did",5
" Much has changed since then, a long time has passed, a lot of players",1
" These are different days Pepe Santamara recalled that the bonus didnt go far Yesterday, Juventuss Dani Alves grinned that cheeky grin and said: the president promised us a red horse [a Ferrari] if we win  lets see if he delivers Madrids bonus is reportedly 15m euros each",5
" The enormity of the achievement warrants it, even for them After all, it is not just 1958, not just a wait of over half a century for this double; it is that another record stands before them: 25 years have passed since a team defended the European titleThis is a chance to win it for a second year in a row, Ramos said",3
" Back then, Carlo Ancelotti, the man who led Madrid to the dcima, their 10th European Cup three years ago, was on the pitch for Milan So were Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten",2
" In the Champions League era, no team has emulated that Milan team, not even those that have defined epochs like Arrigo Sacchis side did Juventus have been in consecutive finals but, having won it in 1996, in 1997 and 1998 they were defeated  as they would be again in 2003 and 2015",2
"Real Madrid have a feeling with finals; they are used to winning them, Gigi Buffon said, smiling slightly",1
" We, on the other hand, have lost a lot of finals For Madrid, it is 11 wins from 13, and three finals in four years, something Ramos described as barbaric For Juventus, it is two from eight We are going try to change our history, Buffon added At 39, it could be his last opportunity: this is the only trophy he has not won",5
" The last time he tried, Juve were beaten by Barcelona That night in Berlin, Dani Alves played for the other side, collecting his third European Cup; now of course he is a team-mate",2
" Id like to see him win it; I took one off them, Id like to give one back, Alves said",1
" Buffon meanwhile admitted: I asked Dani to teach us how to win this competitionThere is a thorn in Juventuss side, Alves said",2
" Whether thats because they lost that final two years ago, or that it is twenty years since they won this competition, or that they lost the 1998 final to an offside goal The offside goal, cheekily referenced, was scored by Pedja Mijatovic, to finally end Madrids 32-year wait for the trophy that despite those barren years had come to define them Alves was enjoying this, a moment for fun, not for fear",2
" We are not scared of Madrids history, he added",1
 Well play with ambition and desire,1
" Were hungry, and theres a plate in front of us We have to get there, pick up the cup and get out of there with it",2
" Told Alvess words, Ramos replied: well be there at quarter to nineIf so, they will be an hour late Its a date, anyway",3
" And it would be historic for Juventus too, completing their first ever treble, and making it eight clubs in European history Alves alone is on for his third, making him uniqueIt is that kind of occasion",3
" A Champions League final is big anyway, but this feels even more significant; The plot is simple  win the European Cup  but there are subplots everywhere, waiting to be fleshed out From Alvess third treble, and against his former rivals, the team he has faced 42 times complete with international team-mate Marcelo, to Buffons last chance",2
" It wouldnt change his whole career to have it, but it would be another golden history, Alves said Juventuss captain, Buffon would be the oldest player to lift the trophy and he described potential victory as the perfect finaleIt is the perfect final for all of them; the strongest sides in Europe, Italian and Spanish champions",3
" The competitions best defence against its best attack Different styles, different identities, yet much that is shared",2
So much of this feels symbolic The stories are many,2
" Like the last time they met in a final, 1998 still the single most anxiously-awaited game in Madrids history, and one that Mijatovic described as being like going from back-and-white to colour",1
" The European Cups most successful team finally won in the modern era, with Zidane on the other side",1
" He had to leave Turin to win the European Cup: first as a player, then assistant coach, then coach Here he is again, 18 months into his top flight managerial career, already seeking a second And theres more Theres Gonzalo Higuan against his former club, where the many he scored are less well remembered than the few he missed, a sense of bitterness accompanying his departure Im trying not to think about it, he admitted",5
"Sami Khedira, a Champions League winner with Madrid in 2014, too Lads its been a pleasure, he said when he left",2
" This week, he said something rather different, admitting: As soon as I had a less good game, criticism started and people asked if I was good enough It got on my nerves At Juventus they see you differently",3
" After five years there, I had to leave And lvaro Morata, against those he credits with making him a man",2
"Then theres Gareth Bale in Cardiff, forced to take pills to get him through training and matches as he fights to make it Because he probably wont, theres Isco, centre-stage at last",2
 And Cristiano Ronaldos bid to become the first player to score in three Champions League finals  if Ramos doesnt get there first,1
" Asked who would be the star if he and Ronaldo played together, Zidane said: Him, for sure I could play quite well, but he scores goals",2
" Too much humility is not a good thing either, Ronaldo said Were better",2
"Alves agreed Indeed, he embraced the underdog role But he was determined to enjoy this",3
" He had started almost with a sales pitch, like a presenter getting everyone going, and he would end with one too Good afternoon, he had begun, its very special to be able to live this day",2
" To be alongside so many great players, playing another final, is lovely Everyone will stop to watch this game",2
" Were lucky to be here and we have to enjoy this moment What we have to do is try to make the night even more special, sweat every last drop; this is the coronation of our season He ended by calling it: very, very, very, very beautiful Whatever happens, there is a date set, history to be made and stories to be toldThe question is which ones",5
"Margaret Court was the most glittering example of Australias domination of world tennis in the 1960s and 70s  a prolonged period of supremacy in which a murderers row of superstar players with iconic, instructive nicknames like Rocket, Muscles and Newk took all before them",1
"It was a time when Australias sun-blessed climate, abundance of tennis facilities and lack of the stifling class systems that held the sport back in other countries, seemed destined to ensure world-beating talent would flourish forever Even then, in the fattest of times, it was beyond comprehension that the country would ever produce a female champion to rival Court She was a living legend among mere championsAt times like this past week, as Court determinedly administered upper cut after crushing right cross to her own reputation, it pays to note her more noble achievements before theyre forgotten entirely, for Courts record 24 grand slam singles titles (and 64 including doubles) are for generations of Australians little more than fading facts from dusty almanacsFrom her late teens to her mid-30s, through marriage, multiple retirements and the birth of children, Court acquired a trophy collection of staggering proportions: 11 Australian Open singles crowns, five US Open titles and as many at Roland Garros, three on the lawns of Wimbledon",5
"Though fame and celebrity never rested easily on her shoulders, in the throes of competition she was always a picture of quiet determination  scrupulously fair, dignified and modest, the embodiment of Australias outdoorsy, can-do image of her times",1
"If Billie Jean King  Courts on- and off-court sparring partner since the 1960s  was the reformist whose relentless pursuit of a better deal for women brought true equality to the sport, it was Court who paved the way for women to embrace power and physicality long before the likes of Amelie Mauresmo and Serena Williams, not just beating but dominating opponentsThe bedrock of Courts remarkable success was a compelling mix of single-mindedness and those imposing physical gifts Height, reach (it was often said Courts arms were three inches longer than the average woman of her size, which earned her the nickname The Arm) and power did for most opponents A superbly athletic animal, is how Sports Illustrateds Gwilym Brown termed it, calling Court the physical equal of a great many menBetween 1960 and 1973 she triumphed in 929 of 1,003 matches, racking up 61 major titles and her remarkable grand slam of 1970",5
"Yet for all that, even before this weeks detour into tabloid ignominy, or the near-identical imbroglio of 2012, Court was, in her own words, an anonymous champion and a little-loved one",1
" I dont think the younger people today really know what I have done, she told Steve Flink in 2012 Personally it doesnt affect me It is probably a bit sad for the history of the game",3
"To provide context for Courts most lurid and provocative statements in the past three decades generally, and the last week particularly, one might start by perusing any of her three colourful autobiographies, published in 1965, 1975 and 2016, or Barbara Oldfields 1993 effort A Winning Faith: the Margaret Court Story  unique in the realm of Australian sports biographies for being written by an individual who claimed to have experienced religious salvation at the healing hands of her subjectIf there is a common theme within the Court literary oeuvre, its the stubborn immovability of her opinions",2
" Another is how acutely aware she has always been of the impact of her wordsIn Courts latest book, during a passage in which she outlines her strident opposition to same-sex marriage, she also makes clear how well she understands the interplay between the interests of journalists eager for a contentious, click-baiting quote, and her own in promoting her ministry It is undeniable I was  am  good copy, Court writes",3
"And then this, on the calculated provocations of 2011, which led to the first calls for Margaret Court Arena to be renamed: My statement was akin to pulling the pin on a hand grenade and throwing it into a crowded roomOne of the most astute observations made in the wake of Courts most recent dive-bomb into public debate was by the cricket writer and high profile transgender Australian Cate McGregor, when the latter pointed to Courts flair for publicity The pile-on last week strategically helped her, McGregor told the ABCs The Drum, It gave prominence to her views and it rendered her a victim You can kick us (the LGBTI community) to death to the applause of the mainstream media and ramp up solicitations for money, as I saw her acolytes doing on Christian radio the other day, and its frankly sick-makingRight now, smack bang in the middle of the website for Courts Victory Life Centre, above even Courts photo and biography, is a link to donate",5
" In her latest book, Court claims a member of her congregation once handed her a cheque for $237,000",1
" In another anecdote, a visiting American pastor promises a $50,000 donation in order to solicit smaller $1,000 donations from members of the congregation, enough in that instance for the deposit on a new property No one knows the precise size of the market for Courts wares, but it certainly exists",2
"Courts overt displays of faith shaped her enduring post-1970s status as an unloved champion of Australian sport, always a determinedly secular fieldStanding out in newspaper and magazine profiles of Court in the latter stages of her playing career are colourful accounts of her spiritual awakening  all arched gates, Jesuit monasteries and electric shocks through the fingertips (I knew I had the gift of healing) An Australian world champion who speaks in tongues? Only a strong minded-woman would risk the jibes that these declarations are likely to attract, was the verdict of Tennis magazine in 1976",3
" The same year, Kooyong tennis club removed Courts framed picture from its gallery of world stars",1
" The die was set: even standing in the winners circle, Margaret Court was an outsiderIt was in 1979  in the scripture of 2 Timothy 1:7  that Court found the personal salvation she says she had ached for, and a cure to the physical and emotional ailments that made a misery of her post-playing life For God hath not given me the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love and of a sound mind",5
" For a time, those were the only words Court could commit to memory",1
" As born-again Christian tales go, it was almost too great a cliche",1
"A central tenet of Courts particular brand of faith is living by a quite literal interpretation of, in her words, the Word of God I believe implicitly in what the Bible tells me, Court said in 2016",2
 I do not cherry pick to be popular,1
" God has made his feelings clear, and they are my feelings, tooOverlooked during her current evisceration in the court of public opinion, and in Courts cries of injustice and persecution, is the fact that for a purveyor of such divisive opinions she has actually had a charmed run In 1970, Court kicked things off by praising South Africas apartheid policy (South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America, she said",3
" I love South Africa Ill go back there any time), for which she received very little lasting scrutinyHer 1990 comments about Martina Navratilova (a great player but Id like someone at the top who the younger players can look up to Its very sad for children to be exposed to homosexuality",5
 Martina is a nice person,1
" Her life has just gone astray), and her suggestion that lesbians were ruining tennis, drew international attention, but never went close to defining her image in AustraliaCourts most fascinating battles on and off court have been with King, disparaged in 1975s Court on Court as a bad sport whose outspoken feminism and public revelations about an abortion diminished her greatly in Courts estimation Yet when Melbourne Parks centre court was renamed the Rod Laver Arena in 2002, it was King who argued that it should have been Courts name on the rafters insteadIt was also King who stepped in to defend Court during the 2012 imbroglio, again amid calls to rename the arena Get rid of her for that? King said",5
 Because you dont agree with her? Are you kidding? Please She deserves it Shes a great player,3
"A great player, yes, but for better or worse, Court is now the principal architect of her own image All my life Ive believed you must tell the truth, Court said last year Hold on to your beliefs, no matter how unpopular, no matter if saying your piece is going to get you in troubleThe preening Portuguese meets the immovable Italian Cristiano Ronaldo will lead Real Madrids breathtaking attacking force in their attempt to crack Juventuss sublime defensive unit marshalled by Gianluigi Buffon",5
" Massimiliano Allegri will see Madrids defence as inferior to his own and Paulo Dybala as the man to exploit any frailty Zinedine Zidanes side can become the first to win back-to-back Champions League titles while Juventus can complete a historic Serie A, Coppa Italia and European treble An enthralling encounter beckons Graham SearlesKick-off Saturday 745pmVenue National Stadium of WalesHead-to-head Juventus 8 Real Madrid 8 Draws 2Live BT Sport 2, BT Sport Showcase, BT Sport 4KReferee Felix Brych (Ger)Odds H 21-10 A 7-4 D 19-10Subs from Neto, Benatia, Rugani, Lichtsteiner, Marchisio, Lemina, Asamoah, Sturaro, Rincn, CuadradoDoubtful Khedira (thigh, Mandzukic (knee)Injured Pjaca (knee, unknown)Suspended NoneForm DWLWWW (all competitions)Discipline Y104 R1 (all competitions)Leading scorer Higuan 32 (all competitions)Subs from Casilla, Nacho, Coentro, Danilo, Rodrguez, Kovacic, Vzquez, Asensio, Bale, Daz, MorataDoubtful Bale (ankle), Carvajal (hamstring)Injured Pepe (ribs, unknown)Suspended NoneForm WWLWWW (all competitions)Discipline Y98 R2 (all competitions)Leading scorer Ronaldo 36 (all competitions)Beer sales were just a little brisker than typical on the 7",5
"43 out of Euston on Friday morning, but then it wasnt carrying your usual commuter crowd",1
" There were a few hundred expat cricket fans on board, making the early run up to Birmingham for the Trans-Tasman derby between Australia and New Zealand at Edgbaston As the train left Coventry the announcer reassured them all that, if they were quick, they had time for one more round before they reached New Street Which set the day up perfectly",3
" Because in between all the longueurs while the showers blew over, carrying fat cold raindrops, everything in the match happened in a hurry It was all about time, who had it, and how they used it",2
" With so many quick bowlers playing, there was precious little of it to go aroundIts a hard road, Edgbaston, for Australias fast bowlers Its been 16 years since the team last won a game here, back in the 2001 Ashes",3
" Since then, a lot of quick men have taken a lot of hard knocks at the ground In the 2004 Champions Trophy, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee were rattled by Marcus Trescothick and Michael Vaughan, the first little inkling that the 2005 Ashes was going to be a very different sort of series to the ones just before it",2
"In 2010 Australia played a couple of T20s against Pakistan, and Dirk Nannes, Mitchell Johnson, and Shaun Tait were thrashed around by Umar Akmal And then, in 2013, Mitchell Starc had one of the worst days of his career here, giving up 75 runs in 10 overs against Ian Bell and Jonathan TrottStarc is the only member of that particular attack who is back again this time  senior man, now, in a gang of four, along with James Pattinson, Pat Cummins, and Josh Hazlewood In theory, the finest, fastest, and most exciting bowling attack in the sport at the moment Though like their predecessors, they struggled here",5
"Australia havent actually managed to get them all into the same team, largely because Cummins and Pattinson have both had so many injuries over the years And were still waiting for them to make their debut as a supergroup now, since Pattinson was left out against New Zealand, to make room for burly, bald John Hastings, the Pete Best of the band",2
"Not that Pattinsons omission was all that reassuring for the rest of us He has taken 20 wickets at 11 runs each in the county championship so far this season, another 11 at 28 in the Royal London Cup, and he still cannot get in the team All cricket is improved by quick bowling But, fun as the spectacle was for the neutrals at the ground, they wouldnt have had to think too far ahead to start fretting about what those four fast bowlers might do to England if they stay fit, in their group match here next Saturday, and, of course, in the Ashes series beyond it, looming into view at the far end of the yearYou can prepare for the storm by latching the windows and sandbagging the doors, Jacques Kallis once said when he was talking about what it was like to face Mitchell Johnson, but when the rain comes, its still a surprise",5
" New Zealand werent looking to lay down defences Their openers, Luke Ronchi and Martin Guptill, decided the best thing to do was counterattack Starc started fast, and full and straight, while Hazlewood opened at the other end Only, the white ball just wouldnt swing for either of them Guptill went straight into business, hit five glorious fours before he misjudged a shot, and was too early on a delivery from Hazlewood and hit a leading edge to point",5
Ronchi decided to heave his bat at everything in reach,1
" He would hit an exquisite shot one minute, and a ridiculous one the next",1
" He took a shine to Cummings, who came on as first change in the seventh overA six over cover, struck with what seemed to be the slightest tap of the bat, was the shot of the day",2
" One moment he was stepping back to leg to uppercut a six over point, the next coming across inside the line to steer four over the keepers head When he was dropped at mid-on off Starc, he followed up by hitting the same shot again, only this time a little harder and higher, for a four Cummins gave up 52 runs in his first five overs",3
"Meanwhile, Kane Williamson was easing into a masterly innings, one which would end, two hours later, with a score of exactly 100",1
" Guptill and Ronchi were in a rush, playing at the limit of their capabilities But Williamson, like all great batsmen, all great athletes, simply seemed to have more time to play with than everyone else, as if he experienced everything in slower motion than his team-mates, and had, somehow, a different perception of time, one that allowed him to wait ever-so-late to play his cuts, or stride forward to pull off his front foot When he went, everything snapped back into real time again, and you were reminded just how quick these Australians are",3
" Hazlewood swept through the New Zealand team, and finished with six for 52",1
"A full list of 2020 Tokyo Olympics medal events will be finalized by the IOC executive board next week, one month ahead of scheduleAmong more than 60 proposals, 3-on-3 basketball is an expected favorite after all were analyzed by an International Olympic Committee advisory panelThe decision is due on Friday at a board meeting in Lausanne called at short notice to discuss awarding the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games hosting rights to Los Angeles and Paris at the same time later this year",3
"Now that we have an (executive board) meeting on June 9 it makes sense to use this opportunity, the IOC said on Friday In addition, an early decision is clearly beneficial to all the parties involved",2
"The half-court basketball format  close in spirit to neighborhood park pick-up games  once seemed set for the 2016 Olympics Its bid for inclusion was curbed when organizers in Rio de Janeiro were stretched preparing for just the regular programNow, FIBA believes mens and womens tournaments in 3-on-3 are even better suited after skateboarding and sport climbing joined the Tokyo lineup last yearNow there is an urban cluster that has been created, Fiba secretary general Patrick Baumann told the Associated Press The best urban team sport is 3-on-3 street basketball",5
" It would certainly be a perfect fitStill, dont expect two-time Olympic gold medalist LeBron James to seek a third title in the three-a-side game which already has a global tournament circuitThats probably a nice dream to have, Baumann said in a recent interview, adding: Our objective is to have similar and fantastic stars that come out of 3-on-3",3
"Baumann singled out the famed Rucker Park street court in Harlem, New York, when expressing hope to see them in the Olympic Games two years down the roadAdjusting from the NBA game would also be tough, he said: Its a different skill set",2
" Its really a 10-minute sprint, no coach, so you need to take the right decisionsAdding 3-on-3 tournaments should add 96 athletes to basketballs quota for the 2020 Olympics, a key test for the proposals next weekThe IOC wants to better appeal to young audiences and promote gender equality, but also stay within the limits of around 310 medal events and 11,000 athletes who must have housing and training venues",3
Some proposals are for mixed gender team events and relays  an IOC favorite  using the existing pool of athletes,1
"Canoeing, rowing, and shooting federations would drop some mens events to add more for womenCycling wants to bolster its track program which was moved to a velodrome in Izu, about 130km (80 miles) outside TokyoBy setting the Tokyo lineup earlier, the IOC also clears a long-scheduled 9-10 July board meeting in Lausanne to focus more on the expected dual hosting award",3
"Paris seems favored to get the 2024 Olympics, with Los Angeles striking a deal to wait until 2028",1
"Steve Smith did not mince his words after Australias Champions Trophy opener with New Zealand ended in a rain-ruined no result, tearing into his bowlers for an ordinary display and admitting the weather in Birmingham had seen his side get away with oneSmiths world champions were certainly wobbling when a third spell of rain at 555pm saw this Group A encounter finally ended, with their pursuit of an adjusted target of 235 from 33 overs sitting at 53 for three by the end of the ninth after Trent Boults removal of David Warner was followed up by a two-wicket burst from the pacy Adam Milne",3
Kane Williamsons classical 100 from 97 balls had earlier steered New Zealand to 291 all out in 45 overs after winning the toss,1
" It was a total the Australian captain put down to an errant start from his seamers and one that could have been worse were it not for Josh Hazelwoods career-best six for 52  a haul that owed much to his opponents swinging late onThat was one our worst bowling displays for a long time, said Smith We bowled both sides of the wicket and it was pretty ordinary Lets hope its rust and its gone Kane timed his innings beautifully but the bowling is something we need to look at",5
"Asked for his feelings when, with eight to his name the players left the field for the final time, Smith replied: We still had some batters in the shed but I would have preferred to have been in New Zealands position at the end",1
" We had work to do and a quality bowling attack against us, so we perhaps got away with one thereThe point apiece plays into the hands of England, who after the eight-wicket win over Bangladesh at The Oval now need just one victory from their remaining two fixtures against the pair to seal a semi-final spot, starting against New Zealand in Cardiff on TuesdayIt perhaps was a sign of the times that when New Zealands innings ended with a record total against their trans-Tasman rivals in a global tournament, it still felt an underwhelming one, ending in a cascade of wickets and an over unused of their allotted 46 as they lost six for 37 runs in 35 balls of picking out men in the deepLuke Ronchis happy-go-lucky 65 from just 33 balls  including two audacious lifted sixes in an assault on Pat Cummins  and a ninth one-day hundred from Williamson had given the lower order the license to swing But with New Zealand sitting pretty on 254 for three at the start of the 40th over, something far grander had looked possible",5
"Australia bounded into the interval feeling better themselves, following what had been a shabby display in the field at times and one that delighted the Edgbaston crowdWhile Glenn Maxwell shone with four catches, Ronchi earned lives on 24 and 54 thanks to a bungled run out by Matthew Wade behind the stumps and a dropped catch by Mitchell Starc",2
"Starc, who saw the ball after his error at mid on fly over his head for four, was one of the bowlers that Smith had referred to as rusty  a fitting description for the left-armers nine overs, none for 52 in which the white ball did not swing and New Zealands batsmen went untroubledStarcs lack of edge can be put down to his near three-month break following a stress fracture to the foot and his decision to miss the Indian Premier League Australia still chose to hold back their most well-tuned seamer, James Pattinson, after his explosive spell at Nottinghamshire, preferring the worthy but less hostile John Hastings instead",3
"Hastings picked up two wickets but was the bowler Williamson tucked into the most, with the 25 balls he sent down to the right-armer taken for 42 runs in a blitz of crisp cuts and mown slog sweeps on his way to three-figures",1
" Having put on 77 with Ronchi and 99 with Ross Taylor (46), Williamson perished the ball after his century when run out after a steer to point",1
"From there it all went the way of Hazlewood who, having earlier removed Martin Guptill for 16 by going cross-seam early, profited from New Zealands lower order trying to swing for the hills without giving themselves a sighter first Boult at No11 was his one classical wicket  caught behind to make it three in four balls at the end  as he became just the second bowler in the history of the Champions Trophy to take sixBoult began New Zealands surge with the ball after a rain-extended interval, as Warner feathered behind attempting an uppercut on 18 in the fifth over",3
" The pace of Milne then saw Aaron Finch chip to short mid-wicket and Moises Henriques offer a simple caught and bowled Australia were suddenly up against it But no sooner had that last wicket fallen, the rain came again and with it, ended what was set to be a compelling contest",3
"James Whitaker, the England chairman of selectors, came here hoping Haseeb Hameed could arrest his concerning slump in form Instead, he was treated to a wonderful display from the Yorkshire seamer Ben Coad, whose second ball had Hameed caught behind for nine",2
" Coad ended up with a career-best six for 25, his fourth five-wicket haul of a remarkable season, as Lancashire were bundled out for 123Yorkshire had a dreamy day overall",2
" They lost the toss and were (curiously) invited to field, lost the entire first session to rain and now trail by only 30 at 93 for two after a day that lost 24 overs Until Peter Handscomb slashed at a wide one from Luke Procter, he had shared 64 with Adam Lyth against a rather thrown together Lancashire attack (there is optimism, though, over the fitness of James Anderson)",2
" Alex Lees had played an ugly innings brimming with heaves, but his falling to Tom Bailey  and the accompanying send-off, from bowler and crowd  proved a mere footnote",1
" It is worth wondering how the impending arrival of Tom Kohler-Cadmore will impact LeesCoad should play for England Lions this summer and is a bowler with Test potential He gets movement both ways and has a smooth, strong action  he believes he has put on pace  which has delivered more first-class wickets than anyone else this summer, and the joint most in Division One  29 (at 13",3
"8), with Kyle Abbott It is greatly encouraging that even now he has been relegated from the new ball, with Ryan Sidebottom  who took three wickets of his own  and Jack Brooks reunited, trees are still being pulled up",2
" There were plenty more wickets than bad ballsBy the time Coad came on, Sidebottom had taken two wickets in two balls",2
" Alex Davies fenced to gully, then Luke Procter was caught behind leaving He found a beauty to do for Hameed, but it is concerning that, for the first time, the locality of his off-stump appears to be vexing him",2
" Coad began his third over by trapping Steven Croft in front and ended it having Shiv Chanderpaul caught at fourth slip; his next saw Dane Vilas caught behindRyan McLaren counterattacked but, after Brooks returned to pin Jordan Clark in front, Sidebottom took him lbw Lancashire were eight down at tea and Coad did for the tail afterwards, with Bailey poking to midwicket and Stephen Parry to second slip",3
"We were a bit surprised that they batted and it was very helpful for seamers with it swinging around and seaming Its been a great day said Coad, who rated this his best performance of the season We couldnt have asked for anything moreJust 484 overs were possible because of light and rain at Lords, where Middlesex reduced Somerset to 80 for five only for Dean Elgar (77) and Lewis Gregory to double the score with an unbroken stand of 81",5
" At the Ageas Bowl, Warwickshire enjoyed early success, reducing Hampshire to 31 for three, with two wickets for Keith Barker and one for the returning Boyd Rankin Hampshire fought back through two old stagers, Jimmy Adams and Sean Ervine, reaching stumps at 294 without further loss, with both men making hundredsIn Division Two the leaders, Nottinghamshire, were bowled out for 229 by winless Derbyshire with Steven Mullaney making 76",3
" Without any of Stuart Broad, James Pattinson or Jake Ball for the first time this season, Notts must bowl smartly to pull off a win",1
" At Hove, Sussex (captained by Chris Nash, who replaced Luke Wright) enjoyed a very strong day against Worcestershire, who left out Kohler-Cadmore, posting 339 for three with Luke Wells unbeaten on 139 At Chester-le-Street, Durham had Northamptonshire 59 for three at stumps after being bowled out for 166 Nathan Buck took six for 34",3
"The match between the defending champion, Garbie Muguruza, and the home favourite, Kristina Mladenovic, on Sunday will surely put a light under the womens draw in the absence of the games biggest names, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, as well as the recently defeated world No1, Angelique Kerber",1
"If Mladenovic were to beat Muguruza, Roland Garros could hardly rise to greet her more enthusiastically than they did after two hours and 48 minutes of drama on Court Suzanne Lenglen on Friday, when Mladenovic recovered from 2-5 down in the third set to beat the American Shelby Rogers, 7-5, 4-6, 8-6",1
The world No14 said: That was epic I still dont know how I won Shelby was playing great tennis,3
 She played quarter-finals here last year and has a great game for clay,1
" She really pushed me to the last breath I hadMuguruza, who has not hit the form she showed here a year ago, had a lesser struggle against the 27th seed Yulia Putintseva, taking an hour and 40 minutes to win 7-5, 6-2The more matches I play and the tougher victories, I think they give you self-confidence, Muguruza said",3
" The three matches I have played have not been easy at all Im happy I went out there without fearShe has a little more to be wary of against Mladenovic in the fourth round, as she realises",3
 Mladenovic is having a good year,1
" Shes won a lot of matches Shes at home, she saidThe tall, powerful Spaniard admitted she struggles to keep thoughts of last years triumph at bay",3
" I remember last year when I was in the semi-finals I was thinking, like, Im 25% [towards] lifting the trophy Thats when I started to think about it This year, Im just focusing on my next opponent",3
Her next opponent will no doubt be similarly attentive to her homework and keen to avoid the sort of energy-draining angst that flooded on to her racket before a quite stirring fightback,1
"I think its going to be also tough for her, Mladenovic said Its such a nice head to head coming up for everybody: for the tournament, for the crowd, for us Shes obviously playing great tennis Im looking forward to this oneAcknowledging she enjoyed the excitement generated by the crowd, she said, Its true that, emotionally, it is all quite high at the moment but its something I like",5
" Its something Im prepared for Its not my first time having so many high emotions, big wins, big moments",2
"Novak Djokovics partnership with Andre Agassi has come under serious early pressure in the first week of the French Open It might not see out the summerThe defending champion remains on track for a semi-final against the tournaments perennial prince, Rafael Nadal, but there are cracks showing in his fledgling coaching relationship with Agassi, who missed the first hour of his gruelling five-set struggle against the tough Argentinian Diego Schwartzman in the third round because of commitments with French television",3
"Asked what he thought of Agassi arriving in his box at 3-4 in the second set, Djokovic said: He was not supposed to be here today, because we finished yesterday with our in-person collaboration here in Paris",1
" He had many different things that he was supposed to do Hes doing that He managed to reschedule certain things and show up today, which was not planned",3
" I appreciate thatFurther asked about Agassis earlier statement on Eurosport that he was doing the gig for nothing, Djokovic said: Im not going to get into that but everything he said is completely true, so its completely his decision",2
 I hope thats going to stay for a long time that we can create something that is going to go long term We dont have anything set in stone We had a great chat after the match,3
 Hes going to try his best to be in the biggest tournaments with me as much as his family time allows and all the commitments that he has,1
"Agassi had already told Djokovic that, after he is done here, he must leave to fulfil earlier commitments, possibly after his next match, against Albert Ramos-Violas, who beat Lucas Pouille, 6-2, 3-6, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 in fading light",1
"In an interview on Eurosport with Boris Becker, who guided the Serb to six of his 12 major victories before they ended their three-year relationship last December, Agassi revealed he was working at Roland Garros on my own time, on my own dime, my own money",1
" No doubt his link with the tournament sponsors, Longines, will ease the financial burden of spending a week in ParisI dont want anything, I dont need anything, I want to help him, he said Djokovic needed all the help he could get quelling Schwartzmans determined challenge over three hours and 19 minutes",3
"There is something awry with the world No2s tennis again, after a few encouraging weeks lately There were some rough moments, none more awkward than at break point on his own serve, 4-0 up in the fourth",2
" Djokovic received a time warning, then a code violation He was not putting a lot of love the umpires way during a 5-7, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 win",2
Agassi revealed a little of his tennis philosophy and how he might persuade Djokovic to switch from lights-out attack to more thoughtful ways of breaking opponents down,1
For me its simple,1
 His game is built on controlling the baseline and executing to big targets Hes not a guy that plays precisely to the lines,2
 Occasionally if hes on the defence he surprises you with this Hes a guy that throws body blow after body blow after body blow and hes just never thought a lot about the other side of the court,2
 So I think theres ways he can take his game at 30 years old  and older because hopefully hes going to still want to play for a while  and he can start to make it easier for himself by knowing what to do across the netHe sounded equivocal about working with Djokovic at Wimbledon,2
" If he wants me there, I will come and figure it out It is a lot of responsibility Whatever is practical and achievable, 100% I will make the effort I committed to him that, as long as he feels like I can help him, I will Does he really need me somewhere in particular, does he need me in a week off, does he need me in a grand slam? We will figure this out as we go",5
" A 100% I am committed to seeing him achieve what his dream isNadal spent probably as much time arranging his courtside water bottles as he did constructing 27 clear winners among 82 points to beat Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-0, 6-1, 6-0",2
" The Georgian, who last year lost to Kyle Edmund in the first round, went downhill faster than Franz KlammerAt the end patrons were treated to the rare spectacle of Nadal abandoning his hair-tugging, ball-bouncing rituals as he served out the match like a man with his pants on fire just as the first of the intermittent rain dumped on Court Philippe Chatrier Today was one of the best matches I have ever played, without a doubt, Nadal said later",3
"If he and Djokovic do clash for a place in the final, the odds would be with the Spaniard, who has won 20 of 21 matches on clay this season",1
 This was his 100th best-of-five match on his favourite surface,1
" Only Robin Soderling here in 2009 and Djokovic two years ago have prevailed against him, a phenomenal recordBefore the quarter-finals Nadal will celebrate his 31st birthday on Saturday then, if all goes well, follow it with a win over his compatriot, Roberto Bautista Agut, who beat Jiri Vesely 6-3, 6-4, 6-3",2
"Portsmouth have appointed Kenny Jackett as their new manager The 55-year-old has signed a two-year deal with the newly promoted Sky Bet League One club, two days after Paul Cook quit to take charge of Wigan",2
"This is a fantastic opportunity for me and Im looking forward to getting started Its an exciting challenge, Jackett told Pompeys official websiteThis club has a passionate fanbase and they can be a 12th man for us",3
 Hopefully we can build on the momentum of last season and continue to progress,1
"I can promise that Ill work as hard as I possibly can to make sure that we can bring success to PortsmouthThe club said they were in advanced talks with Joe Gallen about him becoming assistant managerJackett, who has won promotion from League One with both Millwall and Wolves, had been out of work since resigning as Rotherham manager in November",3
"Cook left Fratton Park on Wednesday after guiding Pompey to the League Two title with victory over Cheltenham on the final dayWere delighted to announce Kenny as our new manager He ticks so many boxes for us, Pompeys chief executive, Mark Catlin, said Hes managed big clubs with big expectations in the past and has plenty of experience of getting sides out of League One",5

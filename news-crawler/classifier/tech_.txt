New York, mysterious billionaire set glass box fancy Manhattan apartment. constant surveillance bored, horny young man named Sam. interloper named Tracy determined D, keeps showing lattes hand, hoping Sam invite apartment stare nothingness together. finally does, waste time getting down, is, course, exact moment blurry ghost finally shows glass box, pecks faces off. Based Ive seen Follows, age movies TV heavily preaching abstinence. reappearance James Hurley Bang Bang bar Twin Peaks, Shelly Johnson having girls night fellow moms. Twin Peaks safe gentrification, Chromatics playing bar, plaid-clad hipsters loving it. Shelley spots James, sweet, doe-eyed boy desperate love, declares hes cool. I heavily disagree, makes happy, Shelly! Im praying hoping theyll hook season make poor choices together. Yes. havent seen legacy characters, like Audrey. Plus season supposed 200 new returning characters, Im interested seeing kind (or cruel) time them. murder mystery, featuring poor Ruth Davenports mix-and-match body, pretty compelling (though CGI jarringly bad)! dont know talking brain-tree Black Lodge was. I watching, Ill live rest life assuming mango tree gone rotten. 21st, David Lynchs Twin Peaks returned television, nearly 27 years end second season. predictable thing revived wildly unpredictable. Right top, audiences learned FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper trapped mysterious Black Lodge, doppelgnger snakeskin-wearing thug inhabited evil spirit Bob loose world, creating havoc mischief. moment onward sort surprise, aged-but-familiar faces appearing alongside new characters settings. episodes broadcast, Showtime episodes available online werent nostalgic throwback quirky soap opera murder mystery originally captivated audiences 1990. opening arc different: sprawling, obstinately paced story evokes familiar themes ideas unique piece entertainment. expected, left ton questions. morning latest visit David Lynchs mind, sat hash out. Warning: Twin Peaks revival spoilers ahead. Bryan: pretty broad question, I think worth asking. discussed expectations week, points hit vibe feel original series. combination small-town soap opera, whodunnit, batshit Black Lodge weirdness potent cocktail, tempering David Lynchs extreme sensibilities creating captivating process. episodes shows return, doesnt feel like weve known before, doesnt feel like prequel film Walk Me, either. early scenes mysterious, glass box monitored New York loft painful sequence Dr. Jacoby spray-paints shovels one, episodes dont rhythm pop original series work. Theyre moments meander, lost weeds, Lynch daring audience invest providing minimal glimpses interaction characters legacy viewers likely tuning see. Black Lodge looks like Black Lodge, Special Agent Dale Cooper cuts sharp profile black suit, drift atop expectation course watching. original series gonzo, strong narrative thrust things moving forward. turned bizarre detours pleasant moments surprise. clearly defined murder mystery, though, new season oddities little antithesis original Twin Peaks. Lizzie: episode, I assumed revivals fidgety, meandering style just way quickly familiarize audiences new subplots characters. end second episode, tangle plot threads havent really begun sort out. original Twin Peaks started slowly, Dale Cooper real, human good guy Dale Cooper lighthouse beacon. end episodes, revival given living protagonist isnt trapped surreal underworld. easier handle seriess exhaustingly glacial pace root for. Theres reason doesnt quite feel like Twin Peaks yet, thats lot originals campy goofiness gone. Theres added weight new series, dont know whats happening Cooper. Already, theres explicit gore, gunshots, desperation characters. Small moments Lynchian levity like cops broken flashlight, nosy neighbor tiny dog dont balance eerie scenes like Sarah Palmer sitting dark, silently staring leopards tear wildebeests guts TV. Tasha: I agree doesnt feel like early Twin Peaks, chipper Cooper leading local law enforcement bottle-smashing experiment determine clues investigation important chattering away Diane tape recorder offering explosively enthusiastic praise pie, coffee, syrup, trees, mountain air. doesnt feel like late Twin Peaks, frantic weasel-cam running peoples feet, ridiculous Adam Sandler comedy little orphan Nicky possibly devil. early quirk gone, late sloppiness, Lynch said wasnt for, didnt watch. feels exactly like mid-series Twin Peaks, scenes like Cooper talking Seor Droolcup shot dragged endlessly, holding single chilly, alarming mood. significantly, series doesnt feel like Twin Peaks, feels like David Lynch. sound design, back-masked dragging noises echoing, disturbing soundscapes, recognizably style. chilly cinematography outdoors scenes. wacky, startling surrealism things like Arm, entire opening episode three. Lynch short experimental films comparatively conventional Twin Peaks pilot, Lynch certainly did original series, especially story moved Black Lodge. Bryan: Rewatching original series recently, I struck just low-fi thing feels. course, ABC gave Twin Peaks massive budget, original series pleasant, handcrafted feel matched quirkiness. Thats changed here; Showtime gone all-in, resources network given project (Lynch quit got budget looking for), creative control handed him. jumps New York, gleaming helicopter shots high-rises. strange glass cube, appears connection Black Lodge literal mystery box filmed like high-end tech thriller story folks cozy confines Oregon. doubt Lynch adapting filmmaking style better represent specific locations, turns different story threads catching old friends like Hawk, Andy, Lucy; following Snakeskin Cooper seedy motels; mystery box shenanigans feel like discordant, random threads. exacerbated modern-day setting. Lizzie, mentioned lack goofiness earlier, true: deadpan humor worked small town 90s feels awkward deployed security guard monitoring mystery box, discomfiting Michael Cera shows monologue Andy Lucys Marlon Brando-obsessed son. original Twin Peaks time capsule; style really work particular time TV history? Tasha: people online absolutely loved Ceras Marlon Brando Wild (hes wearing Brandos costume! Hes straddling Brandos bike! keeps trying failing Brandos accent, especially says godfadda!), I segment just incomprehensibly awful. equivalent James original series moping doing James Dean impression, delivery awkward unconvincing. writing recognizably Lynchian reminded Cowboys introductory monologue Mulholland Drive Cera just wrong person pull off, hes nuanced actor, hes just familiar face. aside, though, Im enjoying modern touches, including helicopter shots New York, ultra-crisp digital cinematography, entire plotline apparently revolving trying scientifically capture Black Lodge-related supernatural events. Oh, Jerry Horne shifting gourmet obsessions pot-gourmet business ventures. Jerry professional stoner edibles tycoon easily plausible subplot series offered episodes. Lizzie: revival apparently set modern day, passage time messy, probably intentionally so. apartment complex South Dakota, cast grouchy, flighty residents, feels like stuck decade. Maybe is? I actually preferred dated-feeling scenes ones New York, stylistically felt completely unconnected world Twin Peaks know. shows special effects little distracting. Black Lodge, Man Place, aka Arm, replaced barren white tree looks like holiday sale item Target. Theres sack brain stuck it, I guess way indicate sentient. Tasha: I mean, basically brain nervous system, crackling visible electrical impulses. pretty clear Arm evolved higher form being. Again, doesnt feel weirder modern wailing snake-baby Eraserhead. anything, looks like product stop-motion puppetry, like technological throwback earlier Lynch days. Ditto episode 3 opening, strobe lights, missing frames, photographic tricks. sequence easily look exactly way 30 40 years ago. great deal new Twin Peaks doesnt feel like using modern technology; theres attempt make things like Arm look slick digital well-integrated background, make Cooper traveling electrical outlet look natural. modern filmmaking like contrast. basic default. Tasha: far, really bothering me. episodes entirely stuck New York tech-experiment, Black Lodge, Dale Cooper went, Id antsy check Twin Peaks characters know love, Id assume Lynch waiting story organically returned there. Instead, getting weird, disconnected glimpses familiar settings: Andy Lucy Hawk fussing familiar conference table covered files, Shelley James locking eyes bar, Log Lady literally phoning contributions. (I wasnt aware Catherine Coulson able film scenes death, I thought Log Lady pretty ridiculous, pointless character, heartwarming back, concern affection Hawk shared on-screen.) problem scenes, ones Hawk trying figure whats missing Cooper files, connection else, relevance larger story larger world. (And turns whats missing Coopers case Cooper, Hawk going related heritage Coop hanging casino Native Americans = casinos, Im going set TV fire.) Currently, Im getting feeling I got Arrested Developments fourth season. Netflix pull cast theyre busy stars, shot separately tried edit scenes separate stories. just felt like characters operating world. isnt just characters dont matter. I dont want fan service, I want story. Lizzie: I agree. far, does feel like fan service. I appreciate that, though, really difficult series it. Right now, time legacy character appears, just tease thinking going pay end. time, frustrating feel viewer, Im just placated glimpses Andy Lucy, thoughtful, gentle conversations Hawk Log Lady, real story happening entirely outside moments. Bryan: Ive turning mind episode different new is, thematic concerns ideas, aesthetically differs times I help wonder just story Lynch wanting tell, hes just using Twin Peaks vehicle bring world. initial scene Dr. Jacoby sums cleanly: hes frame, sure, hes speck, Lynch concerned taking beauty surrounding forest doctor to. (I barely make dialogue sequence.) theres handling Agent Cooper. finds trick backdoor folds space-time escape Black Lodge, shows odd mute basic language skills. Kyle MacLachlans performance Agent Cooper big people loved Twin Peaks place. Hes huge brought order shows chaos. I assume keeping play unable communicate eventually lead incredibly cathartic ah-ha! moment awakening. (Still, sure show.) sidelining long telegraph Lynch interested audiences feel older characters, happens them. Tasha: like Lynch doesnt think be, explain launch Ruth Davenport murder mystery, grotesque CGI: Messy Victims Unit plotline involving severed head hairy, pudgy mystery corpse. moment plotline kicks off, feels like modern spin Laura Palmer murder mystery new death define new series. Given Lynch famously wanted solve Laura Palmers murder, allowed Twin Peaks unravel thread ABC relentlessly pushed address directly, I help wonder Ruths death going eternally unsolved story seed wanted Lauras death be. feels like know killed her, know why? body is, left like that? Currently, though, I dont care things. feel like distractions story I care Cooper functional human again, hes going active removing doppelgnger world. Lizzie: Im hoping Cooper mystery ends sooner later, I want old Cooper back. Tasha pointed out, weve got murders contend with, solve them. viewer, Im invested murders, given Lelands instructions Coop Laura, I dont think Coop game long. Bryan: I mildly hilarious I cavalier mythology chat week, Im obsessed mythology new episodes. Matthew Lillard popping adulterous high school principal suspected Davenports murder like lovely parallel Leland Palmer, way entire story thread (perhaps) ended Snakeskin Cooper killing principals wife leaving town wondering theyre going entirely different direction. Bobs plan here, reasoning ritualistic nature Davenport crime scene? did Bob know going sucked Black Lodge given date time? did create alterna-Cooper place instead? (Im going wonder alterna-Cooper real estate agent named Dougie, things just wonderfully random questioned.) episodes in, seriess central conflict angling Agent Cooper vs. Snakeskin Cooper sort Black Lodge battle royale Im definitely invested storyline, I question set 18 episodes. beauty killed Laura Palmer? mystery single question impacted entire town. original series knew affected Laura way. death window entire community, truly analogous yet. fate Agent Cooper drive audience interest, going link various story threads way Lauras death did. (At least, way discern yet.) larger, Dark Tower-esque mythology interconnects Coopers appearance New York mystery box point direction then, payoff, reason watch place. Bryan: interested return Twin Peaks good old-fashioned nostalgia, far thats like distant cousin original direct successor. Thats going frustrating viewers hoping same, upside appealing preconceived notions. Unfortunately, thats pretty narrow way looking question. far new season Twin Peaks confusing, discordant, lacking overall propulsive narrative drive (see Cooper, Agent Dale above). just wanting weirdest thing television quite time, I newcomers turning episodes particularly enraptured. Unless want watch Kyle MacLachlan play slot machines. thats case, theyre going stoked. Lizzie: gonna me. I imagine having investment show, willingness trust going pay off, dont care seasons. Tasha: impossible guess looks people watched original show. story linear well-ordered, coming season like entering really convoluted play act, bad idea. case, like joining acid trip progress. Id love read reactions people coming New Peaks cold, I assume them, story feels disjointed does us. else, Lizzie said above, currently lacks protagonist viewers comprehend care about. arent emotionally invested Coopers recovery, watching stumble around, parroting heard last, fun. unpredictability compelling new viewers? I imagine depends patient are, theyre Lynch fans general. Tasha: absolutely question this. Im long haul. got episodes row just test patterns sound fingernails chalk boards, Id fast-forward come week wed moved on. I Lynch mind world. Lizzie: Agreed. Im episodes in, took 25 years made, I dont think I easily. Bryan: Same. I know thing going all, I zero doubt going somewhere. I intend arrives. please, lets talk episodes test patterns. actually happen. Spider-Man: Homecoming star Tom Holland signed star upcoming Uncharted film, playing role young Nathan Drake.

Bungie revealed gameplay trailer Destiny 2 Thursday, fans lot noise new superpowers available CGI trailers setting new Red War Campaign story mode. comically loud cheering section Bungie execs announced that, long last, players wouldnt kicked games waiting zone time wanted new activity. lot nuts-and-bolts changes Destiny 2 went unmentioned onstage. Luckily, I spent time Thursday playing healthy new Crucible multiplayer, full-fledged three-person strike, introductory story mission. safe say Destiny 2 feels looks lot like predecessor changes going subtle ones. important tweaks drastic effects play cooperatively AI human opponents competitive games. Naturally, Bungie big deal new subclasses, including fan-pleasing reveal Solar Warlock class, Dawnblade, gameplay trailer. Theres going new Void Titan class, Sentinel, straight Destiny version Captain America, shield all. Hunter, theres new Arc subclass called Arcstrider similar original games Bladedancer replaces daggers lightning-imbued staff. pretty known Bungies presentation. developer didnt tell you, however, old subclasses getting revamped. I chance spend time Titans traditional Striker class Destiny, noticeably different. one, using signature Fist Havoc skill, super stayed active. I able run map charged lightning burst enemies high speeds. super skill one-off shot dark ongoing strategic threat. Bungie confirmed significant changes existing subclasses feeling fresh. I did ask newly announced subclasses mean end Sunsingers, Defenders, Bladedancers, Bungie designer social lead M.E. Chung wouldnt say interview her. desperately hoping self-resurrection bubble skills game, faint glimmer hope. brand new addition Destiny 2 latent subclass abilities. game, things differentiated subclass jump styles, grenade melee types, super abilities. course unevenly distributed subclass skill, like Shadestep Shoulder Charge, felt like fun tricks strategic tools. Now, subclass series latent abilities used recharge. instance, new Dawnblade class Warlocks allows players create temporary pool light heals surrounding teammates gives damage boost. coming older subclasses. Titans Striker class create artificial walls use cover, Hunters Gunslinger use quick dodges simultaneously reload weapons. time playing strike Dawnblade, pools damage-boosting/healing light critical taking higher-level enemies staying alive particularly grueling parts three-stage boss fight. expect subclass pretty unique abilities dependent super charge, Bungie intent making divisions classes pronounced. noticeable change Destiny 2 looks feels weapons system. original game weapon slots: primary, secondary, heavy. Primary weapons guns like automatic rifles, revolvers, burst firing guns. Secondary weapons sniper rifles shotguns (as fusion rifles sidearms), heavy weapons exclusively large machine guns, rocket launchers, and, later on, swords.

Telescope data taken night showed brightness star dipped significantly. contacted astronomers observing star, let know seen eye changes. following morning, star dimmed more. Thats knew time signal alarm: weirdest star galaxy acting weird again. time look distant celestial body figure hell going on. far I tell, telescope look right looking right now, Muterspaugh, professor Tennessee State University, tells Verge. star Muterspaugh looking KIC 8462852, known Tabbys Star. Thats Tabetha Boyajian, astronomer Louisiana State University, noticed strange star couple years ago looking archive data Kepler NASA spacecraft thats hunting planets exist outside Solar System. Boyajian citizen science project called Planet Hunters, volunteers analyze Kepler data look planets, alerted wonky star. users flagged really interesting, Boyajian tells Verge. came science team asked, this? Thats planet clearly. data showed KIC 8462852 experienced extreme fluctuations brightness, way passing planet cause. point, stars light dimmed 20 percent. huge dip, like seen before, indicating big irregular orbiting star. @ajebson @NASAKepler @LCO_Global @keckobservatory @AAVSO @nexssinfo @NASA @NASAHubble @Astro_Wright @BerkeleySETI @ESO 2% r' band looks like start pic.twitter.com/TjJdSY2ar9 late 2015, astronomer Jason Wright Penn State suggested tantalizing scenario dips. large megastructures created alien civilization orbiting star, explaining weird changes. Aliens hypothesis consider, Wright told Atlantic time, looked like expect alien civilization build. Thats Tabbys Star popularly known alien megastructure star. course, astronomers focused natural explanation: huge swarm giant comets periodically orbits star. way narrow possibilities observe star real time dimming happening. past observations fluctuations caught Kepler. kind stuck spot anything, says Boyajian. data learn needed catch action again. problem, though, Tabbys star unpredictable. fluctuations arent exactly repetitive dont follow known pattern making hard know strange star strange again. Things change brightness star happen regular pattern, says Muterspaugh. tell far, [this star] periodic. predict happens, makes weird. Thats astronomers observing star basically clock learned dimming behavior. this, Boyajian started Kickstarter campaign called Wheres Flux? secure funding telescope time continuously monitor star. campaign successfully raised $100,000, helped Boyajian set year-long observation program Las Cumbres Observatory, telescopes stationed world. time, Muterspaugh independently set observation campaign robotic telescopes Fairborn Observatory Arizona. telescopes essentially automatic, observing certain targets sky rest sleeping. Muterspaugh programmed telescopes constantly eye Tabbys Star. part, star quiet, behaving like normal. April 24th, data Fairborn indicated star dimmed slightly. wasnt change astronomers think star acting again, guard. idea small dip preliminary event real thing. sure enough, nearly month later, huge dimming Kepler saw happening again. ALERT:@tsboyajian's star dippingThis drill.Astro tweeps telescopes 48 hours: spectra please! really moment waiting Tabbys Star. gives astronomers opportunity use entire arsenal telescopes observe fluctuations occur. Kepler observed light fluctuations just broad range light colors. Now, use telescopes observe stars light numerous colors light spectrums, better idea types chemicals present changes occur properties objects blocking light. instance, just bunch comets, theyre going close star super hot, according Jason Wright, thats pick observing infrared spectrum. theory alien unclear see. Maybe kind artificial element associated blockage. making definitive statements just yet, time simply observe, going astronomers decode weekend. theories table including alien megastructures. theory valid one, says Muterspaugh. really hate that, thats pretty major thing. Itd awesome course, scientists hoping theres natural explanation. good news going lot data. Boyajian says response science community overwhelming, help right doing best watch document changes. neat turn circle citizen scientists discovered star opportunity folks interested science follow learn star is, Boyajian says. really humbling work science enthusiasts support really interesting star.

Assistant available Android now, does AI assistant stack Siri forced head-to-head Apples far limited playing field? head-to-head. important parts AI assistant easy access. biggest selling points Amazons Echo hardware always-listening feature lets Alexa hand respond queries commands. Android, Assistant deep, OS-level hooks make accessible functional. iOS, things little tougher. Siri: Apples hardware, Siri massive home court advantage comes actually starting digital assistant. Namely, Siri baked iOS core level accessible anywhere, youre app lock-screen simply holding home button. Siri listening, too, activated anytime Hey, Siri command newer iPhones (although feature, like Siri days, feels largely half-baked.) Assistant: Google making big play Assistant, fighting uphill battle inherent limitations Apple iOS. means Assistant lives Assistant app. Google doing best Assistant places possible: theres Assistant widget quick launch app, accessible notification shade, lock screen, home screen. Plus, theres 3D Touch action start Assistant. Unlike Siri launched 2011, AI assistants just work single device anymore. Working iPhone thing working entire ecosystem ballgame. Siri: best thing said Apples assistant exists variety hardware platforms. youve got Apple Watch, Mac, Apple TV, use Siri it, thats extent it. Siri different platforms largely exist separate things use native Siri iPhone play song Apple TV, example, use Siri Apple TV make call. Controlling smart home utilities Siri works manufacturers support Apples HomeKit, youll need Apple TV iPad serve hub. Plus, youre locked strictly Apples ecosystem Cupertino doesnt make hardware (like, say, Amazon Echo-like speaker), use Siri it. Assistant: Obviously, just like Siri works Apple stuff, Assistant works Google stuff. means Chromecast, Android phones, course, Google Home. announcements Assistant I/O third-party hardware manufacturers able integrate Assistant devices, means larger ecosystem Assistant near future. Google showed Assistant work multiple devices using Chromecast display visual results Google Home, suggesting universal experience Siri. work practice somewhat unclear, given feature doesnt available (at Assistant iPhone.) speaks Googles larger ambitions having unified Assistant platform devices. course, assistant useful actually assist things. point, there's basic table stakes platforms able accomplish basic queries weather sports scores, calendar reminders, alarms, etc. said, clear differences terms extent abilities. Siri: Siri able advanced queries like tell time difference cities price gasoline San Fransisco, typically drawing resources like Wolfram Alpha Wikipedia answer, practice Ive generally easier reliable just Google question. Siri's functional advantages things like opening apps sending iMessages stem aforementioned platform advantage intrinsic usefulness Siri itself. Assistant: limitations iOS, Assistant gets lot done. play videos YouTube, add reminders events Google Calendar, send emails Gmail. Plus, theres usual AI assistant queries stocks, weather, maps thats common Siri Assistant. Google tried best offer messaging support iOS, far 99 percent way passing Apples apps actually sending message placing call. Meanwhile, things like setting alarm just arent possible Assistant iOS, like playing music, shunts YouTube work, bit hack. putting aside similarities, Assistant entire power Googles Knowledge Graph it, means breadth information answer wider Siris. Also, Assistant just work better experience comes understanding words responding quickly. said, impressive features Assistant Google I/O simply arent yet. impressive Google Lens augmented reality camera, simpler demos like interactive Panera order seen stage arent app yet. Amazon really led way developer supporter comes Alexa, 10,000 different third-party skills available. Siri Assistant third-party support, companies stand page Amazon's book here. Siri: Apple finally added third-party developer support Siri iOS 10, it's limited developers make Siri integrations mapping music apps, intentional limitation forces use Apples Music Maps services, prefer Google Spotify.

Assistant: Google took things slowly came building Google Assistant Google Home's third-party abilities, I/O year opened door developers make extensions Assistant Home phones. Plus, actions wont targeted specific devices rather, hardware support skill (which could, say, require screen function), itll able access it. developers actually build ecosystem. Answering questions search half equation, though. AIs need able actively things you, make life easier. platform outstanding yet, definitely eye future digital assistants continue mature. Siri: Siri mixed bag comes actually accomplishing tasks you. theory, look restaurant reservations movie times OpenTable Fandango, fall actually complete task yourself. things, like booking Uber entirely Siri, sending money Square Cash Venmo, thats pretty far go. Assistant: Like Siri, Assistant limited comes actually doing things you, now, things Siri like summon Uber arent Assistant now. But, mentioned before, Google high hopes eventually assistant, like sending flowers ordering lunch, right things extremely limited iPhone. Google (and party developers needs jump board) actually ship integrations shown I/O year, Assistant huge leg Siri. Directly comparing party AI assistant Google, Microsoft, company Siri going tough proposition, given locked iOS level Apples tight control platform. things stand right now, Siris advantages comes native integration things like messaging music, system-wide availability makes accessible time means cases, easier use Apples assistant. Assistant does clearly best Siri comes overall knowledge support Google services, (including Maps) current implementation just isnt dramatically better tasks worth extra inconvenience working Apples sandboxing. said, Google does seriously impressive ambitions Assistant shift scales favor. features arent yet, Assistant iOS now, Siri great good enough.

Verge spoke University College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott clear questions. 1991, David Lynch Mark Frosts groundbreaking TV melodrama Twin Peaks cancelled, left viewers lot unanswered questions. central series dreamy, surreal mysteries. immediate, deliberately left dramatically hanging series finale, left characters apparently dead, protagonist Dale Cooper possessed outright replaced evil spirit. Fans hoped Coopers story resolved subsequent movie, 1992s Twin Peaks: Walk Me, film turned prequel left series largely unaddressed. speculation high Lynch Frosts new Twin Peaks threads original TV show. 18-episode limited series, begins two-hour premiere Showtime Sunday, 21, expressly intended sequel takes action original 1990s run, 25 years later. doesnt mean itll answer fans longstanding questions. Lynch oblique storyteller whos interested symbolism mood laying clear, linear stories. Given series casting, pretty clear going certain characters arent dead instance, Sherilyn Fenn, character seen trapped bank bomb going off, returning role. certainly worth wondering new clear mysteries stuck us. Tasha: I watched Twin Peaks originally aired early 1990s, like TV. then, long-arc storytelling hadnt standard American TV. genre-leaning dedicated internet fandom standing pick apart mysteries, showrunners designed series fandoms guessing wondering. shows mysteries, stretched entire season, like entirely new approach storytelling prime time. Lynch team werent particularly interested answering questions raised Lynch famously didnt want reveal answer central murder-case question defined show, killed homecoming queen Laura Palmer? ABC pushed solve case onscreen, plenty surreal elements introduced course two-season run. I say certain plot elements bugged years, Im literally talking things Ive sat 25 years now, wondering theyd resolved. number question fate soul Agent Dale Cooper, played Kyle MacLachlan. original series final episode entering Black Lodge, place unimaginable power, chock dark forces vicious secrets, evil spirits offer power vast bearer reorder Earth liking. Fans spent decades debating exact meaning happens Cooper Lodge episode, whats undisputable comes Lodge wearing face, acting like all. I want foremost new Twin Peaks story understanding went Lodge, changed Coop, means state war good, evil, possibly non-aligned spiritual forces haunting town Twin Peaks. matters guys? hoping learn new show, failing that, want general? Lizzie: thing comes mind people talk Twin Peaks making zero sense "The owls seem." Giant says visits Coop hotel room, it's probably Twin Peaks' recognizable quotes. does actually mean? owls woods just pleasant decoration? symbol? metaphor? hint revival going come? Presumably Lynch hire new owl actors time around, maybe role opaque now. Theres possibility I dont really want revival answers all; I just want make feel like I did 2011. I like solve mystery James singing voice. Kwame: thing stuck Killer Bob. Im intentionally using word thing, he? second seasons endless digressions, Ive watched handful episodes Agent Coopers visit Black Lodge. Bob gets me. just hes creepy demonic, thats obvious. I just think fascinating otherworldly evil embodied long-haired dude wearing lot denim. does say Lynchs cosmology? Hell populated random guys jean jackets, sneering ether? so, spirits beings look like? used angels demons looking certain way, beautiful terrifying, ultimately conventional. framework, Id imagine Bob blob-monster tentacles. Lynch, hidden deep belief spiritual, doing completely different. question, then, hell does Lynch think evil looks like world Twin Peaks? Does believe theres Lovecraftian ordinary? way, thats probably scarier Cthulhu, right? Bryan: Im going strike contrary tone say actually arent specific plot questions Twin Peaks Im concerned going new season. (Well, I wondered going Josie drawer knob, thats pretty standard-issue.) Twin Peaks plot-driven ended Laura Palmers murder solved. that, specifics left impression. I actually didnt realize little stuck I recently rewatched entire series (and Walk Me) month. honestly felt like I watching second season time thats little impact machinations weird developments had. I did remember tone. strange dreamy mix Lynch excels at, mixing familiar surreal create outright terrifying. People certainly argue two-thirds Twin Peaks excelled combined quality traditional read: coherent narrative structure TV, odd times, theres magic purely Lynchian became. probably explains complicated relationship prequel movie Walk Me, Lynch said integral understanding new show. I originally loved film, I enraptured I rewatched it. gonzo bizarre, plays like refined version second-season strangeness, shot absolutely heartbreaking terror Laura Palmers final days. delicate mix, I help think Showtime executives run from, screaming. way, truest example Twin Peaks evolved. ultimate question going Lynchs new Twin Peaks able hit kind tonal balance, using familiar bizarre disarm audience, lead truly emotionally devastating territory. hit it, maintain 18 episodes? serialized TV focused plotting fan debate story theories. I welcome chance just float tide Lynchs mind. Tasha: I understand just wanting Twin Peaks feeling back. I understand thinking exact mechanics Nadine super-strength dont matter, dont need know Log Ladys log really houses spirit dead husband, shes just crazy, entirely. original Peaks mystery series, dangling plot threads unexplained occurrences. nonsense, apparently thrown post-Lynch writing crew clear plan doing. Lynch said wasnt involved second season, stopped watching entirely. Id love explanation Josie Packards soul appears trapped dresser-drawer knob, I dont expect one. larger framework series human emotion, great spiritual war intersects emotion. thats I want understand shape story. I wonders Black Lodge plotting, kind agenda dwarf giant kind humanity? arent left wondering weird spirits adjacent people (like Mike, Tremonds, Garland Briggs) theyre represent different factions? Annie got Theresa's ring, connection means? soap-opera scale, dont care Big Ed feels forced stay Nadine shes recovered memory, finally return Norma Hank dead? (or whether) Leo Johnson got dangling cage tarantulas? Annie alive? really dont wonder hows Annie? Lizzie: brought Tremonds this, I realized 42 characters I barely remember. Like Harold Smith, unpredictable recluse friends Laura, involved One-Eyed Jacks scheme. Related One-Eyed Jacks, Id like answers Jacques Renaults death. smothered pillow hospital bed Leland Palmer. assumed Leland seeking revenge Lauras death, Coop, suspected Leland trying prevent Renault implicating crime. Whos right? Killer Bob taken someone, does person know Bob? Leland Palmer simultaneously Leland Palmer Bob, does Bob completely? Kwame: Im typically pieces matter kind viewer, seeing I bowed right time Lynch left show, I tend think influence writer creator mood bring back. details I care core good-vs.-evil conflict Bob spirits haunting Twin Peaks, far townsfolk. I like Big Ed Nadine, got watch show. Laura Palmer, place larger spiritual war. dont forget. limited series taking place 25 years events original run. Log Lady long gone. (RIP Catherine Coulson, played show.) Given Coops vision season, Coops soul return battle Bob? does mean possible? questions matter most. Bryan: funny, ended just reveal Leland Palmer killed Laura, I suspect I questions do. fresh rewatch, actually arent questions leap mind. just season Walk talking, I dont expect come traditional narrative sense I honestly wont disappointed learn giant, dwarf, formica table. anything, I think version Twin Peaks I actually disappointing. Weve plenty wonderful procedurals original show, plenty serialized murder mysteries. I loved Twin Peaks tightly conceived mythology, wonder whodunnit. I loved waking dream worked emotional visceral levels. soap-opera mystery elements larger whole? Certainly. threads larger tapestry.

James Cameron followed decade later 1986s Aliens, brought Aliens surviving protagonist, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), took series action-packed direction. 1992 sequel Alien 3 directed David Fincher, went direct Seven, Social Network, Netflixs House Cards. Citing studio interference production, essentially disowned it. 2003, producer Charles Lauzirika completely recut film, inclining Finchers original vision. Assembly Cut received better original. film hit theaters Alien: Resurrection 1997. Directed Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amlie), jumps centuries future features clone Ripley, people want use alien queen body military purposes. fair number Alien spinoffs years. Alien Vs. Predator movies crossbred franchise similarly long-running science-fiction horror series began 1987s Predator. planned AVP film led right Alien, materialized. extensive runs comics video games, standalone Alien stories Alien Vs. Predator stories. dozen novels expanded Alien universe. dual core story Alien Aliens, feature films helped define modern cinematic science-fiction horror. film series pretty straightforward Ridley Scotts 2012 film Prometheus. movie confused fans, Scott conceived film came Aliens DNA, told standalone story. Still, close Alien story details fans stop speculating actually Alien universe. Regardless, film set events Alien. Alien: Covenant works sequel Prometheus, moves closer setting original Alien. film series confusing: Fresh Chappie, director Neill Blomkamp posted concept art fifth Alien film reportedly project. film essentially ignored Alien 3 Alien: Resurrection attempt reboot post-Aliens franchise. However, Ridley Scotts Prometheus sequel works, Fox project hold, Ridley Scott basically said going happen all. Chronologically, Prometheus begins couple places. Theres alien Engineer beginning film, seeding new world, Earth distant past, just suggest Engineers created humanity. 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw Charles Holloway dig evidence humanitys origins. actual Prometheus mission Engineers takes place 2093. Alien: Covenant takes place decade Prometheus, 2104. recent prologue links events films fills gap, it. there, original films: Alien takes place decades Covenant 2122, Ripley wakes stasis 57 years later Aliens. Alien 3 set immediately Aliens. Finally, Alien: Resurrection makes huge jump 2386. Theres two-decade gap Alien: Covenant Alien, new film provides direct line action Prometheus Alien, doesnt entirely lead original film. Scott ambitious plans future Alien franchise: says Alien: Covenant sequels Prometheus saga entrance original film. Hes said story going films. told IGN hes writing film now, hes aiming production 14 months. unclear film just yet. March, Scott referred film called Alien: Awakening place Prometheus Covenant, hes referred Blomkamps canceled film Awakening. way, Scott looking set original Alien new films, mess post-Aliens era. Alien franchise split big arcs right now. Prometheus, better worse, helps set origins Aliens titular creature, Alien: Covenant continues arc. big arc Ripleys story, began Alien continued Alien: Resurrection. Given drama surrounding status Neill Blomkamps canceled film, Scott Fox bit keen focusing franchises origins, resurrecting Ripley outing. feels like bit unfortunate choice, reasons: Blomkamps script reportedly strong, helped reboot end Ripleys story. Alien 3 Alien: Resurrection widely condemned directions took franchise: Joss Whedon, wrote original screenplay, said filmmakers did wrong possibly do. images Blomkamps concept included Ripley Hicks post-Aliens, Engineers ship cargo bay, course, xenomorphs themselves. stands reason film continued themes explored Aliens, inimical Weyland-Yutani Corporation continuing explore potential using aliens weapons. importantly, Sigourney Weaver said film character satisfying ending. meant let Fox correct mistakes previous sequels. attention spent right origins Alien, going polish Ripleys story. simple practical reasons: marketing nightmare introduce new film heels Alien: Covenant thats really sequel Aliens. standalone, out-of-continuity films starting franchises, thanks success Star Wars: Rogue One, pretty newfangled concept franchise thats bigger Alien. Presumably, sequel-driven industry, eventually sort reboot reimagining finishes Ripleys story, takes franchise different direction post-Aliens.

Ridley Scott returned Alien franchise 2012s Prometheus, primary criticisms film wasnt really, well, Alien-esque. build sci-fi / horror formula created 1979, Scott went different direction film concerned questions origins humanity place universe. intentional shift, Scott saying time film shouldnt taken direct prequel previous work, didnt curb audience expectations. new sequel Prometheus, Scott decision roots. title marketing, Alien: Covenant framed direct descendent original, thing mind others: scaring hell audience. visceral footage previewed SXSW earlier year underscore idea going brutal, gory Alien, closer film fans wanted years ago ponderous, convoluted story got. long stretches Alien: Covenant delivers promise. film terrifying, heart-pounding terror, par best work Scotts career. movie stuck modes, mixing horror pseudo-intellectual pondering ground things halt time. result film welcome improvement Prometheus, home run sci-fi horror fans hoping for.

Reportedly, Discovery tell personal story focusing Burnham, additional general ensemble crew Discovery. interesting direction Star Trek show. Discovery trailer shows diverse Star Trek before. original Trek creator Gene Roddenberry famously broke ground showcasing diversity television, Discovery expanding theme, black woman (Martin-Green) lead role, Michelle Yeoh Captain Philippa Georgiou. like good Star Trek crew, Discovery features new alien species, including Saru (who curiously describes species designated sense death). trailer features plenty throwbacks old Trek, too: trailer tells Discovery set years Kirk, Spock, Enterprise. appearances Spocks father Sarek (James Frain) bat'leth-wielding Klingon warriors, featuring bizarre redesign smooth-browed 1966 Star Trek Klingons, ridged-forehead Klingons Generation, hell Star Trek Darkness going on. intriguing stuff trailer, youre looking reasons optimistic fledgling series. plenty reasons fans concerned Discovery. foremost series long, troubling development process, CBS completely mishandled start finish. Things started great Discovery. announced 2015, set premiere January 2017, heels Star Trek's 50th anniversary. (In hindsight, having planned start miss anniversary entirely bad sign.) Pushing Daisies, Hannibal, American Gods creator Bryan Fuller hottest creators TV today announced Discoverys showrunner. reveal provoked lot excitement, especially given Fullers reputation premier television history franchise. (He got start television writing Deep Space Voyager.) Nicholas Meyer, wrote directed fan-favorite Trek films Wrath Khan Undiscovered Country, brought writer. Plus, announced set "Prime" timeline original shows movies, "Kelvin Timeline" J.J. Abrams reboots. Discovery plagued multiple delays slipping January 2017 date May, indefinite release fall 2017. Fuller forced leave project entirely CBS executives concerns commitments shows like American Gods. telling all, Discovery new Star Trek decade, CBS entirely uncommitted series. beginning, network focused keeping Discovery subscription-only, major draw CBS Access on-demand service. Obviously, corporate concerns precedence business, it's exactly vote confidence media landscape genre television prevalent ever, Star Trek getting shunted broadcast TV. hard feel like Discovery getting relegated Access CBS cash fans' love franchise. Also, comments CBS Interactive CEO Jim Lanzone Recodes Peter Kafka indicate network just doesnt think science fiction works TV anymore. According Lanzone, Sci-fi traditionally really broadcast. impossible, future, somebody figures out. historically, like Star Trek wouldnt necessarily broadcast show, point. Network concerns aside, fans expressed misgivings style show, based footage weve seen far. Sure, CGI slick, gritty ship interiors bland uniforms bring mind recent Battlestar Galactica reboot, Expanse, shining utopian future Star Trek tends strive toward. aesthetic informed recent Trek ventures like Enterprise 2009 film reboots, though, keeping continuity past TV series, Trek fans likely adjust shock new wears off. Discovery tell good story, theyre likely style concerning. it's worrying Discovery returning creative original series Kirk/Spock era, instead breaking new ground area universe. 1960s Trek associated movies, 2009 reboots, Discovery, it's major return time period. means Discovery run problems prequel has, largely know happens universe next, larger scale. it's hard tell closely Discovery hew broader themes earlier Trek series, past shows repeatedly tackled episodic adventures exploratory Federation ship Starfleet officers. Deep Space showed ways tell different stories world Star Trek, instead just slapping fresh coat paint scaffolding original series Generation built. (Voyager Enterprise failed learn lesson, that's conversation time.) Discovery, franchise tagline "to boldly go," nice boldness storytelling perspective, progress representation. Ultimately, I'm cautiously optimistic Discovery. Yes, concerns, yes, sucks viewers shell Access subscription. hopefully Discovery stronger parts foundation cast, seemingly personal stories, course, tremendous ongoing potential Trek universe overcome issues bring triumphant return Star Trek TV. got ways convince fans watching new trailer hopeful skeptical eyes.

Cohen Dismissal Russell Brandom Scribd Google used annual I/O conference connect developers sprawling empire. announces new tools initiatives, sprinkles little hype, tells watching: choose us, far. previous years message directed coders working Android Chrome worlds biggest mobile OS web browser respectively yesterday, CEO Sundar Pichai clear platform company wants dominate bigger: artificial intelligence. Google, doesnt just mean using AI improve products. (Although certainly doing that). company wants individuals small companies world board. wants wield influence wider AI ecosystem, impressive stack machine learning tools software servers mean build AI product ground leaving Google playpen. heart offering Googles machine learning software TensorFlow. building AI tools, like difference command line interface modern desktop OS; giving users accessible framework grappling algorithms. started life in-house tool companys engineers design train AI algorithms, 2015 available use open-source software. then, embraced AI community (its popular software type code repository Github), used create custom tools range industries, aerospace bioengineering. Theres hardly way TensorFlow days, says Samim Winiger, head machine learning design studio Samim.io. I use lot open source learning libraries, theres major shift TensorFlow. Google strategic moves ensure software widely used. Earlier year, example, added support Keras, popular deep learning framework. According calculations creator Keras, Franois Chollet (himself Google engineer), TensorFlow fastest growing deep learning framework September 2016, Keras second place. Winiger describes integration classic tale Google it. says: way making sure entire community converges tooling. TensorFlow popular particularly important reason: good does. TensorFlow scales quickly, works quickly, James Donkin, technology manager UK-based online supermarket Ocado, tells Verge. says team uses range machine learning frameworks create in-house tools tasks like categorizing customer feedback, TensorFlow good place start. easily 80 percent benefit, decide extend model iterative process working tool. Google offers TensorFlow free, connects easily companys servers providing data storage computing power. (If use TensorFlow library means push [products] Googles cloud easily, says Donkin.) search giant created AI-specific chips power operations, unveiling latest iteration hardware years I/O. And, want skip task building AI algorithms together, buy off-the-shelf components Google core tasks like speech transcription object recognition. products services arent necessarily money-makers themselves, offer other, subtler benefits. attract talent Google help make companys in-house software standard machine learning. Winiger says initiatives helped Google grab mindshare make companys synonymous machine learning. firms like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft offer AI tools, Googles feel pre-eminent. Winiger thinks partly companys capacity shape media narrative, strong level support provides users. technical differences [different AI frameworks], machine learning communities live community support forums, regard Google winning, tells Verge. influence isnt just abstract, either: feeds Googles products. Yesterday, example, Google announced Android staggering billion monthly active users, softwares edge, company honing machine learning. New additions OS span range tiny tweaks (like smarter text selection) big new features (like camera recognizes looking at). Google didnt forget feed community either, complement announcements unveiled new tools help developers build AI services work better mobile devices. include new version TensorFlow named TensorFlowLite, API interface future smartphone chips optimized work AI software. Developers use make better machine learning products Android devices. Googles AI empire stretches bit further, Google reaps benefits.

Project Tango, Google experiment used array cameras map physical space. Google announced modest Daydream mobile headset year, Tango-powered device inevitable. I/O 2017, finally arrived, form standalone headset thats supposed ship later year. Google head VR Clay Bavor describes new headset point spectrum called immersive computing, emerging technological paradigm enables computers work like do. teams working project half years, Google partnering Qualcomm, HTC, Lenovo release reference design commercial products based it. works, Googles years-long experiments augmented virtual reality converged ideal self-contained VR headset. standalone device feels like new beginning culmination healthier VR treat way. new VR headset uses Googles Android-based Daydream platform called WorldSense, tracks motion front-facing edge-detecting cameras. I tried prototype design, feels like solid foundation fine-tuned great, Google rest promises. final headsets supposed cost high-end tethered products like $599 Oculus Rift $799 HTC Vive, additional cost PC. thats lot money, drastically expensive people pay gaming console. Theyre designed make VR feel casual accessible people dont Daydream-ready phones, especially people arent interested Android all. turns lot people iPhones, Bavor jokes. Meanwhile, rendering called Seurat named pointillist painter Georges Seurat supposed offer image quality rivals youd high-end PC. Andrey Doronichev, Googles director product management, describes Seurat computational magic. takes rendered three-dimensional scene samples shots different angles. seen above, Seurat uses images assemble facade drastically reduces number polygons headset needs render, visible loss quality. Google use Daydream user interface fine-tuning past year phones. software update codenamed Euphrates add features need devices users just pop apart use phone, like full-featured web browser dashboard accessing settings non-VR parts Android. that, device Google describes doesnt feel like finished product, direct competitor tethered headsets. feels like amped-up Daydream. Googles standalone headset using familiar interface phone-based Daydream devices. Unfortunately, standalone headset imports Daydreams simple remote, instead pair controllers convincingly mimic virtual hands. means run apps like Tilt Brush Job Simulator beloved VR experiences Google-owned studios. now, remain restricted third-party devices like Rift Vive. Partners like HTC Lenovo substitute controllers, either, integrate technology like Leap Motion hand tracking. Bavor says create consistent standard developers, suggests feel different using remote inside-out tracking. Obviously things like Tilt Brush won't translated experience like this, says. we've nice ways blending [inside-out] head tracking [non-tracked] controller. change certainly mind: updates year, there'll future updates hardware, says. now, lack ubiquitous feature make headset feel bit like hybrid development kit, matter polished rest is. like exactly Google wants. exclusive look hardware beforehand, written Stephen Levy Backchannel, exercise aggressively resetting narrative VRs arrival imminent. long essay published alongside it, Bavor pushed idea killer app sells VR, suggesting seemingly niche applications slowly grow mass appeal. YouTube, arguably Daydreams killer app right now, feels like loose end Google. People inside 360-degree videos, unlike vast majority VR experiences, standalone headsets sophisticated tracking wont much. Google, VR video platform called Jump, change cameras map three-dimensional space record it. experimental technology, companies like Lytro using versions it. ultimate goal YouTube people able literally walk inside videos. Maybe, Bavor says coyly. years, companies building generation mass-market (by virtual reality standards) headsets. Success meant creating felt finished ready push millions people. Google certainly hope phone-based Daydream headsets point projects tens millions Daydream-ready phones end year. depending HTC Lenovo unveil, Googles standalone headset like bridge generations virtual reality. lot pieces falling place, process, Google highlighting gaps remain. now, thats bad thing.

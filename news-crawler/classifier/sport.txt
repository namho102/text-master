There are ways of measuring competitiveness in sportspeople. The most effective is getting them to play a sport that is not their vocation. For the England cricketer Jenny Gunn, that sport is football.
She played for Notts County and was even called for England trials, only for cricket to put a fork in both at the age of 17. She has ambitions to play Sunday league when she calls time on a career that, so far, has given her 13 years at international level. When Mark Robinson took over as England head coach at the end of 2015, he reinstated football to the warm-ups. The squad, multi-sported, were thrilled. Not Gunn.
“Oh, it was ridiculous,” she shouts. “There’s a no tackling rule. How are we supposed to get the ball? You end up backing off and allowing them time and space. You know what – I’d rather not play. My dad taught me: ‘You go hard or go home.’ That’s what his coach taught him. Go into every tackle like you meant it.”
Her father, by the way, is Bryn Gunn, a retired professional footballer who played more than 100 times for Nottingham Forest, winning the 1980 European Cup. That coach? Brian Clough. She spends the next 10-minutes doing her best Cloughie impression: laying into referees and mourning the modern game.
It’s a passion at odds with Gunn’s humble demeanour: one that forms the foundation of 132 ODI, 95 T20I and 11 Test caps. She sneaked to the top of the English one-day international wicket-takers list with 123 at an average 27. All with little fanfare. Typically, she wants nothing to do with it: “Oh, don’t pay too much attention to that,” she says. “Katherine Brunt’s only four away from beating me. She deserves it.” The former England coach Mark Lane put it best on Gunn, a low-maintenance, uncomplicated individual: “She has her tea at teatime”.
Yet Lane also marked Gunn as his “luxury player”: a bowler of yorkers, a batter with a breezy cameo in the chamber and a gifted fielder. During Lane’s tenure, one of English cricket’s most successful, Gunn was his vice-captain. In 2014, she was appointed MBE for services to cricket. That she is preparing for her fourth World Cup, aged 31, is a testament to the wedding of natural aptitude and grit that doesn’t lie far from the surface.
Over the last year, she has lost long-term team-mates in Charlotte Edwards and Lydia Greenway. Surely Gunn was worried she was next? “Oh yeah, there’s always going to be that thought when a new coach comes in,” she acknowledges. “Especially coming in from the men’s game. You don’t really know what his views are. But we sat down as a team early on and Robbo put my mind at ease with something he said: ‘I’ve got nothing about age. If you can do it, you’re old or young enough.’ That relaxes you a bit. And on top of other changes, you realise you belong and you can challenge yourself to get better.”
Now she is craftier with the ball, variations plentiful and execution of slower balls at such a level that Robinson calls her a “world-class spinner”. Tongue in cheek, sure, but a clear sign of endearment.
She laughs it off – “People seem to love telling me how slow I am” – but appreciates the sentiment. She has been called worse.
At the end of her England debut in 2004, in South Africa, Gunn was called into the umpire’s office. “You chuck it,” said one of the officials. Five years later, she was called while playing in Perth and banned from bowling in domestic cricket.
It is the timing of that call, months before the 2009 World Cup in Australia, in which the hosts’ biggest rivals were England, that Gunn finds suspicious: “I think they were doing it to unsettle me. And us as a side. I really believe that.”
She was allowed to bowl in the World Cup, provided she was not called while playing for England in the warm-ups. As fate would have it, the same umpire that called Gunn was standing for their final game before the tournament. As a result, she did not bowl that day and went on to take five wickets at an economy rate of 3.82 in England’s successful campaign.
When Gunn became the first woman accepted into the Nottinghamshire academy (she now plays for Warwickshire) most of her time off the field was spent as a lab rat. To correct a quirk where her right arm comes out before coming past her ear – rather than the conventional “wheel-like” motion of most bowlers – she was ordered by coaches to run through the academy corridors and simulate bowling while pressed up against the wall. This, they believe, would stop her arm from moving out. It did not work. “It was the stupidest thing,” she says. “In a normal situation, the wall’s obviously not there, is it? Great idea that was.”
When she was called in 2012 (then cleared within two months) she underwent tests at Loughborough and the University of Western Australia – an institution that has saved the careers of many, including Muttiah Muralitharan – carried out alongside match footage to ensure she was bowling “completely”. It found that Gunn’s right-arm hyper-extended by 14 degrees. Coupled with her initial outward movement, it gave the illusion of chucking. The greatest “flex” in her action – when she bowls a rare bouncer – is 10 degrees, comfortably below the ICC’s limit of 15.
“At first it really gets to you,” she freely concedes. “I mean, I couldn’t change. But after being tested I know I’m nowhere near. The footage of me bowling in super slow-mo, it makes me sick when I see my arm go back.
“It doesn’t bother me at all now, even when the crowd shout ‘no ball’. Sarah Taylor always calls me Chucky. Danielle Hazell has a go at me for wearing long sleeves, saying: ‘All chuckers wear them.’”
Gunn accepts she will hear it more this summer from opposition fans and pundits alike. You would think this down-to-earth, retiring type would be bothered. She’s not. “It just makes me laugh, though. If they’re doing that, I know I’m one up on them.”
England’s women have taken over as the world’s top-ranked team following a convincing and fully deserved triumph over the Black Ferns. The Red Rose forwards laid the foundations of a famous win, only England’s second over their opponents on Kiwi soil, which bodes well for the forthcoming women’s World Cup to be held in Ireland in August.
England’s haul of five tries on a damp, murky evening at the same venue as the Lions’ fixture against the Maori was a fitting reward for a dominant effort up front. Three of the scores were the product of rolling mauls to which the hosts had no real answer. At least one touring team has cracked the secret of winning a major Test match in New Zealand.
It was the Red Roses who seized the early initiative with a well-taken try from the centre Emily Scarratt in the left corner with barely two minutes gone. The captain, Sarah Hunter, was a constant energising force from No8 and the home side found it hard throughout to establish any kind of territorial pressure.
Given the opportunity to attack from long range, however, the Black Ferns are frequently as deadly as their male counterparts. A gloriously skilful chip and chase score from their talented scrum-half Kendra Cocksedge levelled the scores before the pacy Portia Woodman intercepted an attempted pass from Scarratt to outsprint the retreating cover from 60 metres.
Remarkably, New Zealand could not score any further points until the 78th minute of the game as England took increasing control, thanks partly to their shrewd kicking game. Abbie Scott was duly credited with the first of England’s close-range tries but, with the scores level at 14-14 at half-time, it was a contest still awaiting a decisive intervention.
A key moment arrived within three minutes of the restart when a well-worked lineout move resulted in Katy McLean putting Lydia Thompson over in the right corner. The all-action Marlie Packer soon claimed a fourth score before replacement Vicky Fleetwood touched down beneath a heap of bodies to record England’s fifth try.
New Zealand did claim a late consolation but could not prevent England securing their first victory anywhere in this fixture since 2012. A delighted Hunter revealed the forwards had talked before the game about emulating England’s men, who beat the All Blacks in New Zealand in 2003 prior to lifting the World Cup later that same year. “We’re by no means the finished article but it does send a statement and we’ll take confidence from coming to such a tough place and winning,” said Hunter. “Everyone did their job from numbers one to 23.”
Hunter’s own performance drew particular praise from England’s head coach, Simon Middleton, whose side have also defeated Australia and Canada in this month’s international series as they prepare to defend their World Cup title. “She’s a fantastic captain and a fantastic player,” said Middleton. “That’s why she’s world player of the year. We’re really happy and very proud.”

Scotland consigned the Wallabies to a humbling 24-19 Test defeat in Sydney in front of a stunned crowd of 30,721 fans at Allianz Stadium who watched the visitors avenge two heartbreaking one-point losses to Australia in the past two years with a stirring victory.
Israel Folau’s second tryscoring double in as many weeks couldn’t save the Wallabies, as Scotland confirmed their status as world rugby’s big improvers. Up to fifth in the rankings, the Scots cashed in on a disjointed display from Michael Cheika’s men.
As playmaker Bernard Foley admitted, the Wallabies were their own worst enemies during a dreadful first half. They trailed 17-12 at the break, gifting the Scots all of their points through an early penalty goal, then an intercept try to centre Duncan Taylor and a charge-down effort from goalkicking five-eighth Finn Russell.
Only Folau’s two strikes kept the Wallabies in the contest. Foley set both of them up for his NSW Waratahs team-mate either side of a stint in the sin bin for a late hit on Russell when Scotland’s inspirational No10 broke free with some innovative counter-attack from his own quarter.
First, Foley found Folau with a long ball in one of the Wallabies’ rare forays deep in Scotland territory. Then, on the stroke of half-time, Folau soared high above Scotland fullback Gordon Reid to reel in Foley’s pinpoint crossfield kick to give the Wallabies momentum heading into the second section.
But despite being a man down with No8 Ryan Wilson yellow-carded a minute before half-time, the Scots refused to yield until Australia briefly snatched the lead in the 57th minute. Foley’s successful conversion of a desperate dive-over try from Will Genia earned the Wallabies a 19-17 advantage.
But, a 50-metre try three minutes later to flanker Hamish Watson restored the visitors’ five-point lead and, despite several opportunities, the Wallabies were unable to find a reply to give Foley another chance to break Scottish hearts.
Last-gasp penalty goals from Foley had denied the Scots at the 2015 Rugby World Cup at Twickenham and again on the Wallabies’ spring tour last November.
After a moment of magic against South Africa from Zach Mercer, the captain, booked England Under-20s’ place in Sunday’s Junior World Cup final in Tbilisi, comparisons with their football counterparts were inevitable – they were not, however, wholly accurate. England’s football team winning any form of World Cup understandably commands attention but this is a fifth final in a row for a side who set out without five players away with Eddie Jones’s senior side in Argentina.
Oval ball success is sustained by England at this level and, while a rampant New Zealand stand between them and a fourth title in five years, the number of absentees makes their achievement of reaching the final in Georgia all the more impressive. Mercer’s omission by Jones for the Argentina tour was surprising but the Australian still took with him Tom and Ben Curry, Nick Isiekwe, Joe Cokanasiga and Jack Maunder. England have also suffered six injuries to their backs during the tournament in Georgia while Will Evans and Jamie Shillcock were ruled out before it started.
“It’s that context that makes the achievement of this group such a significant one,” says Dean Ryan, who took up the role of the Rugby Football Union’s head of international player development last July. “It’s that backdrop that makes it so significant. Under-20 World Cups are normally framed around three or four key individuals, not a collective, but the collective of this group has been a huge success. Against New Zealand, who unsurprisingly have a lot of very good individuals, this side has to be tactically very good and very collective but they have been all the way through.
After the footballers’ success, it was widely lamented that the pathway for those players to shine at senior level does not exist and while Ryan acknowledges it is also a problem within rugby, he points to the breakthrough of Tom Curry, Isiekwe and Maunder in Argentina as success stories.
“Watching Tom Curry last week was tremendous for us and the team here. To watch him win his first cap, to watch Nick Isiekwe come on and win a lineout, Jack Maunder fire it along for [Denny] Solomona to score [the winning try] – that’s fantastic for these lads because they can think: ‘That’s how close we are.’ Credit to Eddie for taking those players.” 
Potentially jeopardising the current blueprint for success is a move by the Premiership to expand its A League rather than continue to send youngsters on loan to Championship clubs where they can cut their teeth against seasoned senior players. The RFU is reportedly against the idea and Ryan is not convinced A League expansion is the answer.
“Having a clear playing programme for this group is key,” he says. “A lot of our guys have not played a huge amount of rugby prior to this World Cup. The best of them are playing in the Premiership, that’s great. But what are the next group doing and where do they play regularly? It’s obvious that some of the deficiencies is lack of game time.
“A second tier needs a combination of young and senior players. You have to find something that combines that. Any tournament format has to fulfil that. There are times that the A League can do that, there are times that it can’t. The combination is key.”
Back in the intensely hot summer of 2005, India and Pakistan played a six-match ODI series that wound its way from Kochi in the deep south to Jamshedpur in the east, before finishing in New Delhi via the western outpost of Ahmedabad. With India 2-0 up in the series, Osman Samiuddin, whose The Unquiet Ones is the definitive work on Pakistan’s cricket history, and I took the train from Visakhapatnam to Jamshedpur.
One of our fellow travellers was a former India cricketer. After a while, seeing the myriad emotions darting across Osman’s face, he sighed and said: “Go ahead, you can ask me. Everyone does anyway.” That man was Chetan Sharma, whose decade-long career included 23 Tests, 65 ODIs, a 10-wicket haul at Edgbaston and a whirlwind ODI hundred against England.
But a decade after he quit the game, Sharma was remembered on the subcontinent and by fans in the diaspora for just one ball, to Javed Miandad in the Austral-Asia Cup final in Sharjah on 18 April 1986. Miandad had navigated a tricky chase with some aplomb, whittling down the equation to four needed off the last ball.
Sharma tried for the yorker but could not land it. Miandad smeared the knee-high full toss over midwicket for six, levelling the head-to-head ODI record between the two countries at eight wins apiece.
At the time It was just one shot but, as the years passed, it became a festering wound in the psyche of Indian cricketers. Matches against Pakistan were invariably lost, especially when they were finals played in the Middle East in front of capacity Friday crowds.
It took India nearly two decades to inter that particular ghost. In March 2004, with cricket diplomacy taking centre stage, they set off on a first full tour of Pakistan in 15 years. By then, the head-to-head record had skewed to 52-30 in Pakistan’s favour. In an opening game at Karachi’s National Stadium, watched by millions across the globe, India piled up 349. With a ball to go, Pakistan needed six to pull off the most incredible of victories.
In one of those delicious ironies that sport often throws up, Miandad was Pakistan’s coach, watching like a cat ready to pounce from the dressing-room balcony. But Moin Khan, the wicketkeeper who faced the final ball from Ashish Nehra, was no Miandad. His wild heave did not even clear the infield. In the years since, India have won 21 matches to Pakistan’s 20.
On these very pages, in the days before that 2004 series, the late Mike Marqusee had written: “Cricket, like other mass spectator sports, is a magnet for meanings, a malleable metaphor. And in the past, cricket between India and Pakistan has served as both a symbol of south Asian harmony and a prime example of what George Orwell called ‘war minus the shooting’.”
The key words here are “the past”. After the relative detente of the early years of this century, political ties have been Arctic frosty over the last decade. Cricket, once seen as a builder of bridges between the two countries, is now hostage to political agendas on both sides, and there has been just one bilateral series – three ODIs in India in 2012-13 – since Pakistan came to India in late 2007.
The current generation of cricketers has not played each other often enough to become steeped in the rivalry, or to form the sort of friendships that existed at a time when cricket showed the way.
This decade, India and Pakistan have contested just 10 ODIs (India lead 7-3) and six Twenty20 internationals – the majority of them in multi-nation tournaments such as the World Cup and Champions Trophy.
More than three decades ago, administrators NKP Salve, Jagmohan Dalmiya and Nur Khan fought the established order to move the World Cup out of England for the first time. The dream was that India and Pakistan would contest the 1987 final at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.
Both teams duly topped their groups but Craig McDermott’s five for 44 for Australia in Lahore and Graham Gooch’s 115 in Mumbai sent Imran Khan into a darkened room and a subcontinent into depression.
Going back to the World Championship of Cricket, hosted by Australia in 1985, India and Pakistan have met 12 times in 50-over tournaments featuring each of the world’s leading sides. While the overall record stands at 72-52 in Pakistan’s favour, it is 10-2 to India in the games that matter, including 6-0 at the World Cup.
Over the years, that statistic has come to have the same effect on Pakistani cricketers and fans as the Miandad six once did on Indians. But having made the final against all odds, Pakistan, revitalised by the feisty leadership of Sarfraz Ahmed, have the look of destiny’s children. Against a Virat Kohli-led India, who have the happy knack of finding ways to win marquee matches, they will hope that it is the spirit of Miandad, rather than the ghost of Sharma, that influences their performance.

I have always been interested in fighting sports. I grew up obsessed with WWE, Fight Club is my favourite film and I remember watching Holyfield v Tyson, aged seven. But, until savate (pronounced “savat”), I had never done so much as a kickboxing class.
I stumbled on savate by accident. At the start of 2016, I had a lifestyle overhaul, gave up alcohol and cigarettes and started running more. Soon, running wasn’t enough. I searched for kickboxing classes in my area and found the London savate club. I had never heard of it. The site called it an “elegant kickboxing sport from France”. Kickboxing? Elegant? I was intrigued.
Savate combines French kicks – such as a fouetté (a whip or roundhouse kick) – with English boxing. There are two types of competition: combat and assaut. Combat savate is full contact, in which you are looking to knock out your opponent. In assaut savate, the kind practised in most UK clubs, excessive force is forbidden. Yes, you aim to kick and punch your opponent, but you don’t try to knock their head off, only to make contact. You score points for touches and the winner is the fighter who demonstrates the best technique and control. Not fearing for my face means I can think more strategically to anticipate my opponent’s attacks and work out how to counter them. It is in equal parts a mental and a physical workout.
The fights range from three 1.5-minute rounds up to five two-minute rounds, with a minute’s rest between rounds. I was nervous at first, but when nervous energy mixes with adrenaline and becomes an exciting, fast-paced and challenging bout, it makes me want to come back for more.
Savate has given me some incredible opportunities. In the past year, I’ve passed my blue and green glove gradings, travelled to Ireland and Hungary for competitions, become a British vice-champion and joined the GB squad. All without getting a single black eye.
How often do you train? I train twice a week, run twice a week and fit in a weights session if I can. Favourite move? Fouetté figure – a lovely French way of saying a kick to the head.
1 Find an authentic savate club. Many martial artists put savate on their CV, but fewer have trained with bone fide practitioners or have ever got into the ring. The Great Britain Savate Federation lists clubs with qualified instructors at savate.org.uk.
2 Don’t worry about being fit and flexible before starting. Well-run beginner classes won’t expect you to be Bruce Lee on your first night. Training makes you fitter – it doesn’t presuppose fitness.
3 Get in touch with a local savate club about watching a class to see what it is all about.
4 Boots are the most important piece of kit. The word savate refers to the boot worn by practitioners of old. It is hard to get hold of genuine savate boots in the UK, but a boxing boot without jagged edges or rough soles is similar.
5 Don’t worry about getting your head smashed in on your first night. Savate is a contact sport, but a good club won’t ask you to spar until you are ready.James Southwood, founder of London savate club and 2014 world champion
Despite only four wins, a poor percentage and three ordinary quarters against St Kilda, North Melbourne coach Brad Scott is still talking AFL finals.
North managed only four goals in the first three quarters against the Saints on Friday night and Scott lamented they were never really in the hunt.
The 17-point loss, on the night they honoured club legend Brent Harvey pre-game, left the Kangaroos languishing with a 4-8 record and a percentage well under 100.
But they also remain just two games outside the top eight, in a year when upset results are rife.
“It’s a strange season ... we’ll continue to play to win,” Scott said.
“We’re still in that group of a number of teams who still have genuine hope to play in September and that’s our ambition from this point on.
“So we’ll keep trying to play footy that’s capable of beating sides in September and we’ll keep picking the team to win games to get enough wins to try and compete.”
Scott said the final score flattered North and they paid dearly for too many basic errors, adding they will change their training routine to work more on their skills.
One positive was second-gamer Declan Mountford, who put everything into his tag on Saints star Jack Steven and kept him quiet for much of the first half.
While Steven went forward late in the second term and kicked two goals, Mountford earned a big tick from Scott for his performance.
Scott was also pleased for ruckman Todd Goldstein, who was high among North’s best after a run of below-par form.
Despite failing to finish the Kangaroos off in the final term on Friday, St Kilda coach Alan Richardson was rapt with the performance.
They led by 42 points midway through the last quarter, but took the foot off North’s throat.
The ‘Roos kicked the last four goals to restore some respectability after only kicking that many up to three-quarter time.
But the 12.17 (89)-10.12 (72) win broke St Kilda’s three-game losing streak and Richardson noted that, including the bye, they had gone a month without winning.
“I was really proud of them, the fact they were able to play in that sort of manner,” he said.
“Our focus was not necessarily about getting our season back on track, that was an outcome of playing good footy.
“What does our good footy look like? What does it mean for you as an individual? I reckon they had real clarity around that.
“Now we didn’t get it done in the last quarter, but there were three quarters of positive footy, the way we want to play ... they’ll get belief from that.”
The Saints are not yet out of trouble, but at 6-6 they remain in the top-eight hunt.
“We definitely need to improve, there’s no doubt about that, but it was a step towards getting our footy back and that was pleasing,” Richardson said.
Veterans Leigh Montagna and Nick Riewoldt played key roles after having plenty of focus on them during the week.
Montagna was nonplussed after commentator Dermott Brereton took aim at his form, while Riewoldt returned from two games out with a knee injury.
There is also ongoing talk about whether the former captain should keep playing beyond this season.
Montagna had a solid game off half-back, while Riewoldt was relentless with his hard running.
“At the risk of sounding like a horse trainer, I think he’ll be better for the run,” Richardson said of Riewoldt.
The match review panel will look at an incident where Riewoldt lashed out in retaliation at North’s Scott Thompson and hit him across the back, but the Saints star should avoid suspension.
If Rory McIlroy was a racehorse, there would have been no logic at all in ranking him among the favourites for an event of equivalent significance to the US Open. As golf’s version of a performer who is lightly raced, McIlroy arrived at Erin Hills having played only 22 competitive rounds in 2017.
That figure increased by only two, McIlroy’s second-round 71 in the second major of 2017 proving insufficient to improve the damage caused by an opening round of 78. McIlroy at least departed in reasonable spirits, his run of four birdies in six closing holes providing a glance back towards what the four-time major champion is capable of.
“In practice I was really good,” McIlroy said. “You play 54 holes around here before the tournament; I felt really comfortable. I drove the ball well, my irons were good. Everything was in good shape. But you never really know until you put a card in your hand and you’re under the gun a little bit.”
Rickie Fowler encountered pressure of his own, the first-round leader having reached the 11th on Friday without having dropped a shot in the tournament. Fowler promptly bogeyed three holes in a row. At six under, he is one from the halfway lead as held by four players. Two of that group, Paul Casey and Tommy Fleetwood, are English; Brooks Koepka and Brian Harman complete the quartet. Casey’s prominence is remarkable given the eight he posted at the 14th in round two.
The investigative skills of Quincy are hardly necessary when determining why McIlroy missed a second US Open cut in succession. This tournament has not been altogether kind to McIlroy aside from the 2011 occasion when he won it, let alone when the buildup was disrupted by fitness troubles. The rib problem that upset his opening to the year provides perfect explanation for the appearance of rust at Erin Hills. The equipment switch that was triggered by Nike’s withdrawal from the market also inevitably adds an element of upheaval that McIlroy would ideally have done without. These matters are all intrinsically linked; only by featuring at the business end of events can McIlroy perfectly attune himself to what new tools he has at his disposal, just as history shows he benefits from the confidence acquired from the very same scenarios. McIlroy relishes the momentum he has thus far been denied for reasons beyond his control.
“I’ve been very light on competitive rounds,” McIlroy said. “I think at this point in time I just need to play. And I feel, even though it’s very disappointing to not be here on the weekend, these last two rounds will serve me well going into the summer. Yesterday, coming off an injury, I was a little anxious going out there. I got off to a good start but it sort of caught up with me as the round went on. I think the more rounds I can play, I’m hopefully going to get rid of all that stuff and hopefully strip it down to what you saw the last six holes.”
Here is another reason for McIlroy cheer; no other player among the world’s leading group has recently embarked on a profitable run. The 28-year-old is hardly lagging behind in a wider context.
The next part of the season is key for him. Next week’s Travellers Championship begins a stretch of six events in eight weeks, including two major championships and one, the US PGA Championship, at the Quail Hollow venue he has previous for pulling apart. Should success arrive within this period, the frustrations of the first part of 2017 will be readily forgotten. Even when the major season concludes, McIlroy will not lack focus in respect of defending the FedEx Cup.
“I’m just excited to get a run of golf now,” he added. “I’m optimistic with where my game is. Hopefully I’ve got a lot of the bad stuff out of my system yesterday and some parts today. And again, it’s just a matter of getting competitive rounds under my belt. I’m playing next week in Connecticut. I’ve got a nice run leading up to the Open Championship. I’ve got a busy summer, so I’m excited to play a lot of golf. I feel like that’s going to help me to get back into contention and try to win some of these things. I’m hungry but I’m not going to force it. I’m going to let it happen. I’m going to play. The worst thing I can do is go and force it because that’s not my game.”
The key McIlroy problem on Friday was on the greens, leading to inevitable comment regarding his switch to a new putter in recent days. “I didn’t think it was the putter.It was the guy on the end of it,” he said. Jason Day also failed to survive for the closing 36 holes. Yet there was contrasting sentiment from the Australian. Day was bemused by an aggregate of 10 over par. “I felt the most calm I have in a major in a long time this week,” said Day after his 75. “Unfortunately this didn’t pan out. The golf course is beautiful. I just didn’t execute.”
Late on Friday, the world No1 Dustin Johnson completed a high-profile exodus from Wisconsin. Johnson added a 73 to his Thursday 75, thereby missing the cut by three. Only three months ago, an imperious Johnson appeared unbeatable. He has since missed the Masters through a freak accident and, via different circumstances, now been forced to watch another major weekend on television. “I couldn’t have shot any higher,” Johnson said. “I couldn’t possibly shoot any higher than I did. I just struggled on the greens. It’s simple.”
As McIlroy, Johnson and Day exited, Casey kept his dream of a first major win alive. “It’s not every day you can enjoy a round with an eight on the card but I’m a happy man,” Casey said. Casey has recorded three consecutive top-six finishes in the Masters but has only one top-10 in the US Open in 13 attempts, which came a decade ago at Oakmont.
“It feels good,” the 39-year-old said. “It shows what can happen if you get out of position on this course. Even just trying to take my medicine is very difficult. It’s a good eight in the end.”
Australia’s Adam Scott also failed to progress to the weekend.
If Sir Michael Stoute were in better form, I’d be tempted to accuse him of attempted robbery, running a proper Group horse like Thikriyaat (2.55) in a mere Listed contest at York today. But in fairness to the Newmarket trainer, winners have not exactly been tumbling out of his yard in recent weeks; let’s hope this proves a timely fillip for him ahead of Royal Ascot.
Ribchester was the only horse to beat Thikriyaat in his first five races, which also included a Group Three success at Glorious Goodwood. He had a fibrillating heart when well beaten on his final run last season and surely needed his return to action in a handicap.
There is more to come from him at the age of four and this return to a sound surface will help.
1.50 York Hurdling did not work out for the ex-Italian Azari but a return to Flat racing showed him in a pretty good light in a Wolverhampton claimer the other day. Having since moved from Paul Nicholls to Tom Dascombe, he looks like he belongs at this level and has one of the better riders involved.
2.05 Musselburgh The handicapper is probably right to rate Zac Brown a better horse on sand than on turf but he still has possibilities on grass, as he showed when winning at Goodwood last time. Charlie Wallis’s gelding faces a stiffer task here but could be up to beating the penalty.
2.20 York Shady McCoy is of interest, now that he’s back in a big field, but a wide draw is no help. Heaven’s Guest also loves a big-field handicap and has dropped to an enticing mark. His most recent effort hinted he might be on the way back and he went close from 9lb higher over this course and distance in May last year.
2.40 Sandown Tim Easterby’s team seem to be running their way into form and this doesn’t feel like the time to desert his Copper Knight, the winner of his last two starts. He made all to defy a mark of 95 in a York handicap last time and it seems a gelding operation has made quite a difference to this one, a flop in last year’s Windsor Castle when with Hugo Palmer.
3.10 Musselburgh Another Easterby runner, Orion’s Bow, might be worth a second look. The winner of five in a row for Dandy Nicholls last summer, he could be helped by this drop to five furlongs with a strong pace assured. Duke Of Firenze is respected but I don’t fancy his chance of picking a way through from his draw close to the stands’ rail, where runners will congregate in front of him through the early stages.
3.30 York Easterby has another fair chance with Golden Apollo, carrying a penalty for a jaw-dropping performance at Pontefract on Monday that left his previous form far behind. His trainer has won this race twice in the past four years.

The British & Irish Lions have called up six replacements to join the tour party in New Zealand as cover for their final midweek fixtures. The players – four Welsh and two Scots – will help to bolster the bench against the Chiefs in Waikato on Tuesday. That will allow the coach’s first-choice 23 to prepare properly for next Saturday’s first Test against New Zealand.
Warren Gatland indicated as long ago as September he was considering calling up additional players and has decided to move before this weekend’s Test matches involving the home unions are completed. The choices of the scrum-half Gareth Davies, the lock Cory Hill, the tight-head prop Tomas Francis, the hooker Kristian Dacey, and Scotland’s centre Finn Russell and prop Allan Dell have, however, received some criticism from the England coach, Eddie Jones.
With the suggestion that the Lions calls have been influenced by geography – Wales and Scotland are currently in Australasia, while England are in Argentina – Jones told the BBC: “My only comment would be I would like to see it picked on merit rather than geographical proximity.”
With Stuart Hogg invalided out of the tour and with Owen Farrell and Courtney Lawes unavailable, the Lions would otherwise have had to ask several of their potential Test 23 to double up next week, had they stuck with only their existing tour members.
Several replacements were also summoned in the later stages of the 2013 tour, with one of them, Alex Corbisiero, going on to score a try in the decisive third Test win against Australia in Sydney. In addition to the game against the Chiefs in Hamilton, the Lions are due to face the Hurricanes in Wellington between the first and second Tests.
Any suggestion an influx of new players will merely widen an existing split between Test players and the rest of the squad, however, has been flatly denied. Steve Hansen, the All Blacks coach, said this week he felt the touring team had already divided into midweek and Saturday sides but the Saracens’ lock George Kruis insists that perception is false. “He’s entitled to his opinion and he’s obviously a well-respected coach but he doesn’t know what’s going on inside the camp,” Kruis said. “He can have his opinion but we’ve bonded pretty well.”
The precise length of Farrell’s recovery period remains unclear but grade one quadriceps strains like the one he sustained in training usually take between seven and 10 days to recover. That leaves him touch and go to feature at Eden Park but the Lions do have one advantage in the shape of Phil Morrow, Saracens’ performance director, who is part of the strength and conditioning team on this tour. If anyone should know how to get Farrell back to fitness it is the Ulsterman and Kruis also confirmed the fly-half will do everything in his power to be involved.
“He is professional and he’d do whatever it takes. Phil’s dealt with him for the last five to six years now so he’ll know what will get him going.”
If Farrell fails to make it and Jonathan Sexton picks up a knock against the Maori All Blacks, the Lions could well be down to their third choice No10, Wales’s Dan Biggar. That possibility lends a further layer of intrigue to the fixture, although Gatland’s players are determined not to panic.
“I don’t know if it will be a major blow to the squad,” said Sean O’Brien, looking forward to underlining his own claims for a place in the starting Test back row. “[Farrell] has a lot of experience, has been playing very well and he’s a good leader. He will obviously be a loss but there’s other lads there to fill that void.”
The Maori All Blacks will provide no respite as they seek to repeat their 19-13 victory over the Lions on the 2005 tour. They possess a good lineout threat and have as lethal a backline as the visitors will have experienced on this expedition to date. The Lions’ aggressive rush defence is not always easy to outwit but their opponents will have the skill and pace to test that theory with artful little chips in behind.
Ultimately this tour is all about belief and O’Brien, for one, still says New Zealand should be wary despite their warm-up rout of Samoa: “I don’t see an aura in terms of them being unbeatable. They’re a group of guys exactly like us who play rugby. Anything can happen on the day.”
The Lions will also be keen to impress the referee Jaco Peyper, who will preside over the first Test at Eden Park, too.
Judy Murray and Heather Stanning are among the leading sporting figures to feature in the Queen’s birthday honours list.
Murray, the former Great Britain Fed Cup coach and mother to the Wimbledon champions Andy and Jamie, will receive an OBE for services to tennis, women in sport and charity.
“I do what I love and I love what I do, so I feel very lucky to have been given this honour,” she said. “I’ll keep working hard to grow tennis and to promote women’s sport across the UK.” She is the third member of her family to be honoured after Andy was knighted in the new year, while Jamie also received an OBE in 2016.
The double Olympic rowing champion Stanning, who announced her retirement from the sport after successfully defending her title in Rio last summer, is also upgraded to an OBE. Stanning had been awarded an MBE in the wake of her first Olympic triumph, at London 2012.
The Ireland rugby union captain, Rory Best, who won his 100th cap for his country late last year, is another recipient of an OBE, for services to rugby. The 34-year-old is currently touring New Zealand with the British and Irish Lions, and offered his thanks to the scores of coaches, team-mates, friends and family he believes deserve to share in his honour.
“I’m just so surprised and humbled; it’s such a massive honour,” Best said. “To be recognised for contributing to a sport, for someone to feel I’m worthy of being nominated, and then to be deemed worthy, it’s quite incredible.”
Dick Greenwood, the former England rugby union captain and coach, receives an OBE for services to national and international rugby. The 75-year-old made five Test appearances between 1966 and 1969 and later took over as head coach from 1983 to 1985.
Greenwood said: “It’s something that crops up out of the blue and I’ve got a lot of people to thank for it. I’m a rugby man and rugby has been my lifelong passion. It is a great team game, so I am above all a team player, and my debt is to all my team-mates who have supported me through the years.”
John Conteh, the Liverpool light-heavyweight who held the WBC title between 1974 and 1978, is awarded an MBE for his services to boxing.
Conteh, who has played an active role with charities and the London ex-Boxers’ Association in retirement, joked: “I never even thought about the possibility of getting an honour – where I grew up the only letters you got were from the DHSS. It’s an absolute privilege and an honour and I’m so grateful to all the people who supported me and put me forward for this award.”
Scott Hann, the gymnastics coach who guided Max Whitlock to his double gold achievement at the Rio Olympics, is also given an MBE. Hann’s work at the South Essex club has been crucial in the remarkable recent success of the sport in Britain, which culminated in a total of seven medals in Brazil.
“Obviously it is recognition for all the hard work and commitment and dedication but it is never something as a coach you expect to receive,” Hann said. “At the end of the day I stand on the shoulders of so many giants, and I am privileged to get the chance to work with Max and so many other great athletes.”
The Northern Ireland football captain, Steven Davis, is another recipient of an MBE, having led his country to the last 16 at last summer’s European Championships.
The 32-year-old Southampton midfielder captained his country in France at their first major finals in 30 years and helped Michael O’Neill’s team to the knockout stages. Davis said: “I was shocked and taken aback when I was told about it. I thought it was a joke at first.
“It was just something that had never registered with me, that I might receive something like this. Now, however, I think it’s unbelievable. To get recognition like this when I’m still playing is a massive thing.”
Brian Noble, the former Bradford Bulls and Great Britain coach who is the current director of rugby at Toronto Wolfpack, receives an MBE for services to rugby league and charity.
Jennie Price, the Sport England chief executive since 2007, receives a CBE for services to sport, specifically for her work increasing levels of female participation.
A record 185-run fifth-wicket partnership between Samit Patel and Steven Mullaney guided Nottinghamshire into the Royal London Cup final with a five-wicket win over Essex at Chelmsford.
Nottinghamshire reached their target of 371 with three balls to spare – the highest successful run chase in a domestic List A competition – and they will face Worcestershire or Surrey at Lord’s on 1 July.
The pair came together after Brendan Taylor fell for 62 after putting on 100 with Patel for the fourth wicket and Nottinghamshire still had work to do at 180 for four just before the halfway mark.
Mullaney brought up his first List A century from 71 balls with a fifth six before he fell with victory in sight for 111 after striking six sixes in his 75-ball innings.
Patel saw Nottinghamshire home with an unbeaten 122 as they overhauled the record chase of 359 from Hampshire against Surrey in 2007.
Alastair Cook hammered his third century in the competition and Ryan ten Doeschate his second as Essex closed on 370 for five. The former England captain hit 133 from 128 balls with 16 fours as Essex rattled up their highest total in the competition this season. It was his 12th one-day century and took him past 1,000 runs for the season in all competitions, 636 of them in this competition.
Ten Doeschate joined Cook in the middle at 173 for three in the 29th over before Cook drove Harry Gurney for four to bring up his century off 95 balls.
Ten Doeschate took four successive boundaries off Mullaney as he raced to 50 off 40 deliveries but Cook fell shortly after, top-edging Patel, and Chris Read claimed the catch running back. Ten Doeschate then took three sixes off the penultimate over from Gurney and brought up his own century off 64 balls to take Essex past 350.
Nottinghamshire started positively but three wickets from Jamie Porter left them on 80 for three in the 10th over. After a period of consolidation, Taylor kick-started the innings with a chipped six over long-on off Neil Wagner. He brought up his half-century from 39 balls with five fours and that six but when he had reached 62, he called for a sharp single from the bowler’s end, finished up at the same end as Patel and Porter’s throw was gathered by Simon Harmer to complete a simple run-out.
Patel reached his 50 from 60 balls soon afterwards and then Mullaney took over. He cleared the ropes with a straight drive off Harmer and then hit four fours in the spinner’s next over on the way to his highest 50-over score as he and Patel took Nottinghamshire to a superb victory.
Sergey Kovalev is convinced he did enough to defeat Andre Ward when they met for the unified light heavyweight championship in the autumn but this time he is determined to sprint through the tape.
The Russian nicknamed Krusher dumped Ward to the canvas early on and dominated the first half of their November fight but he faded just enough to allow the Olympic champion from Oakland to escape with a narrow, controversial unanimous decision. All three judges scored it 114-113 for Ward.
The rare match-up between two undefeated champions in their prime somehow managed to live up to the billing, offering fans everything but a definitive conclusion. So they meet again on Saturday night in Las Vegas as Kovalev tries to wrest back the WBA, WBO and IBF titles he surrendered in his first professional setback.
It is the best fight that can be made in boxing today: Ward and Kovalev enter at No1 and No2, respectively, in Ring magazine’s pound-for-pound ratings. And there is antipathy between the fighters and their promoters that has lent further intrigue to the proceedings.
“I just have one goal, to beat Andre Ward and beat all the shit from him because he doesn’t deserve the belt and the status of a champion,” Kovalev said. “I want to put him back in his place.”
The 34-year-old (30-1-1, 26 KOs) believes he overtrained for the first fight, describing the doomed combination of three-a-day workouts and daily half-marathons with a conditioning coach who was afraid to tell him to dial it back. This time he has enlisted a new strength coach in Aleksandr Mikhailovich, whose training philosophy is said to centre around his robust work with biathletes.
“They seem to work well together,” Kovalev’s trainer, John David Jackson, said this week. “If Mikhailovich did his job, then Sergey will be fine. For the first fight Sergey was running 14 miles a day and I asked him why. I told him he was going to wear his legs out. He is still running but not nearly as much. He is saving himself this time around.”
Ward (31-0, 15 KOs), a longtime champion at 168lbs who all but cleaned out the division, went 114-5 in an extraordinary amateur career that culminated with a gold medal at the Athens Games, which remains the last time an American has topped the podium in men’s boxing. The last time he lost a fight was against John Revish at the 1997 National Silver Gloves tournament in Baton Rouge when he was 13.
“Tactically I obviously want to have a better start and I’m going to have a better start,” the 33-year-old American said. “That’s really what got me in my hole: the start. I’m sure he’s made some adjustments and he’s going to come harder but I’m ready. I’ve done everything I’m supposed to do. When you prepare the way you’re supposed to, and all the boxes are checked, it’s time to go to work.”
Ward, who is promoted by Jay Z’s nascent Roc Nation Sports, has been guaranteed a minimum purse of $6m. Kovalev’s contract has yet to be filed with the Nevada Athletic Commission but it’s said he is due a 75% share of the overall take for Main Events, his longtime promoter, in lieu of a base purse. That means his compensation is in direct proportion with ticket sales and pay-per-view revenue, which many believe will be compromised by Wednesday’s headline-grabbing announcement of the August novelty match between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Conor McGregor.
That likely explains why Kovalev stormed off stage before the end of Thursday’s final press conference, declining to participate in interviews and the traditional stare-down photoshoot. His frustration is understandable, but there’s no doubt a reversal of November’s cruel result would offer swift consolation.
At this point in the rugby cycle teams from all over the world have a rare chance to work on their strength in depth but also to brandish it. This weekend the World Rugby Under-20 Championship reaches its climax in Georgia, while the best of British and Irish lock horns with the Maori, broadly analogous to a New Zealand second or third team. Next weekend the Lions take on the All Blacks themselves.
Meanwhile, on a third continent, what is left of England, with 30 of their best players unavailable, are wound up in a special bubble preparing to clinch a two-Test series against Argentina, who will be there again in two years’ time when the pool stages of the World Cup get under way. Having blooded 10 new caps in a remarkable 38-34 win last Saturday in San Juan, the convoy moves directly east across the country to Santa Fe.
“While the eyes of the rugby world aren’t on us right now, I think that’s a good thing,” says Dylan Hartley, England’s captain, who will move into third place on England’s list of caps winners. “Our eyes are on us and we are continually developing and trying to get better. I think English rugby is in a very strong place at the moment.”
He may think the eyes of the rugby world are not on him but the benefits of a terrestrial showcase meant that 1.8 million viewers watched the exhilarating scenes from San Juan last Saturday – versus the 600,000 who saw the Lions. And in Santa Fe there is little sign of a drop-off in interest. Hartley and Eddie Jones joined their equivalents from Argentina and a few other local dignitaries at a top-table press conference on Thursday night in front of an audience of hundreds.
Jones is relishing the old-school feel of this tour of the provinces. “It is good to see Argentina bring rugby to the regional centres. One of the unfortunate things of professional rugby is that that has died out in a lot of other countries, because money drives the game. This tour has brought a bit of that back.”
Argentina are thriving on the back of their closer assimilation into the fabric of world rugby, even if they are on a horrible run of 10 defeats from their last 12 games. The blend of speed and furious power with which they play the game will surely develop into something special, possibly the equal of their vintages who finished in the top four at two of the last three World Cups. Which should give those in their pool pause for thought, at least.
If England are not at full strength here, neither are Argentina, who continue to exclude those playing overseas. “We are expecting our European players to return [by the time of the World Cup],” says Daniel Hourcade, Argentina’s coach. “As much as it is a political decision, it is also a rugby one. It’s important that they come back and play in Super Rugby, because that’s what we’re aiming for.”
England squad members can barely move from A to B without being asked about the prospect of Argentina hosting a Lions tour or a World Cup, either of which, incidentally, the country would be perfect for. But, for now, it is England who are in town, albeit this curious but vital blend of youth and exuberance with cool experience.
Last Saturday’s game was one for the ages, Argentina taking the initiative with a pace that Jones described as 10% higher than anything they encountered in the Six Nations. Jones was delighted with the test it posed his youngsters – and how they came through it – but he expects a different one again on Saturday, the dry, high heat of San Juan morphing into the close and sticky Santa Fe, nestled low among the slow tributaries of the Parana river.
“I think it might be a bit of a slugathon,” says Jones. “It is very rare that you get two games the same. It is like drinking a beer. The first beer never tastes the same as the second beer, and the third beer never tastes the same as the second one. Rugby is the same. The second game is generally never like the first game. If the first has been open the second has been tighter, so we are prepared for both.”
The return of Chris Robshaw will help with that flexibility, and the new cap Sam Underhill ought to add a level of physicality, albeit of the 20-year-old variety, which these days need not mean the side is compromised. In the backs, Piers Francis comes in at inside-centre for his first start. Having been rejected by English rugby in his teens, he has been schooled in New Zealand and returns quite the complete player.
England and New Zealand, the coming together everyone wants to see. For now, across various continents, they continue their development towards the 2019 World Cup. This tour has increased Jones’s pool of blooded players to more than 60; a second win in Argentina would leave him as satisfied with where England are as he could possibly have hoped to be.
Former two-times UFC welterweight champion Matt Hughes was airlifted to a medical facility on Friday after the truck he was driving collided with a moving train around 70 miles northeast of St Louis, an Illinois state police spokesperson told the Guardian.
Hughes, 43, was traveling in a pickup truck eastbound on Beelers Trail in Illinois’s Montgomery County approaching a railroad grade crossing marked with crossbuck signs at around 10:45am when he crossed the tracks directly in front of an oncoming train and was struck on the passenger side, officers said.
Police said Hughes was “seriously injured” and transported to a Springfield hospital by an Arch Air Medical Services helicopter ambulance.
UFC president Dana White told ESPN that he’s been in contact with Hughes’ family, who are traveling to the facility where the Illinois native was taken.
“Apparently he has head trauma,” White told the network. “His family is traveling to him now.”
The Illinois state police’s traffic reconstruction unit was still investigating the crash on Friday afternoon. Officials said no further information was available.

Hughes had two as stints the organization’s welterweight champion from 2001 through 2006, during which time he was considered among the best pound-for-pound fighters in mixed martial arts.
He was inducted to the UFC’s Hall of Fame in 2010 and formally retired from competition three years later, though he was reportedly mulling a comeback as recently as this year.
Magnus Carlsen’s career is in crisis and this week Norway’s 26-year-old world champion has been on the brink of losing the No1 ranking he has held without a break for almost six years.
Carlsen was in joint last place in the Altibox Norway elite event at Stavanger, with a pack of eager rivals within one game of usurping his No1 position, but he was saved, at least for the moment, when his old rival, Russia’s Sergey Karjakin, blundered a drawn position in Thursday’s penultimate round to give the beleaguered champion a windfall point. Carlsen then drew with India’s Vishy Anand in Friday’s ninth and final round to total 4/9 in next to last place with just a solitary win, six draws and two defeats.
After seven of the nine rounds Carlsen had not won a game, giving a drab performance and losing twice to major rivals. Levon Aronian beat him in a truly brilliant game with a sophisticated version of the ancient Greek Gift bishop sacrifice, then Russia’s former champion Vlad Kramnik also saw further than Carlsen in a tactical sequence.
Carlsen has often said he values being top of the rankings even more than his official world crown and at his zenith in July 2014 his rating was an all-time record of 2882, 50 points ahead of his nearest rival. Since then he has suffered some losses to weaker players as well as an increased ratio of draws.
His rating gradually dropped some 70 points and he retains the No1 spot only due to his earlier achievements. Taken alone, his 2017 results would put him outside the top 10. The live ratings after his win on Thursday show him at 2823 with five rivals, including the rampant Aronian, above 2800 and thus within striking distance.
Final scores from Stavanger were Levon Aronian (Armenia) 6/9, Hikaru Nakamura (US) and Vlad Kramnik (Russia) 5, Wesley So and Fabiano Caruana (both US) and Anish Giri (Netherlands) 4.5, Magnus Carlsen (Norway), Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) and Vishy Anand (India) 4, Sergey Karjakin (Russia) 3.5.
Exactly why Carlsen, who was widely expected to prove himself alongside Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov as one of the greatest world champions, is having such a prolonged slump in form is unclear. A grandmaster in his mid-20s is normally near his playing peak, because his ambition, creative energy and physical stamina for long games are all in good shape.
Carlsen’s special skill used to be to take on a long endgame with little or no advantage and grind the opponent down by incessant pressure. His opponents have got wise to that and more of his games now feature level positions where his well-prepared rival halves easily.
Kasparov thinks Carlsen’s play has stagnated and that his avoidance of mainstream opening theory blunts his edge. He spent weeks preparing for Stavanger, yet his repertoire included tame Italian openings. In contrast Aronian, who beat Carlsen brilliantly and won the tournament, came without a coach to help him prepare. The Armenian explained: “It is important to be responsible for your own preparation and to take it more seriously. You know, when there is no one to expect help from, you will be working more concentrated and determined.”
Aronian’s win from Carlsen was a remarkable mix of two classical tactical themes. He sacrificed first a pawn, then rook for bishop, to put the world champion’s queen in danger of being trapped. The pawn was a rook pawn, whereas in the Poisoned Pawn Sicilian, where Boris Spassky once famously beat Bobby Fischer, White gambits the b2 pawn.
Trying to rescue his queen, Carlsen left his king short of defenders and allowed a version of the Greek Gift bishop sacrifice. There were still mistakes on both sides until Aronian broke through to win one of the most original games of recent years.
The game showed that 11 a3! was a poisoned pawn, so Black’s safest was 11...Bd6 when White has just a small edge. Then 14...Ne4 set up the Greek Gift, where Aronian planned to meet 18...Kg6 by 19 Qg4 f5 20 Qg3 Kf6 21 d5! winning. As played, 25 Qa7?! (Qb7) gave Carlsen a possible escape by Nf6! but the world champion missed both that and 31...Rf8! which would have held on. These are small blemishes, though, in a classic victory.

Manchester United are watching the Cristiano Ronaldo show with renewed interest after the Real Madrid striker made it plain he is “outraged” at what he feels is unfair treatment by tax authorities and is now determined to leave Spain.
The 32-year-old feels he is being singled out for disproportionate treatment after prosecutors accused him of defrauding the authorities of €14.7m. A source close to the player claims the “outraged” Portugal international “feels great indignation” following the public speculation about his tax affairs and a sense of “injustice” at the allegations – which he contests – and he has made a decision to leave the country.
Ronaldo, who signed a new five-year contract in November, has made no secret of his affection for United – the club he left to join Madrid in 2009 after six years at Old Trafford – and José Mourinho, who shares the same super agent Jorge Mendes, would relish his return as he seeks to build a team capable of a title challenge and a successful campaign in the Champions League.
United remain one of the clubs with the financial muscle to offer a competitive package for Ronaldo – they are predicting record revenues of up to £570m this year – and his return would be a dream commercial move.
He has a €1bn (£880m) release clause in his current Madrid deal and United – now without Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s wages on the books and the potential to lose Wayne Rooney’s financial burden soon – would be able to meet Ronaldo’s wage demands of around £400,000 a week. Paris Saint-Germain could match United’s offer but the Old Trafford move presents Ronaldo with his fairytale moment and a far grander stage on which to perform. The potential availability of one of the world’s most marketable players will also naturally alert the Chinese Super League clubs.
Reports that Ronaldo wanted to leave Real were sparked on Friday in the Portuguese newspaper A Bola. It claimed his decision was “irreversible” and that he has already told his Madrid team-mates that he wants to leave.
The root of Ronaldo’s anger stems from Spanish prosecutors’ lawsuit against the player, accusing him of defrauding tax authorities of €14.7m by hiding his image rights income between 2011 and 2014. Ronaldo has categorically denied any wrongdoing. Real backed that assertion, saying they were confident the Portuguese forward had acted legally.
Following the tax allegations, Ronaldo posted a picture of himself with his fingers to his lips on Instagram with the caption: “Sometimes the best answer it’s to be quiet.”
Earlier this week Ronaldo’s agency Gestifute released a statement which read: “There is no tax evasion scheme ... There has never been any hiding nor any intention to hide anything.”
Ronaldo’s frustrations at his treatment come after leading Real to three Champions League titles, scoring twice in last month’s final against Juventus in Cardiff as they became the first club to retain the trophy. He also became only the second player to score in three different finals and remains the competition’s record goalscorer with 105.
Barcelona’s Lionel Messi took a similar stance in threatening to quit Spain in 2014, also claiming he had been singled out for special treatment, when he was accused of concealing €4.1m from the authorities. The Argentina international was found guilty and subsequently lost an appeal against a 21-month prison sentence – under Spanish law sentences under two years are usually suspended – and a €2.1m (£1.8m) fine.
The tragic scenario attached to one of Augusta National’s founding fathers, Clifford Roberts, may be well known but the similarly grim circumstances which form a backdrop to Erin Hills have barely featured in the buildup to the US Open. For obvious reasons, perhaps; this tale of money problems, homicide and a lengthy jail term is hardly in keeping with an upbeat major championship narrative.
Imagery of Roberts remains a constant feature during any Masters week. In September 1977, aged 83 and a year after standing down as the long-term Augusta chairman, he committed suicide on the very premises he played such a major part in establishing.
The scenario around Steve Trattner is even more troublesome because it involves others and criminality. As Erin Hills stages its first major this week, Trattner has watched via television in a nearby jail. He is serving a 35-year sentence for the murder of his wife. And, make no mistake, from the Waupun Correctional Institution, Trattner is observing every shot. “I’m going to be watching every minute of the tournament,” he said in a recent interview with Sports Illustrated. “For so many years, that place was my home away from home.”
Trattner, a former software engineer, clearly had an architect’s eye. While living a seemingly unremarkable life on the outskirts of Milwaukee, married and soon to be a father of two, he had a dream to build a public golf course. Such a concept is fanciful without identifying appropriate land; in itself an infamously tricky business. But Trattner did it, just as he convinced multi-millionaire Bob Lang to fund the project.
“Only two people, Bob Lang and I, experienced the day-to-day transformation of the property,” explained Trattner. “All the ups and downs, challenges, hundreds of conversations about tweaks.”
The $2.5m land deal was pieced together in 1999 and at the last minute, with the farmer who owned what is now known as Erin Hills on the verge of removing the land from the market. Trattner became project manager on a salary of $2,000 a month. “I would have done it for free,” he claimed. He was fulfilling a long-term dream.
By 2005, a year before the facility opened, Trattner was concerned by Lang’s increased spending on the golf course. The former’s marriage to Sin Lam was also in trouble owing, mainly, to Trattner’s addiction-like approach to Erin Hills. “I was going to be the general manager and that would have been heaven for me,” he later said.
The upshot instead was altogether different. After a domestic dispute on 3 January 2006 – Lam was intending on filing for divorce – court papers reveal Trattner threw his wife against a cabinet, banged her head against the floor and performed strangulation. He covered his wife with a blanket, dragged her into the living room and went to bed before taking his children to school the following morning as if everything was normal. That afternoon – after meetings at Erin Hills – Trattner called police, sleeping pills having been placed at Lam’s side to imply suicide.
Trattner went on to plead guilty to first-degree reckless homicide. He is currently in the midst of an appeal, on the basis he was not properly advised or represented during courtroom hearings. Trattner now claims self defence was key to his actions.
“If you’re a judge, sitting up there with this guy sitting in front of you, and you see his wife who was supposedly strangled to death for no reason, you’re not going to care about some golf course that nobody knows about,” admits Lew Wasserman, Trattner’s lawyer.
“Is this a case of perfect self-defence? Maybe not. But that’s not the issue. We’re not dealing with a jury’s verdict. We’re dealing with whether he was properly advised to enter a plea for first-degree reckless homicide.
“It’s sadly ironic because without Steven Trattner’s efforts, there wouldn’t be an Erin Hills.”
Having become more smitten with the dream than was healthy, Lang found himself at the bottom of a fiscal hole. Spending had spiralled out of control. The businessman, who attended this week’s tournament, sold the site in 2009, before the US Open dream became reality. “I had a come-to-Jesus with myself,” he said. “I had no choice. I had to sell.” The price was listed at $10m, less than half what Lang reckons he had spent.
On Wednesday, the United States Golf Association hosted its annual pre-event media conference. “The golf course is a championship venue that will make history,” said the USGA president, Diana Murphy. “And we also want to say thank you to its owner Andy Ziegler and congratulations.” Ziegler stood up, waved and took recognition from the floor.
During correspondence with Sports Illustrated writers, Trattner expresses regret over Lang’s financial blow. “At times I definitely wish I never would’ve pursued and started Erin Hills,” he said. “I can’t help but feel guilty and awful for how it devastated Bob and his family.”
It is the US Open storyline that will not feature in any guidebooks. That does not prevent it from being both fascinating and horribly sad; any golfer falling agonisingly short at this major is not the key component in a tragedy.
Mike Tyson has an interesting new book out called Iron Ambition. In it he talks about his violent childhood, explores his relationship with his late coach, the great Cus D’Amato, and kicks the whole thing off with a passage about wandering around his old Brooklyn neighbourhood, marvelling at the gentrification, tourists and, above all, the sight of people taking selfies all over the place.
Like many other grouchy middle-aged men Mike hasn’t, you sense, fully engaged with the selfie craze. “Imagine trying to do that with the people I was hanging out with in Times Square,” he writes. “‘Hey man, let’s take a selfie!’ Motherfuckers would start beating on you and leave you in a coma in the street.” We can never go back, of course. But in many ways, happier, wiser times.
This is not, yet, the most famous Tyson quote. That comes instead from his time rampaging around the heavyweight division when he was asked by a room of journalists about an opponent’s plans to dance inside, hit and run and generally pick him off. “Everyone has a plan,” came the reply. “Until they get punched in the mouth.”
It is a cool quote, albeit perhaps a little misunderstood, with an assumption among those who perhaps didn’t see Tyson in his prime that saying this marks him out as a force of untutored aggression, all front-foot brutality. Read the book and you realise the phrase has strong echoes of D’Amato, a brilliant strategist who talked first of all about not getting hit, and whose triumph was to turn Tyson into a counterpunching technician, saving his most ferocious attacks for when he’d just slipped your best shot.
What Mike and Cus were saying was: you may have a plan but ours is better. Just as all trainers and indeed football managers work relentlessly on defence, the flaws in their opponents’ attack and disrupting first of all what’s coming back at them.
Can you feel it yet? Can you feel José Mourinho’s hard, flat, insolent gaze glaring out between these words? This week another fascinating set of quotes has been doing the rounds, this time from Mourinho, extracted from remarks he made at a Lisbon university about his preparations for the Europa League final against Ajax. These were picked up by the newspaper Tribuna Expresso and translated by the football analyst Tiago Estêvão. Again the talk was about strategy and, above all, about getting your retaliation in first.
The first striking thing is the level of detail in Mourinho’s prep for Ajax, the way he really does visualise the game in advance, reaching his horrible hands through his opponent’s rib cage and gouging his nails into the vital organs.
The second striking thing was the response on social media to this insight, reflecting a certain acerbic reaction to Mourinho’s first season at Manchester United, the tendency to hold a perfumed handkerchief to the nose, to splutter about “anti-football”, to suggest that setting out a team defensively is in some way cynical or disrespectful. And beyond this, the idea a club like United should instead be imposing its own freewheeling, tousle-haired will, leaving the washing-up, romping about like cosseted puppies and all the rest.
This still feels a bit baffling to the neutral. Looking at Mourinho’s notes it is hard to see anything but complete respect for his opponent and indeed for his sport. He’s not mucking about here. Mourinho watched eight Ajax matches before Stockholm. He had a clear plan, a set of counter measures that worked so well that with 10 minutes gone he was already telling Rui Faria “we have them in our pockets”.
The first stage of this was to “create instability” by hustling Matthijs de Ligt, Ajax’s usual conduit from the back, forcing Davinson Sánchez to take the ball forward instead. Sánchez is hugely talented and shut Marcus Rashford down on the night but he’s not as good on the ball as his partner. So in one move a strength became a weakness.
Carrying the ball forward, Sánchez looked up and found stage two: United matched Ajax’s midfield man for man, leaving no real option but to pass long. Which he did. By the end Sánchez had made 35 more passes than De Ligt, including nine long balls, and every part of the Ajax machine had been very slightly jiggered out of place. Everybody has a plan – until they get hustled into a series of unplanned movements by a master of the pre-emptive smothering tweak.
Mourinho also had his defence under strict orders. Chris Smalling, who can – let’s face it – at times look like he’s playing in a pair of oversized square-toed cow-poke boots, was told to pass long every time, to make no attempt to link with his midfield, thereby negating Ajax’s powerful high press.
They followed the drill. United’s back four played 25 long balls. Smalling and Daley Blind didn’t pass once to Paul Pogba. A team of stars man-marked a 17-year-old novice defender. And United won a European final at a guarded canter by the horribly subversive pragmatism of not giving the ball to their £90m record signing. “For me beautiful is not giving our opponents what they want,” Mourinho sneered in Lisbon. I wasn’t there but, let’s face it, he sneered it, maybe even cackled it. And he’s right. This is in its own way deeply beautiful.
So why the snorts of unhappiness? Clearly defensive football isn’t everyone’s idea of fun. It doesn’t look good on the telly. Pogba’s willingness to fit the plan is admirable but his own extreme talents may get more of an airing elsewhere. Similarly Mourinho’s love of the system, his ability to wrench out an opponent’s circuit boards, have seen his greatest triumphs arrive at clubs just below the top tier, turning a B-list European power into a snarling, spitting, brilliantly obstructive champion.
Beyond this it is hard to avoid the idea that people make the mistake of conflating Mourinho’s tactics with his toxic and infuriating public persona: the sneakiness, the tedious jibes, the sight of him stalking the touchline haggardly in baggy grey shell suit trousers with the look of a man dragged from his static caravan in the wee hours and forced to walk four miles down the hard shoulder in search of a canister of butane gas, only to find he’s forgotten his wallet, lost one of his flip-flops in a gorse bush and is being taunted by a busload of primary school children.
For all that, the notion this is somehow beneath Manchester United seems a bit odd. The later Sir Alex Ferguson teams were hardly buccaneering free spirits swinging from the hip. Chewing through a third manager in three years, United have now won two Cups. This feels like progress, an ice pick lodged in the cliff face.
Mourinho may be a counterpuncher. He may be Floyd Mayweather rather than Roberto Durán. But even in a nation where an academic, systems-based approach has so often been jeeringly dismissed, the obsession with team, with winning by first of all preventing defeat, has its own kind of refined mathematics, even its own kind of poetry.
Aidy Boothroyd admitted his England Under-21 side were rescued from a disastrous defeat in their opening match of the European Championship by “super” goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as the new £30m Everton signing’s penalty save nine minutes from time secured a point against the holders, Sweden.
Ben Chilwell’s reckless challenge on Linus Wahlqvist looked like condemning England to a defeat that would have left their hopes of reaching the semi-finals hanging by a thread, only for Pickford to deny the same player from the spot with an excellent right-hand save.
It ensured England will go into their second match against Slovakia on Monday knowing there is all still to play for, although Boothroyd acknowledged they will need to improve drastically if they are to end a desperate record of failing to get out of their group at the last three tournaments.
“It was a fair result in the end and we can certainly play better than we did,” he said. “Sweden gave us problems which we dealt with. It was disappointing to concede a penalty – I’m not sure it was – but it was given, so it was. Of course we have our super goalkeeper that keeps penalties out.”
Pickford, who became the third most expensive goalkeeper in history on Thursday, had little to do in the first half as England made a decent start but Sweden gradually imposed themselves on the match and could have gone ahead when Pawel Cibicki’s curling effort from just outside the box cannoned back off the crossbar.
Chilwell also struck the woodwork from long range via a heavily deflected effort soon afterwards but could have little complaint about the penalty award after diving in when there appeared to be little danger.
Wahlqvist’s penalty was poorly struck but Pickford, after his initial stop, was on hand again to save the substitute Carlos Strandberg’s weak follow-up and enable England to hang on to the draw.
“I waited longer and held my ground and got to the penalty; that’s what you do,” the goalkeeper said.
“Sweden killed our tempo a bit, they had a game plan to let us have the ball at the back and now we move on to Monday. The main thing is not to lose the game. The first game is always tight and we came away with a draw. It’s down to us to win the next two.”
That will be no easy task despite Slovakia’s and Poland’s poor records at this tournament, with only the Group A winners guaranteed a place in the last four in the newly expanded format of 12 teams. Watched by the senior team manager, Gareth Southgate, and the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, England came into the game with the unwanted record of having conceded more goals at these finals than any other nation.
More than 5,000 Sweden supporters made the atmosphere in Kielce feel more like Stockholm than southern Poland, although at first it seemed as if this was England’s game to win. Tammy Abraham was unlucky to see his acrobatic effort just before half-time miss the target after an excellent flick-on from Alfie Mawson following a throw-in.
Boothroyd’s side also made a strong start after the break but were hampered by a disappointing end product from both flanks, with the Everton right-back Mason Holgate culpable at times. Lewis Baker struggled to make an impact from his No10 role as Nathaniel Chalobah and the captain, James Ward-Prowse, were frequently overrun in midfield and it seemed almost inevitable Sweden would secure victory as they poured forward as the clock ticked down.
Strandberg was particularly dangerous on the break and only a last-ditch challenge from Holgate prevented him from having a one-on-one with Pickford just before the penalty was conceded.
Boothroyd was philosophical about his side’s chances of progressing but, having seen Pickford complete his move to Goodison Park while away on international duty, admitted his admiration for the way the 23-year-old has handled the pressure.
“He has had quite a week,” he said. “Most people would struggle to deal with what’s happened and have some sort of dip but, touch wood, he doesn’t. I thought he was excellent.
“We want to qualify for the semi-finals and in order to do that we have to win games but it’s also really important we didn’t lose,” added Boothroyd.
“We’ll look back at it and say it’s a defining moment, I hope. It is important when we don’t play well we dig in and make sure we don’t get beaten.
“I’m not satisfied because I want to win every game but, when you get to this level, you have to be realistic that you can’t win every single game. What’s important is you keep focused and don’t get beaten and make sure you qualify.”
The card game bridge is hardly the most physically strenuous of activities. But according to a judgment by one of the European court of justice’s most senior lawyers, the game should be considered a sport – for tax purposes at least.
The recommendation is the latest salvo in a longrunning legal case brought by the English Bridge Union (EBU), which argues that entry fees for its tournaments should be exempt from VAT, as is the case with all activities classed as sport.
The EBU lost its initial claim against HM Revenue and Customs, which says sports should have a significant element of physical activity. But the EBU appealed to the upper tax tribunal, which referred the case to European judges.
The player-funded organisation maintains that preferential tax treatment for sport was intended to benefit activities that provide either physical or mental health benefits to regular participants. It argues that bridge – a game played by four players in two competing partnerships – helps stimulate the mind, particularly in older people.
On Thursday the advocate general Maciej Szpunar argued that sport should be understood as something that involved the “training of mental or physical fitness in a way that is generally beneficial to the health and wellbeing of citizens”, and recommended that bridge be exempted from VAT in the UK.
He also noted that the International Olympic Committee was among organisations that “expressly include mental sports or endorse activities without a physical element”, having classified bridge as a sport in 1998.
The case will be reviewed by ECJ judgesin the autumn. If they uphold Szpunar’s recommendation, the EBU will no longer have to pay VAT and may be eligible for a rebate. While the recommendation is not binding, judges usually follow the advice of advocate generals.
“This will have huge benefits as it will allow us to invest further in the game, and make entries to EBU competitions cheaper, thus allowing more people to enjoy playing bridge, and enabling more to experience the social and mental benefits that playing bridge offers,” the EBU said in a statement.
Jeremy Dhondy, the EBU’s chairman, said the finding was “a vindication of our view that bridge should be regarded as a sport with all the advantages that brings both for bridge as a game and also for our members and prospective members”.
“We want our game to play its full part as an activity to promote social inclusion and welcome the judgment of the European court,” he added.
Different countries have different opinions on whether bridge is a sport. In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France and it is classed as a sport for tax purposes, but in Ireland and Sweden it is not.
The 2011 Charities Act adopted a definition of sport as “activities which promote health involving physical or mental health or exertion”, which specifically included “mind sports”.
However, in 2015 the high court ruled that bridge was not a sport eligible for lottery funding, with lawyers acting for Sport England telling the court that the game was no more a sport than “sitting at home reading a book”.
On Wednesday it was announced the finest boxer of his generation, unbeaten in 49 paying fights and 26 world championship contests with titles in five weight classes, will fight a scheduled 12-round boxing match against an opponent with no professional boxing experience. It doesn’t take an expert to know how this one will play out.
But we groundlings love a sideshow and always have, making us susceptible to promotional stunts like these for as as long as anyone can remember. There was Muhammad Ali’s risible fight with the Japanese pro wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976, widely regarded as the most embarrassing moment of the Greatest’s career. There were Jesse Owens’ lamentable match races against thoroughbred horses, a humiliating comedown for the Olympic hero who had stared down Hitler in Berlin. There was the much-ballyhooed 150m race between Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson at Toronto’s SkyDome to determine the title of world’s fastest man, a made-for-TV event that went down 20 years ago this month.
Occasionally, one-offs have positive consequences, like the Battle of the Sexes between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973, which altered the perception of women’s sports in many doubters’ eyes. But far more often they leave their participants debased unless they’re forgotten altogether: George Foreman, still nursing the psychological wounds of Zaire, taking on five hopelessly shopworn opponents in one night in 1975. Or the cringeworthy one-on-one match at the Trump Taj Mahal between NBA greats Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Julius Erving, retired quadragenarians both, that aired on pay-per-view for $19.95 a pop.
Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor are hardly the first to prey on PT Barnum’s target market, but they’re certain to scale the tried-and-true formula to dizzying profits that would have left the old carnival barker doubled over in laughter. Showtime boxing czar Stephen Espinoza’s straight-faced assessment on Wednesday night offered an understated taste of the bluster to come: “We’ve never seen a combat sports event, or even a sporting event, of this magnitude.”
Over the next 10 weeks, the combined promotional heft of Mayweather Promotions and the Ultimate Fighting Championship will attempt to seduce you into believing the outcome is anything but the foregone conclusion it is. Hell, some of our most visible thought leaders are already biting. You’ll hear plenty about Floyd’s age. You’ll hear about his struggles with left-handed opponents and the strides McGregor has made with his boxing. Later there will be race-baiting on both sides, the same cynical tactics that lifted Jack Johnson v James J Jeffries and Larry Holmes v Gerry Cooney and Mike Tyson v Peter McNeeley to record-breaking profits.
That’s the thing with one-offs: everyone involved knows they only need to fool the customer once. It’s not bad for boxing. It’s not bad for MMA. It’s not anything except a quick-strike money grab with no enduring significance. It’s an exciting fight until it actually starts and it will be forgotten the minute it’s over, unworthy of a chapter in either man’s memoirs.
No amount of salesmanship, misdirection or promotional razzle-dazzle can alter the obvious: McGregor’s chances under the unified rules of boxing that will govern the 26 August meeting are so infinitesimal they’re hardly worth discussing. It’s simply unfathomable that a man with zero fights will defeat any elite boxer, let alone one of the greatest defensive technicians to ever take up the gloves. Just as Mayweather would stand no chance in a mixed martial arts match. Shame on the thirsty Nevada Athletic Commission for sanctioning this circus.
Hardened skeptics pooh-poohed Mayweather’s summit meeting with Manny Pacquiao for happening far past its sell-by date and were partially vindicated by a one-sided fight that left customers feeling let down and ripped off. That outrage almost feels quaint now. At least Floyd and Manny, in the anxious moments before the opening bell, were staring across the ring at the most decorated opponent either had ever been in with.
McGregor? There are 20-year-olds in boxing gyms right now that would light him up like a Christmas tree. That’s at least what’s suggested by the infamous footage of the Irishman’s sparring session last year with Chris van Heerden, a former welterweight belt-holder from South Africa. Sure, there’s reason to believe his clumsy, plodding approach could improve with a training camp devoted completely to boxing. But there’s simply no way he can catch up to the fistic aptitude of Mayweather, who’s been drilled in the mysteries of the sport since childhood. There’s no such thing as a crash course for a lifelong craft.
Remind yourself what Mayweather did to some of the greatest boxers of his era. We’re not even talking about the destruction of Diego Corrales, a fight where Mayweather entered an arguable underdog, before he surrendered his power by climbing in weight to chase the bigger money. Even late-period Floyd’s brittle hands didn’t keep him from making the likes of Juan Manuel Marquez and Canelo Alvarez appear as if they were stumbling around in the dark trying to find the light switch. If that lot couldn’t even find let alone hurt Mayweather, what hope does our Conor have?
Making this fight required the improbable reconciliation of warring interests. But Mayweather-McGregor was inevitable because whenever there’s enough money on the table, people find a way to make things happen. You can’t blame the fighters for taking the payday. The only reason it’s happening is because they don’t merely think you’re gullible enough to buy it. They’re certain of it.
On Saturday night, Andre Ward and Sergey Kovalev will meet in a rematch of their terrific unified light heavyweight title fight in November. It is, at least by one metric, the best fight that can be made today: Ward and Kovalev are rated the two best prizefighters in the world, pound for pound, by Ring magazine. As a genuine sports experience, it will be a hundred times better than Mayweather-McGregor and, especially after Wednesday’s announcement, is doomed to receive one-hundredth of the attention.
We’re poorer for that, but we get what we deserve.
Mino Raiola, the cheeky so and so, is insisting on inserting a £44m (€50m) clause into Gianluigi Donnarumma’s new contract. The 18-year-old was set to sign a £77,000-a-week deal at Milan but the infamous agent is not playing nice. The Mill isn’t one for telling Milan’s suits to do their job, but £44m sounds cheap for the next big thing, especially if Jordan Pickford costs £30m. The Sunderland goalkeeper is coughing for the Everton doctor, who has flown out to the England Under-21s camp in Poland.
On the red side of Merseyside, Liverpool have finally found some coin and are throwing it at Piotr Zielinski. Twenty-five million quid, to be exact, although that is well short of the Napoli midfielder’s £61m release clause. Tottenham are also said to be interested in the Polish international, just in case Barcelona swoop for Christian Eriksen.
Leicester City are set to offer Harry Maguire £80,000 a week in the hope it can convince him to leave Hull City, for a five-year contract worth more than £20m. That’s after paying a £17m transfer fee, too. Leicester were keen on West Brom’s Jonny Evans, and floated a £10m offer, but were apparently told to get lost.
We’re all set for another thrilling season in Scotland after Celtic had a £1.3m bid accepted for the only non-Celtic player to feature on the shortlist for PFA Scotland Player of the Year, Jonny Hayes. The Ireland international – who, fun fact, has 18 stitches in his arm after being bitten by a dog – helped Aberdeen to second place last season, scoring 11 times. Who knows, he might get a winner’s medal next year.
Emmanuel Adebayor is back, baby. That’s according to the Mirror, who report that Swansea are keen on doing some kind of swap deal for Bafétimbi Gomis. Why Swansea wouldn’t want to keep the Frenchman, who scored 21 goals in 33 games for Marseille last season on loan, is another story, but Adebayor is apparently keen for one more round of the Premier League. The Togo striker is with Istanbul Basaksehir and helped the Turkish club finish second to claim a Champions League spot. Tidy.
Remarkably, we’re staying with Basaksehir, who have another jewel in their ranks by the name of Cengiz Under. The 19-year-old signed from Altinordu for £600,000 only last summer but has since gone on to make his debut for Turkey, scoring twice in three appearances, including on Sunday against Kosovo. Manchester United and Tottenham are keen but Lille appear to be in the driving seat for a player now thought to be worth £13m. “Several clubs have been scouting Cengiz,” said Basaksehir’s vice-president, Mustafa Saral. “Lille have held direct talks with us, we have held talks with a few teams that have been mentioned. Our response has been the same, it is an honour to receive so much interest but we feel it is in his best interests to spend one more season here and then leave.”
Football and theatre can both range from farce to bloodbath. But the tepid response to Patrick Marber’s The Red Lion, set in a lower-league changing room, exposed the problem that plays on the subject tend to include too much football for people who like theatre and too much theatre for people who like football. More successful works have used fans as metaphors for tensions in society: Peter Terson’s Zigger Zagger and Sing Yer Heart Out for the Lads by Roy Williams.
So, it is sensible that two new football-related productions – consisting, with thematic neatness, of a one-act play lasting 45 minutes and a two-act show that blows the whistle after 90 – focus on what the sport means and does to places and people.
Helping fans fill the difficult summer weeks when there are no fixtures, Northampton Town’s Sixfields stadium is hosting The Twelfth Player, an immersive theatre piece based on a tour of the ground. And while the stands of Birmingham City and Aston Villa are empty, supporters can head to the Birmingham Repertory theatre for Stadium, a community play about the teams’ rivalry. (It is unclear whether the box office will agree not to seat fans of one team next to those of the other lot.)
Leaving in groups of four at five-minute intervals, audiences at Sixfields hold an iPod that directs them for three quarters of an hour around a circuit of the stands, changing rooms and pitch. Intricate video and sound designs create the illusion of ghosts in these locations. A ballerina twirls in front of the hot-dog counter. Decorously framed players soap their buttocks in the showers. So smart is the technology that the fictional characters seem to appear in old photographs on the stadium walls. Clarence, the club’s dragon mascot, makes digital and physical appearances.
Allusions to the history (promotions, demotions, near insolvency) of the club known as the Cobblers are interspersed with a drama, acted by local volunteers, featuring marital and other pressures in a family including a football-mad dad and a daughter who prefers ballet until a surprising aspect of her maternal family history is revealed. Created by directors Susanne Thomas and Sophie Jump for Seven Sisters Group, the piece tackles, firmly but fairly, the game’s history of sexism.
In Birmingham, Mohamed El Khatib’s Stadium is kicked off by the actor Dmitri Hatton who announces that the show will explore a city “divided in two” by football. This causes immediate unrest on the terraces – made worse when a third participant in hostilities, West Bromwich Albion, turns up in the second half.
Hatton acts as compere of a sort of a variety show in which all the acts are on the same theme. Gill and Paul tell a fantastic anecdote about a Villa fan at the back of a crowd accidentally losing his false teeth when chanting; the dentures are discovered underfoot, passed back up the stand and unnervingly reinserted. A blind West Bromwich Albion supporter describes the last goal he saw, 50 years ago, before losing his sight. There is a choreographed wheelchair football game between young supporters of the Villains and the Blues.
The show properly reflects the tendency of football to be a proxy for other concerns. On screens above the stage, Villa-supporting film-maker Tony Garnett and Professor Carl Chinn, historian of the city of Birmingham, have a spat about which of the local clubs is most proletarian. Another Brummie historian, Keith Dixon, joins in from the crowd.
El Khatib also honours the fact that – because most football fans were first taken to their matches by parents – games become entwined with memories of love and death. To the sound of Vivaldi’s Nisi Dominus, a West Brom fan swirls the massive banner that his mother stitched for him before she died 20 years ago; she didn’t like football, but she loved him.
Having spent many seasons in seat C67 in the west stand at Sixfields, my neutrality as a referee may be questioned by supporters from further up the M1, so let’s call it a high-scoring draw. The Twelfth Player is slick, witty, family-friendly and, since the team had a tendency last season only to play for 45 minutes, exactly the right length. Stadium is inclusive, intelligent, moving and contains a tremendous bagpipes joke. If fans of any club are as well entertained next season, they will be lucky.
Fiji-born winger Eto Nabuli, the one-time porter identified by rugby league legends Andrew Johns and Brad Fittler, will make his Wallabies debut on Saturday after being named in Michael Cheika’s starting XV to face Scotland at Sydney’s Allianz Stadium.
Fellow rugby league convert Karmichael Hunt has retained his place at inside centre after a promising debut in last Saturday’s win over Fiji, but regular captain and hooker Stephen Moore has again been overlooked. Nabuli’s inclusion, at the expense of two-try star and fellow Fijian flyer Henry Speight, is the only change to the run-on side.
Cheika is treating the fifth-ranked Scots with full respect, retaining 14 of the 15 starters who combined to notch five tries in the opening Test of the year. Tatafu Polota-Nau retains the No2 jumper, with Moore again expected to be picked on the bench when Cheika reveals his reserves on Friday.
Nabuli bagged seven tries in 13 games while playing for St George Illawarra in the NRL in 2013, after a chance meeting with Johns and Fittler in 2012 led to his code switch last year. He has played 16 games for the Queensland Reds, with Cheika first picking the 28-year-old in a Wallabies training squad last season before the England series without using him in a Test.
Star Scottish lock Jonny Gray returns in one of eight changes to the visitors’ starting side for the match in Sydney. The Scots will field an entirely new front row and back three to those that started in last weekend’s 34-13 victory over Italy in Singapore.
Gray’s inclusion is the most significant change in a strengthened team. Anticipating a high-tempo game with lots of ball movement from the Wallabies, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said the 23-year-old’s defence would be critical at Allianz Stadium.
A controversial omission from the British and Irish Lions’ tour of New Zealand, Gray is famous for attempting 85 tackles in one Six Nations campaign – and missing just one. Townsend admits he deliberately kept Gray fresh for the Wallabies, who ran in five tries in their season-opening 34-12 win over Fiji last Saturday in Melbourne.
“We’ve managed him for a reason to make sure he’s ready to go for this game,” Townsend said on Thursday. “He’s been a key player for Scotland the last two or three seasons. He’s in great form. He can’t wait to play.”
Townsend said he always planned to field a vastly different line-up against the Wallabies. “We were always keen on this tour [to ensure] that players who were close to selection got an opportunity,” he said. “A few of them got an opportunity last week and some do this week.
“When you put a squad together, firstly you’re putting together a team that you believe can win the game. On a tour, there’s other considerations. You want to see which players are up for Test level and we want to give them the opportunity. It’s obviously after them after that.”

The long-touted fight between UFC star Conor McGregor and the former five-division boxing champion Floyd Mayweather is set for 26 August at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The two fighters confirmed the news with posts to social media. On Instagram, Mayweather said: “It’s official!”. McGregor was similarly to the point: “THE FIGHT IS ON,” he wrote on Twitter. As a barb, the 28-year-old Irishman added a picture of Mayweather’s father, Floyd Sr, a presumed joke at the expense of his 40-year-old rival’s age.
The bout will be scheduled for 12 rounds at the junior middleweight limit of 154lbs with 10-ounce gloves, Mayweather’s longtime confidant, Leonard Ellerbe, confirmed in a conference call on Wednesday night. The Mayweather Promotions CEO added that the financial details including the purse split will not be disclosed and are protected under a confidentiality agreement.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Nevada Athletic Commission approved a request from Mayweather Promotions to host a fight in Las Vegas on 26 August.
Terms for the event have not been confirmed but the August date had been talked about as a fight between Mayweather and McGregor for some time. When the two meet it will be a boxing rather than mixed martial arts match-up. McGregor has already applied for a boxing license in Nevada, although he has never boxed professionally. Mayweather retired undefeated in 49 professional fights, and is widely recognized as one of the greatest boxers of all time. Mayweather is a huge favourite: early Las Vegas odds had him at 1-10 to win the fight with McGregor 7-1.
Bob Bennett, the executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, confirmed to ESPN on Wednesday that Mayweather Promotions had pulled out of a request for the fight before reapplying. “I got a call [on Tuesday night] from Mayweather Promotions that they wanted to be put back on the agenda, so I put them back on the agenda,” Bennett told the broadcaster. “They pulled the request but then decided to put it back on.”
Both men stand to make tens of millions of dollars from the bout, which will be more about making money than treating the public to a display of athletic skill. It would also prove a lucrative platform for Mayweather’s stable of fighters. The former champion has said he would like two of the fighters he promotes, Badou Jack and the talented junior lightweight world champion Gervonta Davis, to appear on the undercard. Mayweather made around $250m from his fight against Manny Pacquiao in 2015, and would expect to draw a similar sum for the McGregor fight. The Irishman is likely to make less but any earnings would outstrip anything he has made during his UFC career.

There has been no shortage of critics of the fight between UFC’s biggest star and a 40-year-old who hasn’t fought since September 2015. Last month Mayweather’s former rival in the ring, Oscar De La Hoya, said the fight would harm boxing.
“With each passing day, it looks more and more likely that the circus known as Floyd Mayweather v Conor McGregor will be coming to town in the near future,” said De La Hoya. “As undercard fights start to take form, athletic commissions give their blessings in exchange for millions of dollars, and the fighters start counting even more cash, one group will eventually be left to make sure this farce doesn’t occur – we, the fans, who are the lifeblood of our sport ... Our sport might not ever recover.”
There are a lot of sports writers and fans who are adamant that it’s impossible to compare sporting teams across seasons and eras. Taken literally, that’s a truism, because every sport evolves, and what worked for a great team in, say the 1980s, might not work – or even be within the rules of the game – today.
Still, if asked to identify some of the best AFL teams of recent years, most would almost certainly include the 2000 Essendon, 2011 Geelong, and 2012 Hawthorn teams. We all have, if nothing else, some intuitive sense of relative team abilities across time.
As imperfect as it is, one way of quantifying a team’s relative ability is to apply mathematics to the results it achieves, adjusting for the quality of the teams they faced. Adjustment for opponent quality is important because, were we to use just raw results, a 90-point thrashing of a struggling team would be treated no differently in our assessment of a team’s ability than a similar result against a more talented opponent.
This notion of continuously rating individuals or teams using results adjusted for opposition quality has a long history. One version of the method can be traced back to Arpad Elo, who came up with it as a way of rating chess players as they defeated, drew or lost to other players of sometimes widely differing abilities. It’s still used for that purpose today.
In sports like football, Elo-style rating systems can be expanded to provide not just a single rating for a team, but a separate rating for its offensive and defensive abilities; the former is based on the team’s record of scoring points relative to the quality of the defences it has faced, and the latter on its record of preventing points being scored relative to the quality of the offences it has faced.
If we do this for the AFL we can quantify the offensive and defensive abilities of teams within and across seasons using a common currency: points.
There are many ways to do this, and a number of websites offer their own versions, but the methodology we’ll use here has the following key characteristics:
Applying this methodology generates the data in the chart below, which records the offensive and defensive ratings of every team from seasons 2000 to 2016 as at the end of their respective home-and-away seasons. Teams that ultimately won the flag are signified by dots coloured red, and those that finished runner-up as dots coloured orange. The grey dots are the other teams from each season – those that missed the grand final.
We see that teams lie mostly in the bottom-left and top-right quadrants, which tells us that teams from the modern era that have been above-average offensively have also tended to be above-average defensively, and conversely that below-average offensive teams have tended to be below-average defensively as well.
The level of association between teams’ offensive and defensive ratings can be measured using something called a correlation coefficient, which takes on values between -1 and +1. Negative values imply a negative association – say if strong offensive teams tended to be weak defensively and vice versa – while positive values imply a positive association, such as we see in the chart.
From the correlation coefficients for team ratings in the current and previous eras we see the degree of association between team offensive and defensive ratings has been at historically high levels in the modern era. In fact, it’s not been as high as this since the earliest days of the VFL.
In other words, teams’ offensive and defensive ratings have tended to be more similar than they have been different in the modern era.
By way of comparison, here’s the picture for the 1980 to 1999 era in which the weaker relationship between teams’ offensive and defensive ratings is apparent.
Note that the increase in correlation between teams’ offensive and defensive abilities in the modern era has not come with much of a reduction in the spread of team abilities. If we ignore the teams that are in the lowest and highest 5% on offensive and defensive abilities, the range of offensive ratings in the modern era span about 31 points and defensive ratings span about 34 points. For the 1980-1999 era the equivalent ranges are both about two points larger.
One plausible hypothesis for the cause of the closer association between the offensive and defensive abilities of modern teams would be that coaching and training methods have improved and served to reduce the level of independent variability in the two skill sets.
The charts for both eras have one thing in common, however: the congregation of grand finalists – the orange and red dots – in the north-eastern corner. This is as we might expect because this is the quadrant for teams that are above-average both offensively and defensively.
Only a handful of grand finalists in either era have finished their home-and-away season with below-average offensive or defensive ratings. In the modern era, just two teams have gone into the finals with below-average defensive ratings – Melbourne in 2000 and Port Adelaide in 2007, both of which finished as runners-up in their respective seasons.
Melbourne finished its home-and-away season conceding 100 points or more in four of its last eight games, and conceding 98 and 99 points in two others. Those results took a collective toll on its defensive rating.
Port Adelaide ended their 2007 home-and-away season more positively but probably not as well as a team second on the ladder might have been expected to – an assessment that seems all the more reasonable given the grand final result just a few weeks later. In that 2007 grand final, Geelong defeated them by 119 points.
The chart for the modern era also highlights a few highly-rated teams that could consider themselves unlucky to have not made the grand final in their years – the 2016 Adelaide and St Kilda teams in particular, though that Saints’ rating was somewhat elevated by its 139-point thrashing of the Lions in the final home-and-away game of that season.
Based on the relatively small sample of successful teams shown in this chart, it’s difficult to come to any firm conclusions about the relative importance of offensive versus defensive ability for making grand finals and winning flags, and impossible to say anything at all about their relative importance in getting a team to the finals in the first place.
To look at that issue we use the ratings in a slightly different way. Specifically, we use them to calculate the winning rates of teams classified on the basis of their offensive and defensive superiority or inferiority at the time of their clash.
Those calculations are summarised in the table below, which also groups games into eras to iron out season-to-season fluctuations and make underlying differences more apparent.
The percentages that are most interesting are those in the column furthest on the left in each block. They tell how successful teams that have found themselves stronger defensively but weaker offensively than their opponents have been.
What we find is that, in every era since the second world war:
We should note though that none of the percentages are statistically significantly different from 50%, so we can’t definitively claim that, in any particular era, defensive superiority has been preferable to offensive superiority in the home-and-away season or that the opposite has been true in finals. That’s the clear tendency, but the evidence is statistically weak, so the differences we see might be no more than random noise.
In any case, the effect sizes we see are quite small – around 1% to 2% points – so practically it makes more sense to conclude that offensive and defensive abilities have been historically of roughly equal importance to a team’s success in home-and-away games and in finals.
So, where do the current crop of teams sit? The chart below maps each of the 18 current teams’ ratings as at the end of round 12 and the ratings of all 34 grand finalists from the period 2000-2016 as at the end of round 12 in their respective years.
Adelaide stand alone offensively, with a rating almost as good as the 2000 Essendon team who were 12-0 after round 12 having averaged just over 136 points per game in a season where the all-team average score was 103 points per team per game across the entire home-and-away season. The Dons scored then at a rate just over 30% higher than an average team.
This year, Adelaide are averaging just under 119 points per game in a season where the all-team average is just under 91 points per game, which is also about 30% higher. They are, clearly, a formidable team offensively, though they’ve yet to impress consistently defensively.
The 2017 Port Adelaide and GWS teams come next, both located just outside the crop of highest-rated grand finalists, and having combined ratings a little below Adelaide’s. This week’s loss to Essendon had a (quite reasonably) significant effect on Port’s rating, as did GWS’s loss to Carlton.
Geelong, Collingwood, Sydney, Richmond and the Western Bulldogs are a little more south-east of that prime flag-winner territory, and would require a few above-expectation performances in upcoming weeks to enter that area. The Bulldogs in particular would need to show a little more offensive ability to push into the group, though they had a similar rating at the same point last season, so who’s to say they need to do anything much more.
Collingwood’s relatively high rating might raise a few eyebrows, but they have, it should be noted, generated more scoring shots in their losses to the Western Bulldogs in round one and Essendon in round five, and generated only four or fewer less scoring shots in their losses to Richmond in round two, St Kilda in round four, Carlton in round seven, GWS in round eight, and Melbourne in round 12. They’re currently ranked seventh on combined rating.
Essendon, Melbourne and St Kilda form the next sub-group – rated slightly above average on combined rating but below almost all previous grand finalists at the equivalent point in the season.
No other team has a combined rating that is positive or that exceeds that of any flag winner at this point in the season since 2000. As such, the remaining seven teams would make history were they to win the flag.
Still, there’s a lot that can happen between now and the end of the season, as we can see in this final chart, which shows 2017 team ratings and the ratings of all non-grand finalists from the seasons from 2000 to 2016.
There are plenty of sides in the chart that rated highly at the end of round 12 that never got as far as grand final day.
For example, the Geelong 2010 team was 10-2 after 12 rounds, one game clear at the head of the competition ladder with a 156 percentage. That team went 7-3 over the remainder of the home-and-away season to finish runners-up in the minor premiership before being eliminated by the minor premiers, Collingwood, 120-79 in a preliminary final.
And, in any case, in a year where results have constantly surprised and where two wins currently separates fith from 17th on the ladder, no team can reasonably feel assured of progressing into September, let alone to the MCG at the end of that month.
Even the best-laid plans can be instantly scuppered and the British & Irish Lions are suddenly on red alert over the fitness of Owen Farrell. A thigh strain sustained in training has ruled the fly-half out of the match-day squad to face the Maori All Blacks on Saturday and time is not on his side before the first Test against the All Blacks one week later.
Farrell is reported to have a grade one quadricep tear, which is at the lesser end of the scale but the last thing the Lions need is a kicker and playmaker with a bad leg. For all the attention given to Peter O’Mahony’s selection as captain against the Maori, the two names uppermost in Gatland’s mind are currently Farrell and the tour captain, Sam Warburton. If neither start the first Test for reasons of injury and form respectively, the Lions’ stock of on-field leaders will be conspicuously depleted.
As yet there is no official indication when Farrell may be fit again, with Dan Biggar coming on to Saturday’s bench, but even more pressure now rests on Jonathan Sexton, whose best chance of starting the Tests at No10 had previously rested on Farrell playing at 12. Barring a swift recovery for the Saracen, this weekend’s midfield combination of Sexton, Ben Te’o and Jonathan Davies are on standby to feature against New Zealand as well.
Gatland, one suspects, was planning on Farrell, Te’o and Davies forming a 10-12-13 partnership in Auckland and hoping a late rush of form from Warburton would secure him a place ahead of O’Mahony or Sean O’Brien. The two Irishmen and Taulupe Faletau were so impressive as a back-row combination, however, in last Saturday’s win over the Crusaders that Warburton may find the first Test arriving a few days too soon.
Gatland, by his own admission, is currently tempted to leave the trio intact. With O’Mahony also set to remain the on-field captain even when Warburton comes on, the ground is certainly well prepared for the Test skipper and the tour leader to be separate individuals. “He [Warburton] is well aware of the competition at the moment,” confirmed Gatland. “He fully understands that loose forward trio went outstandingly well against the Crusaders. But one of the reasons we selected him as captain of the squad is because this tour isn’t about Sam Warburton, it’s about putting the squad first. So if he’s not involved in the first Test because of the performance on Saturday night, he will fully understand that.”
Little room for misinterpretation there. Similarly, before Farrell’s fitness issues emerged, Gatland did not mince his words about Sexton: “I think Johnny needs some more rugby. I thought he was really good coming off the bench the other day but Johnny knows his last two games before that weren’t his best games of rugby. He was down a little bit on confidence but, at the moment, he’s got a bit of his mojo back.”
In almost the same breath, even so, the head coach left the door ajar for a second-half renewal of the 10-12 axis that went well in Christchurch after Davies departed early with a head knock. “That combination was pretty seamless,” agreed Gatland, emphasising the need to have different variations up his sleeve. “We’ve got to make sure we’re not fully showing our hand. We’ve got to keep some combinations back and keep the All Blacks guessing a little about what the final squad might be.” The way things are going that might not be necessary.
Gatland’s opposite number, Steve Hansen, will certainly expect to see most of this side trotting out at Eden Park. Anthony Watson, for now, appears to have jumped ahead of Liam Williams on the wing while the No15 jersey looks to be Leigh Halfpenny’s to lose. Te’o might not have been everyone’s Test inside-centre before the tour but has looked more comfortable there to date than Robbie Henshaw. Maro Itoje has also been invited to prove he can offer more than Alun Wyn Jones; Gatland will be inclined to revert to the Welshman alongside George Kruis as his starting Test lock combination but that could yet change should Itoje has a stormer.
Rhys Webb and Dan Cole, assuming full fitness, must also be contenders to replace Greig Laidlaw and Kyle Sinckler on the bench, although the latter is proving one of this squad’s most engaging, enthusiastic members. If Ken Owens and Jack McGrath are to leapfrog Jamie George and Mako Vunipola respectively, meanwhile, they are going to have to buck the evidence of this tour so far.
On a beautiful sunny day beside Lake Rotorua, Vunipola was also prominent on the list of suspects after the backs finished their session to discover some mischievous forwards had either tied together their training shoe laces or removed them completely. Smiles were soon wiped off faces, though, when the NZ Maori’s squad was unveiled a couple of hours later. With the quicksilver Chief Damian McKenzie at fly-half, Nehe Milner-Skudder and the equally elusive Rieko Ioane on the wings and the dangerous James Lowe at full-back, the Lions will be in for a breathless afternoon if they allow their opponents any time or space. McKenzie, even if closely policed, has the pace and skill to outwit the most aggressive rush defence with a clever chip or two. The Lions cannot hold too much back if they want to emerge victorious.
British & Irish Lions L Halfpenny; A Watson, J Davies, B Te’o, G North; J Sexton, C Murray; M Vunipola, J George, T Furlong, G Kruis, M Itoje, P O’Mahony, S O’Brien, T Faletau. Replacements K Owens, J McGrath, K Sinckler, I Henderson, S Warburton, G Laidlaw, D Biggar, E Daly.

Jordan Pickford has undergone a medical as part of a proposed £30m transfer to Everton.
The Sunderland goalkeeper, in Poland on England Under-21 duty, had wanted to postpone a decision until after the European Championship but Everton have moved swiftly to seal what would be a record transfer for a British keeper.
Having agreed to meet Sunderland’s asking price for the 23-year-old earlier this week, with add-ons taking the fee to £30m, Everton sent members of their medical team to Poland to complete the next stage of the transfer.
Pickford’s arrival will be part of a significant outlay by Everton this summer, with Ronald Koeman also close to adding fellow Dutchman Davy Klaassen to his midfield. Everton are understood to be at an advanced stage of negotiations with Ajax for their captain and are interested in the Burnley defender Michael Keane, Swansea City’s Gylfi Sigurdsson and Malaga striker Sandro Ramírez.
Everton’s director of football, Steve Walsh, has travelled to Italy to discuss potential arrivals from Serie A.
Gareth Southgate has given a bleak assessment of England’s status on the back of their demoralising defeat by France and made it clear “there is no magic wand” to help the national team back to a position where they can cope against elite opponents.
Southgate, reflecting on only three wins from eight games in charge, said every part of the team needed improvement and admitted the 3-2 defeat at the Stade de France, against a side who had to play with 10 men for virtually the entire second half was the first time since taking the job he had been angry with his players in the dressing room.
“There was no point raising my voice but equally you can’t sugarcoat what happened in that final 30 minutes,” Southgate said. “I don’t think that does any harm. I think they know anyway, they are a very honest group of players. It’s a big challenge. I played the last time we won in France, 20 years ago, and actually we got battered for a lot of that game and scored a goal on the counter.
“That’s the reality of where we are as a country. We have some young players coming through who have really good potential and can be exciting but there is no shortcut. I am afraid there is no magic wand but we are recognising where we are short, we are recognising where we can exploit teams. We’ve had some joy doing that but our game, in all areas, without the ball has to improve.”
Southgate’s wins have come against Malta, Scotland and Lithuania but the manager said he did not regret choosing difficult opponents for the friendly fixtures. His team have already been beaten by Germany, with a return game planned for Wembley in November, and drew with Spain during his spell as the caretaker manager.
Southgate was also frustrated by the 2-2 draw against Scotland at Hampden Park on Saturday but the defeat in Paris represents the biggest disappointment of the new era, not least because he noted some of the team’s old flaws once Raphaël Varane had been sent off. England, he said, had become anxious as soon as they had the extra man.
“I am bitterly disappointed to be 2-2, with them down to 10, and not at least take a draw,” Southgate said. “But I am not shocked. I saw France a lot last summer [during Euro 2016]. I know the power and athleticism they have and the speed. I also know where we are as a team and the hard work that lies ahead to try to bridge the gap between the three teams we’ve played.
“The only way we can understand the gap is by playing these teams. If we’d played lesser teams and won maybe we would all be getting excited and thinking we are better than we actually are. The reality is to find out exactly where we are against the very best. We’ve had two matches away and one at home and for long periods we’ve acquitted ourselves well. But we have a bit to do and I think it’s important, as a group of players and a group of staff, we recognise that.”
He added: “If we’d lost to lesser teams then that would be a bigger concern. I know we are improving and I know the players are receptive but I also know that’s not going to happen in the space of two or three months. I’ve got to keep that at the forefront of my mind. I want the players to feel disappointed because they have to recognise the moments when they have an opportunity to get a really good result.”
Southgate had used Tuesday’s friendly to experiment with a 3-4-3 system but a bad night for England does not necessarily mean him reverting to an orthodox back four. “I don’t think the goals we have conceded are anything to do with either system,” he said. “We were overloaded on a set play for the first goal. We got a tackle [wrong] and it was a weird chain of events for the second goal and the third was a gift.”
Claude Puel has been sacked by Southampton after one season in charge. The 55-year-old’s position had been the source of speculation and rumour for some time with a section of Saints supporters displeased with their team’s style of play and results under the Frenchman.
Thomas Tuchel, the former Borussia Dortmund manager, has been linked with taking over at St Mary’s. The former Alavés manager Mauricio Pellegrino and Reading’s Jaap Stam could also be contenders. Whoever does so will be the club’s fourth manager in a little over four years, following on from Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman.
A club statement said: “Everyone at Southampton would like to express our thanks to Claude for his hard work and commitment this year. The highlight of the season was a memorable day at Wembley in the EFL Cup final, a day our fans will always treasure.
“We wish Claude well for the future. The search for a new management team is underway. We are confident we will find the right fit in line with the long term vision of the club.”
Having arrived last June as the successor to Koeman following the Dutchman’s departure to Everton, Puel led Southampton to eighth in the Premier League and to the final of the EFL Cup, where they were somewhat unlucky to lose 3-2 to Manchester United.
Despite the positivity around Southampton’s Wembley appearance in February, they lost 16 league games to slip down the table after Koeman had delivered sixth place before moving to Goodison Park.
Saints also suffered early exits from the FA Cup and the Europa League. Come the final game of the season, a 1-0 home defeat to Stoke, fans appeared to have turned against Puel, chanting “You don’t know what you’re doing” and booing the manager.
Rumours of player unrest have continued into the summer and, on the day which saw the 2017-18 fixtures released, Puel has departed just 12 months into a two-year contract. Southampton start the season at home to Swansea on 12 August.
Those in positions of authority may be soft targets for vociferous abuse but nobody has matched the United States Golf Association’s fuelling of such fires.
The rules farce that overshadowed Dustin Johnson’s maiden major win, at last year’s US Open at Oakmont, would have been damaging enough for the USGA had it arrived in isolation. Twelve months earlier, the world’s best players had erupted in fury regarding the dreadful condition of greens at Chambers Bay.
Golf’s governing body in the US was embroiled in further chaos in April, a women’s major having descended into farce after a ruling based on contact from a television viewer; 24 hours earlier. And there is more; at the conclusion of the US Women’s Open of 2016 the USGA’s president, Diana Murphy, continued a propensity for erratic speech-making by continually calling the winner by the wrong name. Pieced together, this is like professional sport meets Eldorado.
In their traditional, eve of tournament address at the US Open, the USGA’s leading lights were not 100% convincing over whether a repeat of the Johnson scenario will be avoided. There has, at least, been an admission that things went badly wrong in Pennsylvania and a move to improve on archaic processes.
“Something like the last couple of years affects our whole organisation,” Mike Davis, the USGA’s executive director, said. “Any time your competency comes into question that affects the people who are dealing with the history of the game and helping to grow the game. Of course, we want to avoid these things but sometimes things happen.”
Specific issues at Erin Hills are partly within the USGA’s control and partly not. A huge property – some capital cities are smaller – will inevitably lead to tediously long rounds. The USGA slashed back areas of thick fescue rough early this week but deny that was a response to widespread complaints from players. “It is not as if we don’t listen to feedback from players,” Davis said. “But in this case it had absolutely zero to do with what the players were saying. We look at some spots and said, simply: ‘This is not going to play properly.’”
The great unknown comes in the form of weather, which is infamously changeable at this time of year in the Midwest. Early predictions suggest heavy rain will have an impact, most notably on the first round.
Almost a fortnight has passed since Phil Mickelson informed the USGA he likely would not participate in the one major thus far absent from his CV, with the left-hander keen to attend his daughter’s high school graduation on Thursday lunchtime in San Diego. Davis – with a straight face – claimed it was pure coincidence Mickelson was given a late time for the first round, thereby keeping alive the possibility of competing should a significant weather delay arise.
This situation is not particularly impressive, with the clear inference the pin-up boy of US golf is being assisted in a manner that would not be forthcoming towards others. Given the timescales involved, and in avoiding uncertainty for others, Mickelson should have been told either to commit to playing or not.
Johnson arrived in Wisconsin on Tuesday afternoon, his partner having given birth to the couple’s second child a day earlier. Glory at Oakmont was sufficient for Johnson to finally endorse underlying talent. He is now established as No1 in the world; a course where long, straight driving will be essential is surely of benefit.
Jason Day and Rory McIlroy retain precisely the same weapon, with the latter’s performance after an injury absence of particular intrigue. It is a curious truism that none of the world’s best players enter this major in particularly striking form. The expectancy is of a lower winning score than has been typical over the past 20 years, provided the course is set up in a sensible manner.
“We want to afford players a completely clear stage to perform and do their job,” Murphy said. “We want to stay out of the way and not be part of the story.” The very fact this point had to be made at all rather told one of its own.
Eoin Morgan was left lamenting a lack of home advantage and his side’s inability to adapt after a collective dose of paralysis with the bat on a reused Cardiff pitch led to England being bundled out of the Champions Trophy by a resurgent Pakistan.
As Sarfraz Ahmed led his players on a lap of honour in front of a strong and jubilant Pakistani support, England could only reflect on a dismal showing in the eight-wicket defeat in the semi-final, one that means their search for a first global 50-over crown rolls on to the 2019 World Cup on home soil.
Bowled out for 211 in 49.5 overs after losing the toss, any chuntering about the rough end of conditions should have dissipated when Pakistan cruised to their target with 77 balls to spare for the loss of two wickets. Azhar Ali’s 76 and 57 from his opening partner, Fakhar Zaman, broke the back of the run chase, with Mohammad Hafeez sealing their place in Sunday’s final at The Oval when he pulled Ben Stokes for four in dominant fashion.
Morgan pointed to his side failing to adapt to a slow, low pitch that was used 48 hours earlier when Pakistan won their final group game against Sri Lanka – something he felt brought their eighth-ranked opponents into contention.
“I don’t think there was any home advantage,” Morgan said. “We were not over-confident. Knowing we were going to play on a used wicket potentially brought Pakistan’s game closer to their home [conditions]. So it was a big challenge and one that was too far for us.
“We left ourselves short adapting to conditions. It’s a big frustration because I think we’ve played some great cricket in this tournament and we weren’t anywhere close to it today. Fair credit to Pakistan, they played brilliantly.”
Asked why Pakistan’s batsmen thrived where his did not, Morgan replied: “I think the explanation is they played two days ago on it.”
England collapse was not a quickfire horror show of old but rather a slow suffocation that from 128 for two in the 28th over saw them lose eight for 83. Having struck 95 boundaries in their three group stage wins, they passed the rope only 15 times against Pakistan with the impotence summed up by a 64-ball 34 from Stokes made up of ones and twos.
Pakistan’s bowlers must be given their dues, having reacted to Mohammad Amir’s late withdrawal because of back spasms with a performance of nous and skill. Hasan Ali’s three for 35 from 10 overs shone brightest, earning him the man of the match award and taking him to 10 wickets for the tournament and the top of the bowling charts. Each one has been met with the slippery seamer’s now trademark chest-thumping celebration.
“I think the pitch was very good,” said Sarfraz, whose side have defied all expectations since their opening defeat against India. “It was good for both teams. We played very good cricket, that’s why we won.”
While Pakistan look ahead to Sunday and a possible reunion with India – Virat Kohli’s side take on Bangladesh at Edgbaston on Thursday – England must reflect on how the bubble of their two-year resurgence burst.
Morgan said the direction of travel remained positive, something echoed by the England coach, Trevor Bayliss.
“There’s a number of our guys who haven’t been at this level before and it is a learning curve,” Bayliss said. “Finishing third or fourth, I think that’s about right where we sit in world cricket at the moment [they are ranked fourth]. We’ve got a long way to go until we reach the level we want to get to and a level I believe we’re good enough to get to.”
Warren Gatland, look away now. After preparations for the Test series against New Zealand were dented, if not derailed, by a second midweek defeat, the size of the task awaiting the British & Irish Lions has come sharply into focus with Steve Hansen naming the strongest All Blacks side available to face Samoa on Friday.
Aaron Smith’s selection at scrum-half, in favour of the in-form TJ Perenara, is perhaps the most eye-catching choice considering his slump last year while the Barrett brothers – Beauden, Scott and Jordie – may make history as the first set of three siblings to play in the same New Zealand side, if the latter two come off the bench. What strikes most about Hansen’s side, however, is the heavy artillery it contains. It is ostensibly a fixture for New Zealand – who have not played together since last November – to get rid of any lingering rust but increasingly, and considering the Lions have lost two of their four matches so far, it presents the opportunity to make a statement.
Kieran Read, Dane Coles and Ryan Crotty are all absent through injury – though Read and Crotty are expected to be fit for the first Test – but Ben Smith captains the side from full-back, having missed out on the Highlanders’ win against the Lions on Tuesday. Sonny Bill Williams plays his first international since the 2015 Rugby World Cup final alongside Anton Lienert‑Brown in the centres while Israel Dagg, the top international try‑scorer in 2016, keeps his place on the right wing despite the form of Waisake Naholo against Gatland’s side in Dunedin. Julian Savea will start on the opposite flank.
Up front, Joe Moody, Codie Taylor and Owen Franks reprise the front row that came off second best for the Crusaders against the Lions – in the eyes of the referee Mathieu Raynal at least – while Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock again combine in the second row. Jerome Kaino makes his first appearance since April following knee surgery – his performance will be of great interest to Hansen – while Sam Cane is at openside flanker and Ardie Savea is named at No8.
In total, it is a match-day 23 with 871 caps – Jordie Barrett and the back-rower Vaea Fifita are due to win their first from the bench, where they are joined by the Highlanders’ fly-half Lima Sopoaga, Nathan Harris, Charlie Faumuina, Wyatt Crockett, Scott Barrett and Perenara. Sopoaga gets the nod with Aaron Cruden nursing a knee injury but he is another expected to be in contention next week.
Hansen rarely resists the temptation to throw a few barbs in the Lions’ direction but the fact that New Zealand have even arranged this match – they rarely bother with warm-up games before a series – can be considered a sign of respect. The opportunity to blow away the cobwebs outweighs the danger posed by a fired-up Samoa leaving a mark on any of Hansen’s players.
“Whilst we asked for this game to help us prepare for the Lions series, once it became a reality, it then took on its own importance, this is a Test match against a quality and very capable opponent,” he said. “Samoa are about to kick off the qualifying stage of their Rugby World Cup campaign, so this will make them even more dangerous. The Samoans are always a challenge and will play with a high level of physicality and skill. At the very minimum, we will need to match that.
“This [training] first week has been about bringing together the players from the five different Super clubs and reintroducing them to the All Blacks way. We’ve had a good week and are really looking forward to this match.”
Preceding the All Blacks’ match against Samoa at Eden Park are Wales, who face Tonga to open their summer tour. Wales’s acting head coach, Robin McBryde, has named three debutants including the Scarlets’ 22-year-old winger Steff Evans, who finished last season as the Pro12’s top try-scorer. Elsewhere, Thomas Young of Wasps wins his first cap at openside, as does Seb Davies in the second row.
Jamie Roberts captains the side alongside Scott Williams in the centres while Alex Cuthbert starts on the right wing with the Auckland-born Gareth Anscombe at full-back, meaning Keelan Giles is still awaiting his first Wales cap. Gareth and Sam Davies form the half-backs for Wales in a match that was originally due to take place in the Tongan capital of Nuku’alofa but was rescheduled amid safety concerns over the Teufaiva Sport Stadium.

As you may be aware, Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water, Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after. What a humiliating fiasco that was and it’s no surprise that Jack and Jill haven’t been heard of since, unless that was them masterminding Theresa May’s recent election campaign. What’s sure is that the original water-carrier, as so dubbed by Eric Cantona, remains very much to the fore, although it seems that Didier Deschamps’ bucket has sprung a leak and not everyone in France is convinced he has the slightest notion how to fix it. Look at him, careering downhill with a rusty crock, getting water all over his tiny shoes and making all the bullies laugh! Run, squat Diddly, run!
Poor Deschamps, he’s been poor. Reaching the final of Euro 2016 on home soil fooled no one: France have been mostly plodsome for the five years in which Deschamps has been in charge even though he can call on some of the most exciting attacking talent in Europe – or, as Deschamps still prefers, Moussa Sissoko. Deschamps is even turning qualification for next summer’s World Cup into a c0ckamamie palaver, with Friday’s goof-riddled defeat in Sweden leaving France vulnerable to an unlikely resurgence by Holland. “I make choices after a lot of thought and analysis and things either go well or they don’t,” explained Deschamps, showing off the benefit of all that thought and analysis.
What France could really do with before breaking up for their holidays is a reminder that there are countries with an even more deeply entrenched capacity to make things dull and difficult. As luck would have it, Tuesday’s friendly in Paris is against England. And because it’s in Paris, England’s fancy-thinkin’ manager, Gareth Southgate, has decided to go avant garde. The manager will start with Burnley’s Tom Heaton so as not to cause any further interruption to Joe Hart’s daydreams. Deschamps, meanwhile, will also make changes, one of them likely to result in the inclusion of N’Golo Kanté, whom Deschamps has omitted in recent months on the grounds that Blaise Matuidi offers more. The big question, then, is whether Kanté can show Deschamps, of all people, that he is much more than a water-carrier.

“Yesterday’s Fiver described how Theresa May is a perfect example of what can go wrong when you put all your cards on the table, as a warning to Joe Hart. I think it depends on the game. When I was a teenager, my brother, some friends and I used to kill time after school playing various card games, including one I forget the proper name of, but was basically a more grown-up version of Donkey, with cards-on-knuckles punishments for the loser of each round. I re-iterate, if this sounds stupid, it’s because we were teenagers. Anyway, after a while players developed their own playing styles, including ‘red and black’ and ‘numbers and royalty’, where cards were grouped face down on the table for players to select. However, one lad played what he called ‘controversial’, for which he placed his cards face up on the table. What’s most remarkable about this is that despite revealing his every strength and weakness, he never lost. Not once. It was a successful combination of hubris and luck that Premier League goalkeepers and prime ministers could only dream about” – Ed Taylor.

So it is England against Asia for the Champions trophy. Against expectation Pakistan and Bangladesh are semi-finalists – there is no surprise India have qualified. This should ensure all sides have vociferous support in Cardiff on Wednesday and at Edgbaston on Thursday. Even better, they say the sun is going to make an appearance as well. A fitting climax to the tournament is in prospect.
Pakistan may not have taken on the role of cornered tigers, a description Imran Khan as captain coined so effectively in the 1992 World Cup in Australasia but Sarfraz Ahmed’s motley side are putting up a good fight. Back then a Pakistan team far more intrinsically gifted than this one were on the brink of being knocked out of the tournament but everything clicked just in time and they went on to beat New Zealand and England in the semi-final and final respectively.
When Pakistan were thrashed by India in their first game there was little prospect of them making the semi-finals but two victories, albeit scrappy ones, against an out-of-sorts South Africa and a butter-fingered Sri Lanka, means Pakistan are two games away from lifting the trophy. That would be quite a heist.
After the defeat of Sri Lanka, Sarfraz, a resourceful captain and batsman (and probably the slowest runner between the wickets in the tournament), quickly remembered beating England in Cardiff in September last year, which was Pakistan’s solitary victory in a five-match series. It was not so difficult for him to recall that game since he scored 90 and was the man of the match. Thanks to Sarfraz, Pakistan chased down England’s 302.
In this tournament Cardiff has tended to produce lower scores than the other two venues and that might well suit Pakistan. Not so long ago England were the team better suited to low-scoring ODIs. Their strength was reckoned to be in the consistency of their pace bowling and their solid rather than swashbuckling batting. In this country they are adept at knocking off totals like the 237 required by Pakistan on Monday.
Now their approach has changed. England have become a good-wicket team. They possess batsmen who can devastate on the benign batting surfaces they now prefer rather than Test style technicians. With all those players capable of delivering pyrotechnics they are well-equipped for high-scoring matches on flat pitches.
Pakistan prefer to play like old England. They do not possess a string of batsmen who can clear the ropes regularly. Most of them, with the exception of Fakhar Zaman, like to take their time but they also possess quality pace bowlers such as Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali and Junaid Khan, who is looking a far more effective operator than the man he replaced, Wahab Riaz. This trio can exploit the little bit of uneven bounce and seam movement that has been more evident in Cardiff than at Edgbaston and The Oval.
Now the sun is coming out, Pakistan may consider recalling their young leg-spinner, Shadab Khan, for the semi-final in place of Fahim Ashraf, who made a useful debut against Sri Lanka. There is a certain paranoia about playing two spinners in Cardiff because of the short boundary at the Taff end but this may be balanced by England’s traditional hesitancy against wrist-spinners (not that they have been that tentative in their recent dealings with Adam Zampa and Imran Tahir). Expect England to keep the bowling personnel used in their past two games, which means selecting both spinners.
England will start as the favourites after avoiding the rain and romping to three straightforward victories in the group games. The advantage of playing at home in the middle of the domestic season means they have more batsmen down the order capable of contributing. Many of the other sides have struggled badly once four or five wickets have fallen. The lower middle orders have been as rusty as abandoned old bikes.
India are even stronger favourites to win their semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday. They have lost to Bangladesh only five times in the 33 ODIs between the two and this record has been achieved without home advantage. India have not had a match on home soil against Bangladesh since 1998. These games have not been regarded as great TV revenue creators, which may explain India’s reluctance to issue an invitation on more than three occasions.
In the last series between the sides – in Dhaka in 2015 – Bangladesh won 2-1. Their team have long shed any inferiority complex and are brimful of gnarled old pros two of whom, Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah, shepherded them to victory against New Zealand at Cardiff last week quite brilliantly. Nonetheless it would be astonishing if they could do that at Edgbaston.
The most important person on court when the Golden State Warriors won the NBA title again was the man who wept. Sometimes it’s easy to forget how much their dynasty is because of Steve Kerr.
Could it last without him?
For all the talk of the Warriors as the NBA’s super villains with two MVPs, four of the game’s top 15 players and a fleet of role-fillers who would be starters on most other teams, Golden State may be the happiest team in pro sports. They win with joy. How many other great champion teams have said contentment was their top motivator? Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls – of whom Kerr was once a part – never claimed love as the key ingredient in hoisting a trophy.
But the Warriors who went 16-1 this postseason, beating Cleveland 129-120 in Monday’s Game 5 of the NBA finals, are unlike any other sports empire. They don’t motivate with anger. They don’t belittle one another. They win because they like who they are. They win because of culture, that’s what makes them so hard to beat. And as long as Kerr stays at Golden State they will remain the league’s best team.
Warriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser, who played college basketball with Kerr at Arizona, explained this well when he told me last year: “Steve is incredibly important and keen at handling situations where he’s able to get what he wants from the players without offending them, without getting into a screaming match.
Fraser added: “Sometimes I’m thinking: ‘He’s got to jump these guys, this is not good’. And the next thing you know he comes in and says something either really positive or very honest and from his heart and articulate and all of a sudden they have turned that problem into something good.”
The obvious reaction to Durant’s signing with Golden State last summer was that he was jumping on the float at the front of the parade. But Durant, who has always been more contemplative and soulful than other superstars, wanted something bigger than a gaudy ring when he joined the Warriors. He had watched the happiness with which they played and he wanted to be a part of it.
The winning just followed.
Few outside the NBA understand how much Kerr matters to the Warriors. How could they? With players like Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green how could Golden State lose? The assumption is anyone could coach them to a championship. Didn’t Luke Walton lead them to a 39-4 start last year and Mike Brown go 11-0 in these playoffs when Kerr was out with back issues? But as brilliant as Walton and Brown were, the foundation that allowed those wins to come was Kerr’s. The aura around the team is his.
Warriors general manager Bob Myers, the man who hired Kerr in 2014 didn’t fully grasp this himself until the middle of the 2015 finals, when at a tense point in the series he walked into a practice in Cleveland’s arena and found players blasting music from speakers, kicking soccer balls and laughing as they threw half-court shots. Instead of pressure there was euphoria. The Warriors weren’t fuming under a dark cloud as any other team would in such a situation, they were practicing to be themselves.
“Sitting in the stands I had this epiphany,” Myers told the Guardian last year. “I said: ‘I get it.’”
Late last night, after Golden State had won their second title in Kerr’s three years with the team, Myers laughed off the label of his team as the NBA’s Death Star.
“We’re still the same guys,” he said. “Kevin Durant is a great guy. He’s a nice guy. Steph Curry is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. I don’t think we were ever that. I think [with] our personalities people kind of embraced it in a funny kind of way. If that’s what they want to call us that’s not really who we are. I think we’re just a great group of people that want to play team basketball and don’t care who gets the credit.”
Kerr’s style works because much like San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich – a Kerr mentor – he doesn’t make the team about himself. He hates being the celebrity coach, grabbing the spotlight, rambling on about his theories. It was telling that during Monday night’s celebration, ESPN’s Doris Burke had to plow through the players celebrating on the stage to get the coach to talk about his team’s victory. Most coaches would have made sure to be her first interview.
That’s why the greatest threat to the Warriors empire is not LeBron James and the Cavaliers or the Spurs or the Celtics or any of the league’s rising teams. The greatest threat to Golden State’s continued dominance is Kerr’s fragile back. He has been in pain since his surgery after the first title in 2014 with the spinal cord fluid leak that forced him off the bench the first three rounds of the playoffs being the latest in a string of agonizing incidents.
“I don’t know if he can do this very much longer,” a Kerr associate recently told The Veritical’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Two weeks ago Kerr himself told the San Jose Mercury News his situation is “unprecedented” and said “We have to figure everything out this summer.”
It’s hard to imagine Kerr pushing through the hurt, twisting his body into airplane seats and running up and down the court in dress shoes 100 nights a year. If the pain persists he will have to leave and when he goes, the string that holds the Warriors together goes too. That isn’t to say Brown can’t take Golden State to more championships. He is an excellent coach. But his way isn’t Kerr’s way. No one’s is.
The Warriors culture is like none in the NBA. It’s still amazing to see the ease with which Durant slipped into a team that had just set a record for wins in a season. Kerr is lucky to have superstars such as Durant and Curry who put the team above themselves, but he is also the coach who gives them their joy.
Without it they are just another team with a lot of good players.
If a second midweek defeat of the tour has brought the Lions down to earth, there is equally no need for Warren Gatland to panic. There were positives in the 23-22 defeat in Dunedin – they outscored the Highlanders three tries to two after all – but many of their failings against the Blues returned. It was a breathless match, the best so far, but the Lions were found wanting in the final stages. Should Owen Farrell rather than Greig Laidlaw have kicked at goal considering it was his first involvement? Should Elliot Daly have allowed the clock to run down by lining up his long-range penalty? And why did the Lions not attempt to drive over from the late lineout? Both midweek defeats have been inflicted in the final six minutes when, as history has repeatedly shown, New Zealand are able to raise their game. The Lions must at the very least not allow theirs to fall apart.
The back row was always going to be complicated – Taulupe Faletau may be nailed on at No8 but flankers are proving more difficult. Sam Warburton did not have a good first half but he made significant improvements thereafter. It is hard to see Gatland leaving him out but Sean O’Brien was simply superb against the Crusaders. He could go to blindside but Peter O’Mahony is another in the frame, as is CJ Stander, who like Warburton, grew into this match. Justin Tipuric has shone in patches but the fact he was given 13 minutes in a contest tailor-made for him shows how desperate Gatland is for Warburton to prove his fitness. Considering the Lions struggled in the collisions and at the breakdown on Tuesday, O’Brien and the Warburton of the second half would seem the right blend but Gatland must be ruthless if his captain is not up to speed.
Defence and discipline, so pivotal against the Crusaders, were considerable blots on the Lions copybook. The penalty count was 12 as the Highlanders often got the better of the breakdown. George Kruis and his fellow forwards were effective at cleaning out rucks in Christchurch but that was not the case in Dunedin. The line speed was there but the Highlanders saw it coming and continually kicked, using a mixture of chips, crossfield kicks and grubbers. It did not always work – Tommy Seymour scored an intercept try from a Lima Sopoaga kick – but it caused the Lions problems and the All Blacks fly-half Beauden Barrett is the best in the world kicking from hand. One poor pass aside, Sopoaga looked assured and while Steve Hansen needs no reminder of Waisake Naholo’s qualities, he showed what a threat he can be.
That the scrum toiled will be a source of great frustration for Graham Rowntree and it cannot all be put down to the fact the referee, Angus Gardner, officiates on the Super Rugby circuit. That no doubt played its part – Dan Cole was furious with one scrum penalty against the Lions – and so Rowntree’s anger will be tempered by the fact two of the Tests will be refereed by Frenchmen. Nonetheless, it is a worry, particularly as the scrum got worse as the game wore on. The Highlanders pack isare underrated and contained only one All Black but if the Lions front-row replacements are supposed to be one of their biggest strengths, it was certainly not the case in Dunedin.
Courtney Lawes’s premature departure meant Alun Wyn Jones entered the fray earlier than Gatland would have wanted and that may give Maro Itoje the chance to stake his claim for a Test spot by playing against the Maori All Blacks on Saturday. There were not too many who advanced their hopes of featuring against New Zealand, other than maybe Kyle Sinckler and Rhys Webb, who seem destined for a bench role. In terms of front-row and back-three starters, no one is ahead of the chasing pack and while Jonathan Joseph caught the eye, he also made mistakes. Robbie Henshaw was better but it is hard to look past Ben Te’o if Gatland wants muscle at No12. Most telling will be whether Jonathan Sexton and Owen Farrell start together on Saturday. It would potentially allow Gatland a 6-2 bench split, with a bit more heft in someone like Iain Henderson, who showed his true colours against the Highlanders.
As part of Tom Jenkins’ series of films the Guardian spoke to Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations. Ever since he assumed the position in August 2015 the sport has been mired in crisis – from allegations of deep-rooted corruption during the tenure of his predecessor, Lamine Diack, to state-sponsored doping and a battle to engage a new generation of participants and viewers. Even as the popularity of running has boomed, the status of athletics has declined in inverse proportion and a sport that once commanded peak-time viewing is among those battling for its life in the face of myriad challenges.
Guardian Sport: How do you begin regaining trust in your sport?
SC: “You have to start somewhere. My instincts were that we had to start by rebuilding the foundations. The first year was not a page turner but we moved the dial a long way very quickly. In the course of a year we rewrote the constitution of the sport, we created the integrity unit and that is up and running. It doesn’t answer the next question, which is ‘OK, that’s fine but how does that really manifest itself in terms of a return to trust?’. I tend to think of a triangle – you need trust, you need good leadership and you need relevance. The one crucial asset my sport has is that more people globally do what we do than any other sport. The first advantage we have is more people run than cycle or swim or do triathlon. We have to make sure the people doing that in their millions feel an affinity with what is going on in the sport and feel this is a movement they want to be part of and not a movement that is tainted.”
Your sport has been brought to its knees by a succession of crises. Is it not fatally undermined?
SC: “I don’t want to remotely diminish the importance or the challenge of those various crises. But I do draw comfort from sitting in the crowd at meetings. I do compete in Parkruns, I do compete in 10ks – albeit at the back of the field – and I’ve not found there has been any loss of excitement or ambition about being involved in the sport. People have been able to separate their own enjoyment of being involved in the running movement without it being undermined by the fragilities elsewhere. We don’t like those fragilities, they have hit us hard and they have damaged us. But they are not stopping people wanting to be part of our sport. There was no sign last year of a diminution of the gates at our stadiums.”
But won’t it reach a tipping point?
SC: “We’ve got to do everything we can as quickly as we can to make sure we don’t reach that tipping point. Rio as a sporting event, particularly for athletics, was the best event we’ve had. We had more records than ever before, more countries competing than ever before and more countries winning medals than ever before. Poor leadership doesn’t impact on performance, because the athletes repeatedly punch through the fragilities we’ve had.”
But clearly there must be a link between the evaporation of trust and whether parents want their children to take up the sport or watch it?
SC: “When I set off on the path of reform I had two groups absolutely at the top of my list in order to protect and preserve and create confidence. The first was the clean athletes – if we’re in a system where no one cares if athletes are clean or not, then we’re in the knacker’s yard. The other group are parents. They have a huge impact on the sport their kids take up. We can’t have parents and grandparents thinking: ‘Hmm, maybe athletics isn’t the sport for us because there is going to be a risk that at the age of 16 or 17 you’re going to have an unscrupulous coach or a chancer agent saying there is a shortcut to doing what most of us have done cleanly for most of our athletics career.’ They were the two groups those reforms were absolutely aimed at.”
In today’s fragmented world with so many choices open to young people, can athletics ever be among the top three or four sports in the country again?
SC: “I don’t know. If I’m being honest maybe not. But there is a great deal we can do to restore support and trust in the sport. We have to be more innovative, we have to be braver and more creative in formats. The first thing I said when I became president was that we have to think differently. The Australians did. They came forward with Nitro. It’s not going to be the universal panacea. You might not see elimination miles in London this summer or the Olympics in 2020, but there are some clues there. There was better athlete engagement, the event was over in just over two hours, the stadium didn’t look like a car boot sale. You were focusing on one event per moment and young people seemed excited. In a country hemorrhaging athletics support, we had full stadiums. Are we going to get back to the point where the Nine O’Clock News breaks into a world record attempt of mine in 1981? Possibly not. But there is a lot more we can do to be more relevant and more exciting. We’ve got to be brave about it.”
Why hasn’t the sport evolved?
SC: “The sport has been too beltway. We’ve spoken to each other. I won the English Schools title 44 years ago and the format hasn’t changed. I’m pretty much watching the same format over the same period of time. I can’t think of any sport that’s remained inviolate to change for that amount of time. Twenty20 has done it well, look at Rugby Sevens. Look at Formula-E. Even watching Chelsea the other day, I noticed the player of the match was selected by the fans. To say Usain Bolt, probably the most recognisable athlete on the planet, doesn’t get into the top 30 on Snapchat or Instagram is pretty insightful.”
How can you cope without Usain Bolt?
SC: “We need to work harder to make sure that the Wayde van Niekerks, the David Rudishas and the Valerie Adamses are being given the horsepower to help fill the void. But there is going to be a void, no doubt about it. No one immediately found a replacement for Muhammad Ali but plenty of great boxers came along in his wake. There isn’t going to be another Usain Bolt for some time but there are things we can do to lessen the impact of that loss.”
These are practical things. What about the more philosophical impact of the cynicism that now surrounds your sport and others? Has it gone too far?
SC: “No, it hasn’t. Sport has gone through what global financial organisations have been through, the Church, the royal family. That’s what sport has been through and we have to adjust to it. What sport hasn’t properly understood is that the basis of power has changed. My federation was founded in 1912 and I only had five predecessors. It will come as huge relief to my family that I don’t intend to be there for 31 years. I think what sport hasn’t properly understood is that the average CEO probably only stays for five years. You need oxygen and you need change. You need a churn of people coming in and you need outsiders coming in. Sport doesn’t have the monopoly of wisdom and it does need to reach out. We’re not too far down the road to make sure we put the right things in place to hold on to the upper ground.”
The London Stadium will be sold out this summer for the world athletics championships. But a lot of the great things about London 2012 have been undercut by cynicism. Do people feel differently about cycling and athletics than they did then?
SC: “They probably do. But I don’t think that’s a permanent shift. The point I’d make more broadly is that, yes, people want higher standards in sport. People want higher standards in business, in schools, in politics, probably in their own families most of the time. That’s a natural human instinct. But I also think people are capable of saying that by a distance sport has more to offer than the challenges confronting it. We do something in society that no other area does.”
Does it matter if someone feels differently about Mo Farah or Bradley Wiggins, given the allegations against them?
SC: “I would rather people felt complete comfort that what they are watching is legitimate. The only thing I’d say is that they have, with some justification, should have a greater confidence in what they’re watching than 20 or 30 years ago. Systems are better. We are discussing it and we wouldn’t have been 20 or 30 years ago. We can go back 10 years and take medals off people. If you don’t go fishing, you can’t catch fish. I’d rather have the embarrassment of some high profile positives and uncovering some uncomfortable things than sitting there in gentle decline. I’d rather encounter it front on.”
When we’re back in the Olympic Stadium this summer, will you reflect on the difficulties of the Olympic legacy?
SC: “We are making a difference. I went to the Olympic Park the other day to watch one of my daughters play in a schools hockey tournament. The place was heaving. The stadium was being used, the swimming pool was full, there were queues of people trying to get into the velodrome, you couldn’t get a court at the tennis centre and there were schools playing on the hockey pitches. Affordable housing, families, life in an area that didn’t have that. Inspire a generation wasn’t just getting more people to participate, it was about improving elite level sport. We go from London to Rio as the only city that has gone on to secure a bigger medal haul four years later. That has clearly inspired a generation.”
The British & Irish Lions tour is approaching the rugby equivalent of Amen Corner. Negotiate the trip’s all-important middle fortnight successfully and anything becomes possible down the closing stretch. Get it wrong and, as with professional golfers who drop shots at Augusta’s pivotal holes, it can be hard to restore sufficient equilibrium.
Hence the reason the penultimate midweek game against the Highlanderson Tuesday, before the first Test on Saturday week, carries more significance than might seem obvious at first glance. The Lions badly want to maintain the momentum generated by their victory against the Crusaders and numerous examples exist of spirited ‘dirt-trackers’ playing key roles in successful tours.
It is particularly true in New Zealand, where every Lions performance is mercilessly picked over, whether it involves a second-string team or not. Memories of the 1993 Lions’ heavy midweek defeats by Hawke’s Bay and Waikato still linger and Gavin Hastings’ team also lost 37-24 against Otago in the build-up to the first Test. Martin Bayfield, Will Carling and Scott Hastings were all injured and the Test series ended in frustrating defeat.
If there is one key difference today it is that the Lions management are conscious of the mistakes of past expeditions. With two more demanding fixtures against the NZ Maori and the Chiefs also preceding the first Test with the All Blacks at Eden Park, Warren Gatland has made a point of ensuring every player feels at least vaguely in the frame for Test recognition. His assistant coach, Andy Farrell, has also emphasised the need to maintain a positive outlook, rather than be simply remembered as whingeing tourists.
With so little time to prepare and so much to cram in on the training ground, the Lions made a pact before flying out not to be dragged down by negative factors they cannot control. “The one thing we discussed before we left is that there is no bitching or moaning about anything,” Farrell said. “This is the schedule and you get on with it. That is what touring is all about. You have to embrace it. Preparation is never ideal but there will be no whingeing about it on this tour. We will not accept that.”
Instead they have listened to local complaints about scrummaging, refereeing and dull tactics with quiet enjoyment and Farrell’s nonchalant response – “They have to talk about something” – sums up the squad’s collective view that deeds rather than words will define this tour. That applies, from Farrell’s perspective, to the midweek team every bit as much as the Test side. “We enjoyed Saturday and what I would have felt if I was sat in the stand watching is a sense of excitement. I would want to get out there and build on it. It’s about making sure we are going in the right direction and improving until we get to the Test matches.”
Beneath the fixed roof of the Forsyth Barr stadium – the atmospheric modern replacement for the old, forbidding ‘House of Pain’ at Carisbrook – the priority will be to counter the Highlanders’ fast-tempo style which bears similarities to what awaits in the Tests. “We’ve got to be in control of how we want to play the game and be ready for them to hit us at breakneck speed,” said Farrell, who helped to mastermind Ireland’s victory against New Zealand in Chicago last autumn. “This is the type of test we want because that’s exactly what the All Blacks are fantastic at. We want to keep the ball rolling.”
A key element against a Highlanders team who have been scoring an average of four tries per game will be the Lions’ proactive defence, with Farrell still on the lookout for on-field lieutenants capable of constructing an even more impregnable wall. “It ain’t about just sprinting off the line, it’s about adapting to the situation,” Farrell said. “It’s about numbers on feet and covering space. I thought our decision-making was very good last Saturday.
“I’m still looking for defensive leaders. I think everyone should be a leader in defence because, if somebody messes up, everyone pays for it. I’m still looking for people to grab hold of the system and take it forward. We’ll see who steps up.”
The Lions are keen to underline their attacking ability on a hard, fast track but over the next fortnight much will also hinge on keeping their own try-line intact.

England’s Champions Trophy semi-final opponents on Wednesday will be Pakistan, who contrived a harum-scarum victory against Sri Lanka in Cardiff.
They won by three wickets when chasing a modest target of 237 but they needed an unbroken 75-run eighth‑wicket partnership – aided by dropped catches by the Sri Lankans – from the captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, and Mohammad Amir to secure their progress in the tournament. The last time Pakistan played England in Cardiff, in September 2016, they won so Sarfraz declared “confidence is high” before the semi-final.
“England are a world‑class team. They have been very good for the last two years. So we must play more positively against them,” he said. “Today our bowlers did very well at crucial times, I’m concerned by our middle order but we will sit down tomorrow and sort those problems out.
“All credit goes to the bowlers, Junaid [Khan] and Amir played very well. I’m very impressed with Fakhar [Zaman], too. He is a good prospect.” Sarfraz is a relatively new captain but is relishing the task. “I’m really boosted by my innings [61 not out],” he said.
Pakistan were expected to defeat Sri Lanka but they will not be favourites against an in-form England and Sarfraz implied that this would offer his side more freedom as the underdogs. Sarfraz will be free to take on the tournament hosts despite being fined 20% of his match fee, while his team-mates were fined 10% for their slow over‑rate against Sri Lanka.
An Argentina side boasting a midfield trio of Juan Román Riquelme, Esteban Cambiasso and Pablo Aimar and a defence featuring Walter Samuel won their second consecutive Under-20 World Cup, using José Peckerman’s floating 3-5-2 formation to devastating effect in Malaysia. Argentina’s top scorer, Bernado Romeo, despite playing alongside future Serie A, La Liga, Champions League and Copa Libertadores winners, did not enjoy such a distinguished career, managing four caps for the national side in a career that came to an underwhelming end in 2012 at San Lorenzo.
A far cry from the golden generation of Spanish footballers that would dominate the late 2000s, the team’s attack was led by Pablo Couñago, a man more closely associated with the Tractor Boys than tiki-taka. While Couñago now plies his trade at the Spanish fourth-tier club Alondras CF, his then team-mates Xavi Hernández and Iker Casillas boast seven Champions Leagues, 13 domestic titles and 300 caps between them to go alongside World Cup and European Championship winners’ medals. Couñago never received a Spain call-up.

Javier Saviola won the Golden Ball and the Golden Boot, following a record 11 goals in seven games. The youngest player on Pelé’s list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004, he won league titles in Spain, Portugal and Greece as well as a Copa Libertadores at his boyhood club, River Plate. Portsmouth fans may remember his team-mate Andrés D’Alessandro, who played for the club on loan from Wolfsburg. Both went on to star in an Argentina side who claimed gold at the 2004 Olympic Games and finished runners-up in the Copa América of the same year.

In a team featuring Dani Alves and Fernandinho, Dudu Cearense was arguably Brazil’s oustanding player, scoring four in seven games in the United Arab Emirates. Dudu’s journeyman career has taken him to Japan, France, Russia and Greece, while Alves’s career at Sevilla, Barcelona, and now Juventus has led many to consider him the greatest full‑back of all time. The Golden Ball went to the UAE’s Ismail Matar, who has spent his career in his homeland with Al-Wahda (bar a two‑game loan at Al-Sadd in Qatar).

Following in a proud tradition of Argentinian attacking talent, this tournament gave a glimpse into the future superstardom of Lionel Messi. Like Saviola before him, he claimed the Golden Ball and Boot as La Selección continued their dominance of the competition. With a record five Ballon d’Or victories, Messi has more than lived up to the hype. Maybe there is hope for 2017’s Golden Ball winner, Dominic Solanke.

Another victory for Argentina and another player secured the Golden Boot and Golden Ball double, this time Sergio Agüero. The striker, having played 84 minutes in the previous tournament, delivered with aplomb, scoring six times, including the opener in the final. Whereas Agüero has developed into one of the world’s most feared strikers, the other goalscorer in the final in Toronto, Mauro Zárate, has seen his career stall following a series of poor transfers.
Breaking the South American monopoly, and claiming Africa’s first and to date only Under-20 World Cup title, Ghana were powered to the title by Dominic Adiyiah’s eight goals in seven games and overcame a much fancied Brazil on penalties in the final. Adiyiah’s career has been a case of could have been but never really was. A move after the tournament to Milan, for whom he failed to make a start, was followed by a rapid decline as he failed to score for four clubs. A move to Thailand has seen Adiyiah return to the score sheet, with 38 goals in 58 games for Nakhon Ratchasima – a far cry from the San Siro.

An Oscar hat-trick in the final inspired Brazil to their fifth Under-20 World Cup victory, one shy of Argentina. Although the former Chelsea man impressed in that game, Fifa’s player of the tournament was Henrique with five goals in seven games. As seems to be the case with non-Argentinian Golden Ball winners, though, Henrique’s career has been disappointing. He has played for eight teams at the age of 26, his only prolific spell coming in 2015 at Coritiba, where he managed 12 in 20. Danilo and Casemiro have gone on to great success at Real Madrid and Alex Sandro has proved to be the perfect foil for Alves at Juventus.
A team containing Paul Pogba, Samuel Umtiti, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Kurt Zouma ensured France were the first nation to win all five Fifa tournaments in men’s 11-a-side international football. Pogba’s performances came a year after his free transfer to Juventus, where he would become one of the world’s most sought-after midfielders, before returning to Manchester United for a record fee. Pogba’s career is in stark contrast to that of Paul Charrau, who is on loan at Ligue 2’s Paris FC.
An unfancied Serbia defeated a Brazil side containing Gabriel Jesus, delivering a first success to the Balkans since the breakup of Yugoslavia. The goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic and midfielder Andrija Živkovic secured individual honours, with the former claiming the Golden Gloves award after Serbia conceded three goals all tournament and the latter winning goal of the tournament for his free-kick against Mexico. Zivkovic is the next great hope for Serbian football, holding the record for the youngest player to represent his country and recently winning a domestic treble with Benfica. Rajkovic has established himself at Maccabi Tel Aviv.
Here’s an argument for the office this week: this is the most unpredictable and engrossing season of AFL football ever. Discuss. If we limit the frame of reference to the weekend just gone, it is an easy argument to make.
Usually come winter the herd begins to thin, but after a weekend where Brisbane dismantled Fremantle, Essendon humiliated Port Adelaide and the 17th-placed Carlton wrung out a win and a great deal of fun against second-placed Greater Western Sydney, evaluating anything this season can be done just as effectively by shaking a Magic 8 Ball as it can be by watching hours of film.
In the twilight of Saturday, two days after re-signing forward Josh Schache, the hitherto unloved Brisbane Lions played like a club set free from heavy chains – although Dayne Zorko has hardly been bound this year, metaphorically or otherwise. Through 12 weeks, the Brisbane best-and-fairest winner is the only player not named Dusty or Dangerfield to have averaged more than 25 possessions, five clearances and a goal a game. By half-time on Saturday, he’d already racked up 19, eight and one respectively.
In the “traditional” football states, the 5ft 9in Zorko is like one of those slightly distorted airport announcements you don’t quite catch but suspect might be important. There is no doubting his importance to Brisbane, just as there is no doubt that to break through for a thumping 57-point win after a run of nine losses matters to a young group like the Lions.
“At some point in time you need to get some emotional nourishment for the group and we were able to get that tonight,” said Brisbane coach Chris Fagan. “We’ve still got a long way to go, but that’s the brand we want to play.”
One club that knows a little about “brand” is Essendon, and on Saturday they went some way to re-establishing their on-field reputation with a dominating performance against Port Adelaide that only the most partisan Bomber fans would have seen coming – and even most of them would not have anticipated what they saw from Cale Hooker.
Hooker won Essendon’s best-and-fairest as a defender in 2015, but has been a point of fan frustration and online forum contention this year due to John Worsfold’s persistence in playing him forward. It can’t have been much fun for Hooker going from the key man down back to being the support act up forward, but after five first-half goals, there was no doubting who was the star among many at Etihad Stadium on Saturday night.
But there is something of Sisyphus in Essendon. Jobe Watson, Zach Merrett and Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti play in an exciting, daring fashion that delights the football world, and then their fans boo Port Adelaide’s Paddy Ryder every time he touches the ball.
Having initially expressed a desire to remain with the Bombers during the supplements saga, the scrutiny eventually wore Ryder down and he requested a trade at the end of 2014.
That Ryder served a 12-month ban last year along with 33 of his former team-mates should’ve been enough to provide some perspective to those Essendon fans that booed. Then again, if a concern raised last week by former Bomber Nathan Lovett-Murray over the health of his daughter (who was conceived after the Bombers’ 2012 supplement program) was not enough to provide a sympathetic disposition, than the cause is likely a lost one.
Sympathy and the Carlton Football Club have been strangers for some time, but in the dying light of Sunday afternoon, even neutral football fans were willing them to a win against Greater Western Sydney.
In most sports there exists a proxy war between proponents of the high-octane offence practiced by the Giants and traditionalists who insist that such systems inevitably falter to a superior defence. The traditionalist line of thinking isn’t as easily marketable for a club in the early days of a rebuild, but just because it’s not an easy sell doesn’t mean that it’s not worth buying – and the Blues’ players and supporters have bought in.
The primordial game style from which the Carlton reinvention is evolving is built around a defensive structure (of which former Giants, Lachie Plowman and Caleb Marchbank are important pieces) that could one day see Brendon Bolton receive Queen’s Birthday honours for his work as football’s foremost civil engineer. Although it must be said that Carlton’s defensive structure is built on one of the game’s most fundamental of principles – the spare man.
On Sunday, the Giants midfielders won almost twice as many clearances and blew Carlton’s doors off for inside 50s. Yet the Blues were able to absorb just about everything the Giants threw at them and then swing to attack through the agency of Sam Docherty. That Docherty is regularly spoken as an All-Australian half-back-flanker is of no surprise to those who’ve watched his progress during the past two years. That Liam Jones was spoken of as an influential defender is a surprise. In a list of adjectives likely to be ascribed to Jones, “influential” falls somewhere well below “flakey.” After an indifferent career as a forward and navy blue whipping boy, Jones was impressive at reading the play, flew confidently into packs and at hit a target with all but one of his 14 possessions.
But if any one player personified the passion in Carlton’s gritty one-point win, it was 150th-gamer Matthew Kruezer. And if there was one play that personified the man those at the club call “Tractor” it was the one with 11 minutes to go in the last quarter when he barrelled over his opponent, followed up and kicked the ball off the ground 40 metres into the arms of Dale Thomas who set up Matthew Wright for what would prove a crucial goal. It was another example of how Kruezer plays football as though it is the central trouble of his life – so much so that you suspect the feeling he gets from busting through packs will stick with him like a phantom-limb sensation long after his football career is over. But given the 28-year-old is in career-best form, you suspect there’s a fair bit of football to play out yet.
And there’s plenty to play out in this most unpredictable of seasons. Wins on the weekend from Carlton, Brisbane and Essendon were less an act of footballing rug pulling than an alteration of perspective. There is no such thing as a certainty in such an unpredictable season – and Monday’s game between Melbourne and Collingwood in front of more than 70,000 at the MCG provided further proof of that.
In what was undeniably one of the games of the season, Melbourne seemed headed for a listless defeat that played into every tired ski-season stereotype before kicking six goals to two in the third quarter to set up an anxious final quarter. It also set the stage for Jack Watts to once and for all exorcise his debut demons from the same game eight years ago, when the Pies targeted the physically and mentally ill-prepared first draft pick. Paul Roos, the coach who Watts credits for his decision to stay at Melbourne, still believes Watts’s debut was not one of merit, but by virtue of a marketing stunt – one that backfired not just for the club, but for arguably a large part of Watts’s oft-criticised career.
With 90 seconds to go and less than a kick in it, Watts grabbed the ball just outside Melbourne’s 50-metre arc, took a bounce and calmly kicked the sealer from an angle acute enough for Melbourne supporters to ride every one of its 25 metres with hearts in mouths. Having played the role of Melbourne’s unlikely saviour, Watts extended his arms with an emotion that the confines of the English language could barely do justice.
It was a fitting finale to a round that was, yes… the most unpredictable and engrossing – the latest instalment in a year of AFL football that has been illustrative of the broader context of our times, which are for want of a better term, an uncertain and unholy mess.
Rafael Nadal made an observation in Paris about his philosophy on life that sounded innocuous enough to dip below the radar of those who were correctly more concerned with the history he had just created but it describes perfectly why he is playing some of the best tennis of his career.
His words reveal, too, that the 31-year-old Spaniard, who has suffered more injuries than is good for his long-term health, is not done just yet.
“Very organised people, very proactive people, know exactly what they’re going to do next,” Nadal said after looking about as organised as is possible on a tennis court in demolishing Stan Wawrinka in three sets to win his 10th French Open. “I do things as they come. Right now, I don’t really know. I’m just going to keep on playing as long as it makes me happy. If one day I get up in the morning and I’m no longer motivated to go train, well, I guess that day I will put an end to my career. You know what? I’m not worried. I’m a happy person.”
Like his oldest rival, Roger Federer, he is playing with the sort of freedom known only to the very young and those who have seen it all.
It is a joy that might carry Nadal to his first Wimbledon final in seven years. He might even win for the third time there. Or, as he admits, he could just as easily fall early if his unreliable knees do not adapt quickly to the peculiar demands of grass, as they did when he lost to the world No100, Lukas Rosol, in the second round in 2012.
Nadal, more than most players, has endured extended periods of struggle, when his love for the game has been tested. He almost expects them to return.
In 2005 his emotions were dragged in all directions. He met his long-time girlfriend, Maria Francisca Perello, and won the first of the 10 French championships that set him on his journey to La Decima on Sunday, as well as an unprecedented decade of winning at least one slam every year.
However, 2005 was also the year that structural weaknesses surfaced in his feet and knees and they have plagued him, to a great or lesser degree, ever since. He has been struck down in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2014.
In 2013 he came back from nearly eight months out to heal ruptured patellar tendons and won two majors among 10 titles and posted 75 match victories. It was an astonishing achievement. Bjorn Borg, no slouch on the dirt, was moved to call him “the greatest clay-court player to ever play”. Carlos Moyá, who has since joined him as eventual coaching successor to uncle Toni, described him as “a warrior”. Jimmy Connors remarked at the time: “His passion and the way he grinds is really something special.”
Because he can play no other way it is easy to take this commitment for granted, without wondering about the price he pays. Last year he had to quit the French Open after two quick wins because of a wrist injury. Only this season has he begun to resemble the old Nadal. If he looks commanding and fierce on court – so deep in “the zone” Nadal rarely reacts to extraneous activity – he sometimes appears uncertain of himself. Eight times in one answer on Sunday evening, he used the word “doubts”. For a long time he had pronounced it “doobts”. He knows how to say it now and he has a proper grasp of its essence.
“I have been very honest with you all the time,” he said. “I have doubts every day. If you have no doubts, probably [it] is because you are too arrogant. I don’t consider myself arrogant.”
What might surprise Nadal, however, is that there is a groundswell of worthwhile opinion saying he can win Wimbledon again. It would be on a par with Federer’s win in Melbourne this year, when he beat Nadal in the final. Even so, nobody – not even uncle Toni or his understudy Moyá – would previously have suggested Nadal could conquer the All England Club’s grass again.
He told the English-speaking press on Sunday: “I love grass, everybody knows, and it’s a surface that I really enjoyed a lot playing there.” However, he said to Spanish reporters later: “Grass is not my speciality, but I’m very motivated.”
He nonetheless reminded everyone when beating Wawrinka 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 that clay fits the script for a natural clay-courter who has rediscovered his killing top-spun forehand and now owns a backhand that is nearly as lethal. If he stays fit and healthy, he could win another two or three titles in Paris, putting him beyond reach in the record books. That might also haul him alongside Federer on 18 majors – although there is no sign the Swiss has finished collecting big silverware. If Nadal rules clay again, Federer likewise is ready to retake his Wimbledon crown. What a story it would be if the draw kept them apart until the last Sunday.
It is nine years since Nadal won possibly the best final in the history of grand slam tennis, when, over five sets of almost unbearable intensity, he deconstructed Federer’s elegance with the sheer power of his will, it seemed.
Before they arrived at that 2008 Wimbledon they played in the final at Roland Garros. Nadal won 6–1, 6–3, 6–0. It was one of the most humiliating experiences of Federer’s career. Now Wawrinka has felt the French heat of Nadal before Wimbledon. It would be foolish to predict the Spanish master could not do that double again.
The debate over whether medals have been prized over morals in Olympic sport has been escalated by the revelation that talented young women training with a view to sporting glory now allege they were sexually abused in pursuit of their dream.
British Canoeing and the police are currently investigating the claims. These were sportswomen who put their trust in a coach who they claim took advantage of them in the most deplorable way. Once more it gives rise to serious questions about duty of care for athletes, a discussion which will reignite on Wednesday with the long awaited publication of the independent report into the culture at British Cycling that was sparked by claims of bullying and discrimination first made by the cyclist Jess Varnish.
It has been 14 months since Varnish claimed the then performance director Shane Sutton cruelly advised she “get on with having a baby” after she was ditched from the high performance squad. He also remarked her bottom was “too big” to ride certain roles on the team.
The affair took a further twist when an independent British Cycling review that cleared Sutton of eight of nine charges was itself found to have “sanitised” the findings of its grievance officer by a leaked UK Sport commissioned report, the final version of which will be released this week.
Disabled riders said they had been referred to as “wobblies” and “gimp”, with the six-time Paralympic champion Darren Kenny claiming he felt so bruised by his experiences with British Cycling that he could not bear to display his medals publicly at home. Sutton denied the claims.
But Kenny’s sadness in the face of enormous success raises a potent point about whether the joy of sport was lost in a relentless clamour for more shiny metal to wave around. And of whether UK Sport, the funding body that allocated millions of pounds of exchequer and lottery money, should have asked robust questions about safeguarding, mental health and athlete representation.
The independent report is expected to make uncomfortable reading for the governing body, British Cycling, discovering over the course of more than 90 separate interviews that many riders and staff felt bullied and discriminated against. But it is also expected to criticise the funding agency UK Sport for failing to demand accountability, missing opportunities to identify management shortcomings at British Cycling years earlier and to spare much heartache.
It is not just cycling and canoeing, two of Britain’s best funded Olympic sports – in receipt of more than £50m between them over the last four-year cycle – conducting internal investigations. British Swimming is looking into claims of bullying made by Paralympic athletes. An elite coach was alleged to have belittled and criticised athletes, leading to a “culture of fear”.
Meanwhile medical staff at GB Taekwondo raised concerns with UK Sport over coaches’ practices with regard to concussion, weight loss and training loads, including suggestions that athletes were asked to train in saunas. According to UK Sport, an independent review found insufficient evidence to support the allegations.
It is not overblown to say UK Sport is in the midst of a crisis. The contrast with medal-based success is stark. In Rio British athletes had their best ever medal haul. While there is clearly much good being done behind the scenes – world-class facilities, coaching and an enviable attention to detail in training and competition – there is a case for the “no compromise” model to be reviewed entirely.
The idea of “no compromise” was minted by Peter Keen, who set in motion the “marginal gains” led transformation at British Cycling in 1998 and five years later oversaw its introduction to Olympic sport as a whole. It was enormously successful. Great Britain catapulted up the world standings, from 36th place and a solitary gold at the Atlanta Olympics of 1996 to second behind only the USA last summer.
The accompanying lottery money allowed athletes to devote themselves entirely to their training, paying for accommodation, food and a range of support services, from physiotherapy to sports science and nutrition.
Alongside that a performance director culture took hold, whereby one individual was given power to run his or her programme with relative autonomy. Varnish said it was a case of a select few at the top of British Cycling having ultimate power to decide on the future of athletes. She maintains the decision not to renew her contract was personal rather than an objective assessment of ability and potential, while there was scant opportunity for recourse.
Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, an 11-time Paralympic champion, conducted a government-ordered year-long review into duty of care which was published in April. It had seven broad recommendations, one of which was to create a Sport Ombudsman with the power to hold national governing bodies to account for duty-of-care failings.
It also suggested that the British Athletes Commission, an organisation which supports athletes who feel they have no route for making complaints to their own governing body, be independently funded by the government. It is presently funded by UK Sport which presents its own, perceived if not real, problems of conflict of interest.
If Grey-Thompson’s proposed reforms are acted on, it will go some way to making sure athlete welfare has the same gold standard as Great Britain’s Olympic performance.
It rains on a ticker-tape parade to remind England’s Under-20s that it will be easier to conquer the world than the obstacles that litter their path to regular Premier League football but they can take comfort from the roots of their triumph in South Korea. Sunday’s World Cup success, England’s best return on the international stage since 1966, repaid a willingness of the Football Association and Premier League to act on concerns over youth development in this country. A change in attitude at Premier League clubs could bring further reward.
Lewis Cook, the England captain, had only just hoisted aloft the Under‑20s World Cup following victory against Venezuela in Suwon when the debate began over the future prospects for Paul Simpson’s players – with a tone of inevitable, understandable foreboding.
The 13 players who featured in the final for England ran up a combined total of 1,094 minutes in the Premier League last season, roughly the equivalent of 12 matches, with Cook having the most, with 431 minutes in the Bournemouth midfield. The match-winner Dominic Calvert‑Lewin, only the third Englishman to score in a World Cup final, comes next with 346 minutes for Everton followed by his club-mate Ademola Lookman on 287. The time then slips away to Josh Onomah’s 17 minutes for Tottenham Hotspur while seven of those who played on Sunday did not play a single minute of Premier League football last season.
The suspicion that the final could have been as good as it gets for some in the England team deepened when the goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, fresh from making a fine and crucial late penalty save, admitted that his future at Newcastle United was uncertain having spent last season on loan at Kilmarnock in the Scottish Premiership.
Those playing statistics are indicative of a league where financial pressures and incentives do not encourage patient development and risks on young talent; and of a competition where some owners are more concerned with grabbing additional money from the broadcasting revenue pool than the international fortunes of what to many is a foreign land. But the efforts to clear the pathway for homegrown talent in the Premier League cannot be dismissed with England the world champions at under-20 level, even if the long-term benefits are yet to be seen at senior level.
For the FA victory in South Korea rewards its decision to bring uniformity to England coaching at all age levels, to seek greater cooperation with Premier League coaches and to improve team cohesion via their St George’s Park base. Six of Sunday’s squad featured in England’s European Championship success at under-17 level in 2014 with four – the Golden Ball winner Dominic Solanke, Jonjoe Kenny, Woodman and Josh Onomah – starting against Venezuela. More recent and arguably more important changes have taken place within the Premier League as it attempts to counter accusations it is to blame for England’s lamentable record.
England has not had a problem in the past producing talent that can deliver up to under-18 level. The problem, articulated by a procession of Premier League managers, is the lack of competitive opportunities for players in the 18-21 age bracket. “Spain are developing men at that age while England’s players become overprotected,” said one. There appears little to no chance of the Football League allowing Premier League ‘B’ teams into its midst, as in Spain, but competition has improved at that age level following consultations with leading coaches in recent years.
Last season brought the introduction of Premier League 2 as a replacement for the under-21 Premier League, exposing youngsters to competition against under-23s, relegation and promotion between the two divisions and play-offs in the second tier. It was not a cure-all by any means but a start and one that ended with Everton winning the title before sending five players off to the Under-20 World Cup. There was also a 20% increase in playing time for homegrown debutants in the Premier League last season, 716 minutes on average, compared with 596 minutes in 2015-16.
David Unsworth, Everton’s under-23s coach, played for England when they finished third at the 1993 Under-20 World Cup and was one of four from that squad to graduate to the senior side. He was a rare voice in support of the much-criticised Checkatrade Trophy last season, arguing that any competition that heightens pressure on academy players should be embraced. But ultimately, he insists, it is individual quality that will determine how many of Simpson’s squad establish themselves in the Premier League.
“They have to enjoy this moment because it can be once in a lifetime,” said Unsworth. “They should enjoy it and go away and rest. Then they need to come back flying for pre-season – and I’m sure they will. All five of them are great lads and are desperate to be part of what is going on at our club. They have to keep proving themselves. Just because they have come through our ranks it doesn’t mean they have a divine right to play in our first team. They need to prove it every single day in training and they need to earn their places. They’ll all give it their best to get there.”
It encourages Calvert-Lewin, Lookman and Kenny, whose performances in South Korea showed Everton do not need to enter the transfer market this summer to sign cover for the injured Séamus Coleman, that Ronald Koeman was prepared to trust the club’s young talent last season. The same goes for Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham but it needs many more to follow suit for England’s world champions to build on their achievement. “English football people say you have to look out for young players, that maybe they can play 15 or 20 games but not more,” Koeman said last season. “They are afraid.” Sunday offered an alternative.
There have been higher-quality games of cricket in this tournament but none yet with such a taut finish. Beyond the dropped catches (there were plenty of those) and the overthrows and the wanton strokes there was at the end of Cardiff’s sunniest day so far the wonderful tension that knock-out cricket can generate.
At the end of it all Pakistan scraped to a victory that should have been so much more straightforward. They won by three wickets but they needed an eighth-wicket partnership of 75 between their captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, and Mohammad Amir to get them over the line. Sarfraz produced a captain’s innings of 61 not out but he was badly dropped on 38 and less culpably on 40 as Sri Lanka faltered in the field in the closing overs.
This victory means that England will meet Pakistan in Cardiff in the first semi‑final on Wednesday. They may be happy about that for the surface here seems to suit some of their team (their bowlers if not their batsmen).
There has not been much encouragement for bowlers in this tournament but the likelihood of some lateral movement for the fast men has been greater in Wales than in England. There may not be much pace in the pitches in Cardiff but good bowlers have sporadically found some movement. In earlier games Tim Southee, Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood have gained some assistance from grass, which Eoin Morgan has described as “thatchy”.
Pakistan, especially with the introduction of Junaid Khan as a replacement for the volatile Wahab Riaz alongside Amir and Hasan Ali, now have a triumvirate of pace bowlers who seem adept at exploiting any help. Hence they may be more dangerous opponents for England than Sri Lanka might have been.
Their pace trio were effective on Monday. Between them they took eight wickets with the debutant seamer Fahim Ashraf also picking up two. Such conditions favour Pakistan’s style of play. They are not so well equipped to chase the mega-totals as their batting lineup may be described as old-fashioned – with the exception of the newcomer Fakhar Zaman, a left-hander who wastes no time. But mega-totals in Cardiff are not guaranteed.
On a cloudy, mercifully dry day Sri Lanka were restricted to a modest total of 236. Amir and Junaid combined to puncture the Sri Lankan effort, taking four wickets for six runs in four overs. Hence the innings subsided to 167 for seven and beyond significant restoration even though Asela Gunaratne and Suranga Lakmal managed to raise the target to 237.
Sri Lanka looked to be on target for many more. After the early loss of Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis combined to add 56 enchanting runs. One ramp over the wicketkeeper’s head by Dickwella off Junaid was a shot of startling impudence and skill; Kusal Mendis oozed quality in a more orthodox manner.
However, Mendis was defeated by a lethal in-ducker from Hasan Ali and Dinesh Chandimal dragged his second ball on to his stumps. Now Angelo Mathews expertly resuscitated the innings alongside Dickwella so that Sarfraz summoned up his opening bowlers in tandem.
Mathews, maybe surprised by extra pace from Amir, was bowled off the inside edge; Dhananjaya de Silva nicked a beauty from Junaid, a fierce introduction to the tournament for a man who has only just been called up as a replacement for Kusal Perera. Next Dickwella was brilliantly caught by Sarfraz from an inside edge; the Pakistan captain was swamped by his colleagues in their excitement and in their recognition that this was an extraordinary one-handed take. Thisara Perera soon followed as the heart was ripped out of the Sri Lankan innings.
The Sri Lankan attack does not possess the same potency but theirs is a team of granite resolve. When Pakistan were 74 without loss in the 12th over the game seemed over. But some spirited bowling and panicky Pakistan batting soon put a stop to that notion.
At the start of the chase Fakhar, who has a licence to swing, drove lustily, taking three fours from a Lasith Malinga over with Azhar Ali a more watchful partner. Fakhar reached 50 from 34 balls and was promptly caught on the boundary. No matter; the older grafters would surely take Pakistan to their destination.
It is never that simple. Those grafters contrived to spoon and nick catches and the Sri Lankans under the calm leadership of Mathews started to believe. Pakistan plummeted to 137 for six with Sarfraz alone suggesting permanence. In came Fahim for his first international knock and the cricket acquired a technicolour tension. A bouncer from Malinga was hooked into the crowd by Fahim to get off the mark; another was top-edged wide of the long leg fielder. He was starting to enjoy this.
Perhaps the uncluttered novice would do the trick, as 25 runs were added rapidly. Then a firm straight drive from Sarfraz flicked the fingers of the bowler Perera before hitting the stumps. Fahim’s bat was over the line but not touching the turf and his dream was over.
Sarfraz and Amir stayed cool; Perera at mid-on then dropped a sitter after Malinga had duped Sarfraz, the biggest and most decisive mistake of an error-strewn yet rather magnificent match.
Mark Wood is revelling in his role as Eoin Morgan’s bubble-wrapped strike bowler and heads into Wednesday’s semi-final in Cardiff with chest puffed out from the faith that his captain is showing in him.
England’s near peril-free passage to the knockout stages of the Champions Trophy, one that sees the management mulling over just a single spot as Jonny Bairstow prepares to replace the misfiring Jason Roy, has owed much to a n on-song bowling attack that boasts Wood’s game-breaking 90mph missiles.
A career-best four for 33 against Australia on Saturday included the wickets of David Warner and Steve Smith, with two thirds of his deliveries dot balls, and was reward for a bowler who has battled back from a chronic ankle injury and whose pace and trajectory provides a point of difference in Morgan’s right-arm seam attack.
“It’s a nice feeling to have the confidence of the captain,” said Wood, who set up the group-winning performance against New Zealand with the wicket of their key man Kane Williamson. “Subconsciously I don’t know if it makes me try a little bit harder, but at the moment I seem to be getting some of the best players out. It’s a nice knack to have and hopefully I can keep it up.
“You lift up, push your shoulders back, puff your chest out a little bit, you feel like the captain really needs you and you want to be the man who changes the game.”
Wood has returned this summer after three bouts of ankle surgery but with both pace and enthusiasm seemingly undimmed. Like Simon Jones in 2005 – another skiddy and hostile fast bowler, if more strappingly built – there will always be fears over his longevity but the player himself has reported few ill-effects in this comeback. “My body is holding up really well, the backroom staff have been fantastic since I’ve come back,” said Wood, who has made subtle changes to his delivery stride and wears specially-designed boots to minimise pressure on his left ankle. “They roll me in sellotape and wrap me in bubble-wrap between games and hopefully I’ll be ready for the semi-final.”
Wood, along with Ben Stokes and Liam Plunkett’s role as a splice-thudding battering ram with some added smarts, is a reminder of the national team’s debt to Durham’s cricketing conveyor belt of talent.
“It’s great the north-east lads are the ones carrying the team at the minute,” said Wood, with a hint of mischief thrown in. “There’s always north-east pride. Being the only county a distance away from the others, we’ve always considered ourselves a tight-knit group at Durham.
“But this England group feel just as tight and together as that one. Everyone wants each other to do well, the lads who aren’t playing are pushing you to keep in the team and they genuinely want you to do well. We’ve got one hell of a team and I absolutely love being part of it.”
Wood has always spoken with a refreshing honesty and where some players may claim not to look too far ahead, the second Ashes-winning son of Ashington, after Stephen Harmison, is open about targetting this winter’s tour to Australia and the defence of the urn that was recaptured in 2015 when he detonated Nathan Lyon’s stumps at Trent Bridge.
“Am I thinking about it? Of course I am,” said Wood, who won the last of his eight Test caps on the 2015 tour of the UAE before the ankle was deemed in need of surgery. “If I can do well in a white-ball tournament like this, and then back it up by being consistent with the red ball [for Durham], I’d love to get back in the Test team.”
The expected absence of the side-strain afflicted Chris Woakes for the first two Tests against South Africa next month – and with Jimmy Anderson’s fitness not yet guaranteed following a groin tear – there will be a vacancy in Joe Root’s first side as captain.
England are clearly pondering Wood here, having made him available for just the opening fixture of the three-match Twenty20 series against the Proteas in Southampton on 21 June as part of a 16-man squad that has five uncapped players and sees Root, Stokes, Adil Rashid, Moeen Ali and Jake Ball all rested.
Root and co’s next cricket will be the floodlit County Championship round that begins on 26 June and provides both a return to the four-day groove before the first Test at Lord’s on 6 July and some valuable time playing time with the pink ball before England’s first day-night Test against West Indies later in the summer.
Mason Crane, the Hampshire leg-spinner who broke into the New South Wales team during the winter, has earned his first senior call-up along with the Lancashire’s thunderous batsman, Liam Livingstone. Craig Overton, the Somerset seamer, will replace Wood in the squad for the last two games at his home ground of Taunton and Cardiff.
Bairstow will play in the first two matches before returning to Yorkshire, while the uncapped Middlesex left-hander, Dawid Malan, earns a second squad place after going unused by England in their Twenty20s last summer but, like Livingstone, impressing for the Lions.
Tymal Mills, the left-arm quick who is the one short-form specialist, misses out due to his restrictive back complaint, with Surrey’s Tom Curran the fifth newbie as England look to widen their white-ball selection net at a time when the sun is already shining on the first team.

Racegoers at Royal Ascot next week can look forward to the Queen being in attendance as usual, despite speculation on Monday that she might be forced to miss at least one of the first four days of the meeting if the state opening of parliament is postponed from Monday to later in the week.
The Queen has been an enthusiastic owner and breeder throughout her long reign and the royal meeting at Ascot in June is said to be the first engagement that goes into her diary each year. Officials at Ascot believe she has not missed a single day’s racing at the meetings since her coronation in June 1953.
The five-day meeting begins on Tuesday and any one of the first four days could now be the new date for the state opening of parliament, when the Queen’s speech to both houses of parliament, setting out the government’s plans for the new session, is the centrepiece of the ceremony.
Ascot racecourse never comments in advance on any issues that concern the Queen’s attendance. However, there is an obvious precedent for next week’s possible clash of engagements, as the state opening of parliament took place on the second day of the royal meeting in 2001. The Queen attended a rehearsal for the state opening on Tuesday and then delivered her speech the following day, before travelling to the racecourse by car and arriving in time for the first race.
The royal procession down the middle of the course in horse-drawn carriages, which normally takes place about half an hour before the first race at 2.30pm, did not take place on either afternoon as the horses involved had taken part in the ceremonies at Westminster. However, this year’s state opening is due to take place without the horse-drawn carriages, so a mid-morning slot for the Queen’s speech, which is in any case expected to be shorter than normal, could allow her to perform the ceremonial duties in the morning and a more recreational role in the afternoon.
At present the Queen has only two horses entered at next week’s meeting: Call To Mind, an outsider, in the King Edward VII Stakes on Friday and the strongly fancied Dartmouth, who is priced at around 9-2 to win the Group Two Hardwicke Stakes on Saturday’s closing card for the second year running.
Jenny Pitman, who saddled two Grand National winners during an outstanding training career, and the former leading Flat jockey Philip Robinson are among the 23 members of the British Horseracing Authority’s new Disciplinary Panel and Licensing Committee, which will be responsible for hearing disciplinary cases and imposing penalties where necessary from early next month.
Pitman and Robinson both responded to a call by the BHA for former trainers and jockeys to put themselves forward for the new panel, the formation of which was recommended by Christopher Quinlan QC in a review of the regulator’s disciplinary and licensing procedures last year.
“I’ve worked in racing all my life and hopefully we can bring something to the table,” Pitman said on Monday. “If people are unfortunate enough to find themselves in an inquiry, I’m hopeful they will be satisfied with their treatment and the decisions that are made.
“I’ve worked with owners, stable staff, jockeys, vets, feed merchants, I was on the Lambourn Trainers’ Association committee and I’ve done a lot of stuff since I retired from training. The panel members who have done it from the grassroots, we’ve done it and didn’t read it in a book, so hopefully we’ll all be an asset to the panel in general. I haven’t got a legal brain but I’ve got common sense.”
Quinlan’s review was commissioned before the protracted disciplinary case involving the trainer Jim Best, which finally concluded in December last year when Best was banned for six months for ordering a jockey to stop two horses in races in December 2015. He had initially been banned for four years in April 2016 after an earlier hearing of the case, but that result was quashed when it emerged that Matthew Lohn, the chairman of the disciplinary panel, had accepted paid work for the BHA on non-disciplinary matters.
Several QCs, both current and retired, are also included on the new panel, including Patrick Milmo QC, an owner for many years, who also represented Jack and Linda Ramsden and their jockey Kieren Fallon in a successful libel action against the Sporting Life newspaper in 1998. Jodie Mogford, a former jump jockey and now an assistant trainer at Graeme McPherson’s yard, is also on the panel, but will not sit on any cases which involve a licensed trainer or in which McPherson, a QC who regularly acts for racing clients, is involved on either side.
John de Moraville, a former racing correspondent for the Daily Express who has been a handicapper for the BHA for nearly 20 years, will join the panel in November 2018, while Simon Rowlands, a form expert and the current chairman of the Horseracing Bettors Forum, also survived a selection process which involved 138 applications and 53 interviews.

Essex, without a title for a quarter of a century and in their first season back in the top flight, lead the County Championship. Having taken full points in thrashing Surrey by eight wickets at Guildford – after the hosts dominated the first day, Essex ran every session, despite missing Matt Quinn with a back spasm – they have won half their six games, and are the only unbeaten team in the league. Ducks have taken to water with greater difficulty.
The elegant Tom Westley completed this win the same way he finishes every stroke: with a flourish. His stylish unbeaten 108 helped his side reach 253 – a target Surrey’s captain, Gareth Batty, said was as simple as 160 on other grounds – without alarm. This is a theme: in Essex’s wins, Westley has 337 runs, a pair of centuries, and red ink in two chases.
That target had been set up by some efficient final-morning bowling. The industrious Neil Wagner returned and forced Stuart Meaker and Ravi Rampaul into loose shots, then Mark Footitt witlessly ran himself out seeking a second run. Ben Foakes, stranded on 65, looked furious, and with good reason; since that fine first day, Surrey had batted poorly and passively. Mark Stoneman, who was the reason for their early dominance, will on Tuesday receive a maiden call-up from England Lions.
For the second time in the match, Westley came to the crease when Alastair Cook fell on the stroke of lunch, this time for 31. He shared 95 with Nick Browne, whose form returned with a 77 full of attractive drives, and 104 with Dan Lawrence. When set, Westley hit 38 from his last 25 balls, including three successive boundaries off Scott Borthwick, then a pulled four off Stuart Meaker to bring up his 17th first-class century. Like Stoneman, he is ready should England call. It is the smoothness with which players such as Westley and Lawrence have adjusted to life in Division One that will most please Essex.
“Going top is not a big thing,” said Essex’s captain and first-innings centurion, Ryan ten Doeschate. “But the way we have gone about winning this game, missing Quinny on the first day, the effort that was required to find a win on a very good wicket with two out and out seamers is very rewarding.”
This was a seismic day in the shaping of the season and if the promoted side are leading the charge for the title, the champions are looking more like candidates for relegation than retention. Middlesex’s unbeaten run was terminated after 21 games, by Lancashire at Southport, with eight wickets the emphatic margin of defeat. The second day was lost to rain, and still Lancashire chased down the 108 they required shortly after lunch on the final day, with – pleasingly for England – Haseeb Hameed unbeaten on 38, his highest score since the opening game of the season. Middlesex’s tail had wagged to set up the target – they were still behind when they lost their sixth second-innings wicket. Stephen Parry took his first Championship five-wicket haul as they were bowled out for 236; such a paltry target, even on a sporting pitch against a batting lineup prone to scares, was never going to be enough.
The most thrilling finish was at Taunton, where Somerset fell four runs short of their first win of the season, against Yorkshire when Jamie Overton – having shortly before hit a six – turned Adam Lyth to midwicket. The debutant Adam Hose and Steven Davies, who made his first 50 of the season, put on 118 for the fifth wicket, but both were gone with 63 still required. Ryan Sidebottom then took three wickets with the old ball to finish with eight in the match, before Lyth’s late intervention dramatically curtailed the lower order resistance. Only Warwickshire are below Somerset, while only Essex sit above Yorkshire.
In Division Two, Sussex waltzed to their second consecutive win following their tricky start to the season . They had a tricky start to the game, away at Leicestershire, too. With nine of their first innings wickets gone, they were 139 behind Leicestershire’s 340, but ended up by winning by five wickets. Their last pair put on a record 83, then Jofra Archer took six wickets (to go with five in the first innings) to bowl Leicestershire out for 175. Luke Wells led the chase for 232 with a composed, unbeaten 90.
And Nottinghamshire were unable to take the nine Gloucestershire wickets they required on the final day on a lifeless pitch at Bristol that, according to the Notts assistant coach, Paul Franks: “makes a mockery of what good cricket should be about”. Harry Gurney took two early, but Chris Dent (71) and Graeme van Buuren (88 not out) ensured Gloucestershire earned a draw five down. Nottinghamshire, who travel to Taunton Tuesday for a One-Day Cup knockout, remain top of the division, by 16 points over Kent, who have played six games to Notts’ seven.
The Oyston family, owners of Blackpool, have been accused at the high court of treating the football club as “the family’s personal cash machine”.
Lawyers for the Latvian millionaire Valeri Belokon, the club’s president, were launching what could prove to be one of British football’s most expensive legal actions. Andrew Green QC alleged on Monday at the start of a five-week hearing that Owen and Karl Oyston, owner and chairman of the Lancashire club, had “improperly” extracted millions of pounds from its funds following promotion to the Premier League in 2010 and used the money for their own benefit.
Belokon’s company VB Football Assets, a minor shareholder in the club, was excluded from key decisions, information and any share of profits, Green said.
VB Football is pursuing a claim against the Oystons for “unfair prejudice” against shareholders. The claim is also against Blackpool FC Ltd itself and Blackpool FC (Properties) Ltd, a company with family links formerly known as Segesta. The Oystons are vigorously denying the claims in what has developed into a bitter legal battle.
Green told Justice Marcus Smith, sitting in London, that as a result of the Seasiders reaching the Premier League, the club received £106m. The unprecedentedinflux of cash over five years included £48m in respect of the 2010-11 season, followed by £58m in parachute payments after Blackpool’s relegation at the end of the season.
Green said: “Owen and Karl Oyston have treated Blackpool Football Club as the Oystons’ personal cash machine.” The QC said the family’s case was that at all times they had been transparent and open in relation to payments made out of the club. “Our case is this is simply inconsistent when you consider the documents. There was, in fact, the adoption of a deliberate strategy by the Oyston family to take cash out of Blackpool Football Club and do so in a way VB Football Assets and its nominated directors could do nothing to stop what was the antithesis of transparency.”
Belokon won a court case in Manchester in February this year in a dispute with the Oystons over his share of profits after he provided £4.7m in July 2008 to develop the south stand and south-west corner of the club’s stadium. That case was brought by JSC Baltic International Bank, owned by Belokon, against Segesta Ltd, the holding company for the club’s assets.
In March, the club announced Belokon was being suspended from its board as a result of a judgment in the Paris court of appeal related to disputed allegations of money laundering involving two banks founded or owned by him. The hearing continues.
The Fiver has never had the problem of not knowing where it is going to be “in the future”. Every weekday – save for those blessed bank holidays – is spent chained to The Man’s desk, typewriter firmly fixed on lap, every weekend is spent surrounded by lots of Tin and a subscription to Guardian Soulmates. Tea-timely email WLTM similar. Zero matches thus far.
The point being, The Fiver’s dye is cast. Whether The Fiver has a good day or a bad day, it knows the next one will always be at Fiver Towers. Not so for footballers, who have the luxury of moving on to pastures new, even if that pasture is on a slippery slope where the grass a little less green; a rugged piece of agricultural land with absolutely no hope of playing in Big Cup next season. Joe Hart is in this rather ambiguous bracket. And rather than have his Mr 15% actually do his job, Honesty Joe decided that the best thing to do was to put all his cards on the table which, as Theresa May will tell you, is the worst possible thing to do if you want a good deal.
“I would love to give you a poker-straight answer as to where I’ll be next season but I’ve got nothing at the moment,” Honesty Joe conceded, continuing the card analogy. “I’d love to be ‘withholding information’ about my future, but I don’t have the information to withhold. People are focused on international duty and respecting that players are focused on international duty.” Indeed, in an interesting take on Brandy and Monica’s 1998 smash hit, Hart admitted that his international duty might also be in doubt.
“This shirt’s not mine.” Honesty Joe honestly sang, the sound of 90s R&B leaking out of every pore. “We’ve got high-quality goalkeepers and I will have to be playing at a good, well, at the top level, to the maximum of my ability, even to get in the squad.” Yes, Honesty Joe, that is all well and good, but what exactly is the good level or the top level or the maximum of your ability? Mediocrity at Torino seems to be the standard, but where does clumsiness at Crystal Palace, or mediocrity at Newcastle sit in the pyramid of Hartism?
Taxpayers FC might be the best fit owing to the fact that they might be the only club able to afford his reported £110,000-a-week wages, although as of 4.08pm BST there hasn’t been a peep out of Big Website’s inside man, Gollivan Offspring Jack Sullivan. Still, that’s the basket The Fiver is putting its eggs into, only because the image of a bleary-eyed Honesty Joe being unveiled inside a glass prison on the wrong side of London – with even the South Bank’s most boisterous tourists shuddering in embarrassment as England’s now former No1 is forced to do the obligatory Hammers crossed-arm thing non-stop for a full half-hour; 2017’s David Blaine, if you will – is too good to be confined to the imagination.
“If the neighbouring countries in north-east Asia, including North and South Korea, can host the World Cup together, it would help to create peace in North and South Korea as well as north-east Asia” – well, it would appear that South Korea’s new happy-clappy president Moon Jae-in is a strong contender for The Fiver’s newly-created Most-Optimistic-Bod-Of-All-Time gong.

A trivia question: who was the last team to beat New Zealand at Eden Park, the stadium that hosts two of the three Tests against the British & Irish Lions? The answer is, of course, France in 1994 in a match best remembered for Jean-Luc Sadourny’s “try from the end of the world”.
Contrast that unforgettable moment in rugby union history with Dan Cole’s quip last week that, “the quickest line to the tryline is a straight line”.
Considering he once went 60 Test matches without scoring a try, Cole is perhaps not the most qualified member of the Lions squad to pass judgment on the subject but his pithy assessment is accurate, if showing disregard for aesthetics.
The fact remains though that the Lions have managed just two in three tour matches and while it is a cause for concern, rather than panic after restricting the Crusaders to just a penalty, it can be said with certainty that they will not end the All Blacks’ unbeaten run at Eden Park without scoring tries. Sam Warburton has said the Lions need to score at least 20 points to beat New Zealand but in their last four defeats the All Blacks have averaged 33 points against and while the 12-3 win over the Crusaders has alleviated the pressure brought on by the Blues defeat, the attack needs refinement.
Warren Gatland has accentuated the positives – whereas chances against the New Zealand Barbarians and the Blues were minimal, the Lions created openings against the Crusaders and would have at least doubled their tally for the tour with slightly cooler heads. Gatland has also pointed to the 13 line-breaks in Christchurch while their try in Whangarei was taken with a simplicity – Anthony Watson’s sharp spin and finish notwithstanding – that belies their subsequent scoring problems.
But it is CJ Stander’s try against the Blues that should be more instructive as to how the Lions can improve their scoring rate, in a manner in keeping with Cole’s analysis. For whether it is a lineout drive or a dazzling, length of the field score such as Ihaia West’s, they are still both worth five points and the rolling maul ought to be among the Lions’ most potent weapons.
Against the Crusaders, on more than one occasion Farrell kicked aggressively into the corner but the Lions were unable to capitalise. The home side’s defence takes its fair share of credit for that but with Jamie George and George Kruis linking so well at the lineout, as they do for Saracens, the Lions’ inability to drive over the line was surprising.
Indeed, it has been said that the Lions would be well advised to copy Saracens’ style – an argument given added currency after the way that they strangled the Crusaders with Owen Farrell to the fore and a pack containing three of his club-mates, with Maro Itoje coming off the bench. But perhaps a more effective blueprint for scoring tries would be that of Exeter. The Premiership champions scored 86 tries last season and they finished the regular campaign with a record eight consecutive bonus-point wins. There is also no side in the country more effective than scoring from a driving lineout that the Chiefs.
Add in the fact that while Crusaders followers have vented their fury with Mathieu Raynal’s interpretations of the laws, the Lions are confident of at least parity at the scrum against the All Blacks – as Gatland says: “Our scrum will be very strong by the time it comes around to the test” – and the Lions will hope to have ample opportunity to kick for the corners. It may not be as eye-catching as, say, West’s try but it should not be confused with negativity. When it was decided that Farrell would kick at goal in Whangarei rather than to the corner, it was a negative decision, only compounded by the fact he struck the upright. It was the wrong choice and a wasted opportunity to fine-tune their driving lineout.
For while Gatland and his coaches have sporadically hinted that the Lions are holding aspects of their attacking game-plan back for the Tests, it is a stretch to suggest that is why the maul, in a try-scoring sense, has not been used to any great effect as yet. More likely, as with their inability to finish when Watson burst through against the Crusaders, or when all Jonathan Davies needed to do was find George North outside him, it requires polish and as frustrating as those missed opportunities were last Saturday, perhaps the most disappointing chance to go begging was the late lineout against the Blues.
The Lions face the Highlanders on Tuesday under the Forsyth Barr Stadium roof and so it will be the hardest, fastest pitch that they encounter throughout the tour, against a side who will be hell-bent on breaking the shackles imposed on the Crusaders. For Tommy Seymour, who starts on the wing, it is an opportunity to cure the Lions’ white line fever. “Once these passes stick we’ve got individuals that can create things out of nothing from 80 metres let alone finish from five metres out,” he said. “Sometimes it can be a bit like a tidal wave and they all come after that.” He is no doubt right to say that the Lions will find their try-scoring rhythm sooner or later but it would pay to remember they do not all have to come from the end of the Earth.
Even before National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman appeared at ice level on Sunday night in Nashville to award the Stanley Cup to the Pittsburgh Penguins, fans in the Bridgestone Arena were already chanting “Bettman sucks.”
Most likely, the hatred spawned most directly from the fact that the Predators, who lost 1-0 to the Penguins in what was to be the decisive Game 6, would have been up by that same tally from early on, had it not been for a mystifying call by one of the referees. Early in the second period, a Predators shot deflected off the glove of Penguins goaltender Matt Murray, and Predators centre Colton Sissions tapped it in. But for whatever reason, the play had already been whistled dead, and the goal was disallowed.
NO GOAL.The refs blew the whistle before the puck crossed the line. #StanleyCup pic.twitter.com/Hg9etK1EAa
It was a weirdly fitting bookend to the series, though an unfortunate one for the Predators. In the first period of Game 1, Preds defenceman PK Subban scored to put Nashville up 1-0 on the defending champions. But the Penguins utilized a newly-introduced feature to the NHL, the coach’s challenge, and after review it was determined that the Predators had been offside. The goal was called back.
Nothing is to be taken away from the Penguins in all this. Pittsburgh are now the first team in the post-salary cap era in the NHL to win back-to-back Stanley Cups. The victory also ends another amazing season for the team’s captain, Sidney Crosby. Crosby started the season leading Canada to victory at the World Cup of Hockey; he finished it with his second Conn Smythe trophy, awarded to the most valuable player of the postseason.
Yet, for all the stories there are to tell about Pittsburgh, and for all the other, smaller, stories there are to tell about the 2017 Stanley Cup final – including whether Subban, the league’s most interesting player had, thanks to some post-game chirping, unnecessarily provoked Crosby into a career performance – the story this year belongs to Nashville.
And because it belongs to Nashville, at least some part of it belongs to the man Predators fans booed mercilessly when he did finally emerge Sunday night – the man responsible for bringing them a team in the first place: Gary Bettman.
There are many reasons Bettman is generally disliked by NHL fans, and why booing him as he presents the Cup every year is an annual tradition that Nashville took on with gusto. It is under Bettman, for example, that the league has undergone a number of game-play changes, including 3-on-3 in overtime, and the hated shootout. It is under Bettman that the coach’s challenge was introduced. It is under Bettman that the NHL has had two recent lockouts. And it is Bettman who obstinately refuses to admit a connection between concussions and CTE.
But atop the list of reasons why fans like to boo Bettman is that it is under his watch that the league has morphed into something many still fantasize that the NHL is not: a big business. When you ask hockey fans what annoys them most about the NHL, the answer is often that it is simply too big. Specifically, many fans decry more teams in places where there should not be teams – places in the southern United States such as Florida, Georgia, Arizona and (coming soon!) Nevada – and fewer teams in places where they think there should (Markham, Quebec City, Hamilton and Seattle).
Expansion, it turns out, is the harshest word in hockey. Unless, of course, it works.
In announcing the NHL’s plans to expand into Nashville and Columbus, as well as to return hockey to Atlanta and Minneapolis-St Paul, in June 1997, Bettman told the Associated Press that the moves would position the league for “significant growth and stability as we head into the next century.” He was wrong when it came to Atlanta. He was wrong for a long time about Columbus. But he was right about Minnesota. And, as is now clear, nearly 20 years since the Predators first took to the ice, he was eventually pretty much right about Nashville.
“You know when somebody says something to you and it just rings in your head; it just seems right from the start? That was the beginning.” This, apparently, is how the idea for Nashville, Tennessee as a hockey town began, according to an account from the team’s original owner, Craig Leipold. Nashville ticked the boxes for Bettman: a stadium awaiting a major league franchise, either NBA or NHL; potential ownership; and the right kind of market. Still, “[i]t was more than just a straight statistical thing,” he told Leipold. “All the economic indicators were there, and I believed that it could sustain a franchise.” But, Bettman said, there were “intangibles,” also. “My gut told me that this city could do it,” he said.
It almost didn’t.
Through the first nine seasons, Leipold lost $70m, and in 2007 there were rumours he was set to sell the team to tech billionaire Jim Balsillie (who wanted to move the team). Despite putting together consistently competitive squads, the Preds saw their average attendance fall to just over 13,000 per game in the 2006-07 season, and had as few as 9,000 season ticket holders. But the deal with Balsillie never materialized, and in the meantime, a Tennessee-based ownership group came to the fore and managed to keep the team in Nashville.
But it’s not as if there weren’t hockey fans around – even if they weren’t initially Predators fans.
In 1990, General Motors opened its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, a then-tiny town about a half hour drive south of Nashville, to manufacture its Saturn line. Six thousand employees from Michigan were relocated at the same time. When some of them heard, a few years later, that Nashville was getting an NHL team, those among them who were Red Wings fans were lured in by a chance to see their former hometown team play. But, as Jordan Ritter Conn chronicled recently at the Ringer, some of those fans eventually morphed into honest-to-goodness Predators fans.
And Nashville eventually gave those displaced hockey fans – as well as plenty more Nashville natives who adopted the team – a new place to call home: Smashville. Frank Glinsky came up with the term – a town “where the big hits of hockey met the smash hits of country music” – and when the Predators were searching in 2002 for a new slogan to give season ticket sales a bump, he submitted it. The concept – relaunched in 2009 by marketing firm GS&F – was one that placed the Preds in the centre of a city-wide party. It was the Smashville attitude writ large that showcased the town’s embrace of the team, and made the Predators run so special. Every game night, thousands of people have filled the streets around the Bridgestone Arena. Inside, the party was taken to another level – as if it were perpetually last call at the local bar. NFL football players chugged huge beers together in the box seats; the mascot drove an ATV across the ice; a different country star sang the national anthem each night; catfish, thrown from the stands, occasionally littered the ice.
Veteran Canadian broadcaster Bob McKenzie described it simply as: a Cup final like no other.
But the 2017 finals did more than cement Nashville as a legitimate hockey town; they marked the end of yet another chapter of the NHL’s expansion story. Before the month is out, the league will hold yet another expansion draft, this time in aid of creating a team for Las Vegas. The Golden Knights, yet another southern team, will take to the ice to start the 2017-18 NHL season. Shortly after the league announced its decision to grant Vegas a franchise, Gary Bettman told Sports Illustrated that having a team in that city will “enhance the league as a whole.”
“The people of Las Vegas – the people who live and work there – are going to embrace this team,” Bettman said. Perhaps the only way we’ll ever know if he is right this time is if, one day, the Golden Knights are where the Predators found themselves Sunday night, and Gary Bettman takes to the ice  in Vegas to be roundly booed.
A familiar American phenomenon has been in full force during the rise of Christian Pulisic this past year — for every US soccer fan or writer proclaiming Pulisic as the real deal, there’s been another one fretting about Freddy Adu, and the dangers of too much hope, too soon, being placed on the shoulders of the 18-year-old. It’s a familiar US pastime. And as Pulisic broke open a tense game against Trinidad & Tobago with two goals on Thursday night, the cautionary takes were as abundant as the hyperbolic ones.
But nobody within USMNT circles is pretending that Pulisic is anything other than their brightest: Bruce Arena called him “a big boy now”. Against Trinidad, Pulisic’s urgency in reaching the ball ahead of Clint Dempsey for the first goal had a symbolic feel. Pulisic vs Dempsey is not a zero sum choice, but it’s become clear in the last few games, that it’s impossible to give both players any sort of roaming brief. Dempsey is still dangerous, and capable of driving some games in those fits of self-righteous fervor, but his relevance to the national team will depend on him adapting to Pulisic rather than the other way around.
And if Pulisic was quieter against Mexico, there was a reason. Along with his team-mates he was absorbing pressure for much of the game, so that the moment two minutes from the end where he cut inside to shoot, and for a second dangled fresh levels of hype in front of us, was a standout rather than the rule. There’s a place for that kind of performance too, when it comes to assessing Pulisic. Eighteen or not, caveats about his age don’t really have a place any more. The team have pinned their hopes on Pulisic — if the fans do too, he’s ready to take it.
WHAT. A. GOAL. (Via @FOXSoccer) https://t.co/essdEgwgt6 #MEXvUSA
The opening few minutes of the Mexico game had already seen a couple of wild elbows, some unexpectedly bold US pressing, and had yet to settle into a pattern when Michael Bradley made his move.
In keeping with that aggressive US start Bradley had stepped up to win the ball, and then with a directness we rarely see from him, hit the most exquisite, shallow-arced chip over Ochoa in the Mexican goal.
The clamor and intensity and occasional downright ugliness of the opening minutes made the sweet flight of the ball off Bradley’s boot seem even more, well, beautiful, by contrast — and perhaps mixed in with the surprise of it was that the ball was hit by Michael Bradley.
Bradley had been shunted up and down the center of the formation for so long by the end of Jürgen Klinsmann’s tenure, that the sight of the US captain moving dutifully but awkwardly into position to play yet another cautious square pass had come to feel like his sole possible contribution.
The last time the US played Mexico, Bradley’s most memorable first half contribution was running to the sideline in a break in play to consult with a lost looking Klinsmann as Mexico ran the US ragged in Columbus. On Sunday night there was no confusion. Direct when he needed to be (and nearly stealing the winner with another shot off the post in the second half), marshaling the midfield line of defense more often, Bradley reminded us of his virtues against Mexico. And when he hit that shot he even made Bruce Arena smile.
The record used to speak for itself, with the long list of US losses at the Azteca suggesting an inferiority complex deepening for the visitors with each defeat. US teams used to appear beaten at the point of the first setback, if not before they took the field in the first place. But now, with a win and two draws in the last three visits to the stadium, Mexico’s advantage has been diminished.
When I was working on a story on the effects of altitude recently, in anticipation of this game, I spoke with Colorado coach Pablo Mastroeni, who knows a thing or two about the phenomenon. He suggested that past defeats may have as big a part to play in the outcome of the game as any consequence of the thin air.
The impregnability of the Azteca was diminished during Mexico’s struggles in World Cup 2014 qualifying, but even in the formidable run put together by Juan Carlos Osorio this time round, it’s been easier said than done to make the Azteca a fortress again. Part of the reason of course is that these days Mexico’s players are just as susceptible to the conditions as their opponents – most play their soccer in Europe.
Mexico will qualify comfortably for the World Cup. But even as they ended the Dos a Cero sequence up north, they couldn’t regain the historic dominance of the US when the series switched down south. There’s been talk of future national team games being moved away from the Azteca, and the more results like this happen, the less unthinkable that prospect seems.
Bruce Arena might have wondered why he bothered to come back after he saw the reaction to his appointment. The most experienced American coach in the game was treated as an underwhelming choice when he was announced as Klinsmann’s replacement. Even the arguments about him being a safe pair of hands, for what had suddenly become a World Cup qualification emergency, seemed to damn him with faint praise.
There were advantages to that too, of course. With the bare expectation that the team get points on the board, Arena did not have to deal with any of the existential questions about the overall trajectory of the program that Klinsmann had dealt with (and frankly, invited, with his dual role as technical director). Points for wins and draws were all that mattered. Style was irrelevant.
And yet even in the exceptional circumstances of preparing a roster for two games on a three-day turnaround at altitude, there were signs of an Arena manifesto for this US team. There’s the growing clues as to Arena’s preferred midfield, with the integrations of Kelyn Acosta alongside Bradley. Acosta replaced Dempsey against Trinidad, and Arena told me after the game that the purpose of that was to “get Pulisic closer to goal”. But it also beta-tested a defensive midfield screen ready to face Mexico, and that would in the event perform admirably. Add in the faith in Darlington Nagbe, rewarded by the midfielder’s directness in helping break the deadlock in Colorado, and there are real signs of Arena’s preferred side. And with qualification looking more and more likely the bigger picture of where Arena is taking this team begins to become more of a question. So far he’s answering the question confidently.
DaMarcus Beasley’s latest adventure involved playing 90 minutes against Mexico in the Azteca, in what’s now a record-breaking fifth World Cup qualifying cycle. Beasley did not particularly disappoint as one of seven changes Bruce Arena had made from the Trinidad game, even if he was the player Carlos Vela went past to score the equalizing goal. But his presence was a reminder of the USA’s ongoing inability to find and stick with a first-choice left-back.
Jorge Villafana did well enough against Trinidad. But when we’ve seen natural center backs like Tim Ream and Matt Besler tried out there, it’s apparent that there’s no specialist in that position who has distinguished themselves from the crowd. And that’s going to be a headache in the coming year.
John Stones is under consideration for a defensive midfield role as England explore their options in the build-up to the World Cup finals next summer, with Gareth Southgate seeking solutions for what he perceives to be a shortfall of talent in the position.
The England manager has experimented with Stones, long considered to be the best ball-playing centre-half at England’s disposal, in a midfield brief both at St George’s Park last week and, since Sunday, at the team’s temporary base in Croissy-sur-Seine. While the 23-year-old is still expected to start his 18th cap against France on Tuesday in a more familiar role in the middle of a back three, Southgate believes the Manchester City defender boasts the attributes to thrive as a holding midfielder at some stage.
“Well, I think he could do that [role],” said Southgate, who will begin for the first time with Tom Heaton in goal with Jack Butland to earn his first cap for 16 months in the second half.
“We had a look at that in training last week, in fact. I also think we want defenders who can bring the ball out and show composure. I think he could do either of those jobs. You’ve asked me if he’s an option there, and I think he is. He’s a player who’s very comfortable receiving possession, and has all the attributes and capabilities to play as a holding midfield player. He obviously hasn’t done that yet, really, so that’s a decision we have to make. But do I believe he can play that role? Absolutely.”
Stones was an unused substitute in the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on Saturday after injury restricted him to only 13 minutes of first-team football at City in the last six weeks of the campaign. He will start in a back three as Southgate switches system from that employed at Hampden Park.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is likely to start in central midfield, alongside Eric Dier, though Stones could push up into the role at some stage during the match. The visitors will be captained by Harry Kane in a friendly for which video assistant referees – the Italians Marco Guida and Massimiliano Irrati – have been appointed to review major decisions.
There will be a debut for Kieran Trippier, as well as that first start for Heaton with Joe Hart, Southgate’s first-choice goalkeeper, having always been earmarked to be rested for the fixture. “Joe is the No1,” Southgate said. “But next season we don’t know who will be playing at which club, who will be in form. Tom has had an outstanding season and we’ve got to maintain the squad environment and make sure people feel involved. Equally, Jack is coming back off a long lay-off and was No2 before that. We think he could also challenge for the No1 slot moving forward. We want competition for places.”
Didier Deschamps’s hosts will also experiment with their selection, with a first start anticipated for Thomas Lemar and his Monaco team-mate Kylian Mbappé, employed up front alongside Olivier Giroud.
The likes of Ousmane Dembélé, Samuel Umtiti and the full-backs Benjamin Mendy and Djibril Sidibé are expected to start. Southgate expects a stern test from France’s talented young side. “But the key is we learn something from the game,” he said. “We don’t have many opportunities to try things, to try players, so we have to take these chances. We need flexibility as a team.”
The Oasis song Don’t Look Back in Anger will echo around the Stade de France before kick-off as those present, including the prime minister, Theresa May, unite to pay respect to the victims of recent terrorist atrocities in Manchester and London. Eight people were killed in the capital a little over a week ago while, last month, 22 died with many more injured when a suicide bomber targeted a pop concert at the Manchester Arena.
The home support will hold up red and white placards to form the flag of St George as the players emerge into the arena, with a minute’s silence to precede kick-off.
The tributes mirror those at Wembley in November 2015, just days after the terror attacks in Paris, when England supporters had sung *La Marseillaise* ahead of a friendly with France and the teams had entered with the locals parading a flag reading ’Libert√©, Egalit√©, Fraternit√©’. England’s preparations have been undertaken amid heavy security at the Stade Omnisports, on the outskirts of Paris, at the venue used as Russia’s training base for last summer’s European Championships.
Oasis’s Don’t Look Back in Anger will echo around the Stade de France ahead of Tuesday’s friendly with England as the French pay respect to those killed in the London and Manchester attacks.
Just over a week ago eight people were killed in the capital by terrorists and on May 22 a bomb rocked Manchester Arena, leaving 22 people dead and injuring many more.
A minute’s silence was observed before kick-off for Saturday’s World Cup qualifier between Scotland and England, with the same tribute to be paid at the Stade de France on Tuesday evening ahead of the friendly with England.
Both teams are to wear black armbands and Press Association Sport understands fans will hold up red and white placards to form the England flag as Oasis’ ’Don’t Look Back in Anger’ is played just before the players emerge.
It is a reversal of the tributes seen at Wembley in November 2015, where a flag reading ’Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite’ led the team procession as the sides met just days after the terror attacks in Paris.
France midfielder Lassana Diarra’s cousin Asta Diakite was among those killed, while Antoine Griezmann’s sister managed to escape the mass killing at the Bataclan theatre.
Both players started on the bench at Wembley, where the words to La Marseillaise were shown on the big screen, allowing home supporters to join in a touching rendition of the French national anthem.
England and France players posed shoulder-to-shoulder for a photo, before standing together around the centre circle during a minute of silence.
South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has suggested North Korea could be part of a bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup. In a meeting with the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, Moon said that several countries in north-east Asia – including the isolated North Korea – could form a bloc to share hosting duties for the tournament.
According to the president’s spokesperson Park Su-hyun, Moon said: “If the neighbouring countries in north-east Asia, including North and South Korea, can host the World Cup together, it would help to create peace in North and South Korea as well as north-east Asia. I would like President Infantino to have interests on this matter.”
The liberal South Korean president has been open to more dialogue with the North since he was elected last month. North Korea has so far shown no sign of responding, however, instead conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in defiance of global sanctions imposed on it. Last week the prospect for Moon’s push to expand cross-border exchanges was thrown into doubt as the North rejected a Seoul civic group’s offer to provide relief items.
Infantino’s visit to South Korea took in the Under-20 World Cup, the final of which England won 1-0 against Venezuela. It marked England’s first global title since the senior side won the 1966 World Cup final. Fifa’s president said he would relay Moon’s suggestions to China’s president Xi Jinping, who he is scheduled to visit this week.
South Korea co-hosted the World Cup in 2002 with Japan, and the organisers of next year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang hope North Korea will take part. The North boycotted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Olympics, both held in Seoul, but it has since attended other major international sports events held in the South.
Queensland have wielded the axe, making seven changes for next week’s must-win State of Origin game two in Sydney. Veterans Sam Thaiday, Nate Myles, Jacob Lillyman and Aidan Guerra have been dumped along with unlucky winger Corey Oates and centre Justin O’Neill, while five-eighth Anthony Milford has a shoulder injury.
Fullback Billy Slater has been named to make his return in the clash at ANZ Stadium on 21 June along with champion five-eighth Johnathan Thurston, who missed the series-opening 28-4 loss at Suncorp Stadium due to injury.
Queensland took the unusual step of naming their 17-man team alphabetically but Darius Boyd is expected to move to left wing in place of Oates to make way for Slater at the back. Cronulla’s Valentine Holmes seems set to debut on the right wing, with Dane Gagai moving to centre in place of O’Neill.
In the forwards, North Queensland youngster Coen Hess will make his debut while Cowboys teammate Gavin Cooper returns to the Origin arena. The biggest bolter is Melbourne prop Tim Glasby, and Gold Coast prop Jarrod Wallace has also been called up to debut after being 18th man in Game I.
Wallace must beat a shoulder charge citing at the NRL judiciary on Tuesday night if he is to play, as he otherwise faces a two-match ban. 
“We didn’t get the result that we needed to have. We went to plan B, which was always in our plans, to bring some new players in,” Maroons coach Kevin Walters said. “The transition period for Queensland is right now. It’s not next year, or the year after. We just picked 17 players who we feel are the best 17 for Queensland.”
Likely Queensland team: Billy Slater, Darius Boyd, Will Chambers, Dane Gagai, Valentine Holmes, Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Dylan Napa, Cameron Smith (captain), Josh Papalii, Gavin Cooper, Matt Gillett, Josh McGuire. Interchange: Michael Morgan, Tim Glasby, Coen Hess, Jarrod Wallace.
Sidney Crosby is bringing the Stanley Cup back home to Pittsburgh for a second consecutive year.
Patric Hornqvist scored with 1:35 left and Matt Murray made 27 saves for his second straight shutout as the Penguins became the NHL’s first team in nearly two decades to repeat as champions following a 2-0 win over the Nashville Predators in Game 6 on Sunday night.

The Penguins won their fifth title — all of which have been clinched on the road — to tie the Wayne Gretzky-Mark Messier-era Edmonton Oilers for sixth on the all-time list. The Detroit Red Wings in 1997 and ‘98 were the last champion to defend their title, but the Penguins are the first to do it in the salary cap era.
“We knew it was going to be tough all year, but we just tried to keep with it,” said Crosby, who won his second Conn Smythe Trophy as postseason MVP. “We had a lot of injuries and things like that. We just kept finding ways. That was really what we did all season, all playoffs. It’s great to be able to do it.”
Hornqvist scored off Nashville goalie Pekka Rinne’s left elbow to end the scoreless game. Nashville challenged for goalie interference, but the goal was upheld. With Rinne pulled for an extra attacker, Carl Hagelin set off a bench celebration with an empty netter with 13.6 seconds left.
Nashville lost for just the first time in regulation on home ice this postseason.
Colton Sissons had a goal erased by a whistle 67 seconds into the second period. The Predators went 0 of 4 with the man advantage, including 32 seconds of a 5-on-3 in the third.
Forget a golden anniversary: The Penguins will cap their 50th season with their names on the most famous silver cup in sports — again. It is also the third championship for Crosby and a handful of teammates from the 2009 title team, surpassing the two won by the Penguins teams led by current owner Mario Lemieux in the 1990s.
And it’s the second championship in 18 months for coach Mike Sullivan, who has yet to lose a playoff series since taking over after Mike Johnston was fired. Sullivan is the first American-born coach to win the Cup not once, but twice.
Matt Murray became the first goalie to win not one, but two Stanley Cups as a rookie after being a late-season call up a year ago and didn’t play enough games to get that tag removed. That’s something neither Patrick Roy, Ken Dryden or Cam Ward ever managed, but the 23-year-old Murray finished this Cup Final shutting out Nashville for the final 126:52.
The loss ended the upstart Predators’ deepest playoff run in the franchise’s 19-year history and one that became the talk of the town far beyond Music City, catfish and all.
A superb strike from Michael Bradley gave the US a bonus point in the quest to reach next year’s World Cup, and a big psychological boost.
A squad still finding their feet under Bruce Arena shrugged off a dismal history at the Estadio Azteca to claim a draw on Sunday night, looking liberated by the lack of pressure that comes with limited expectations.
The captain, whose attacking prowess has not been to the fore in recent matches, intercepted the ball in midfield in the sixth minute, dashed forward and, spotting the goalkeeper out of position, chipped him from 40 yards for a sensational opening goal. The shot sank over Guillermo Ochoa in a mesmerising arc: a piece of craftsmanship, imagination and beauty so perfect that a video replay should run on an endless loop in a permanent exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
WHAT. A. GOAL. (Via @FOXSoccer) https://t.co/essdEgwgt6 #MEXvUSA
“Obviously it gave us an advantage early on,” Bradley told Fox Sports 1. “They had a lot of the ball but tactically the game went the way we expected … any time you get a point here it’s great, the mentality and the commitment from every guy was really good.” Bradley almost scored again from distance inside the last 20 minutes with a thunderbolt that clipped the outside of a post.
Carlos Vela scored Mexico’s goal, but a point was most welcome and fully merited for the US after an obdurate display in Mexico City against the side that leads the qualification standings. The US moved level on points with Costa Rica, who are second, although the Americans have played a game more.
Since Mexico won the previous meeting between the teams, the outcome also stands as a yardstick indicating improvements since Arena became coach. “We had let a lot of little things drop and I think Bruce has come in and done a really good job,” Bradley said in his post-match interview.
Mexico beat Honduras 3-0 last Thursday and - in stark contrast to their turmoil four years ago - have looked impressive in this qualifying campaign under their coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, a Colombian who is a former coach of the Chicago Fire and New York Red Bulls and a one-time student in Liverpool.
They also looked good a year ago in the Copa America Centenario before the bizarre blip in the quarter-finals when they lost 7-0 to eventual winners Chile. Here they were missing the injured Rafael Marquez, Miguel Layun and Andres Guardado, though Carlos Salcedo made an unexpected recovery from a leg injury.
Starting off the final Hexagonal round of Concacaf qualification, Mexico beat the US 2-1 in Columbus, Ohio, last November thanks to a late Marquez goal. It was an occasion freighted with political as well as sporting import, three days after the election of a certain former failed sports franchise owner to the White House.
The outcome ended the Americans’ 30-game home unbeaten run in World Cup qualifiers as well as the “dos a cero” scoreline streak. When the US lost to Costa Rica a couple of days later, Jurgen Klinsmann’s tenure as head coach was doomed.
Arena had said after the win over Trinidad & Tobago last week that he would change the team; he transformed it, with seven new names in the starting XI. Perhaps most surprisingly, the in-form Tim Howard, who played in the Americans’ only win at the Azteca, a 1-0 friendly victory in 2012, was rested and replaced in goal by Brad Guzan.
Geoff Cameron, Bradley, DeAndre Yedlin and Christian Pulisic were the only four to retain their places; left back Jorge Villafana was injured. The energetic 21-year-old, Kellyn Acosta, of FC Dallas, came in to act as a midfield disrupter in a formation that was a 3-4-3 in possession. It is the sort of dramatic rotation that, were Klinsmann still in the dug-out, might have inspired insinuations about his competence and/or sanity. But Arena’s pedigree, demeanour and the current performances of the team inspire more trust in his judgment.
The short rest between games was undoubtedly one factor; another, perhaps, was that with three points collected against T&T, Arena could afford to experiment at a venue where avoiding defeat felt likely to be a long-shot no matter who he picked.While Arena understandably fretted about the potential physical effects of the Azteca’s high altitude its factor as a competitive advantage risked being exaggerated; only two of the Mexico line-up play their club football in the country. The pace of the game hardly dipped as the night wore on, with both teams seeking a winner.
The 18-year-old Pulisic has become the US’s get-out-of-mediocrity free card, as he was in the fitful 2-0 win over bottom side T&T in the Denver suburbs last Thursday, scoring two second-half goals. On Sunday, though quieter, he made an adroit run and pass to set up a chance for Yedlin late in the first half, and an audacious attempted sand-wedge of a pass over the back line that was cleared.
Pulisic had boldly predicted victory ahead of this game. He had the opportunity to make his prophecy come true with two minutes remaining as he fashioned an enticing chance, but shot wide from the edge of the area. This time, for once, he would not be the headline-maker.
It was the kind of intense occasion that would have benefitted from firm officiating. But in the first three minutes, Salcedo was lucky to escape a booking for an elbow on DaMarcus Beasley, and seconds later, ought to have been sent off for another flailing arm that caught Bobby Wood.
Then came Bradley: it was the Toronto FC midfielder’s second international goal since July 2015 and a rare moment of adversity under Osorio; only the second goal Mexico had conceded in six Hex matches.
Chicharito should have levelled after 20 minutes when set clear, but with the ball bouncing, mishit his lob over Guzan and injured himself colliding with the goalkeeper, though he played on. The contest was tied soon after. On the counter-attack, Beasley – in his US-record fifth cycle of World Cup qualifiers – was unable to stop Vela cutting inside and dribbling along the edge of the penalty area, giving him enough of an angle to lash a low shot beyond Guzan. The US defender Omar Gonzalez fluffed a free header inside Mexico’s box as both teams looked dangerous, but went in at the break locked at 1-1.
More direct than Mexico – who worked the ball from side to side in search of space that the visitors mostly closed down effectively – the US were spirited in the second half and created a couple of half-chances.
Still, Mexico almost scored again with 20 minutes left as Hector Herrera cannoned a free kick off Guzan’s crossbar. Then came Bradley’s effort that hit the post. As rain fell in Mexico City, the Americans held on amid late pressure.
With a goalscoring turn from one of his stars and solid displays from lesser lights, Arena’s choice of players was vindicated and suggests a degree of depth that will give him the kind of selection problems that all managers relish as the US heads into this summer’s Gold Cup feeling good about making it to Russia.
Harry Kane’s late, late intervention was not to prove the final weekend blow landed on Gordon Strachan even if it was the most shuddering one. “I am absolutely shattered,” Strachan said. “That is probably the most emotional I have ever been after a game.”
Slovakia’s Group F victory in Lithuania on Saturday evening means Scotland remain fourth in the section, four points adrift of second and three from third. World Cup qualification remains a long shot, even if the pulsating boost afforded to Scotland by Leigh Griffiths’s outstanding double against England gave Strachan reason to believe.
“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t,” the manager insisted. “If I didn’t believe it I think it would rub off on the players. The players can sniff that.”
Strachan’s own situation has, of course, been intrinsically linked to struggles which preceded the March win over Slovenia and briefly stirring events of Saturday. It now seems certain the 60-year-old will see out the campaign, which apart from anything else will be commercially and practically useful to the Scottish FA in terms of sourcing a replacement.
“I have got a way of dealing with it,” Strachan said regarding speculation. “What makes me strong is those players and everybody I have met this week. People come up to you and say: ‘Keep it up, keep it going.’ That energises you.
“You all know that I do keep a barrier between myself and the media. It is nothing against you guys. I can get on and do my job, then it doesn’t affect me. If it affected me then it would affect the players. You have seen the performances over the last couple of years. I have got no problem with that. Funnily enough, somebody said: ‘Would you go back to full-time [club] management?’ I said: ‘Yeah, with that group I would.’
“I actually get excited when it’s time to get together with them. I just love working with them. We have faults, we all know there are faults – but that’s not their fault, that’s the Scottish game.”
That widespread chasm between Scottish players and their English counterparts is not lost on any sane observer, albeit Strachan has regularly been guilty of underplaying what talent is actually at his disposal. Teams with less to pull upon have fared better than the Scots under Strachan’s guidance.
A case in point relates to Griffiths, whom Strachan showed a real reluctance to play until recently. The manager will claim it was a simple mistake but pointing towards Christophe Berra as a player at a Hearts team “who finished sixth” in Scotland was disingenuous; they did not, just as the centre-back was virtually an ever‑present player last season for Ipswich Town in the Championship, a division from which Strachan has always drawn heavily. Berra was actually one of Scotland’s best players on Saturday.
“Listen, we have to improve,” Strachan said. “But that’s a different story. We could sit here all night and talk about things that we have to do to make us better as a group. In general, we still have to improve a lot as a whole, Scottish players.
“What you can’t say, though, is can you improve on your work rate. Unless you stand out there in that tunnel with these [English] guys and then get knocked down you don’t know what it’s like. It’s like in rugby when you come up against a pack and that pack keeps knocking you back. It drains you. That’s what happened with these guys. It drains you. But they kept finding an energy from somewhere.”
Scotland would now be helped in part by England maintaining their imperious qualifying form against other teams in the group. “I hope so,” Strachan said. “That’s 35 games unbeaten [in tournament qualifiers] and it’s the closest they’ve been to losing that record.
“We had a moment in the day that a lot of us in football won’t forget. We will remember the noise after the second goal forever. It could have been the best ever. If you can leave memorable moments then you have given something to the game.”
Griffiths was so close to becoming a national hero. His international manager drew comparisons to David Beckham and his memorable free-kick goal for England against Greece in 2001. “Some people can do it after 20 minutes when they’re fresh,” Strachan said. “For Leigh to dig out these two late on was incredible. I actually thought the second one would go in as well, I really did.”
Harry Kane has spoken of his pride at captaining his country but insists England boast “plenty of leaders” in their ranks as Gareth Southgate contemplates who will wear the armband on a permanent basis.
The Tottenham Hotspur forward, who does not captain his club side, became the fifth captain of Southgate’s seven‑game tenure after Wayne Rooney, Gary Cahill, Joe Hart and Jordan Henderson at Hampden Park on Saturday and seized his opportunity by scoring the team’s 93rd‑minute equaliser. That timely intervention, just moments after two free-kicks by Leigh Griffiths had taken Scotland to the verge of a first win in this fixture in 17 years, maintained England’s unbeaten qualifying campaign at the top of Group F.
“I have said before I would love to be England captain,” said Kane, who had previously been denied the chance to represent Southgate’s team by injury and whose goal was his first for the national team in 13 months. “Obviously, I don’t know what the gaffer’s feeling is on it. He gave me the armband on Saturday and I went out there and gave it my best. When you are on the pitch, not much changes. We have got leaders in the team, and it is just that I am wearing the armband.
“I still play the same way. I still talk, I still shout in the same way. That is what is good about this team. People look at one player now to drag them through, but we have plenty of leaders in the team to try and change the game. For me it was great to get that goal and be captain, but whoever the gaffer chooses long-term, there are plenty of leaders.
“It was quite emotional to be given the chance. The manager told me just before training on Friday. He said he sees me as one of the leaders in the team, that was it. Nothing about it being permanent. I am sure he will make that decision when he is ready, but I was delighted to lead that team out. There were a lot of emotions, lots of proud feelings, and my family were delighted. It was something I have always dreamed about, as most kids do. So to be given that opportunity by the gaffer and how the game panned out, to manage to score in the last minute was a very proud moment.
“It was probably the most special moment, personally, of my career so far. I did not want to lose my first game as captain, that is for sure – especially against Scotland. So to score that goal … it has been a while since I scored a goal for England. It was a special feeling for me.”
Kane took his first steps at international level under Rooney’s leadership, having broken into the Spurs first team with Hugo Lloris – France’s first-choice captain – wearing the armband. “A good captain leads by example, on and off the pitch,” the Spurs forward said. “You have a responsibility off the pitch with the media, and to kids coming through, and being a role model. I am quite a calm character. I’m not someone who gets too irate or too low. I have a steady mind and I know my ambitions, I know what I want to do, and this team has great ambition. I am one of many who could be captain.
“When I first came into the England squad, Wazza was great with me. He talked to me. Even as I was doing well with my club he was giving me a little phone call or text to say: ‘Things could change for you as you play more and get bigger.’ He was great with that, giving me his experiences of what he had gone through.
“I played under Hugo Lloris, France’s captain, who I will see on Tuesday. He is totally different. He is very calm, you respect him. I’ve had great captains in my career so far and if I can take anything from any of them I will be happy.”
Joe Hart has admitted he has no idea where he will be playing his club football next season with no firm offers having been lodged for his services, but is confident Manchester City will not price him out of the market as he seeks a fresh start this summer.
The England goalkeeper, who will sit out the friendly fixture against France in Paris on Tuesday with Gareth Southgate expected to offer Jack Butland a first appearance in 15 months, was a high-profile early victim of Pep Guardiola’s tenure at the Etihad Stadium and has just completed a season-long loan at Torino in Serie A. The Italian club are not seeking to make that transfer permanent, with the coach, Sinisa Mihajlovic, suggesting they cannot afford Hart’s £110,000-a-week wages, but Hart has not spoken personally to anyone at City since rejoining the ranks.
The club have since signed the uncapped Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica for £35m to leave Hart in no doubt that he has no future at the club he joined 11 years ago. No clubs have crystallised their interest as yet, and it may be that Hart has to accept an opportunity outside the elite bracket, and potentially a pay cut, at the likes of West Ham United, Everton, Newcastle United or Crystal Palace if he is to secure a move to another Premier League side.
“Something’s going to happen, one way or another, but it’s almost in the hands of the businessmen now,” he said. “They have obviously signed the new keeper, and I get the direction [in which they are moving]. There is no real need for me to talk to them. I’m lucky enough to have management who deal with that side of things. I think they spoke to my agent. There is no animosity between the two teams; they are going about their business, and we are going to go about ours.
“Look, I would love to give you a poker-straight answer as to where I’ll be next season, but I’ve got nothing at the moment. I’d love to be ‘withholding information’ about my future, but I don’t have the information to withhold. People are focused on international duty and respecting that players are focused on international duty. Come Tuesday night, after that is when conversations can be had and people can start being real. My personal situation is interesting, and patience is going to have to be the key.”
City have now spent more than £50m on Ederson and Claudio Bravo since Guardiola determined Hart’s distribution from the back was not of the standard he required, and that pair are now competing for the No1 jersey at the Etihad. Asked if he knew what the club’s asking price for him would be, Hart said: “I don’t know exactly. It’s hard to say what is ‘realistic’. Football is a business, at the end of the day. You can’t judge, realistically. The millions and zillions of pounds that get paid for someone to come and play football for you, in the real world, is strange. In the business world, the football world, it’s not.
“But I certainly don’t think they are going to try and price me out of a move. I think there’s enough respect between the player and club to work together. There’s no point in working against [each other]. There is no animosity between the two. They are going in their direction and I need to go in mine. It’s about what is considered to be market value and what gets agreed between the two clubs.”
Yet Hart, who kept five clean sheets in 36 games for Torino and was criticised by the club president, Urbano Cairo, who claimed to have been “surprised” at the number of mistakes the goalkeeper made, has conceded his departure will have to be on a permanent move. “If the switch is what needs to happen, and that’s key, then we all need stability in our life,” he said. “I’m not a kid any more. I can’t just pack my stuff, like a 17 or 19-year-old, and go on loan. I am a 30-year-old man with stuff I need to organise. I like stability.”
“There is an ideal situation to come out of this but nothing is perfect. It’s a short career and football is crazy, so I have to be prepared for anything. I just want to play football. I love football. It’s what I live and breathe, and I want to play football at the highest possible level I can play. That’s the plan.”
The England goalkeeper was beaten by two late Leigh Griffiths free-kicks at Hampden Park on Saturday, before Harry Kane salvaged a point in stoppage time, and his absence at the Stade de France will be one of a number of changes to Southgate’s side. Butland has not represented his country since fracturing his ankle in a friendly win in Germany in March 2016 and is likely to start, with Fraser Forster and Tom Heaton also in the squad.
It was difficult, listening to Joe Hart’s version of events, not to suspect he was putting on a front at a time when there has to be a legitimate debate about whether someone in his position – no future at Manchester City, no idea where he might end up next and, perhaps understandably, little of the old assuredness – still warrants his place in the England team.
Hart had just been through the videos of the two free-kicks Leigh Griffiths had put either side of him during that wild finish to England’s 2-2 draw in Scotland and there was no indication that a goalkeeper with 71 caps, nine years at this level and more clean sheets than anyone in that position other than Peter Shilton and David Seaman, considered himself to be at fault.
“As a goalkeeper, you set your wall up, and sometimes there’s nothing you can do,” was Hart’s take. “He’s produced two bits of quality. They weren’t sidefoots, they weren’t curlers, they were what I call ‘heavy’ – my boring goalkeeping technical term. He put them over the wall, then they picked up pace and sometimes you have to say well done.
“I went over to him at the end to say well done because that’s my personality, hate it or love it. I wanted to congratulate him and talk about it because I was interested about his thought process, too. To do it twice in a few minutes, after not really having a sniff the whole game, was a big moment for him. He took one with a minute to go in the game at Wembley and used a different technique. It’s a free shot from 25 yards and unfortunately his training has paid off.
“I asked my wall to jump but not excessively because people are clever now and they go underneath, but I’ve seen it again and we would have needed four or five Peter Crouches in that wall to make a difference. What else can you say? Sometimes you just have to say well done.”
And he was right, to some extent, bearing in mind the lopsided amount of attention that has been paid to Hart’s goalkeeping rather than the elegance of those strikes – first to his left, then his right – from the Scotland striker.
Unfortunately for Hart, these are not the first moments that have left the clear impression he is not the goalkeeper of old and the truth is neither free-kick was aimed fully into the corner of his net. From that distance, an elite goalkeeper would not normally be beaten twice and nobody could really take issue with Gareth Southgate if England’s manager is concerned about the way Hart’s career, at the age of 30, appears to be drifting.
As it turns out, Southgate will remove him from the team to play France in Paris on Tuesday, a decision that Hart did not seem to have been notified about as he talked about devoting time to studying the free-kick techniques of Dimitri Payet and Paul Pogba. That, however, is not Hart being dropped, even if Southgate is aware it might be perceived that way.
“Our intention was always to give someone else a game,” Southgate said. “However it looks, I will have to ride that out. I am seeing a headline that says ‘Hart is not safe’‚ but the fact is we need competition in every position. Who knows who will be fit and available [in the World Cup]? Too many times we have got to a tournament when a key player is not fully fit. We cannot rely on one or two players.”
All of which makes perfect sense now Jack Butland has recovered from his broken ankle, with Tom Heaton and Fraser Forster also in better form than England’s established No1, and not forgetting the credentials of Jordan Pickford, currently preparing for the Under-21 European Championship.
Southgate’s tone was supportive, on the whole, but Hart is in a state of limbo, back at Manchester City after a patchy loan arrangement with Torino but acutely aware he has no future under Pep Guardiola, the manager who fast-tracked him out of the club. In the circumstances, with zero offers from other teams, it is probably no surprise that Hart has never fully regained his best form since the ordeal of Euro 2016.
“I am sure he will be playing at a high level,” Southgate said. “He has had an important experience abroad. His contribution [for England] has been high and without his save against Slovenia we would be worse off in the qualifying group. For me, the goals were two moments of high quality, but we will look at them.”
Southgate’s hope is that Hart’s club situation will be resolved by the time England resume their World Cup qualifying programme against Malta and Slovakia, Group F’s second-placed side, at the start of September.
In the meantime, the former England captain Terry Butcher was among those calling for Southgate to change his goalkeeper and there was at least an acknowledgement from Hart that he was vulnerable. “This shirt’s not mine,” he said. “It’s not nailed-on mine, it’s no one’s. We’ve got high-quality goalkeepers and I will have to be playing at a good, well, at the top level, to the maximum of my ability, even to get in the squad.
“I am not a robot. Sometimes I do have thoughts about it [the uncertainty]. But there is nothing to get down about. It’s another exciting adventure, another move, the next step in my career, the next challenge for me personally. I love personal challenges. I have never shied away from one and I don’t intend to now.”
After San Juan there should be no need to talk up Santa Fe. Argentina and England put on one of the more exhilarating matches of modern times, a try-laden festival of dynamic rugby that twisted this way and that right up to the last, when Denny Solomona’s brilliant solo score tilted the balance one final time in favour of England.
It was an extraordinary exhibition of skill and nerve by an England side shorn of 30 players. Ten new caps were blooded, the most by England since 1956. By any rational measure they ought to be well satisfied, the second Test next weekend no more than a bonus opportunity to play a bit more rugby before a well-earned rest at the end of a long season. But Eddie Jones does not do satisfied. Already he has defied his put-upon youngsters to seize this last opportunity if they want to stand a chance of making the 2019 World Cup.
“This next Test is really important for these players,” he said. “They have to understand they may get only one game to have the opportunity to show they are good enough to be in contention for the next World Cup. You can always get those X-factor players who suddenly come through. We have seen a few now who previously we didn’t have on the radar. You always want that to happen. But, generally speaking I would think 80% of the [World Cup] squad will come from the next 45-man squad [announced in August].”
When Jones speaks of X-factor he might as well be holding up a portrait of Solomona, whose debut here was just about as wild and unpredictable as he could have dreamt it would be and, as such, a neat microcosm of the match. He came on in the 50th minute and within three minutes had missed three tackles, conceding two tries in the process. England’s six-point lead had transformed itself into an eight-point deficit – and Solomona must have been wondering what he was doing in this strange land, this strange sport.
“I think he was just so nervous,” Jones said. “The big occasion got to him. But the great thing is he bounced back. He had one opportunity to carry the ball and it was a fantastic carry.”
In the 79th minute England finally worked the ball to him – and then he remembered spectacularly what he was all about, smashing through, stepping around and streaking away from a variety of hapless defenders for the winning try.
“It’s unreal,” he said. “I think that is the best and worst debut I have had in my life! It is definitely different, a lot more intense than I thought. I can’t remember the build-up to the try. I just remember putting the ball down and being overwhelmed with joy and pride. I made a couple of mistakes but hopefully redeemed myself.”
As with Solomona, so with England. The error count in the first half in particular was high – from both teams – but Argentina, with a good deal more experience, even if they are without a host of world-class talent themselves, looked as if they might administer the kind of lesson no one enjoys having to endure. In the Pumas’ case the absentees are voluntary, their policy of selecting only home-based players as strict as that of the All Blacks, but they retained enough quality to dominate England at the set piece. And their reputation for running rugby is well earned, with Martin Landajo, Nicolás Sánchez and Matias Moroni dazzling at times. They fielded a new cap of their own, Emiliano Boffelli, a strapping winger who scored the game’s first try. The names are worth remembering. They are in England’s World Cup pool and will be lethal.
But they made mistakes, too, and England punished them as ruthlessly as Argentina did theirs. Mark Wilson had a fantastic debut on one flank and will not surrender his shirt lightly with Chris Robshaw back in contention this week. On the other Tom Curry, 19 this Thursday, gave promise of a long career, mixing the fearless with the dextrous.
Surpassing them all, though, was George Ford, who had his best game in an England shirt, pulling the Pumas’ defence into all manner of uncomfortable positions and racking up 25 points. “He’s a young stand-off,” Jones said. “He’s 24, still learning his trade and I thought it was certainly a good performance. He kept in the game and kept in control and gave the team what we needed. He definitely kicked well.”
The show moves on to Santa Fe, via Buenos Aires where England are basing themselves. Robshaw has recovered from his ankle injury but more new caps can be expected as Jones extends those precious opportunities to outsiders to convince him. He is building England an enviable stock of resources for now and the future but as ever prizes above all else the life force of recurring victory.
“We know Argentina are going to respond. It’s always the case when one side win and one side lose. The side who lose go back over every detail of how they lost. They come up with a game plan and perform it energetically. We have got to treat this like a loss and make sure we have the same intent to improve from the last game.”
No, Santa Fe should not require a further raising of the stakes but it is going to get one anyway.

Aaron Ramsey could not have picked a better place to convert a Panenka penalty as Wales secured a precious point against the Group D leaders, Serbia, to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup finals next summer, yet it was a night tinged with regret for Chris Coleman and his players after they allowed victory to slip through their fingers for the fourth time in this campaign.
Playing in the stadium where Antonin Panenka first produced that nonchalant chipped spot-kick, in the 1976 European Championship final for Czechoslovakia against West Germany, Ramsey showed nerves of steel to deliver his own version and for a long time that penalty looked like being the defining moment in the game.
Wales, who were missing the suspended Gareth Bale, played with a great deal of courage and discipline to frustrate Serbia but with 17 minutes remaining Alexsandar Mitrovic broke through on the left to equalise, denying the visitors the win that would have made such a huge difference with only four fixtures remaining.
Sitting in third place and trailing Serbia and the Republic of Ireland by four points after a fifth successive draw, Coleman admitted that Wales now have no margin for error in the rest of the campaign if they want to top the group. “I think realistically, if we want to finish first, [we need] four wins,” the Wales manager said. “If we want to take our chance in a play-off, it’s at least three wins and a draw.”
That challenge starts in early September with a home fixture against Austria and an away trip to Moldova. The bad news for Wales it that Joe Allen will miss the Austria match through suspension after picking up a yellow card against Serbia. The good news is that Bale will be available again.
That Wales coped so well without the Real Madrid forward here owes much to the performance of Ramsey, who was superb. Playing just behind Sam Vokes, Wales’ lone forward, Ramsey used the ball intelligently and made some excellent forward runs to relieve pressure and stretch the Serbia defence. He also converted a penalty kick to remember.
“I didn’t see that coming if I’m honest with you,” Coleman said. “But I had no doubt he’d score because he’s playing with such confidence at the moment. His overall performance was absolutely outstanding. He seems to thrive on that responsibility. It’s not the first time he’s run a game for us.
“His input tonight was immense. If we didn’t have him, I’m not sure we’d have come away with what we did because I thought when we needed someone to keep the ball, hold it and give us a rest, he was fantastic. And the penalty – the noise the supporters make here is incredible but it didn’t matter to him. Full of confidence and a fantastic finish.”
Asked whether he thought Ramsey was deliberately trying to copy Panenka’s penalty because it was the same venue, Coleman said: “Do you know what, I’m pretty sure that he probably hasn’t even seen it. But it was identical. It’s what we thought as soon as he did it. But I don’t think that would have been in Aaron’s thinking.”
It was an audacious piece of skill and came after a comedy of errors from Serbia’s point of view. Vladimir Stojkovic, the Serbia goalkeeper, made a pig’s ear of dealing with Ben Davies’s long ball and ended up bringing down Ramsey just outside the area when he realised that he was unable to shepherd the ball out of play. From the resultant free-kick Luka Milivojevic was penalised for pulling Sam Vokes’s shirt and Ramsey, with a delightful dink into the corner of the net, did the rest.
That goal turned the volume down in a stadium that was a cauldron of noise but it rose again when Serbia equalised. Nemanja Gudelj released a measured pass behind Davies and it was a lovely flick from Aleksandar Prijovic that Mitrovic dispatched inside Wayne Hennessey’s near post. Ramsey, breaking into the area with yet another well-timed run, could still have won it for Wales but his shot with the outside of his boot was turned behind by Stojkovic.
An emotional Rafael Nadal described his 10th French Open title as the perfect end to a perfect fortnight after he made history at Roland Garros on Sunday. The 31‑year‑old Spaniard’s 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 victory against Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland made him the first man to win any of the grand slam events 10 times, a feat he achieved without dropping a single set.
“This has been, I think, a perfect Roland Garros for me,” said Nadal, who dropped just 35 games in total on his way to a 15th grand slam title but his first for three years.
Nadal was shown a montage of his 10 victories before the trophy presentation and said the historic nature of the triumph added to his satisfaction. “It is true that this one is going to be one of the more special for the number, for what happened on the ceremony after the final, for so many things,” he said. “And because I am 31 already and not a kid any more. Today was a very important day for me. [There] have been some tough moments last times, injuries, so it’s great to have big success like this again.” Nadal said when he first won the title in 2005 he would not have imagined he would still be playing in 2017, let alone winning, and said 10 titles had a special ring to it. “As I like to say, if I can do it, someone else can do it,” he said. “But you need the right circumstances, the right ingredients to win 10 French Open titles. I don’t know if I will ever get to meet the player who will do better than I did. It has been very special to me, and it’s true that it is unprecedented. Trust me, I’m very happy that I’m the one who did it. I’m very happy.”
Wawrinka, who lost a grand slam final for the first time, said he had been beaten by a man at the peak of his game. “For sure he’s playing the best he’s ever played,” Wawrinka said. “But not only here. I think since the beginning of the year, you can see he’s playing more aggressive, staying more close [to] the line. But that’s clearly the best he has ever played. That’s why he’s winning so much again.”
The Swiss said he had recovered well physically from the effort of defeating Andy Murray in a semi-final which lasted more than four and a half hours, but that mentally the efforts of the past few weeks had caught up with him.
“From the beginning from my side, for sure, I didn’t play my best tennis,” he said. “I think I was a little bit hesitating with my selection of shots. I was always a little bit between [thoughts]. One, because I play against him and he puts this doubt in your head when you play against him because he’s playing so well. And second, all the effort I have been doing [in the] last few weeks to get to my best level again, to get some confidence again, and to win all those matches … some tough matches.”
Wawrinka said the positives of the fortnight outweighed the negatives of losing a grand slam final, having shrugged off a poor clay-court season to make the final for the second time in three years. Nadal’s 10th win, he said, was an incredible achievement. “It’s something tough to describe when you just say you won 10 French Opens,” he said. “It’s a grand slam, but it’s the same grand slam. That’s something so big for the sport. He’s the best-ever player on clay.”
Nadal said his chances at Wimbledon, where he has not won since 2010, depended on how his aching knees respond on the grass. “If I have pain in the knees, then I know from experience that it’s almost impossible,” he said. “Because I need to feel strong, low and powerful legs to play well in Wimbledon. If I don’t feel that, then probably my chances are not there, no? But if I am healthy and I am able to have the right preparation and feel healthy during Wimbledon, then I am probably going to have my chances to play well.”
Greg Eden continued the remarkable revival of his career when he ran in five tries as Castleford took another important step towards ending their 91-year wait to win the championship with a resounding victory over Warrington which left them six points clear at the top of Super League.
On this form the 26-year-old winger looks capable of eclipsing the 40 tries scored by Denny Solomona last season to set the competition’s record before he departed for rugby union. This was Eden’s fifth hat-trick in six games – including a Challenge Cup treble against St Helens – taking his season’s tally to 30 in 18 league games.
Castleford’s coach Daryl Powell, who recruited Eden when he was at a low point following a spell in the National Rugby League with Brisbane, said: “The people on the inside of him do an outstanding job but he’s an incredible finisher. But we were scratchy in the second half I thought, and Warrington came back at us.”
Just as Powell takes great credit over the Eden project, he equally deserves plaudits for turning the Tigers into a side who are the undisputed favourites for the Grand Final at Old Trafford in October.
In recent weeks his team have shown an essential hallmark of a championship team by winning when they are below their best. That was never more evident than against St Helens last Sunday and, while mesmerising in patches here, they were again far from perfect yet still ran out comfortable victors.
Warrington were the last side to defeat Castleford at home, in July 2016. But the chance of a repeat here was all but over by the end of a frenetic opening quarter in which the Tigers, with prop Andy Lynch playing the 500th game of his career, had opened up a commanding 20-0 lead after the Warrington captain, Chris Hill, had been sent to the sin-bin.
That early burst was typical of so many of Castleford’s victories this season where a flurry of points in a short, sharp spell have proved decisive. “It made it hard to win from there,” the Warrington coach, Tony Smith, said.
His team are now 11 points adrift of the top four and it appears their Challenge Cup quarter-final against Wigan on Saturday may well be season-defining. However, there is still the possibility of last season’s beaten grand finalists facing a battle against relegation in the Qualifiers. To illustrate the gulf in class between these two sides, Eden’s five tries here were one fewer than the six Warrington have managed in their past four games combined.
The early signs were ominous for Warrington when they fell behind after three minutes as Luke Gale’s kick was claimed by Eden for the first of his haul. Hill’s yellow card proved a pivotal moment, as in his absence Castleford took control of the match with tries from Eden, Greg Minikin and Mike McMeeken.
Tom Lineham’s try shortly after Hill’s return reduced the deficit, although only temporarily, with normal service quickly resumed when Eden completed a hat-trick following a looping pass from Junior Moors – whose knee injury was the only blot on another successful afternoon for the league leaders.
The second half was much more closely fought and Warrington managed to score the game’s final two tries through Joe Westerman and Jack Hughes, but by that stage far too much damage had already been done to their cause.
Eden scored his fourth and fifth tries and, for a brief moment, it looked like he would become only the second player in Super League history after the Bradford great Lesley Vainikolo to score six in a game. That was not to be but, on this evidence, there are still plenty more to come from him this season.

Always a happy hunting ground for Lewis Hamilton, the Canadian Grand Prix was once again conquered by the British driver but his skill was rewarded to a much greater extent than merely claiming his sixth win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. While Hamilton led from pole to flag in a race in which he never relinquished control and followed the Mercedes team’s plan to perfection, his Formula One world championship rival Sebastian Vettel endured a trying afternoon from which he did well to manage a strong comeback. But it remained a major blow, the German’s fourth-place finish cutting his 25-point advantage over Hamilton to 12.
Hamilton led a Mercedes one-two, their first of the season, his team-mate Valtteri Bottas finishing second with the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo third. Ferrari had been stymied almost from the start. Vettel suffered damage on the opening lap and was forced to play catch-up while his team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, lost places off the grid and had to adopt an alternate strategy, managing to finish only seventh.
Hamilton, who gained his debut F1 win here in 2007, relished the success. “You always need weekends like this,” he said. “There was a lot of time to think when I was out front, reliving the memories of 2007, really being able to absorb the moment and enjoy driving the car. It was a challenge but it was like other races I have had here, well managed from the front. I love driving this track.”
Hamilton had indeed been untouchable in front. He was in a class of his own in qualifying and a race of his own on Sunday. It continues the remarkably successful run that began with his first victory here and puts him one behind Michael Schumacher’s record of seven wins. Having taken the chequered flag in China and Spain already he is now honours even with Vettel – they have three wins apiece – and crucially within touching distance of the German in the title tussle, while his mastery of this demanding track on the Île Notre-Dame is simply beyond doubt. The deft touch and steely nerve that Montreal demands were once again to the fore and, although he was not under pressure, he did not put a foot wrong. “There was no trouble today,” he said. “It was a beautiful Sunday drive.”
With the order upset Force India took advantage and, aided by their upgraded Mercedes power unit, Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon were in the mix throughout. They drove superbly to finish fifth and sixth but the team faced a difficult debrief afterwards for not allowing Ocon, quicker than his team-mate in the latter stages, through, thereby assisting Vettel’s attempt to catch and pass them both.
Vettel had to pursue his own singular race and did so with admirable determination. The German had jumped Hamilton at the start of this race in 2016 but there was no repeat performance. Instead he was caught by the Red Bull of Max Verstappen.
Verstappen had an electric start and shot up the outside into turn one, while Vettel dropped two spots into fourth but he had not only lost places. The Dutch driver clipped Vettel’s right front wing and he subsequently also suffered from a damaged floor. It changed the complexion of Vettel’s afternoon immediately. A stop for a new wing followed, forcing him into a two-stop strategy, while Hamilton could stick to his plan, staying out long on the quicker ultra soft rubber and pitting only once, the optimum for the race, but Vettel was determined to limit the damage.
After his final stop he came out in seventh and a chase to the finish ensued. Raikkonen was first to fall. The Finn, suffering from brake issues, went straight on at the final chicane and Vettel passed him for sixth place on lap 61. On a charge he passed Ocon in a superb move into turn one on lap 66 to go fifth and then went after Pérez. This was thrilling stuff at the end and it paid off. Vettel pulled off another remarkable move through the final chicane on lap 69 to finish fourth – a result that looked unthinkable after the opening lap.
He was, nevertheless, disappointed but accepted the clash at the start had been a racing incident. “The beginning of the race did not go our way but I still believed we could fight back,” he said. “Three cars into turn one does not work. He [Verstappen] ran over my front wing. You don’t do that on purpose because of the chance of a puncture.”
Lance Stroll, the Canadian rookie, scored his first points in Formula One at his home grand prix, with what was by far his best drive of the season, finishing in ninth for Williams.
Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg came in eighth and the Haas of Romain Grosjean 10th while McLaren took another step towards a divorce from Honda after Fernando Alonso’s engine gave out on the penultimate lap.
But the day had belonged to Hamilton as it has so often in Montreal. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes non-executive chairman, acknowledged they had got everything right. “The whole team is back,” he said. “This race weekend was perfect.”
He was understandably pleased because it was enough for Mercedes to retake the lead in the constructors’ championship from Ferrari by eight points. The team’s executive director, Toto Wolff, described it as an afternoon that was a “cruise” and so it had been for Hamilton. But he executed the race perfectly and leaves Canada not only with a winning feeling but right back in the title fight.
Only the foolish would celebrate too hard the Wallabies’ 37-14 win against a spirited Fijian outfit in Melbourne on Saturday. Yes, of course Karmichael Hunt is a massive positive takeaway point – he was magnificent at 12 and is a match-day 23 keeper – but, overall, coach Michael Cheika should be deeply concerned about his side’s atrocious catch-and-pass skills.
It’s such a glaring inadequacy it renders all positives moot: Australia will lose more often than not against top tier opposition until players learn how to catch and pass accurately – and that means putting the ball in the space in front of support runners, and not behind them whereby players need to check their run and thus lose attacking momentum.
With the exception of two of the five Australian tries, the Wallabies were unquestionably poor at this fundamental aspect of the game. In fact, on this showing the Wallabies have never looked further adrift of the All Blacks who are undisputed masters of this core skill.
Poor catch-and-pass skills have been a blight on the Australian game for nigh on a decade now, and particularly so in the last two Super Rugby seasons. It has reached the point where excuses are regularly trotted out: “the Kiwis are innately better because they learn these skills from a younger age”, and so on. Indeed, that’s a reason why New Zealand rugby players catch and pass so well by default. But it’s not an excuse for Australian players being as inadequate as they are now. In fact, Australia used to be the envy of the rugby world for this elementary skill set with the Ella brothers, Michael Lynagh, Stephen Larkham, David Knox, Lloyd Walker to name a few leading exponents.
There simply isn’t a good enough reason for the Wallabies to be so lacking in this basic aspect of the game. It’s not as if it’s beyond them – the interchange between Hunt and Bernard Foley to put Israel Folau away for a gem of a try was a perfect example of flawless execution; players coming onto the ball in space – or where the space will be – and at pace. That was a classic Wallabies try of the kind we rarely see these days.
If Cheika and skills coach Mick Byrne (the former All Blacks kick and pass specialist) can sort out the Wallabies catch-and-pass basics, Australia can at least be competitive against the All Blacks during this year’s Bledisloe Cup/Rugby Championship. On the weekend’s showing though, the Wallabies will struggle to beat Scotland next up.
Cheika would have been pleased with what the Fijians brought to the contest. It’s always a coaching bonus to take big learnings away from a game which has been comfortably won. Too often these lessons only come from heartbreaking losses.
Unfortunately, one of the lessons from Saturday is that Wallabies captain Stephen Moore, 34, might not make it to the 2019 World Cup in Japan. Moore is backing himself to improve, but unless there’s a sharp upturn on what he showed off the bench against Fiji it might be the end for him. Michael Hooper’s permanent captaincy claims are becoming irresistible.
What of the Fijians, who will, likely qualification permitting, again play Australia in the World Cup pool stages? There is no mistaking Fiji are a team on the rise. Leone Nakarawa was magnificent and troubled the Wallabies no end. He truly is a world class player at the peak of his game.
The 37-14 scoreline suggests a comfortable Wallabies victory but it was far from that. Fiji butchered several try-scoring opportunities which, had passes stuck, could have seen the islanders sneak a famous win. The Wallabies would have noted the big omissions of Montpellier winger Nemani Nadolo and Toulon’s Josua Tuisova. And if Fiji can find a quality fly-half – Ben Volavola is simply not international quality – then it could be game on at the World Cup.
Surrey’s recent record at Guildford, where they are winless since 2002, is abysmal and they require a broad backbone to avoid defeat against Essex. With three second-innings wickets in hand they are 217 ahead; victory would take Essex, without a County Championship title since 1992, top of Division One.
Essex are making a superb fist of life in the top flight, and this was one of their best days yet. Ryan ten Doeschate swelled their first innings advantage to 36 with an unbeaten 168, his top score for Essex, then Simon Harmer, finding drift, turn and bounce with men round the bat, and Jamie Porter, hammering at a length and doing just enough with the ball, bowled beautifully to share seven Surrey wickets. Surrey’s hopes lie with Ben Foakes, once of Essex, who has 46.
Ten Doeschate had guided the tail through the first 90 minutes of the day, turning down singles but bunting boundaries between the men in the deep. In the half-hour before lunch, Surrey lost Mark Stoneman, caught at first slip off Porter as second slip parried, but Rory Burns and Scott Borthwick bedded in to share 93 in the face of probing bowling.
By tea, both were gone, though. Borthwick was well taken at short leg off Harmer, then Burns – who had driven nicely in his 57 – was bemused to be given out caught down the legside off Porter. Again, with the lead not yet 100, it was left to Kumar Sangakkara to bail Surrey out. This time he could not, beaten by Harmer’s turn and caught behind in 26 that saw him pass 900 runs for the season.
Dom Sibley was then trapped in front by one that stayed low from Porter, and Sam Curran was well caught at cover off Harmer. Eighteen overs of resistance from Foakes with Gareth Batty was ended by a catch at short leg, giving Harmer – an increasingly canny Kolpak signing – his fourth. Surrey need to grow their lead plenty: while scoring is becoming trickier (particularly off the good length frequented by Porter), boundaries continue to flow and Essex’s batting, as Ten Doeschate showed first time round, is very well stocked.
Middlesex have not lost since the final game of the 2015 season but a torrid performance at Southport leaves them requiring a superb final day to escape without defeat against Lancashire. Ryan McLaren’s 75 and some late humpty from Tom Bailey carried Lancashire from 136 for six to 309 and a first-innings lead of 129, with Tim Murtagh picking up six for 63.
The champions were instantly in trouble, though. They were six down and still behind, with Steve Parry taking three wickets and Saqib Mahmood two, before the shop was steadied by Dawid Malan and James Harris. With four wickets in hand, they lead by just 27.
At Taunton, the equation is simple: Somerset need 161 runs, Yorkshire need six wickets. The visitors piled up 283 in their second innings, with Gary Ballance left stranded two shy of his fourth century of the season, to set Somerset 262 for victory. Dom Bess, the 19-year-old offspinner, worked his way through 36 overs to record five for 80. Somerset made a poor start to the chase, with Steve Patterson took three wickets as they fell to 49 for four. Steve Davies and Adam Hose, on Championship debut, shared an unbeaten 52 to leave the final day tantalisingly poised.
Durham’s wait for a Division Two win lags on, as Kent batted throughout the final day to remain unbeaten, with Sam Northeast making 72 and the last pair, Yasir Shah and Mitchell Claydon, surviving 46 deliveries to secure the draw nine wickets down. Durham’s maximum bonus points will be no tonic: they remain on minus nine points.
Worcestershire, having won their first four games of the season, have lost their way in the wake of the saga that’s seen Tom Kohler-Cadmore join his native Yorkshire with immediate effect. On day one, they had Glamorgan 58 for six, trailing by 209, but they ended up losing by nine wickets before lunch on the third day. Michael Hogan took five wickets to bowl Worcestershire out for 129, before Glamorgan knocked off the required 16 for the loss of just Nick Selman for their second win of the summer.
Northamptonshire recorded their fourth win of the summer, over Derbyshire by 128 runs. Conor McKerr, a 19-year-old seamer on loan from Surrey, took his second five-wicket haul to finish with match figures of 10 for 141 as Northants subsided from 225 for one to 277 all out in their second innings. They responded, though, by bowling Derbyshire out for 191. The absent Luis Reece is feeling better after suffering breathing difficulties on the first day.
Nottinghamshire, are well placed to extend their lead at the top of Division Two after Samit Patel racked up an unbeaten 257 not out, a career best, in their 535 for eight declared against Gloucestershire. That was a lead of 232, and the hosts lost Cameron Bancroft to Luke Fletcher as they reached stumps 30 for one. Nottinghamshire will have James Pattinson available for their One-Day Cup knockout match against Somerset on Tuesday.
Jofra Archer confirmed his status as one of the game’s most promising fast bowlers by turning Sussex’s match with Leicestershire on its head. He took six for 70 (giving him match figures of 11 for 137) as Leicestershire were bowled out for 175 in their second innings (all the more impressive given Sussex were without the injured Vernon Philander), leaving Sussex a target of 232. They closed 100 for two.
Racing’s ruling body has denied undue delay in considering a licence application by Suzi Best, wife of Jim, whose licence to train was suspended at the end of a protracted and troubled non-trier case last year. The Guardian can reveal that Suzi Best’s application will now be considered at a hearing on 19 June, the very last day on which her husband is suspended.
Privately British Horseracing Authority officials insist this is nothing more than a coincidence and certainly does not amount to evidence of victimisation. They are prevented from offering any direct comment by the rules of racing, which insist that licensing proceedings are confidential and must not be discussed in public by either side.
Asked why it would take so long to consider a licence application that was made in the first half of December, a BHA spokesman confined himself to explaining the system in general terms rather than discussing Best’s case. “Generally the time required to determine a licence application can vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of additional information required and how quickly that information is provided,” he said.
Approached for comment, Jim Best declined to discuss his wife’s application, saying he had no wish to antagonise the BHA further. He added that he had not been to the races in the past six months, even though there was nothing in his suspension to prevent him from going, because he was concerned that his presence might be viewed as inappropriate.
However, it was clearly the hope of the Best family, at the time of Suzi’s application, that she would be given a licence before her husband’s suspension ended and keep the business going at their stable near Lewes in Sussex. In a December interview with The Guardian Jim Best pointed to the concern shown by the BHA’s disciplinary panel for the future of staff employed at the yard. “I don’t think it was the chairman’s intention for [the business] to be totally finished,” he said.
The BHA’s decision to refer Suzi Best’s application to its licensing committee is in contrast to its handling of the jockey Paul John, who had already admitted stopping two horses when he applied to get his licence back a year ago. John claimed Best had told him to stop the horses and was the only BHA witness against Best in hearings in February and November last year, which resulted in a finding against Best, despite his denials. The BHA decided not to oppose John’s application, which was duly granted, prompting concern from licensing committee members.
The committee chairman, Richard Russell, sent an email to ask: “Why was Paul John not referred to us? The only reason I can even think of is that, until the Jim Best case has been retried, the BHA did not want Paul John going before the licensing committee or any of its other independent committees. Another of my committee made the comment: ‘I am sure nothing untoward has happened but it just savours a little bit of a done deal in a way that a decision by us cannot.’”
The disciplinary panel in Best’s case eventually ruled that the BHA had agreed to give John lenient treatment in exchange for giving evidence, something which the BHA had denied for months.
France’s Champion Hurdle fell to a British raider for the third year in a row on Sunday when L’Ami Serge bagged the £142,000 prize for Nicky Henderson. The Lambourn trainer said Daryl Jacob had delivered “one of the best rides you’ll ever see”, settling the horse at the rear and saving plenty of ground at each bend in an attempt to make his stamina last the three-mile trip.
L’Ami Serge’s appetite for a battle has not just been called into question but become the subject of mirth in the press room and on social media. Even so, stepping up in distance may have made a big difference, as this was his second success in three starts. Henderson, who also won the English Champion Hurdle in March with Buveur D’Air, said L’Ami Serge responds well to French obstacles but would probably be returned to English racing in the autumn.

Roy Keane had called for a war but what he got was bloody awful until, that is, Jon Walters stormed to Ireland’s rescue five minutes from time.
The Irish had trailed since the 31st minute, when Martin Hinteregger struck for a depleted Austrian side who seemed on course to revive their World Cup qualification hopes by dealing a blow to those of their hosts, who were incoherent for much of this match. But then Ireland rallied, equalised and even forced the ball into the net a second time, only for the referee to disallow the goal for a supposed foul on the goalkeeper by Shane Duffy, much to the anger of Martin O’Neill.
With Serbia and Wales also in the running Group D looks likely to go down to the wire and Ireland can take confidence from this demonstration of their ability to fight to the finish. Whatever else they lack, their determination is bottomless. No one personifies it better than Walters. “Jon’s not the quickest but he’s got a real knowledge of the game and a really great will,” O’Neill said. “He is totally invaluable to us.”
Dublin looked a picture under a glowing sun but this match all but defaced it in the first half. With wayward passes, clunky touches and negligible imagination it was grisly viewing until Austria scored with a goal of incongruous quality. The visitors had offered a smidgin more neatness than the hosts in the opening half an hour but nothing that foreshadowed the artfulness of their breakthrough. It came from a corner delivered by David Alaba. Aleksandar Dragovic and Sebastian Prödl flummoxed the Irish defence by letting the ball run past them and over to Hinteregger near the penalty spot. He took one touch before firing past Darren Randolph.
There was no immediate trace of an Irish riposte. Robbie Brady and Jeff Hendrick can usually be relied on to serve up a measure of creativity but both were sloppy, Brady ineffective from the right wing and Hendrick offering meagre invention in an advanced central role. The game was crying out for Wes Hoolahan, the 35-year-old on the bench.
“I knew at half-time that we had left so many things behind and there was a determination in the second half to redress it,” said O’Neill, who made no personnel changes during the break but his team did emerge with more dynamism.
The fragments of class still came from Austria, though. The visitors forged a chance to increase their lead when Alaba drove through midfield before flipping the ball wide to the dangerous Florian Kainz and charging into the box. Kainz’s low cross was fractionally in front of Alaba, who had to stretch as he shot from 10 yards and that affected his accuracy.
O’Neill rejigged his team in the 55th minute, introducing Daryl Murphy up front alongside Walters and reassigning Brady to left-back in place of the substituted Stephen Ward. Ireland improved. They cranked up the intensity and delivered more and better balls into the box. For the first time Austria looked vulnerable.
McClean rattled them further when he cut inside from the right and shot a couple of yards wide from the edge of the area.
O’Neill cast on Hoolahan in the 71st minute and the little schemer almost created an equaliser within moments, delivering a wicked inswinging cross from the left that triggered such panic that Stefan Lainer almost slashed it into his own goal. The goalkeeper, Heinz Lindner, came to his rescue.
Austria rode that storm and would have increased their lead if not for a fine save by Randolph. Just as the visitors sensed a victory, Walters struck. It was classic Walters, the striker marauding on to a punt by Randolph, outmuscling Dragovic and walloping the bouncing ball into the bottom corner from 18 yards. The crowd went wild and two minutes later they thought things had got even better when Duffy headed into the net from close range after a massive scramble in the Austrian goalmouth. But the Spanish referee, David Fernández Borbalán, reckoned there had been a shove on the goalkeeper.
“We had a legitimate goal disallowed,” O’Neill said. “The referee was not to blame for our performance in the first half but I thought he was very poor indeed. The Austrian centre-back Prödl said on the pitch that, if it had been the other way round he would have been very disappointed.” The draw, at least, suited Ireland more than Austria.
Ben Stokes could stride into the Champions Trophy semi-final on Wednesday believing himself to be invincible at present but the England all-rounder has said he is not the type to get carried away with his performances; unsatisfied, he will continue striving to reach new levels.
Having bounced Australia out of the tournament exit door at Edgbaston with his career-best unbeaten 102, as Eoin Morgan’s side made it three wins from three in the group stage, Stokes underlined his status as the player all other teams covet and added more clout to the argument that we are witnessing a once‑in-a-generation cricketer.
Stokes himself, however, is trying to ignore the hype even though the Indian captain, Virat Kohli, used social media on Saturday to laud a four through the covers off the generally brutalised Pat Cummins – with a break of the wrists to add some deliberate slice – as the best shot he has seen in a long time.
“I just shut it out,” Stokes said. “You can do well one day and then not do well the other and you are not as good as everyone says. You just keep your feet on the floor. I never feel I get too high and I never feel I get too low about things. Everyone else may deal with things like that differently but that is just how I go about it.
“I am always trying to get better as a player, no matter how things are going, always trying to expand my game and look into how I can hit more areas or bowl different balls or whatever it is. I’m always looking to learn and am never happy with how I am going. I think once you get comfortable with what you are offering it is dangerous territory to be in.”
Lending itself to this level-headedness is the fact that England’s 40-run win by Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method – set up by the wonderful counterattacking stand of 159 from 35 for three with Morgan – was the first time Stokes has struck three‑figures in a one-day international run chase, with his second innings average going into the match just 20 from 24 innings with one half-century.
There was a point during his innings in the 70s where Stokes admitted his “beans were going” a bit and, upon recognising this could lead to his downfall, decided to throttle things back a touch and reset himself once more. Such an acknowledgment is one aspect to the 26-year-old’s game that has developed over the past year, not least during his subcontinental winter.
The Indian Premier League is getting much of the praise here and it would be ignoring the evidence to say there were no benefits, such as an acclimatisation to pressure-cooker stadiums, coping with the expectation of being the tournament’s most expensive overseas signing at £1.7m and gleaning advice from the masala of world-class players on offer.
Steve Smith, the Australia captain who led Stokes at Rising Pune Supergiant, may now regret being one of those who offered some help. “He just gave a little tip out in India, something on my technique, something that he felt could help me with,” Stokes said. “I was losing my backside a bit when I was hitting.
“The whole thing with the IPL is the exposure you get to big moments in games playing in front of a huge crowd all the time. In situations like 35 for three [against Australia] you can just mentally look back to a time in the past and reflect on that and also take confidence in knowing that you have been in that situation before and done well.”
Such a situation arose when Stokes struck his maiden IPL hundred from 10 for three last month in a match against Gujarat Lions, and winning the tournament’s MVP award in his first season was also a significant (and certainly will not be come next year’s auction) achievement. The experience, according to the England’s one-day batting coach, Graham Thorpe, has added an extra edge to a player who was already among the most diligent.
“He would have felt pressure going over there but there is something different about him now,” Thorpe said. “He wasn’t lacking in confidence before – in a nice way, not arrogance – but maybe it’s a belief, from being around those types of players, that he belongs.
“Him and Joe Root hit the most balls I’ve seen among young players over the years. You might be able to give them advice but they look to develop their own games. Ben has always been powerful but he’s adding new elements to his game. He’s very good at self-exploring. When he started, he hit a lot of balls and had fun but now he’s really consolidated his basics, too.”
For all the benefits Stokes felt from the IPL, the tournament is not cricket’s all‑healing grotto at Lourdes if Jason Roy’s returns since a largely unused spell with Gujarat – 51 runs in eight one-day innings that see Jonny Bairstow in line for the semi-final – are considered.
Thorpe said: “I think it can go one way or the other. It can be a great experience but there is another side. We have a player who maybe didn’t go there and play every game. That’s sport and life though, he could well go back next year and have a really positive experience.”
Roy will hope that his recent funk does not see him miss out when the Twenty20 squad to face South Africa at the end of the month is named on Monday. Stokes and Root are expected to be given a breather before the Tests in July, with Dawid Malan, Liam Livingstone and Sam Northeast among those who could feature.
Front-foot no-balls are not memorable. The sundries column is the last to be interrogated on any scorecard, if ever. Yet when Morne Morkel overstepped in South Africa’s doomed defence of 191, Indian partisans roared as loud as they did at any stage during the romping eight-wicket win. For white-ball foot faults mean free hits; a guarantee of seeing one of their adored wallopers go for gold.
It was a moment emblematic of the fanaticism the follows this team everywhere, capable of overwhelming anyone. In this match, the Proteas were just that: smothered. The top seeds’ Champions Trophy exit was sealed by a skittish batting effort, punctuated by three run outs ranging from desperate to comical through the course of a collapse in which they lost eight wickets for 51 runs. Breezy half-centuries from Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli then completed the thrashing with ease.
A perfect South London morning brought sizable expectations, this the first of two quasi-quarter-finals to resolve who qualifies for the final four. The sudden‑death nature – after both teams unexpectedly lost their previous fixtures – added the heat needed for a tournament so far hindered by relentless rain.
After being put in, South Africa’s slow but serviceable start was their only period of parity with Kohli’s men. With run-rate pressure building, their angst showed between the wickets. In the space of five balls, captain AB de Villiers was found short for a single that wasn’t there before Faf du Plessis burned David Miller as both batsmen dived for the same end – some 22 yards from where the bails were being removed. It was ugly. The innings never recovered, all five bowlers contributing to the wickets column in a consistent and disciplined display.
Afterwards, De Villiers accepted the performance “ranks right up there” – or down there – in the lengthy list of defeats his nation has suffered at the pointy end of major tournaments over the past quarter-century. “Through soft dismissals we lost our way and that was the part for me that hurt the most,” the captain’s assessment. “A few mistakes cost us badly.”His opposing number underlined a marked improvement in the game’s third discipline as the driver behind the victory, coming after Sri Lanka upset their campaign on Thursday. “We had a complete performance in the field,” Kohli said. “This was something that we required. Before going out we had a chat and in the huddle I said that I wanted everyone’s intensity to go up.”
He added praise for the difficulty posed by his bowlers from the outset. While Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock’s opening partnership reached 75, it never came at better than four runs an over.
The former was the first to go when MS Dhoni showed he has lost nothing with the gloves, snaffling a fine low catch from the bowling of Ravichandran Ashwin. A half-century was tallied by the latter, but he departed an over later when Ashwin’s spin twin Ravi Jadeja brought a delivery back through the sweeping left-hander’s gate.
Following the pair of run-outs it was the turn of India’s seamers to cash in, Jasprit Bumrah trapping Andile Phehlukwayo with a hooping outswinger before Bhuvneshwar Kumar found the edge of Kagiso Rabada and Morkel with consecutive classy deliveries. Predictably, the innings ended with another mid-pitch mix-up some 33 balls short of the full allotment.
In reply, India were able to play within themselves, knocking off the runs with 12 overs in hand. Dhawan top-scored, slapping an imposing 78 at the top of the list, allowing Kohli to do as he does best with an unbeaten 76. He was there at the end with the veteran Yuvraj Singh, who finished the game with a massive six over midwicket, much to the delight of the capacity crowd, who were chanting in unison for exactly that.
The opener played the more distinctive of the innings, on multiple occasions pulling to the rope with a compact and powerful swing. By now far behind in the game, there was little South Africa’s seamers could do. Meanwhile, Kohli has now reached 50 in four of his past five innings, nearing his top gear at the perfect time.
To reach the final at this same venue next Sunday India will need to overcome Bangladesh on Thursday at Edgbaston. Using history as a guide, having defeated their easterly neighbour in all but five of their 32 meetings, they will go in strong favourites. With Pakistan facing Sri Lanka for the right to play England in the first semi-final on Wednesday, three of the four teams who remain will be from the subcontinent.
South Africa are once again left to once again ponder what might have been. They will do so while remaining in the country rather than returning home, continuing their tour of England with four Tests at the conclusion of the Champions Trophy. That will hurt, and it should.
It is impossible to overstate the fresh sense of purpose that has accompanied the entire British & Irish Lions squad south from Christchurch to Otago. Not many sides conquer a strong Crusaders team with something to spare and the result on Saturday had two significant consequences. Not only do these Lions have more belief in themselves but New Zealand’s worst nightmare is in danger of materialising.
From a New Zealand point of view all was relatively normal before the weekend. The touring team had been struggling to make an impression, the local media were in full wind-up mode and the Crusaders and the Highlanders were about to treat their visitors to a double shot of southern discomfort. Suddenly Warren Gatland is on the offensive, even publicly querying the legality of Super Rugby scrummaging, and the mangy, jet-lagged Lions of last week have morphed into completely different animals.
It is not too much of an exaggeration, listening to some of the whinging about the performance of the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, to suggest sections of the New Zealand rugby community appear rattled. A referee prepared to apply the laws? A hard-nosed away team with decent line speed, aggressive but disciplined forwards and excellent tactical kickers? None of this is remotely illegal but, for some reason, the Lions are now being accused of trampling across the beautiful game.
There was a glorious moment at the press conference in the Lions’ team hotel on Sunday when a Kiwi inquisitor asked Gatland about his team’s meagre return of two tries in three tour matches. “How many have we conceded?” Gatland retorted, quick as a flash. Cue a lot of chin-stroking. These Lions have shipped only four tries in their first 240 minutes in New Zealand yet focusing on that side of the ledger is considerably less popular.
Of course Gatland’s team need to improve their strike rate at some stage but, as Graham Henry observed on radio at the weekend, there is more than one way to win a game of rugby. The beauty, ugly or not, of Saturday was the huge improvement in physicality and forward control that squeezed the Crusaders at source. Keep progressing on both fronts over the next 10 days and the All Blacks will have a stiff challenge on their hands at Eden Park on Saturday week.
The Crusaders, remember, boasted six All Blacks in their pack alone yet, aside from one dominant scrum, trailed in second in most key areas of the game. With slightly more precision the Lions could have scored two or three tries in addition to Owen Farrell’s four penalties. In the back five of the scrum, in particular, Gatland is spoilt for choice. Maro Itoje or Alun Wyn Jones? Peter O’Mahony or CJ Stander? Sam Warburton, Sean O’Brien or Justin Tipuric alongside Taulupe Faletau? With the All Blacks trio of Kieran Read, Dan Coles and Jerome Kaino either sidelined or short of recent rugby, it is far from guaranteed New Zealand will win all the meaningful collisions.
Add to that the ability of Conor Murray and Farrell to pen opponents deep in their own half with judicious kicks out of hand and the Lions really will be tough to beat when their final passes become more accurate and their attacking rhythm improves. “I thought we played some excellent rugby,” said Gatland, refusing to accept the Lions are a negative bunch with little to recommend them. “It’s only the third time in their history the Crusaders have scored only three points in a match and both of the other occasions were away from home. That team’s been together for only a week and this is the sixth hotel we’ve been in since we’ve been in New Zealand. We made 13 line breaks, I didn’t see any negative rugby.”
In terms of the scrums Gatland was similarly bullish: “I felt they had one scrum where they had some ascendancy but on the whole we scrummaged pretty well. I’m a little bit surprised such a huge amount has been made of the scrum. I thought the referee did a good job. If you look at the numbers elsewhere, I thought we dominated in every other area: lineout, territory, possession, carries, line breaks.”
It probably did not help that Monsieur Raynal was the official with the whistle in Chicago when Ireland defeated New Zealand last autumn; either way, the Frenchman’s dislike of the pre-scrum engagement common in Super Rugby did not concern Gatland.
“The law says there must be a small gap but they don’t play to the law of the game. So Super Rugby sides tend to scrummage illegally if that’s the case,” he said. “The scrum’s not going to be a problem for us. I think our scrum will be very strong by the time we come around to Test time.”
Who starts in the Test midfield remains a fascinating debate. For all the promise of the Farrell-Jonathan Sexton axis on Saturday it would be no surprise if Gatland prefers a Farrell-Te’o-Davies combo at 10, 12 and 13, with George North and Liam Williams on the wings and, depending on Stuart Hogg’s fitness, one of Jared Payne, Leigh Halfpenny or Anthony Watson at full-back.
“We’ve got lots of options; we’ve just got to get the right ones,” Gatland said. “I’m sure there will be a lot of difference of opinion in final selection and that’s going to be the challenge for us.” In terms of collective belief, nevertheless, the 2017 Lions grow stronger by the day.

Sam Warburton says he will not lead the British & Irish Lions into the first Test against the All Blacks on Saturday week unless he truly believes he is worth his place. The Welsh flanker concedes his inclusion is not yet certain and he “may not be ready” unless he has a storming game against the Highlanders on Tuesday.
Warburton has played only 66 minutes of rugby on tour, having strained an ankle in the opening quarter of the opening game. He is finally fit to return to the side but says he will not hesitate to advise Warren Gatland, the head coach, not to pick him if he struggles to match the form shown by Ireland’s Sean O’Brien and Peter O’Mahony in the 12-3 win against the Crusaders on Saturday.
“I’ll be honest with Gats and Gats will be honest with me,” Warburton said, after the squad’s arrival in Dunedin. “If I play Tuesday and I still feel I’m a bit undercut, then I might not be ready for that first Test. I’ll be perfectly honest with Warren: if I feel I need more games, then I’ll tell him I don’t feel ready. If I don’t need any, then I’ll obviously let him know that with a good performance.”
Warburton has long been among the most selfless of captains but he accepts he has played insufficient recent rugby to be a first Test certainty. “I definitely need more games,” the Cardiff Blues forward said. “I knew that coming into the tour. I’ve received this role as tour captain but I know there’s every chance I might not even get involved in that first Test. Maybe that would be the situation or maybe I could have a blinder on Tuesday and feel absolutely fine. If I’ve made the Test, then that would be a bonus for me but there are three Tests to get selected for so the first one is not the be-all and end-all.”
His honesty is to be applauded but invites speculation as to who might be involved should he not feature. The Lions may also have to soldier on without the full-back Stuart Hogg, who is due to see a specialist to check the facial injury he sustained when his room-mate Conor Murray’s elbow inadvertently caught him in the first half of the Crusaders fixture. With Ross Moriarty (back spasm) and Jonathan Davies (concussion protocols) also unavailable, Gatland has opted to play CJ Stander at No8 alongside Warburton and James Haskell, with Jared Payne and Dan Biggar also fit to resume at No15 and No10 respectively.
The Test prospects of, among others, Anthony Watson, Liam Williams, George North, Ben Te’o, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola, George Kruis, Maro Itoje, O’Mahony and O’Brien have probably been enhanced by their absence from the midweek lineup. The All Black backline trio of Waisake Naholo, Malakai Fekitoa and Lima Sopoaga all start for the Highlanders but three other internationals – Ben Smith, Aaron Smith and Liam Squire – will sit out the game along with five players due to represent the Maori against the Lions this Saturday.
Gatland says the Lions will not necessarily put out their optimum Test XV but Warburton confirms internal squad competition is intensifying. “Now we’ve all had a game it feels it’s audition time for the Test series. You know they’re going to start putting their Test team together pretty soon.” He also admits to feeling momentary panic when injury hit in the opening fixture. “It was about 15 minutes into the game. I was thinking: ‘Oh no, this can’t be happening.’ It was sore but I’ve had a few bumps now and I tend to know when it’s serious.”
Murray, who sustained a dislocated finger in the win against the Crusaders, has meanwhile made clear the Lions will not be resting on their laurels. “A couple of days ago we lost and there was criticism,” he said. “Now we’ve won, people will probably be bigging you up. But we won’t fool ourselves. There is stuff we did, a few slip-ups or turnovers, that the All Blacks would finish off. Because we won doesn’t take the pressure off.”

L’Equipe is running a poll on its website at the moment, giving readers the chance to put themselves inside Didier Deschamps’s head and select a full squad of 23 to take to the World Cup next summer. Around 300,000 have duly sifted through the long list and picked out their favourites in every position.
Unsurprisingly, Antoine Griezmann scores highly, included in more than 99% of the voters’ selections. Not so far behind, chosen by more than 97%, is a player who did not win his third cap until Friday. Kylian Mbappé has been included on the strength of his explosive season as football’s latest golden boy, on the assumption that he must be a natural at this level too.
This freakishly talented 18-year-old was largely kept in reserve for France’s recent doubleheader of a friendly against Paraguay, followed by the shock World Cup qualification defeat in Sweden, when he sprinted on for a late cameo but did not really have the opportunity to make an impression.
Perhaps he will get more of a chance to show what he can do against England on Tuesday – and the desire to see Griezmann playing just off Mbappé as the attacking spear of a new-look France is understandably enticing – but, all of a sudden, there is an urgency about the agenda that buzzes around the topic of the new generation. Is it time to push for change?
Is the moment right to shake up the side that is still largely built on the components that took France to the final of Euro 2016? Those questions lurked in the shadows of the postmortems after defeat in Stockholm, as the French tried to figure out how on earth they have squandered top spot in Group A.
France had the game, marked by fabulous finishing, under reasonable control as they pressed for a winner in the closing stages, but it was turned on its head at the death. Sweden’s players were overjoyed as they scalped France with a brilliant, opportunistic, stoppage-time strike. Hugo Lloris, who had presented Ola Toivonen with the chance to find an unguarded net from half a pitch away, looked as if he wanted to eat his own gloves as some kind of penance.
World Cup qualification is suddenly a more stressful operation than France had in mind. Lloris was profoundly apologetic. Deschamps was stern-faced and straight-talking as he laid out the requirement to win all of their remaining games.
How quickly the tone of conversation has changed. The next few months for France were supposed to be about fine-tuning, about evolving, about Deschamps prising himself away from his loyalty to tried and trusted players to unleash the prodigies in their place. There is such demand to see the new wave fast tracked into the first XI. The seemingly unstoppable trajectory of Mbappé, the silky touches of Thomas Lemar and the darting dribbles of Ousmane Dembélé make strong cases to be the present rather than the future. They already look revved up and ready to go and Deschamps is under pressure to weigh up how he balances what they offer compared to an older generation that he trusts.
In Sweden, for a game Deschamps (rightly) assumed might pose physical and tactical challenges, the France manager was reluctant to be too bold. Having already integrated exciting full-backs in the Monaco pair Benjamin Mendy and Djibril Sidibé, Deschamps chose more conservatively in attacking positions, mindful that the young whizzes further forward might not track back or be as diligent as a more experienced option. But Moussa Sissoko? Really? Having spent a season as an expensive spare part at White Hart Lane, he struggled to match the intensity of the toughest group game between the top two.
Such are the decisions Deschamps wrestles with as he tries to sensibly manage the integration of the new wave. Sissoko and his season in the shadows or the vibrant prospect of Dembélé? Olivier Giroud, with his weird blend of not-quite moments and an excellent scoring rate – 17 goals from his last 17 starts for his country, including a piercingly swiped volley in Sweden – or the wonderkid Mbappé? Dimitri Payet, their star of the Euros, who has found some form again after a mid-season dip, or the purposeful bursts of Lemar?
France are spoiled for choice, but those choices are not that straightforward. It is a dilemma of sorts: loyalty versus audacity. That topic has been put into sharper focus now that the World Cup qualification scenario has changed. Only group winners take a guaranteed ticket to Russia; France are behind Sweden on goal difference, with four games remaining.
How long is the life of a team? The question was posed by a French journalist, Vincent Duluc, in the aftermath of the quirky defeat in Sweden. Deschamps is not about to abandon the Euro 2016 team, which has formed the basis of this qualification campaign. But the fresh faces are ready and waiting to seize the opportunity. How they handle the friendly against England should give the manager even more food for thought.
A school of thought insists that it is unhealthy to crank up the hype train’s lever so it approaches speeds worthy of a Shinkansen. But … but. Christian Pulisic. Christian Pulisic! CHRISTIAN PULISIC. Christian Pulisic.
If there is hope when the US face Mexico at Estadio Azteca on Sunday night, it lies on the 18-year-old’s small but sturdy shoulders. Hard to conclude otherwise after the 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Trinidad & Tobago on Thursday in Colorado.
This is a roster replete with decent players capable of getting a team to the second round of a World Cup finals, and one step farther if the draw’s kind. Pulisic, though, even so early in his career, is the only one who looks like he’d belong in the line-up of a top-10 nation, a side that expects to reach the semi-finals.
Of the two outfield regulars with the biggest reputations, though only 29, Michael Bradley appears to be settling into a role where he is more shield than sword, disrupting the opposition rather than defining the flow of his own side’s attacks. Substituted after 61 minutes on Thursday, Clint Dempsey subjected his coach, Bruce Arena, to that famous Deuce glare, eyes boring into his target’s soul like an electric drill bit.
That surely reflected natural frustration at missing an ideal opportunity to grab the goal that would bring him level with Landon Donovan at the top of the US’s all-time scoring chart. But it’s tempting also to see it as a symbolic moment, a scene stemming from the pathos of a player on the way down who knows he’s ceding his status as the key forward to a team-mate roughly half his age.
Pulisic scored his second goal of the game a minute after Dempsey trudged off. And like the former Premier League man in his prime, it was a move that showed him to be both an exuberant creator and a clinical finisher.
Forced to pick between the two, it’s not a hard choice. Given that both tend to roam all over the final third, making Jozy Altidore’s selection important because his more static style provides a fulcrum for attacks, Arena may well have to make a decision. The US have only ever won once in Mexico, a 1-0 friendly victory in 2012. Overall, El Tri have won 23 of 26 home games against their rivals. Starting with all three forwards would seem hubristic.
Arena said on Thursday that he intends to make changes for Sunday’s match. In the high altitude of Mexico City, on short rest, it would appear logical to put the 34-year-old on the bench and go with the hotter feet of the Borussia Dortmund player, who has seven goals in 15 international appearances, five of them coming in eight World Cup qualifiers.
“He’s ahead of his time - he gets the ball he’s super comfortable on it, he’s never ever panicking, you see him when he gets inside the box he stands his defender up and the world is his oyster. He’s special, these guys don’t come around very often,” said Tim Howard, the US goalkeeper.
Will Mexico try to intimidate him physically, as T&T tried as did Panama before them? “If I were any team that played us I’d certainly target him. Not sure he’d win a street fight but he’ll always get stuck into a tackle, he’s not afraid. He’s a big boy, plays in the Bundesliga, he knows what it’s about,” Howard said. “But he’s not afraid and that’s huge for us. Because you look at him, he’s not the biggest, not the strongest, teams are always going to come in and try and get stuck in to him.”
The highest-profile encounter in Concacaf’s Hexagonal qualifying phase is in one way also the lowest-pressure for the visitors. Students of the fixture’s history, as well as the relative positions of the teams, could only conclude that the Americans are highly likely to lose.
Given the forgiving nature of the group, which sees the top three teams automatically reach Russia while the fourth faces a play-off against an Asian side, losing on the road will not be fatal to American prospects as long as they keep winning at home.
Mexico beat Honduras 3-0 on Thursday while Costa Rica and Panama shared a goalless draw. The US win lifted them to third in the standings, six points behind Mexico in first.
Mexico have conceded only once in five Hexagonal games. Arena’s team was unconvincing enough at the back, especially out wide, to merit a sense of foreboding about what might transpire in the Azteca if the favorites are at their incisive best. “We know that we are taking on a very difficult opponent, but they should think the same way about us,” the Mexico coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, told reporters.
Pulisic, though, has uncommon self-assurance as well as remarkable talent. “They’re a good team and they’re not easy to beat at home so it’s going to take a lot, but I think the guys we have, the confidence we have, I think there’s no reason why we can’t do that,” he said.
Eoin Morgan had tipped the raucous Eric Hollies stand here to be one of England’s chief assets before their encounter with Australia. As the captain signalled the charge that would eventually dump their rivals out of the Champions Trophy, the army of assorted bananas, gorillas, Mexicans and Nintendo characters duly responded.
A burst of rain had forced a break in proceedings at 3pm. With Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Joe Root all departed after a breathtaking surge from the Australia attack, England’s 35 for three from six overs had left the mood only slightly less dank than the weather; a chance to send Steve Smith’s men back to the joys of their contract dispute at home was in jeopardy.
But upon returning to the middle, Morgan lit the fuse from which the Hollies – and Edgbaston as a whole – would explode. He cracked Mitchell Starc’s first two deliveries through the covers in fearless fashion and, with it, ramming home the point that his England side are no longer the types to be cowed when faced by a canary-yellow onslaught in one-day international cricket.
Ben Stokes’s violent, unbeaten 102 will doubtless hog much of the limelight, but Morgan’s 87 in their breakneck stand of 159 was pivotal to this win. He was named in the week by Paul Farbrace, the assistant coach, as the standout central figure in England’s one-day revival and, as he flayed Australia’s bowlers, it felt simply the latest slab of evidence.
Morgan came into the side eight years go as an outlier: a 360-degree cavalier in a team made up largely of roundheads. After a spell when he reined it back a touch – and even found his place questioned after a dip in form and the thorny Bangladesh tour saga – he is back at the peak of his powers as a batsman, while his mandate as leader has swelled.
With he and Stokes nailing down the coffin of Australia’s soggy campaign in a flurry of boundaries, before the captain’s eventual run out, it was Aaron Finch who had the unfortunate stationing in front of the Hollies. The opener enjoys playing England, against whom he has made four of his eight international hundreds, but the repeated chants of “Finchy’s going home” may have taken the edge off a touch.
With Finch and Australia dispatched, agonising over Roy’s spot will doubtless fill some of the time between now and Wednesday’s semi-final in Cardiff. Having averaged 6.73 in eight one-day innings this summer it is fair to say England have entered the territory where they lose little but face in making the switch to Jonny Bairstow’s previously glowing bat.
Bairstow has history of thriving when parachuted in, and even Roy’s electric out‑fielding – demonstrated by the pop-up-and-reclaim boundary catch that removed Glenn Maxwell in front of Edgbaston’s most famous stand –would be more than compensated by the Yorkshireman’s equal prowess. The one unknown is how he goes against the new white ball at the top level.
While Roy’s trough has been an unshiftable headache of late, Morgan will be heartened by his bowlers. They turned Australia’s launchpad of 181 for three, at the now double-the-score mark of 32 overs, into 276 for nine from 50, and largely backing up their performance against New Zealand on a pitch offering less.
Smith had described England’s bowling strategy as predictable before the match, claiming it to be half the battle won already. The other, and more important, 50% is dealing with the ball once it leaves the bowler’s hand. Though his gaggle of fast-mediums shipped runs, Mark Wood and Adil Rashid shone brightly.
Wood’s career-best four for 33 from 10 overs – an England record in the Champions Trophy – was reward for a bowler who once doubted he would return after three ankle operations. That the troublesome joint is seemingly holding up and his pace remains are encouraging signs for the knockout stage to come and the small matter of the Ashes tour.
A maiden five-wicket haul is the next box to tick off on the Durham quick’s CV, but with the pelts of Hashim Amla, Kane Williamson, David Warner and Smith hanging on his wall already this summer, the curious folk that have stared solely at the statistics and not recognised the potential of Wood’s attributes are evaporating fast.
Rashid’s four for 41 was startling in its discipline. No boundaries were shipped from his 10 overs and 28 dots wracked up as Australia’s batsmen floundered against his googly. Hollies, the Warwickshire great who inflicted Don Bradman’s final-innings duck with the wrong ’un, would doubtless have nodded in approval.
The England support drew unfavourable comparisons between their oldest rival in international football and San Marino, suggesting, impolitely, that Scotland were inferior to Europe’s whipping boys. Below the belt, but given their team’s problems against a committed but limited side it was not an occasion when England were in a position to revel in supremacy despite extending their unbeaten qualifying record to 35 games courtesy of Harry Kane’s injury‑time equaliser. The visitors were passive in the face of a ferocious Scotland start and, despite improving to take a degree of control, another illustration of Joe Hart’s weakness on his left-hand side, when failing to get close to Leigh Griffiths’ first free-kick, and a subdued display in the final third showed the strides England still need to make. It needed the introduction of Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling to finally stretch a shattered home side.
Barring a remarkable upturn in fortune in the final four matches, this painful draw may well have curtailed Scotland’s World Cup qualifying prospects and Gordon Strachan’s hopes of leading his country to its first major tournament since 1998. “Scotland’s staying home,” as the England fans cruelly, bluntly but accurately put it. As the reaction to the final whistle testified, with Scots on their knees on the pitch and in the stands, it should have been so much better, a turning point in a campaign that has flickered only sporadically. Griffiths’s outstanding free-kick double put Scotland in sight of their first Hampden win over England since 1985, when Strachan was playing, but regardless of their inability to hold out, and lack of attacking options, their performance and commitment should silence the debate over the manager’s future for some time yet.
Southgate raised a few eyebrows by giving Jake Livermore his second start in an England shirt. Although he and Eric Dier struggled with the intensity and aggression of their Scotland counterparts the West Bromwich Albion player left his manager with no cause for regret. His range of passing impressed, he posed one of the few threats to Craig Gordon’s goal and he was the one barking instructions and leading the team when Scottish pressure was at its height. His selection, however, underlined the limited options that were available to Southgate in seeking to protect his defence, with Livermore and Dier the only natural choices for central midfield in the match-day squad.
Given the scrutiny on the behaviour of England supporters before the game, and the criticism that flows when it does cross the line, it is only fair to report when they do get it right. Southgate had reminded the travelling support of their responsibilities as ambassadors for the country. The message was heeded. A minute’s silence for the victims of the Manchester and London attacks was impeccably observed by all and there was no repeat of the cringe-worthy songs aired at recent internationals. The Scotland taunt of “Jimmy Saville, he’s one of your own” was greeted by the bewilderment it deserved. The two sets of supporters even applauded each other after the final whistle.
Strachan sprung a surprise by recalling Christophe Berra to Scotland’s back-line for the first time since the 3-0 loss to England in November but also by reverting to a three-man central defence with Kieran Tierney on the left. The formation restricted the Celtic full-back’s ability to support the Scotland attack but enabled Tierney to demonstrate the awareness, intelligence and timing that attracted so many admirers during his season with Brendan Rodgers’ invincible side. Tierney, left, who only turned 20 on Monday, was instrumental in containing Marcus Rashford and denying space to England’s front line but was unfortunate to collide with Stuart Armstrong when Oxlade-Chamberlain broke the deadlock. A genuine talent.
As the past few weeks on the election trail have shown, a campaign rarely runs in a straight line. What seems certain one day can look unlikely the next and a few days after being tipped to go through the rest of the tour without securing a victory the Lions not only defeated the previously unbeaten Crusaders but gave New Zealand some reasons to be fearful.
One disappointment for the Lions, which will kick in after the euphoria and relief of a win they needed with the majority of the side likely to start the first Test, was that they did not adorn it with tries. They created chances but a mixture of poor decision-making, a lack of understanding and slack passing under pressure cost them from the opening minute.
What mattered, though, was the result and the manner of the victory. The strong set pieces complemented by resourcefulness at the breakdown, an accurate kicking game and a suffocating defence that maintained its chokehold despite a backline reshuffle in the first half will keep New Zealand’s analysts up for a few nights.
The Crusaders failed to score a try for the first time since April 2015. The conditions were no aid to passing movements but they had not been in Auckland three nights before when the Blues stretched the Lions defence until it snapped. The home side showed the expected intent in possession but the Lions closed down space so quickly that the Super Rugby favourites became jammed up in a congested midfield.
Even when the Lions kicked long and the receiver had time to launch a counterattack the tourists were quick to deter the long pass, leaving a run or a kick as the only options. Even from set pieces, which were at times under so much pressure that a kick offered relief, the Crusaders struggled to move the ball beyond the second receiver and were cramped for space.
They created two half-chances, George Bridge shoved into touch in the first half after a cross kick and then failing to gather Jack Goodhue’s improvised kick from a scrum, but otherwise the Crusaders were mute as an attacking force. They struggled to please the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, at the scrum, penalised for not staying square and engaging too early, but they were more perturbed at what they felt was his connivance at the Lions encroaching beyond the feet of the hindmost player as they rushed up in defence.
With French officials in charge of the final two Tests, the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, is sure to use media conferences to put pressure on Jérôme Garcès and Romain Poite, officials who were not swayed by home pressure during the 2015 World Cup when they took charge of England’s group matches against Wales and Australia.
Raynal was in charge when New Zealand lost to Ireland in Chicago in November and, while the Top 14 may have become the most mind-numbing of the major leagues in Europe, French officials are arguably the world’s best, refereeing what they see with consistency. Unlike most, they tend not to provide a running commentary, making it harder for players to test their tolerance thresholds.
The Lions conceded seven penalties, a marked improvement on Wednesday, when Liam Williams was sent to the sin-bin for taking out a player in the air for the second time. This time the Lions waited for the catcher to hit the ground before moving in. The kicks from Conor Murray were precise and Israel Dagg even proved suspect under the high ball.
Murray, like his half-back partner Owen Farrell, made a significant impact. Farrell moved into the midfield, operating at centre when Jonathan Davies failed a head injury assessment, with Jonathan Sexton coming on at fly-half. It gave the Lions the opportunity to see the pair in tandem and they benefited from another happy accident when Anthony Watson replaced the injured Stuart Hogg at full-back and he unnerved the Crusaders with his pace and elusiveness.
Watson is an option at full-back for the first Test but the priority in midfield has to be to play Farrell where he is at his most commanding. That is at fly-half, which would mean Ben Te’o and Jonathan Davies linking up again in midfield. Davies, like Leigh Halfpenny and Dan Biggar on Wednesday, showed that the Lions are not playing Warrenball, keeping the ball alive at every opportunity. It may not be the tiki-taka rugby New Zealand have come to cherish but it looks sure enough to prevent a landslide.
Matt Wallace has learned to trust those with a hunch. The finest endorsement for those who believed in the 27-year-old will arrive on Thursday morning when he makes his major championship debut, at the US Open. A year ago, Wallace was enjoying the most fruitful spell of an unremarkable career, winning three times on the Alps Tour, where first prizes occasionally approach £10,000. There was also a meeting with Chubby Chandler, the influential agent, when Wallace attended the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth as a spectator.
“This is freaky,” Wallace says. “It was the first time I’d ever met him. He said: ‘You know what, Matt? You are going to be playing here next year.’ I said: ‘Shut up. I’m on the Alps Tour, I have to play Challenge Tour, win things there … how am I even going to get close?’”
Wallace did tee up in the European Tour’s marquee English event having benefited from two things: his own ability and another demonstration of confidence, this time from Keith Pelley. It was the Tour’s chief executive who invited Wallace to last month’s Portugal Open where he opened with a 63, won the tournament and thereby earned full playing status.
“I spoke to Keith at Wentworth,” says Wallace. “I wrote him a letter of thanks, he got that and came to see me. He said: ‘I really appreciate the letter.’ I was like: ‘Well, I really appreciate you changing my life.’ He said: ‘You are exactly the reason why we give invites. You showed you could take your chance when we gave you that invite.’”
Wallace’s earlier periods on the road provide insight into a division far removed from the US Open, for which he earned a place from a play-off at international qualifying. The field at Erin Hills will compete for a prize fund of $12m (£9.4m). For Wallace, there was the distribution of a business plan to potential sponsors so that he could collect even some of the minimum £17,000 per year needed to play on the Alps Tour.
“I always felt like if I was able to go to events, I could win and make a living,” he says. “That’s how I spoke to people; some took an interest, others didn’t. I only had a couple of people helping me and you would have a certain amount of money to last five or six events. After that, I had to pay my own way so that was tough.
“Even in the year where I won six times, it was great but not significant or life-changing money and I was having to pay a lot of stuff off with what I won. I was getting sponsorship, maybe £5,000, so from there on I was paying with whatever I earned.”
Wallace is clearly confident but self-deprecating about his route to the top. “My parents are PE teachers, my whole family is very sporty. I was very good at pretty much all sports. I played really high-level cricket, football and rugby. I didn’t play golf seriously until I was 18.
“From 18 my head was on the wrong way, I worked for Hollister and was out partying all the time. I changed that when I was 20 when I had this thought of: ‘What am I going to do when I’m 30? I have nothing.’
“I wanted to go to America and get my degree. I did that on a scholarship to Jacksonville State and went there for a year. I was at the wrong university; I was the No1 there, won events, helped their ranking then got called into the England first team. I thought it was all going in the right direction but I still wasn’t any good. I was just playing with what I was given, talent, and that was it.
“I always managed to score and get it round. That helps me now. I wasn’t that good but I could and can play from positions others aren’t used to because I’ve been in those situations. I’ve changed my technique, because I had to, and I’m a proper golfer now. I’m quite confident standing next to anyone on the range and hitting shots.”
Wallace’s development is fascinating on two counts. That he is a prolific winner – the eventual tally on the Alps Tour last year was six – sets him apart from others, regardless of where those successes took place. At 27, and having turned professional in 2012, he is also relatively late to the high-level party. Wallace regularly doubted experiences like this “best six months of my life” would ever transpire. “I have worked really hard for years but over the first couple, I didn’t see much happening with my game,” he says.
“I didn’t see any purchase or any outcome which suggested I was going to be a professional golfer. I spoke to a few of my friends about giving it up at the end of 2013. I was busy writing a new CV. In hindsight, working hard wasn’t the right thing; I had to work a lot smarter.
“At the end of 2015 I changed coach after being in position a few times on the Alps Tour but not winning. It wasn’t mental; I felt great every time I was in position. It wasn’t nerves. Under pressure, my technique wasn’t holding up. I worked on my technique, made that a lot better and now have a great team around me.”
That coaching switch led to the widely respected Matt Belsham overseeing stunning improvement. Among Belsham’s other pupils is the world No8 Alex Noren. “This is a guy who I idolise,” says Wallace of the Swede. “His work ethic and his technique are brilliant. He isn’t completely happy with the way he swings it so there is a grey area where he is winning but he is always working to get better. That’s where I am because I never had great technique and it’s technique that gets the ball to go where you want it to.”
Chandler delivered a “told you so” message as Wallace lifted the trophy in Portugal. “I’ve taken so much confidence from someone of his stature telling me I was going to do all right,” says the man from west London. He will cherish Erin Hills more than most.
Barely a month ago, the final whistle was set to blow on David Beckham’s long-held dream of launching his own professional football club in Miami, the glitziest of American cities.
What was to have been a lucrative retirement project for the former England captain appeared thwarted by a series of broken stadium deals, the snail’s pace of Miami’s complicated political machinery and resistance from locals keen to block progress of Beckham’s investment group.
Even the bosses of Major League Soccer were losing patience with the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star. Don Garber, the league’s commissioner, pointedly remarked in April that at least 12 other cities were chasing a prized franchise and their own ticket to the top table of American soccer.
Beckham, however, was always the master of the game-changing moment. Just like a trademark curling free-kick from his playing days, a simple vote from county leaders this week secured a welcome victory, one that restores life to the stalled venture and nudges Brand Beckham closer to the bright lights of South Beach.
“Our heart is to be one of the best franchises in Major League Soccer and a great neighbour, partner and leader here for the kids that are playing soccer in this community,” said Tim Leiweke, Beckham’s friend, fellow investor and chief negotiator for the $500m (£391m), privately funded project.
“Major League Soccer needs Miami just as much as Miami wants Major League Soccer. Our hope is within the next several weeks the league will accept Miami and the Beckham ownership group.”
The crucial development was the approval by Miami-Dade commissioners to sell a three-acre parcel of county-owned land in the Overtown neighbourhood to the Beckham team, which also includes the music and television entrepreneur Simon Fuller, Bolivian telecommunications billionaire Marcelo Claure and, as of April, financier Todd Boehly, co-owner of baseball’s Los Angeles Dodgers.
The group bought the derelict site’s other six acres privately for $19m (£15m) in March 2016 and Beckham needed the final piece of the jigsaw to secure MLS approval for a 25,000-seat, open-roofed stadium. A team of league inspectors visited the site this week.
Yet despite this breakthrough, the MLS product Beckham now looks set to offer is a far cry from the one he envisioned back in February 2014. Then, on a stage beneath the tropical foliage of Miami’s Perez arts museum, Beckham confirmed he was exercising the cut-price $25m franchise ownership option that came as a signing bonus when he signed a five-year deal to join LA Galaxy in 2007.
Miami, he declared, was “the world’s most vibrant city” and deserving of a soccer team to match, which he pledged would play in a downtown stadium, possibly by 2017. “Who wouldn’t want to play in Miami? Live in Miami?” he asked, speaking passionately of fans walking along picturesque waterfront boulevards to games at a state-of-the-art stadium.
But little by little the dream began to fall apart, throttled by politics even as Leiweke worked feverishly behind the scenes to canvass support from the mayors and commissioners of the city and Miami-Dade county.
First, county politicians rejected Beckham’s proposal to build at the Port of Miami, as an alliance of cruise ship operators and dockyard workers lamented that cargo loaders and crane operators were about to be replaced by “peanut-sellers and ticket-takers.”
Then city mayor Tomas Regalado, a one-time Beckham ally, went cold on county mayor Carlos Gimenez’s plan to fill in a disused deep-water slipway and build the ground in a “grand waterfront park”. Stung by the realisation that a prime waterfront site had eluded him, Beckham announced in June 2014 that he was pausing to weigh his options.
Nine months passed before a venue next to the Miami Marlins’ new baseball stadium in Little Havana was touted, and embraced by Beckham. But he walked away “frustrated” in November 2015, after several individual owners refused to sell despite receiving offers well in excess of the real land value.
Facing an MLS deadline and veiled threat to award Sacramento the league’s 24th franchise in December, the group known as Miami Beckham United quickly latched on to the vacant Overtown site.
The move was a little too hasty for many residents of the Spring Garden historic district, a quiet, leafy neighbourhood on Overtown’s western edge that some fear will be ruined by noise and traffic if the stadium comes to pass.
Home to one of Florida’s original tourist attractions in the 1890s, Alligator Joe’s, where visitors gathered to watch reptile wrestling contests in deep pits, Spring Garden remains unspoiled from its 1920s heyday and is popular with young families.
“The human side, the effects of this stadium aren’t being addressed,” said resident Meredith Vey. “I’m not an elected official, I’m not an entertainment mogul and I’m not an athlete, I’m just a mother trying to raise a kid in my small neighbourhood. I feel we’ve been betrayed by the commissioners who have stars in their eyes.”
Another resident, Daeja O’Donoghue, said Beckham’s team called a community meeting at less than 24 hours’ notice last month and said the group “hadn’t done its due diligence”.
“I said, ‘Show me the studies, the traffic studies, the feasibility studies,’ and they had nothing,” she said. “We want proof of how this is going to affect us.”
O’Donoghue said she was also concerned that the group planned to use the stadium for open-air concerts as well as 15 or so football games a year.
Leiweke sought to allay residents’ fears: “People worry we’re going to do 20 or 30 nights of concerts and disrupt their sleeping patterns and kids. Not true,” he said. “We’re going to cap the number of concerts we do and the genre of music. We are committed to being a good neighbour, we are committed to being a good partner.”
Amanda Hand, whose house directly faces what would be the western side of the stadium, was not persuaded. “They have a lot of language like ‘we will attempt to’, ‘try to’ and ‘intend to’,” she said. “There’s a lot of aspirations and not a lot of guarantees. Aspirations are not legally enforceable.”
Celebrity-starved and economically depressed, Overtown is also not quite what the limelight-loving Beckhams had in mind when they set their sights on a life in Miami.
In 2014, at the start of the odyssey, the Miami Heat were the defending NBA champions and it was common to find Beckham in a courtside seat, or chilling with his friend LeBron James, the Heat forward who was once a potential partner in the soccer enterprise.
Beckham and wife Victoria, the former Spice Girl, were spotted in Miami more often then, eating with other celebrities at the Zuma restaurant or lounging at Soho Beach House, the exclusive club the footballer still uses as a de facto office.
Times have changed: the Heat are back among basketball’s also-rans and James has gone home to Cleveland. But there will be plenty to occupy Beckham in Miami as his as-yet unnamed franchise moves forward.
A first priority will be finding a big-name coach and well-known players who can deliver immediate success and catch up with Florida’s two other new professional soccer teams, which stole a march while Beckham’s project floundered.
Orlando City, who joined MLS in 2015, signed Brazilian World Cup winner Kaka; Miami FC, unbeaten in eight games this year in their second season in the junior North American Soccer League, are part-owned by the former Italy captain Paolo Maldini.
Beckham has said it would be “disrespectful” to speculate about his own potential players, especially because it could be four years before the team plays a game. But Peter Wilt, who launched Chicago Fire into MLS in 1998 as the franchise’s founding general manager, said Beckham’s status and connections would attract big names eager to be part of the league’s planned expansion to 24 teams by 2020.
“David has an allure that gives them an advantage at the start,” he said. “It’s a dissipating advantage as he gets further away from his playing days and celebrity status, but there’s still a something there. Working with Tim Leiweke, no doubt he’ll be smart enough and strategic enough to bring in other athletes and coaches who have that allure.”
Wilt said Beckham’s other challenge would be to make supporters feel part of the club.
“Miami is one of, if not the most difficult, sports market in the nation because of its transient population,” he said. “If he can get them emotionally connected to this team they’ll make it sustainable.”
“We thank you God, for you have truly been good to Jamaica. You have blessed us with doctor, the honourable Usain St Leo Bolt, the embodiment of sportsmanship, who reminds us of the gumption and indomitable spirt of the Jamaican people. May the vibe in the stadium bring a world of justice and love, and make your kingdom on Earth as it is in heaven. Amen.”
Major sporting events are not supposed to start with prayers from an ordained minister, impeccably observed and with righteous amens in all the right places. Yet, inevitably, it proved the perfect prelude to Usain Bolt’s 84th and last race in Jamaica.
This was an occasion akin to a religious experience, a five-hour outpouring of love and joyous exaltation from 35,000 people to the greatest athlete in their history. Salute To A Legend, they called it. And salute they did. Whether they were in the buttock‑deadening $8 wooden bleacher seats or dignitaries in the grandstand, whenever Bolt appeared the reaction was both classless and overwhelming, with roars and claps and blasts from so many vuvuzelas it sounded as if an army of mosquitoes were invading Kingston.
Afterwards the 30-year-old admitted he had rarely been as nervous before a race. It was here at the National Stadium in 2002 that he first made his name – winning the world junior 200m title as a 15-year-old by beating athletes three years his senior. And now, suddenly, it was hitting home that the circle of his athletics life was rapidly bolting shut.
Even so he had the presence of mind to treat the crowd to his greatest hits. As the athletes lined up for the 100m, he shadow-boxed like a prizefighter as the master of ceremonies stirred the crowd into greater frenzies by rattling through his achievements with a preacher’s force and certainty. Then, when the gun went off, he even made his customary terrible start, leaving his blocks with all the grace of someone with backache climbing out of his favourite easy chair. Yet at 50 metres he was ahead and away – and, as always, simply uncatchable.
His time of 10.03sec was nothing special, at least not for him. Then again, having missed more than two weeks’ training after the death of his close friend Germaine Mason in a motorbike accident – Bolt was one of the first on the scene – it was never going to be.
Afterwards he was brutally honest about his performance. “I think that was possibly one of my worst races,” he said. “My execution was poor, my start was poor as always. I think in the last bit I lost it a little. But I didn’t expect anything spectacular because I have had a lot of time off. The two weeks I missed was rough. But the people of Jamaica really came out for me, thank you for showing me your support.”
As Bolt crossed the line he was mobbed by cheerleaders and photographers as a bouquet of fireworks lit up the Kingston skyline. His lap of honour was long and delirious and he climbed into the stands to celebrate with friends and family before going back on the track to party with the Jamaican dancehall legend Beanie Man.
Of course he was never going to lose – not here in Kingston and especially not when the dice had been loaded in his favour. Any athlete who could conceivably have beaten him was put into a tougher 100m earlier in the evening, which was won by his compatriot Yohan Blake, the London 2012 silver medallist, in 9.97sec.
Afterwards, when Blake was asked whether he might fill his friend’s boots one day, he shook his head. “He leaves a size 13 shoe to fit and it’s hard to fit,” he admitted. “I try to squeeze my foot in it.”
Not everyone was as sentimental. The young South African Akani Simbine, who finished second to Blake, was asked whether he wanted to ruin Bolt’s retirement at the world championships in London in August. “That’s the plan,” he said, smiling.
Beforehand Bolt indulged the crowd with two pre-race laps of honour, one in an open-topped car around the velodrome surrounding the track, the other on foot. Then came a big bear hug from Sebastian Coe, the International Association of Athletics Federations president, who shovelled praise on the 100m and 200m world record holder and eight-times Olympic gold medallist.
“Our words, at best, can only be a small, modest contribution to the eulogies and tributes that this great man standing behind me has received,” Coe told him. “But if our words are modest, our thanks are mountainous.”
Peter Phillips, the leader of Jamaica’s opposition, the People’s National Party, was even more effusive. “You are now the greatest Jamaican of all time,” he told him. “You have set new limits for human capacity and speed and your records of performance will endure through all history.”
Not to be outdone, Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, came dressed in a Puma tracksuit and, putting his hand on Bolt’s shoulder, called him “a great man, a great athlete and a great Jamaican”.
Bolt, wisely, intends to stay as far away from politics as possible in retirement. He has already been offered a place in government and the culture and sports minister has urged him to start making “Baby Bolts” for the good of the nation. Such is his ability to unite all Jamaicans, any party he declared for would surely win a landslide.
Seven Olympic champions had come to Kingston to pay tribute to Bolt and there were victories for most of them, including Britain’s Mo Farah in the 3,000m. But it was the South African Wayde Van Niekerk who produced the performance of the night in winning the 200m in 19.84sec. That was not only a personal best and the fastest time of the year but a reminder, perhaps, of why Bolt has decided to run only the 100m and 4x100m relay at the world championships.
That, though, is a discussion for another day. This night, like so many others on the track during the past decade, belonged to Bolt.
An injury to fly-half Joey Carbery, who had two kicks charged down for tries, interrupted a win for Ireland in a Test that showed the gap that still exists between the haves and have-nots of rugby.
In truth, the USA have more than they once did: John Mitchell’s Eagles were well drilled and well lead by two overseas pros: Sale fly-half AJ MacGinty and New Zealander Tony Lamborn on the openside flank. Still, a lack of time together and semi-pros in key positions fed into familiar problems: a scrum that struggled, a defensive line that ran ragged a little too soon. Joe Schmidt’s Ireland, with two Lions starting and another on the bench, made holes and ran through them all game.
“Joey just sprained his ankle a bit,” said Schmidt. “We thought it pertinent to get him off. We don’t know what the story is yet. It hasn’t swelled too much but it was a bit tender. We’ll see how it settles and get a scan either here or once we arrive in Tokyo.”
Mitchell, a former All Blacks head coach, will leave the Eagles at the end of their summer series, which continues against Georgia next week and in a two-legged World Cup qualifier with Canada.
“We were outclassed today,” he said. “We’re disappointed, defensively we had some issues with our setting which cost us.” Mitchell also said he didn’t expect his first-choice scrum to “lose inches”, which contributed to Ireland “finding the front 50 very easy”.
In any event, Ireland had much more strength, even though they were without 11 British and Irish Lions, currently touring New Zealand. For one thing they had Keith Earls, the Munster wing who toured South Africa with the 2009 Lions. Whatever the New Jersey equivalent of the screaming ab-dabs might be, the Americans got them when Earls was carrying the ball. His team-mates noticed and he carried it often: on his wing, off it, on the end of kicks into space.
Two minutes in his marker, Martin Iosefo, rushed up, allowing space for Tiernan O’Halloran to break a tackle and put Earls clear for a 35m run to the line. Then, when Carbery made a half-gap of his own, Earls was straight through it to send a long, flat-ish-cum-forward pass out for the other wing, Jacob Stockdale, to score. Carbery converted for 12-0 on 15 minutes. Three minutes late a missed MacGinty clearance saw O’Halloran run the ball back, a tackler slip off and Kieran Marmion put Earls in at the corner with ease.
“Earlsy usually wants to get the ball all the time,” Schmidt said, “but I think after the first 20 minutes he didn’t want it anymore, he’d run it enough.”
The first US try produced a roar from a crowd above 22,000. The Newcastle Falcons lock Nick Civetta scored it, charging down a clearance from Carbery. MacGinty converted for 17-7. In prompt response, Carbery kicked a penalty to the corner and the Irish pack mauled the hooker Niall Scannell over from a throw to big Devin Toner. So go the pros.
Lamborn then made a half-break but couldn’t complete the pass. From the scrum, which Ireland pressured to keep the tired No8 David Tameilau bound and busy, came the try of the game. Marmion scooted blind and released Earls once again, and though 70 metres later the full-back Ben Cima got him, and well, Earls popped a pass out of a tumble-dryer of arms and legs for Marmion to score. Carbery increased the lead to 29-7. So it stayed to the half.
The first try of the second period took only three minutes, No8 Jack Conan touching down from a five-metre scrum drive. Carbery converted. And then there was a second charge-down of the Irish No10, this time by the Cork-born flanker John Quill. Carbery, Schmidt said with a grin, will learn from the experience.
The US then had their best spell of the game, and the roar for what might’ve been a third home try shook the stands … for a few seconds or so. Alas, replacement prop Paddy Ryan – Irish-born, employed in the Premiership with Newcastle – threw forward a long pass after a fine break from the wing Mike Te’o. Iosefo’s finish was in vain.
Ryan Matyas did get over on 54 minutes for the Eagles’ third, this time patient phase play opening a half-gap. Perhaps stung, a little, Ireland brought on the Munster wing Simon Zebo, a Lion in Australia four years ago. Although the US scrambling defense was good, another Earls break put the substitute lock James Ryan over and replacement scrum-half Luke McGrath also scored as legs tired. The final try came from a high kick to Stockdale’s wing, where the undersized Te’o was predictably outjumped. Zebo collected the loose ball to score.
On a hot, sapping evening, both teams earned their applause. After five minutes of the game, though, the same fans offered a standing ovation in honor of Robert Paylor, a lock from the University of California, Berkeley who suffered a catastrophic injury in the Varsity Cup final against Arkansas State last month. Paylor is now in rehab; a GoFundMe campaign aims to raise $1m to aid his recovery.

Alexei Popyrin is eyeing a Davis Cup baptism after becoming Australia’s first French Open junior champion in 49 years.
The third seed downed Spain’s Nicola Kuhn 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 on Saturday to become Australia’s first boys’ champion in Paris since Phil Dent in 1968, the first year of the professional era.
The Sydney-born teenager was overjoyed after also joining legends Roy Emerson, Ken Rosewall and John Newcombe as the fifth Australian to have his name added to the honour roll in the event’s 70-year history.
“There is a lot of good names. I’m happy to be part of it. It feels amazing,” Popyrin said. “Winning any tournament feels great, but especially when you win a grand slam, you feel over the moon.
Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from Wimbledon qualifying because of the muscle injury she sustained at the Italian Open last month.
Sharapova, who is coming back from a 15-month suspension for taking the banned drug meldonium, had been due to enter qualifying after rejecting a wild card. But she posted in a Facebook message: “After an additional scan, the muscle tear that I sustained in Rome will unfortunately not allow me to compete in the grass court tournaments I was scheduled to play.”
Sharapova will also withdraw from the Aegon Classic in Birmingham, for which she had been granted a wild card. She said: “I want to thank the LTA for their amazing support on my return and providing me with a Birmingham wild card, a tournament which I hope many of you will be able to attend.
“I look forward to meeting you there next year. I will continue to work on my recovery and my next scheduled tournament is in Stanford.”
Sharapova was denied a wild card for this month’s French Open and took a potentially divisive decision for the All England Club out of their hands by announcing she would go through qualifying.
Her withdrawal will prevent a potential logistical nightmare for the organisers of the usually low-key qualifying event, given the interest in her comeback.
Sharapova reached the semi-finals on her comeback at the Porsche Open in Stuttgart in May, but her return left the women’s tour divided.
A number of fellow top players expressed disapproval at the opportunities granted to Sharapova, with the former Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard branding her a “cheater” before their recent Madrid Open showdown.
Manchester United have reached an agreement to sign the Swedish international Victor Lindelof from Benfica for £30.7m (€35m). With Champions League football secured after the Europa League was added to their EFL Cup and Community Shield triumphs, attention quickly turned to reinforcements.
The centre-back is now set to become José Mourinho’s first signing of the summer after United struck a deal with the Portuguese champions.
A statement on the Premier League club’s official website read: “Manchester United is pleased to announce that it has reached agreement with Benfica for the transfer of Victor Lindelof, subject to a medical examination, international clearance and personal terms.
“A further announcement will be made once the transfer is complete.”
In the end, Harry Kane did almost everything Gareth Southgate had hoped he might. This game had gone, the visitors apparently broken by Leigh Griffiths’ pair of free-kicks, when Raheem Sterling cut inside and flung over one last desperate cross from the left and there, opening up his body in mid-air to meet the delivery as sweetly as he could, was England’s captain to guide home a first international goal in 13 months. The manager leapt into the air, his manic celebrations born as much of relief as delight. He had been at pains to point out that talent, eventually, will out. There was evidence of Kane’s pedigree in his timing.
Plucking that point from the dregs of a furious contest left the English buoyed, for all that the shortcomings of the team’s display in Glasgow will surely trouble Southgate over his summer. For Kane, the plunder was more personal. This had in effect been his audition, the fifth captain of Southgate’s tenure to date making his influence felt just as embarrassment – and a first loss to bitter rivals in more than 17 years – had beckoned. “It has ended as a special day,” he said. “To be 2-1 down in stoppage time from nowhere, getting that goal is special. We found another gear, and it feels like a good point.”
The dramatic nature of the equaliser had effectively cleansed the visitors’ performance, all the exasperation the 23-year-old forward had endured up to then on his first appearance for Southgate going exorcised at the last. That finish was Kane inspiring his team-mates as captains should, when the scenario was at its grimmest. The manager would prefer not to contemplate who will take the armband on a permanent basis just yet, concentrating as he is on strengthening the collective, but he may just have found his man. Last gasp contributions tend to have such far-reaching effects.
Kane, a forward with 75 Premier League goals to his name over the past three terms and seven in his final two outings of the season, would have expected to prosper here. After all, the Tottenham Hotspur striker found himself confronted by Christophe Berra, a player whose contract at Ipswich – mid-table in the Championship – expires at the end of the month before a summer return to Hearts. Evade Berra and there was Charlie Mulgrew, recently relegated to League One with Blackburn. Kane has prospered against better players all year, and would ease between the latter and the impressive Kieran Tierney to volley home his reward. Yet it said much about Scottish resilience that this contest had actually drifted beyond the mid-way period in the second half before he had glimpsed a proper sight at goal.
Ryan Bertrand mustered a centre to exploit momentary hesitation, the Scots apparently distracted by a substitution on their right, only for Craig Gordon to react and turn away Kane’s flashed header. That was as close as he came until stoppage time, when it had appeared even the Royal Marines, England’s saviours last weekend on the infamous “sheep dip” on Woodbury Common, could not spare them the ignominy of defeat. Southgate will delight in a point but will recognise plenty of failings from this showing. For long periods this had been a painful reminder of the truism every recent permanent England manager, bar Sam Allardyce, has learned to endure. The England team which reconvenes in the summer, most obviously at tournaments, tends to lack the effervescence they usually display in the autumn internationals, the long slog of a Premier League campaign having dulled their sparkle.
There was a sloppiness in their possession, the cross-field passes as likely to soar over full-backs’ heads as find an ally. The attacking play was prone to overelaboration, the slicker moves invariably running aground on massed ranks of rugged Scottish defence, with Marcus Rashford’s instincts forever to drift into central areas when England needed to stretch their opponents further wide. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who would eventually provide some hustle and bustle to prise the home side apart five minutes after his introduction, appeared a more natural fit in that role.
This was Southgate’s first taste, as senior manager, of a familiar issue. The Tottenham contingent, whose season had extended to five competitions, had taken part in a post-season friendly in Hong Kong since domestic duties were curtailed. Rashford, his senior career still in its infancy, has never known a season of such first-team toil. Perhaps that explained a lack of dynamism, though it could hardly be used as an excuse. The Scots, with their hefty Celtic contingent, have hardly spent the past nine months with their feet up. How this arena rocked as Griffiths threatened to pilfer the points at the death. The pained intake of breath which greeted Kane’s equaliser was one of resignation.
Even so, the visitors’ lack of efficiency with the ball will have infuriated Southgate. It also served to heighten Kane’s anxiety while that goal drought at this level, stretching back to the friendly win over Turkey last May, was still playing on his mind. The two chances that fell to the forward up to the interval were both awkward, the first born of Eric Dier’s lofted pass with Kane shinning his attempt high and wide. There was more precision to Bertrand’s exchange with Adam Lallana moments later, the Liverpool midfielder scuttling to the byline to clip over a cross, but the captain was on his heels and could not collect cleanly. Fortunately for England, his moment was still to come. “This is a day I’ll never forget,” he added before departing the arena. The captain had made his point.
Chris Coleman has always wanted Wales to focus on the future rather than basking in last summer’s success, yet with Sunday’s World Cup qualifier against Serbia taking place exactly a year after their opening match at Euro 2016, even the manager had to concede that it was impossible not to take a trip down memory lane.
That glorious, sun-drenched afternoon in Bordeaux, when Wales marked their first appearance at a major tournament for 58 years with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Slovakia, evokes so many happy thoughts for Coleman, although the moment that will live with him for ever has nothing to do with anything that took place on the pitch.
“When the national anthem started, that’s what I’ll always remember,” the Wales manager said. “Two things stand out: the respect we showed Slovakia when their national anthem was played – it was silent from us, which was great; and then with our national anthem … the noise, wow, that was unbelievable. That’s what I remember. Of course I remember the goals. But definitely, first tournament, first game, singing the national anthem – that was as good as it gets.”
Coleman would love to experience more of the same next summer but that World Cup dream will be fading fast if Wales come away from Belgrade with nothing. Trailing Serbia and Republic of Ireland by four points at the halfway stage of the qualification campaign, Wales can ill afford to lose more ground and they will be without the suspended Gareth Bale as well as Neil Taylor, Hal Robson-Kanu, James Collins and Andy King.
They remain unbeaten in Group D, yet their supporters are a little deflated on the back of four draws from five matches, especially as the lead was squandered in three games, and pessimistic about their qualification chances as a result. Coleman has picked up on that shift in the mood back home and believes expectations have changed after reaching the semi-finals at Euro 2016.
“In the last campaign we drew at home to Bosnia and it was like we’d won. This campaign when we’ve drawn it’s been like a defeat because of what’s happened between the Bosnia game and drawing in Austria. What happened in between was unprecedented, nobody thought we were going to get to those dizzy heights. You go to Austria and come back with a point and it’s a disappointing result because we’ve qualified and been to a semi-final of a tournament.
“I can’t say it has surprised me because I expected it unless we won every game in this campaign or we were top. It’s human nature that if you get so far, you expect a bit more and want a bit more. But we can’t look at anybody else. It’s down to us.
“Everybody looks at us differently and it’s been tougher – we’ve been striving for so long to be in this position where teams take us seriously and the expectation is higher. The expectation is higher for a reason – because we produced.”
With Coleman maintaining that this will be his last campaign as manager the prospect of Wales not qualifying for Russia has raised questions about his position and whether he could decide to stand down sooner rather than later, maybe even after the Serbia match if things go badly.
“I don’t like talking past the next game, it’s never served me right in the past,” Coleman said. “But I’ve had to mention it [now] because people think: ‘If we don’t get the right result or performance, what’s my future?’ But there’s another 12 points after that and if it’s second place that we’re chasing, but it’s doable, then I’ve got to absolutely go for that with everything that I’ve got. Why wouldn’t I?
“I’m still optimistic of getting a result in Serbia. We are four points behind with five games to play. Are we good enough to win three or four on the bounce? I don’t have to tell you the answer to that. Whether it’s Serbia away, it doesn’t matter. I know we can get a result because we’ve gone to hard places before and done it.”
There is no getting away from the fact that Bale’s absence is a huge blow and with Robson-Kanu and Ben Woodburn, the young Liverpool forward, also missing it leaves Wales short of attacking options beyond the Burnley striker Sam Vokes. Coleman, though, remains positive and believes Wales have “enough to touch those right buttons again” providing they are in the right frame of mind.
“Hopefully we’ll have that mental sharpness and focus so that if we’re in the lead we can hang on to it and see it out, because that’s what’s been missing in this campaign,” he said. “We’ve not seen the job through for 90 minutes. We’ve got to a certain level and then just lacked a bit of concentration. That’s what we’ve got to get back.”
Serbia (probable) Stojkovic; Ivanovic, Obradovic, Nastasic; Rukavina, Matic, Milivojevic, Tosic; Kostic, Tadic; Mitrovic
Wales (probable) Hennessey; Chester, Williams, Davies; Gunter, Allen, Ledley, Richards; Ramsey, Lawrence; Vokes
Martin O’Neill has warned his Republic of Ireland players not to take a backward step as they strive to reach next year’s World Cup and knock one of their main rivals, Austria, out of the running. The teams face off in Dublin on Sunday in a match of pivotal importance in one of Europe’s most competitive groups.
At the halfway stage Ireland are level on points with the leaders, Serbia, and four points ahead of both Austria and Wales. Having won 1-0 in Vienna in November, they welcome the Austrians knowing that a draw would probably be more helpful to them than to the visitors. But O’Neill does not want such thoughts to infect the minds of his players and has urged them treat this as a make-or-break battle like their famous duel against Italy at Euro 2016, when Robbie Brady’s goal earned passage to the last 16.
“That night we knew at the very beginning that we couldn’t rely on anything else so had to go and win the game – sometimes that focuses you and stops you thinking negatively,” said O’Neill. “This is a big, big game for Austria and we want to be positive. I don’t think we could have gotten these points we have on the board without being positive so let’s not fall into our shell.”
Injury deprives Ireland of two of their best players, Séamus Coleman and Shane Long, but O’Neill is grateful that Jon Walters has recovered from the knee problem that had threatened to rule him out of action too. The Stoke City striker says he is “completely fine” after training without pain for two days this week and he is expected to start in a central role up front, possibly as captain.
Walters has become a folk hero in Ireland in recent years thanks to his full-blooded bravura and O’Neill believes the player is particularly deserving of a place at the next World Cup, having helped propel Ireland to Euro 2016 only to miss most of his team’s matches there because of injury.
“Jon was a talisman for us in European qualification but picked up injury before the competition started and only played little bits here and there so it’s nice to have him on board because he’s been terrific for us,” said O’Neill. “He’s a great warrior and, more than that, he has great ability and that helps us immensely.”
While Walters seems certain to start, O’Neill has several other several selection riddles to solve. Most notably, a manager who has a tendency to spring surprises in his lineups must decide whether to keep faith with Darren Randolph in goal even though the 30-year-old lost his starting place at West Ham towards the end of the Premier League season and looked shaky during last week’s friendly win over Uruguay. The alternative is Sheffield Wednesday’s Keiren Westwood, who has not featured in a competitive international for five years.
O’Neill also has a difficult choice to make in central defence, where John O’Shea, Richard Keogh and Shane Duffy are vying for the two slots. Additionally, there is the question of whether to include the experienced Glenn Whelan in central midfield despite the appeal of a dynamic duo consisting of Harry Arter and Jeff Hendrick. O’Neill must decide whether to deploy the creative talents of Wes Hoolahan from the start or preserve the 35-year-old for an introduction from the bench if required.
Those might seem like relatively innocuous problems to Austria’s beleaguered manager, Marcel Koller, who has been shorn of seven players for a match that risks being his last in charge in the event of defeat. Absences in defence may force Austria to a formation featuring a back three, while their offensive threat looks weakened by the loss of the suspended Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic and injuries to Sparta Prague striker Marko Janko and RB Leipzig’s Marcel Sabitzer. Worryingly for Koller, he has been forced to rely on his fourth-choice goalkeeper, Heinz Lindner, who is reputed to be vulnerable in the face of robust forwards such as Walters.
Republic of Ireland (probable) Randolph; Christie, O’Shea, Duffy, Ward; Arter, Whelan; Brady, McClean, Hendrick; Walters
Austria (probable) Lindner; Hinteregger, Prödl, Dragovic; Lazaro, Alaba, Junuzovic, Baumgartlinger, Klein; Burgstaller, Harnik
Paris on Tuesday is the final stop in John Stones’s inaugural season as the most expensive English defender in history and a reunion with Kylian Mbappé would represent a fitting end to it. The campaign has vindicated his move to Manchester City, the England international insists, but there is also regret over what the Monaco forward and others denied him under Pep Guardiola: the first silverware of a fiercely scrutinised career.
“Very disappointed,” is Stones’s blunt assessment of his first season at the Etihad Stadium. “Purely because we had such a great team and we set the bar high. Disappointed on a personal note too as we all believe we can do better and in games I should have done better, which is what I want to improve on for the future.
“On another personal note it was unbelievable for me. My journey from the start of the season to the end, I’ve just changed completely as a player and grown off the pitch as well, which is what I went there to do.
“Pep’s message is to improve every day. That’s why I went to City and why I wanted to work with Pep – he’s got the best out of the players he’s worked with and won a lot of trophies. Ultimately, that is my goal – to become as good as I can be and win as many things as I can. As a kid I played in tournaments and my team won trophies but in my professional career I’ve not won anything yet. I’m hungry to get a medal around my neck.”
The Champions League did not satisfy Stones’s appetite as City exited in the last 16 against Monaco, for whom Mbappé scored home and away in dominant performances against Guardiola’s exposed defence. “He was clinical,” recalls the 23-year-old. “He’s a top player in the making and we’ll be looking to stop him. If I’m on the pitch I’ll definitely be looking to do that. He’s still new to the international game and I’ve been lucky enough to play a few games now.”
Stones’s struggles against the French teenager brought further criticism of City’s £47.5m acquisition from Everton, but also staunch support from Guardiola, who claimed the central defender had “more balls than everybody” in the Etihad press room after the 1-1 draw against Liverpool that followed. “It’s definitely helped to know he’s got my back but it’s not just him, it’s everybody at the club,” says Stones, who rejects the suggestion his English record price-tag has been a burden. “The money in football nowadays is frightening and I never thought I would have gone for a transfer like that but ultimately it’s not down to the player,” he says.
“It doesn’t really make it harder. I’m very fortunate to be bought for that amount of money, almost flattered by them paying that much, and I want to do that justice.”
An analysis of Stones or an interview with him rarely passes without reference to a playing style that separates the Barnsley academy graduate from the English norm and attracted Guardiola on his arrival at City last summer. He must find the debate tiresome? “I don’t, no,” the defender says. “You have to be single-minded but listen to what Pep and his staff want me to do for the team.
“Football has evolved and you see more and more teams playing that way. I’ve had some nice messages after games from players who I haven’t spoken to before. I won’t name people and drop them in it, but I’ve had messages from opposition strikers and defenders saying that they respect and love the way I play, telling me to keep doing it and not to change the way I am.
“To hear that is great for me and has given me a lot of confidence. It’s a classy touch from them as well. They don’t have to go out of their way to say that. Hopefully, when I get towards the end of my career I’ll be able to do the same for up-and-coming players and people who you can see could become top players. I’d like to be able to have that bit of class.”
Stones will wear No5 for City next season but the switch to a more traditional defensive number from 24 does not reflect a change in style, more a tribute to its previous owner, Pablo Zabaleta.
“I spoke to Zaba before I took the shirt,” he says. “I thought it was the right thing to do, not ask for his permission but his blessing almost. We joked about him winning silverware wearing that number and hopefully I will do it justice.
“That’s the ultimate thing: doing the shirt justice for me and for my team.”
If anyone should know what to expect when the Lions play in Dunedin on Tuesday it is James Haskell. Five years ago he was living in the beachside suburb of St Clair and playing for the Highlanders as part of a personal odyssey which also involved stints in France and Japan. Choosing the road less travelled was the best decision he ever made.
Far from being the death of his international career, it has proved the route to ultimate fulfilment. The 32-year-old flanker thought his treasured Lions dream had evaporated, only to receive a late call last month as a replacement for the injured Billy Vunipola. No visiting player will be keener than Haskell when he revisits the Forsyth Barr Stadium.
Even now he remembers the “amazing” experience with genuine affection. “It’s a time of my life I look back on really fondly,” Haskell said. “I loved playing Super Rugby and I was really welcomed by everyone. I threw myself into the culture by going diving, fishing, shooting and boxing and I loved the whole place. When I left I missed it.”
His dozen games in a Highlander jersey also taught him much about the Kiwi rugby psyche which his Lions team-mates would do well to listen to. He suspects many visiting players, for example, underestimate the all-consuming nature of the national sport. “Everybody in New Zealand wants to be an All Black; they just have such a desire to have the ball in hand and to play touch from a very early age,” he said. “In the UK rugby’s down the pecking order.”
Haskell was reassured to discover, even so, that not all New Zealand rugby players are supermen; they just play a different type of rugby. “My experience of Super 15 dispelled a few things I was led to believe from the media, from TV and from watching highlight reels.
“ I think to a man we’re probably bigger than these guys but athletically they’re a different kind. In New Zealand there’s always another cab off the rank. Just when you think you’ve seen the best thing, there’s another one. Super Rugby is a very different league but it would be interesting to see what would happen if you put some of those teams in the Premiership. Kingsholm on a February rainy day in the mud, for example, with relegation and everything else involved.”
The Lions, either way, have less than a fortnight to finalise the best way to derail the All Black machine and Haskell believes the solution is no secret. “Against New Zealand you have to be super-disciplined, very direct in what you’re doing. You have to play for the full 80 minutes and you have to execute everything at the top of your game. What they do is not rocket science: it’s executing with speed, intensity and accuracy. They consistently do it for 80 minutes. Turn your back and they’ve got the skill set to punish you. Everyone knows what to do but it’s another thing getting out on the field and delivering it. It’s not about containment.”
Dominating physically is clearly another prerequisite – “You have to impose yourself on these teams; I’m not saying it’s the go-to but it’s certainly part of what we’re trying to do” – and Haskell, despite having four staples inserted in his head after being caught by a team-mate’s elbow during the warm-up to his Lions debut against the Blues on Wednesday, is not about to settle for an indefinite midweek role. “The moment I got here I wanted to compete for a Test spot like everybody else. I’m just not built to sit here and have coffees, I want to push myself as hard as I can.”
If, furthermore, there are young players at home wondering if a spell playing abroad might be worthwhile, Haskell advises them to pack their bags immediately. “I’m a firm believer that you only learn from playing and really testing yourself. If you’re sitting around not doing anything, get a plane ticket and come and play wherever you can.” As his career has conclusively demonstrated, those who venture the furthest from their comfort zone often gain the most.
Full to bursting with kids this England side may have been but they snatched the most remarkable of wins against Argentina with a try at the death by Denny Solomona. One of 10 debutants, Solomona combined brilliantly with two others to steal a game that had twisted this way then that and seemed certain, at last, to have been settled in Argentina’s favour.
It was a suitably stylish way to round off one of the most outrageously entertaining second halves of recent times. A win against a team as accomplished and familiar with each other as the Pumas represents quite the statement from England’s youngsters, who were marshalled superbly by George Ford. The fly-half can be inconsistent but when he’s as good as this he should be pulling on the red of the Lions.
“I thought it was an incredible game of rugby,” said Eddie Jones. “In the end I think we had 10 new caps on there and to show poise and stick to what we needed to do in the circumstances was an unbelievable effort from the young guys.”
The match was never less than entertaining but it took a while to reach real excellence. It came as no particular surprise that Argentina were the quickest to settle, their props squeezing England’s youngsters to win a penalty at the first scrum, which Nicolás Sánchez just missed from an angled 50 yards. The hosts also pinched the first England lineout, from which possession they scored the first try, in only the eighth minute: on the blindside, Sánchez’s wicked chip sat up nicely for Emiliano Boffelli to touch down on his debut.
Such a madcap match was made for back-row forwards, and England’s flankers, Mark Wilson and the 18-year-old Tom Curry, had excellent debuts, the former in particular disrupting Argentina possession. But it was Ford who proved the master. The timing of his passes kept the Pumas guessing and, best of all, he was as confident as a king off the tee, helping himself to a tally of 23 points, including a try of his own, whose conversion was the only kick he missed.
His first two penalties drew England back to within a point, before they took the lead on the half-hour. If Ellis Genge was having a rough time in the scrum, his work in the loose was as excellent as ever. He was on to a loose ball on his 22 and away. Then another debutant, Alex Lozowski, further stretched the Pumas with a superb run before Ford’s fine cut-out let Marland Yarde loose against the tight-head prop. No contest.
Argentina finished the half stronger, scoring 10 points in the four minutes before the break. Another loose England pass was punished when Jerónimo de la Fuente sparked a passage of brilliant interplay down the left, setting up Tomás Lavanini for a monstrous drive at the line and Argentina’s second try. Sánchez’s penalty on the stroke of half-time earned the Pumas a 17-13 lead.
In the second half, though, both teams sharpened their act to spectacular effect. England responded with 10 points in the first seven minutes to take the lead again. Ford’s 42nd-minute penalty was followed by a turn of excellence from Henry Slade, who dummied clean through Argentina’s midfield and sent a chip to the corner, where Jonny May touched down. Ford converted from the touchline once more.
And so Argentina took a turn for the brilliant. Solomona came on for his much-anticipated debut and immediately found himself in the middle of a whirlwind. Martín Landajo broke past Curry and inside Solomona from a scrum to set up De la Fuente for Argentina’s third, before they struck for their fourth with the best of the lot.
Matías Orlando broke through Solomona’s tackle deep in his own half and took the ball deep into England’s. Solomona managed to get back, only to be turned inside out by Boffelli, who then sent Joaquín Tuculet to the line.
The match turned again in the final quarter. A remarkable 55-metre penalty on the angle by Ford drew England back to within five, before England’s maestro closed the deficit entirely with a try of his own. He combined superbly with Piers Francis – another making his first England outing, back from a spell in Super Rugby – to streak clear of the cover for England’s third. Remarkably, he missed the conversion: the game was tied. If ever one deserved to be so exquisitely poised for the final 15 minutes, it was this.
First, it seemed England might close the game out as they pressed on Argentina’s 22. But of all people Dylan Hartley, the skipper on 85 caps, became the latest to spill the ball in a ferocious tackle, and Argentina broke out through Orlando and Ramiro Moyano, setting up Juan Martín Hernández for the coolest of drop goals. Argentina’s game, surely …
No. Up stepped Solomona, and not for anything so mundane as defensive work. This time he showed what he could do with ball in hand. Jack Maunder, yet another debutant, combined with Francis down the right to set Solomona stepping, smashing and streaking away through the Pumas defence to steal an extraordinary match at the death.
“We came here to win 2-0 and that’s what we are going to do,” said Jones, teeing up next week’s match in Santa Fe. England may still be an inexperienced team then, but after this remarkable win they will feel a whole lot less so.
It probably should not be a shock that new chapters in the extensive back catalogue of glorious Scottish sporting failures are still being written in 2017. How familiar this was; how painfully familiar.
Cold analysis should surround Scotland’s concession of two horrendous goals, the kind that undermine international campaigns and cost managers their job. The goals scored by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Harry Kane were horribly reminiscent of the type Scotland have continually shipped in recent times. Another blunt truth is that a point against England probably is not going to be much use in this World Cup quest, the Scots having been trounced in Slovakia and failed to beat Lithuania at home. They need so much more, plus favours, between now and the campaign’s conclusion.
Nonetheless, offering such comment feels harsh. In two glorious moments, Hampden rejoiced in a manner once customary but not witnessed since the win over France in 2006. Before old failings returned, Scotland dared to dream of a first victory over England here since 1985.
“That was the one, at 60 years old, that could have been the best result of my footballing career,” said Gordon Strachan. “You can’t question the personality or character of those players. That was beyond the call of duty at times. They pushed themselves to another level.” He said the draw had felt like a defeat.
Strachan had followed his instinct that a three-man defence was the most viable means to halt a powerful England front four. That backline – of Christophe Berra, Charlie Mulgrew and Kieran Tierney – contained only left-footed players. The Scotland starting XI featured seven.
Good news for the future surrounds the fact that Tierney, a full-back at Celtic, is one of the finest Scottish prospects to emerge in years – if “prospect” is still applicable, that is. He endorsed his rising status with an excellent display.
If it was understandable for Strachan not to express hope that his team could make a mockery 5-1 odds on the grounds of what talent was at his disposal, harping back to the 3-0 loss at Wembley in November made little sense. “The performance that night gave us a lot to be optimistic about,” said Strachan in his programme notes. “We were the better team for large periods of the match.”
If the media indulged in this kind of gross exaggeration as routine, managers like Strachan would have plenty to say about it. The reality in London was that Scotland were not efficient either in defence or attack, leading to a match that was over with half an hour to play. England barely emerged from first gear during their canter to victory.
A further glance back to Strachan’s pre-match comments was necessary within three minutes. “That ‘get intae them’ theory of playing football is gone,” insisted the manager. “They are well in control of their emotions.”
Strachan’s captain, Scott Brown, was not on message. A reckless tackle on Dele Alli with only 150 seconds played earned the midfielder a booking. This was an archetypal case of playing to the gallery by an individual who has never been famed for fine tackling. Brown was later woefully lame as Oxlade-Chamberlain breezed past him en route to opening the scoring.
And yet, Brown’s rush of blood aside, so much of Scotland’s opening was impressive. They pressed and harried their visitors to the point where England were rattled for the first 15 minutes. The only problem was that Scottish energy was not reflected in chances created. An attempt by Lee Griffiths from 18 yards, which did not trouble Joe Hart, was the sum of Scotland’s early play.
Scotland’s problems soon resonated. Robert Snodgrass was toiling badly, with Stuart Armstrong failing to impose himself on proceedings and James Morrison virtually invisible. Griffiths was a chronically isolated figure in attack for the remainder of the first half, during which Kane should have afforded England an unassailable advantage.
Perhaps having sensed England’s fragility, Scotland roused the home crowd by starting the second period with considerably more composure and confidence than they had ended the first. Griffiths later emphasised that with two free-kicks worthy of the highest praise; he was already running away in celebration before both hit the net.
Strachan’s emotion was soon different. He slammed a water bottle to the ground in disgust as Kane finished at the back post. A football nation, for once, knew precisely how he felt. “I’m too tired to think about the future,” Strachan said. “I just want to get home.”
Ben Stokes left Edgbaston with praise from both captains ringing in his ears following the destructive unbeaten 102 that sees England head into their Champions Trophy semi-final on Wednesday glowing with confidence and Australia on the next plane home.
Stokes, in registering his third one-day hundred, continued a rich run of form that has carried through from his time in the Indian Premier League.
The Rising Pune Supergiants made him the tournament’s most expensive overseas player with a £1.7m deal but for his national team captain, the all-rounder is priceless.
“His potential is through the roof,” said Eoin Morgan, whose 87 helped pile on 159 with Stokes for the fourth wicket. “His batting was exceptional. He was very calm with the crease, very relaxed and all those games he’s played really came to the fore.
“He was outstanding. I think the IPL auction proved [his value]. He’s always looking to influence the game, with bat, ball or in the field.”
Australia’s Steve Smith, who captained Stokes in IPL, said: “I don’t like to put tags on guys but he’s a fantastic player and getting better. He played a fantastic innings, took the game on and was hard to stop. He’s an incredibly strong lad and hits the ball very hard – those are the kind of things you want in white ball cricket.
“I think he’s probably developed some smarts and the timing of his innings. I’m sure the more he plays, the better he’ll get. He’s in exceptional form at the moment.”
On his team’s exit following two washouts against New Zealand and Bangladesh before this rain-affected loss, Smith said: “I thought we let ourselves down a little bit today. When you’re playing in a big tournament for your country, you need to step up and get the job done. We weren’t able to do that on this occasion.”
Morgan credited his bowlers for keeping Australia to 277 for nine, Mark Wood and Adil Rashid picking up four wickets apiece. It is something that has given the captain greater belief that he could be lifting the trophy at The Oval next Sunday.
He said: “The last two games, we’ve proved that we can peg sides back regardless of where they’re at going into the last 15 overs, which probably two years ago was a bit of a car crash for us. So that’s a huge improvement. And our batting just seems to thrive.”
Morgan also said Jason Roy’s position will now be reviewed before Wednesday’s semi-final in Cardiff after 51 runs from eight innings this summer. Jonny Bairstow, who has opened previously for Yorkshire but not at international level, is waiting in the wings.
“It’s unfortunate that Jason didn’t get runs today. We’re obviously three games in and we’ll take a couple of days to have a look at what our best team is for the semi-final. We revisit it every game – everybody’s position,” he added.
Gareth Southgate described Harry Kane’s 93rd-minute equaliser against Scotland as a huge and significant show of character from England, one he believes will propel the team on the “enormous journey” needed to deliver on a World Cup stage.
England were facing the end of a 34-game unbeaten run in international qualifiers and a first defeat at Hampden Park since 1985 when Kane, Southgate’s captain for the day, salvaged a draw in stoppage time. The substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had given England the lead only for two stunning free-kicks in the final three minutes of normal time from Leigh Griffiths to transform the contest.
Gordon Strachan, the under-pressure Scotland manager, said the 2-2 draw felt like a defeat and was “probably the most emotional game of my managerial career”. Victory would have revitalised his country’s chances of reaching Russia next summer. Instead the point leaves them languishing fourth in Group F with four matches to play.
England’s manager, by contrast, accentuated the positives from a late recovery that he claimed went some way to answering doubts over the national team’s character. He also spared Joe Hart criticism for Griffiths’ free-kicks, the first beating the England goalkeeper to his left, the second to his right, claiming credit belonged to the Celtic striker for executing two outstanding finishes under extreme pressure.
“It was a huge moment for the team,” said Southgate of Kane’s first international goal in more than a year. “The questions around this team centre on character, they centre on our ability to withstand events that go against you. That’s what we have shown, that we are a team that is never beat. The clock may run out but you never stop. Today we didn’t stop and a real quality finish got us the point. Is it what we wanted? No, but the chain of events was remarkable.
“Anything is possible in football. You can get moments where someone produces an unbelievable moment of quality and then the crowd is on a huge high. We had that conversation this week and it is important. It’s fundamental to being a top team but it is only one small step in that direction. We can still improve in all areas but nevertheless it was a significant moment.”
Gary Neville, on pundit duties for Sky, faulted Hart’s positioning for the Griffiths free-kicks but the Manchester City keeper, who has spent the season on loan at Torino and appears destined to leave the Etihad Stadium this summer, was spared public condemnation by his manager. Southgate said: “I need to look at it again. They were two brilliant finishes. Firstly you don’t concede free-kicks in those positions. I couldn’t understand the first free-kick or why [Scott] Brown escaped a second yellow card. If you concede those free-kicks in international football you run the risk of being punished by a moment of quality.”
He added: “Joe has been excellent this week. I thought he showed excellent composure with the ball at his feet and he’s been one of the outstanding leaders in the group this week.”
England remain comfortably on course to reach for the World Cup, maintaining their impressive sequence of qualification, but Southgate admitted the team must improve to finally make an impact at tournament level. “It’s clear, our record is three knockout wins in 25 years,” he added. “We have a young team emerging, there was a 19-year-old and a 21-year-old in the front line today who haven’t played in many occasions like this. There is great potential, a desire on their part and a desperation to do well for the shirt but of course we’ve got an enormous journey to go to match teams that have won World Cups and European Championships with players who perform in the Champions League regularly.”
Strachan was shattered at being denied the finest result of his Scotland reign, one that would have transformed his team’s prospects in the group. The Scotland manager said: “It feels like a defeat, aye. One pass, one header, it goes somewhere else and we’ve won the game.
“It was like a middleweight fighting a heavyweight out there and I am so proud of the way we kept coming back. That could have been my best result as a manager and I’ve been lucky enough to get some good ones against Man United and AC Milan.
“The power and strength and speed of England is phenomenal. To keep coming back was brilliant. To have that free-kick at the end of the game when you’re tired by Griffiths was brilliant. They pushed themselves to another level to get a result for their country.”
With lunch approaching on the second day, Surrey appeared to be squandering the extremely strong position they had built on the first. Their final five wickets had fallen for 46 in the first 70 minutes to be bowled out for 399 and, with Surrey’s bowling as wayward as their batting had been witless, Essex had ghosted to 55 without loss. We know by now that Alastair Cook gorges on short stuff and Surrey’s attack, particularly Mark Footitt, were spoiling him.
But Sam Curran pinned Cook in front with the final ball of the session. Cook left looking perplexed, perhaps surprised to receive a ball that challenged him. Surrey went with a spring in their step and returned with purpose, finding three more wickets, with Footitt, swapping ends, producing a beauty to have Tom Westley caught behind. Gareth Batty pinned Nick Browne in front and Dan Lawrence cut him straight to point. Essex were 134 for four.
All of which made this a fine time for Ryan ten Doeschate’s first century of the season. This was a fine, brisk innings (his 26th first-class century) on a ground, with short boundaries, a fast outfield and good track, that is mighty hard to defend on.
Ten Doeschate is mighty hard to defend against, too: tactically, he might be the best captain in the land, and – with this a case in point – he fights fires down the order, scoring all round the wicket, running brilliantly between the wickets (is there anyone better?) and punishing anything remotely loose.
There were plenty of punchy drives, and a beautiful pulled six off Ravi Rampaul on the way to a 120-ball century. The only blemish came on 39, when he was dropped down the legside by Ben Foakes off Batty.
He guided Essex to 367 for seven, 32 behind, and shared 120 with Ravi Bopara, who looked in fine touch, smashing Batty down the ground for six, until being fooled by a nipbacker from Stuart Meaker and pinned lbw. Simon Harmer was another doughty ally before he fell in the same fashion as James Foster, caught behind off Footitt.
The day had begun with Surrey’s surprise subsidence as they were bowled out one shy of a fifth batting point that for so long had seemed a certainty.
They had arrived full of optimism that they were about to see Curran’s maiden first-class century, and a first double for Mark Stoneman. Neither was to be.
Curran’s 65 was full of verve, chutzpah and boundaries (48 came in fours) but was ended when Neil Wagner got one to stay just a touch low, and pinned him in front. Stoneman and Batty saw them to within eight of 400, only for the last four wickets to fall for seven.
Stoneman fell driving Wagner and was caught by the diving Foster for 197, a career best. Stoneman, who with 617 runs is behind only Kumar Sangakkara and Gary Ballance in the runscoring charts, has no obvious weakness. Given Haseeb Hameed’s struggles and a golden duck at Canterbury for Keaton Jennings, who has not reached 50 in 10 Division Two innings, England’s selectors might want to take note. From first slip, Cook certainly had a good view of a prospective partner.
With no play possible at Southport, the only other Division One action was in another enthralling low-scorer at Taunton, where Peter Handscomb’s half-century turned a first innings deficit of 22 into a lead of 105 by stumps for Yorkshire over Somerset. Earlier, Ryan Sidebottom had taken the 31st five-wicket haul (and 750th wicket) of his long first-class career, which is due to finish at the end of the season, as Somerset posted 224, with the last six wickets worth 176.
Durham require 10 Kent wickets on the final day at Canterbury to secure their first win of the season and move into positive figures. They bowled Kent out for 236 (a lead of 212), with Sam Northeast unbeaten on 109 and career-best figures of six for 63 for Barry McCarthy, but declined to enforce the follow-on, instead batting 70 overs before declaring on 271 for six. Kent used the 10 overs before stumps to reach 35 without loss; they still need 449.
Worcestershire were frustrated by Glamorgan at New Road. Resuming on 76 for six in response to 267, two significant partnerships enabled Glamorgan to wiggle their way to 381 and a lead of 114, before Michael Hogan dismissed Daryl Mitchell to leave Worcestershire 34 for one. Jacques Rudolph made 111 and Chris Cooke 93 in a seventh-wicket stand of 158, before Joe Leach trapped both in an over. But Andrew Salter and Lukas Carey picked up the baton, sharing 124 for the ninth wicket. Salter finished 80 not out, his second career-best in as many matches.
Nottinghamshire quietly took control against Gloucestershire at Bristol. Having bowled the hosts out for 303 (with Gareth Roderick adding just eight to his overnight 88) they trail by 82 with seven first-innings wickets in hand. Che Pujara, playing his last game for the leaders, fell late in the day for 67 having shared 146 with Samit Patel.
At Wantage Road, Northamptonshire were in clinical mood against Derbyshire. They bowled the visitors out for 176, with Ben Sanderson taking five wickets, then swelled their lead from 42 to 289 for the loss of four wickets by the close, with Rob Newton making 108.
Sussex’s last pair frustrated Leicestershire at Grace Road. After Mark Cosgrove was last man out for 128 of Leicestershire’s 340, Sussex were 201 for nine. By the time bad light intervened at 6.30, Vernon Philander (69) and Danny Briggs (23) had put on 75 to take Sussex to just 64 behind.
Stuart Dallas’s stoppage-time strike earned Northern Ireland a smash-and-grab 1-0 win over Azerbaijan that kept his team firmly on the road to Russia.
Missing eight players from the squad that went to France and without Gareth McAuley after a first-half injury, Michael O’Neill’s side struggled in the Baku heat and were thankful to the profligacy of Afran Ismayilov. The visitors secured an unlikely victory when Dallas rifled in a late winner, his first goal in a competitive international, having been teed up in the penalty area by the cool-headed Jonny Evans.
Dallas’s attempt was just the second on target that his side had mustered, O’Neill seemingly satisfied to settle for a 0-0 stalemate. But late goals have become a hallmark of this team in recent years and the winner ensured Northern Ireland would remain in second place in Group C regardless of results later on Saturday night and they received a further boost when the Czech Republic were held 1-1 in Norway.
The Azeris had been shell-shocked by the Northern Irish tactics in a 4-0 loss in November, conceding three times from dead-ball situations, and the first set piece here came in the third minute. Evans glanced over from the corner and after some nervy early moments Robert Prosinecki’s defence settled into a composed unit that strung together lengthy spells of possession, yet rarely crossed the halfway line.
On one of the few occasions they did go long it produced a clear opening for Ramil Sheydaev, who raced beyond an injured McAuley only to rifle his attempt over when faced by Michael McGovern. McAuley, who had been declared fit despite sustaining a thigh injury last month, was unable to continue and that meant O’Neill had to scrap his initial tactics with the introduction of Niall McGinn.
As the visitors settled into their new system Azerbaijan began to take control, their possession creeping up to 70%, yet there was little for the Northern Irish defence to contend with. Chris Brunt had slotted back in at left-back and his foray forward almost produced a goal when a low whipped cross just evaded Liam Boyce and Josh Magennis.
The half-time interval, which arrived just after McGovern repelled Azerbaijan’s first shot on target, from Pavlo Pashaev, allowed O’Neill to tinker with his tactics again. Magennis was pushed up to the role of attacking spearhead, with Boyce behind and McGinn and Dallas occupying the flanks.
The tweak did little for Northern Irish fortunes and the noise around the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium rose once more in the 64th minute when Ricard Almeida picked out Ismayilov, who turned Brunt inside out before firing at McGovern.
The visitors were tiring and they were nearly caught on the counter following a disastrous short-corner routine, while Evans’s lunge on substitute Namik Alaskarov somehow went unpunished.
The signs that this could be Northern Ireland’s night grew when Ismayilov blazed over as he closed on goal but there was still a sense of disbelief around the ground when Dallas scored in the second minute of stoppage time. He owed much to Evans’s decision to square it to him rather than shooting and the Leeds midfielder steadied himself before firing into the corner to spark jubilant scenes among the 300 or so travelling fans, who will now have a bit more hope that they might be travelling this far east again next summer.
Slovakia are now only two points behind England in Group F, after a 2-1 win in Lithuania. Goals from Vladimir Weiss and Marek Hamsik put them 2-0 up, before Darvydas Sernas’s late consolation.
Earlier, while Scotland and England were playing out their thrilling draw in Glasgow, Slovenia maintained their push for a place in Russia as goals from Josip Ilicic and Milivoje Novakovic gave them a 2-0 win over Malta in Ljubljana. The victors remain in third. Only group winners are guaranteed a place in the finals in Russia next year.
Sandro Wagner scored a hat-trick as the Group C leaders Germany stretched their 100% record to six games with a 7-0 win over San Marino in Nuremberg. Julian Draxler’s early effort set the Germans on their way and two from Wagner and a fourth for Amin Younes put them four goals clear by the break. Shkodran Mustafi increased Germany’s lead early in the second half and Julian Brandt headed the sixth before Wagner completed his hat-trick – and Germany’s scoring – with a header of his own five minutes from time.
In the same group the Czech Republic were held to a 1-1 draw away to struggling Norway, Theodor Gebre Selassie’s first-half strike cancelled out by an Alexander Soderlund penalty.
Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick as Poland maintained their six‑point lead at the top of Group E with a 3-1 win over Romania in Warsaw. The veteran striker opened the scoring with a 29th-minute penalty and doubled their advantage when he added a second just before the hour. A second penalty from Lewandowski sealed another win for the hosts five minutes later before Bogdan Stancu scored a late consolation.
Stevan Jovetic was another hat-trick hero as Montenegro held on to second place in the same group with a 4-1 win over Armenia in Podgorica. The former Manchester City man, now with Sevilla, added to an early strike by Fatos Beciraj to secure a comfortable win for his side, while the visitors replied late through Ruslan Koryan.
Denmark did their best to keep up the pressure on Poland with a 3-1 win over 10-man Kazakhstan in Almaty. Nicolai Jorgensen put the Danes ahead and Christian Eriksen added a second from the spot after Bauyrzhan Islamkhan was sent off in the dying stages of the first half. Islambek Kuat briefly reduced the deficit before Kasper Dolberg’s 81st-minute strike sealed victory for the visitors. The results left Denmark on 10 points from six games, trailing Montenegro on goal difference.
That he might match his hero Ayrton Senna in Montreal will doubtless not have escaped Lewis Hamilton’s attention when he entered qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix, but to do so with a performance that echoed Senna’s brilliance was simply sublime. Taking the top spot at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, and in doing so equalling the Brazilian’s total of 65 pole positions, required a lap that was not only flawless but at the very limit of the unforgiving track and he delivered with a run he rightly described as close to perfection.
Already jubilant after a strong comeback from a difficult weekend at the last round in Monaco, he was left reeling when presented with a gift from the Brazilian’s family: a race-worn Senna helmet from 1987. “I am shaking. I am speechless,” he said. “The fact that I have now reached him in that area, I can’t believe it. I remember getting home from school and putting on the video of Ayrton so its strange that I’m here now with that many poles.”
He finished ahead of his title rival Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel in second, his team-mate Valtteri Bottas in third and Kimi Raikkonen in fourth, and acknowledged it had taken something special to do so. “Being that it is the most difficult season of my career racing against these two great drivers and Kimi and having us so close, pushes us all to the limit and relies on us all being perfect. We can’t be perfect but today I got as close as I could get.”
He has three poles already this season and that he would equal Senna’s total was inevitable but he did so with a lap that was more than fitting to go on par with his hero. “If I’m going to get a pole, get that special pole, if anywhere it’s going to be here,” he said.
“Coming across that line, almost holding your breath, hoping, fingers crossed, waiting, knowing that Sebastian was still on a lap, Valtteri was still on a lap. It was a good lap but you don’t want to get your hopes too much up because you’ll be disappointed if they do a better lap – but the intensity of the moment – I don’t really recall having as intense a moment.”
The scale of his achievement was recognised by the Mercedes nonexecutive chairman, Niki Lauda. “Incredible laps. Unforeseeable,” he said. “We did not expect he could go this quick. Lewis did a fantastic job.”
His consistent and quick running throughout qualifying was just the fillip he required and it was significant that he excelled on a track that shares many of the characteristics of Monte Carlo, where he had difficulty with his set-up and with putting the tyres into the correct temperature operating window.
But on the same selection of rubber at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, which has a similar low-grip, low-abrasion surface and short duration, low-speed corners, he had the Mercedes hooked up throughout. He led the timing screens in Q2 and put in a masterful quick run at his first attempt in Q3 of 1m 11.791sec. It had looked unbeatableimpossible to better but he went out again and promptly did soexactly that, claiming pole with an exceptional lap of 1m 11.459sec. His car control was fluid and while the walls in Montreal beckoned they were not even brushed.
The breathtaking run, the fastest recorded at the circuit, was not only enough to secure pole but also to allay some of the concerns of the team, who have been working to better understand their car’s performance. He was pushed by Vettel, who threw everything at his lap, but the magnitude of Hamilton’s achievement was further emphasised when the best the German could manage was a full three-tenths back.
Hamilton must now make the best of it on Sunday. He trails Vettel by 25 points in the drivers’ championship and while it is not job done, his record in Canada is strong. He has won here five times , two short of the record of Michael Schumacher, who he now trails by just three poles for the highest achieved by any driver. Hamilton has converted four of his previous five front of the grid starts at Montreal into victory and he shows every sign of being able to repeat the feat. Should he do so it will be the third time in a row and the perfect way to close what has already been an emotional weekend.
The two Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen were in fifth and sixth respectively; followed by the Williams of Felipe Massa, the Force India of Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon and the Renault of Nico Hülkenberg. Fernando Alonso again had an impressive run putting his underpowered McLaren into 12th.
The only word to describe it is bedlam. It was certainly difficult to make sense of that extraordinary finale other than to say that, ultimately, Harry Kane showed everyone right at the end why Gareth Southgate had made him captain for the day. It was the 93rd minute when Kane denied Scotland their “football, bloody hell” moment and, in the process, that feat of escapology might have helped to secure him the armband on a longer basis.
That, however, tells only part of the story on a day when both sides experienced the exhilarating joys and excruciating disappointments of football, all in the space of a few minutes. For Scotland, in particular, it was an agonising way to finish a wild and eccentric encounter. Yet England will have their own frustrations bearing in mind they had been drifting towards a relatively prosaic 1-0 win before all that late drama when Leigh Griffiths brought the home crowd to a point of rare euphoria.
The two free-kicks that Griffiths expertly placed beyond Joe Hart came in the 87th and 90th minutes and it is doubtful Hampden has ever made a more deafening roar than when the second one curled into the England net. Before this game, the Scottish FA had announced a competition to find the greatest goal in the team’s history. Both of these free-kicks could make the shortlist and at that stage Scotland were on the verge of inflicting England’s first defeat in a qualifying fixture since October 2009.
Kane, though, had other ideas and it was a remarkably composed finish in the circumstances, ensuring Southgate’s team remain in a position of strength at the top of Group F. Kane’s right-foot volley was England’s get-out-of-jail card and the story changed again. Suddenly he was running to the corner to celebrate and, all across the pitch, Scotland’s players could be seen dropping to their knees.
Their grief was understandable but when they have time to reflect they should not to be too disheartened when, to put it into context, Gordon Strachan’s starting lineup featured three players from teams that will begin next season in England’s second tier and a centre-half, Charlie Mulgrew, who had just been relegated to League One with Blackburn Rovers.
If there was an imbalance of talent, Scotland seemed determined to make up for it in other ways. They were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and could never be accused of lacking effort. They also had a captain, Scott Brown, who quickly gave the impression that whatever England’s players encountered alongside the Royal Marines last weekend was going to be chickenfeed compared to 90 minutes in his company. Brown’s first challenge on Dele Alli – a reducer, to use the old-fashioned parlance – earned him a yellow card inside the opening three minutes and he was fortunate, in the extreme, to stay on after another hack at the same player shortly after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, one of England’s substitutes, had opened the scoring.
England had taken a while to settle but once they cleared their heads of any early uncertainty they had enough of the ball in promising positions to have made it a more straightforward assignment and that, perhaps, was the biggest disappointment for Southgate. England’s supporters had started going through their victory songs just before Griffiths turned the game upside down. Scotland had been compared, unfavourably, with San Marino. Indeed, the first goal from Griffiths took place with “Scotland’s staying home” as its backdrop. Southgate was exaggerating when he described it as “a game we were in control of for 80 minutes” but his exasperation was understandable and, without wishing to take anything away from Griffiths, these were moments that will bring more scrutiny on Hart’s performances.
He is not the goalkeeper he once was and Griffiths took advantage with one 25-yard effort towards one corner and then another, from a similar distance, into the other side. For Hart, it cannot be satisfactory to be beaten from that distance twice in quick succession. They were, according to Strachan, the best free-kicks he could remember from all his years associated with Scotland. From a goalkeeper’s perspective, however, neither shot was fully into the corner.
Until those moments Scotland had so little momentum in the final third of the pitch that Griffiths, playing as a lone striker, resorted to a penalty-area dive earlier in the second half. England found it difficult to get behind the opposition defence but Kane had at least three other presentable chances, one headed off the goalline by Kieran Tierney, and another shot from Jake Livermore came back off the post after deflecting off the striker.
Oxlade-Chamberlain had been on the pitch only five minutes when he turned past Brown, moved across the penalty area, right to left, and opened the scoring with a rising left-foot shot. England looked relatively untroubled until a foul by Gary Cahill gave Griffiths his first opportunity to take aim.
Strachan reflected that he had “never heard a noise like it” when the second one went in, leaving him on the verge of what he noted wistfully would have been the best result of his managerial career. England, however, set about rescuing themselves with all the competitive courage that Southgate had talked about in the buildup to the match.
It was an onslaught once the public announcer let everyone knew there would be four minutes of stoppage time and, finally, the substitute Raheem Sterling picked out Kane. England needed their captain and it was an elegant finish given the pressure on that moment and the consequences if he had failed.
This England side are dangerous when they play with freedom, as Australia discovered in the West Midlands Colosseum. And this was a free game for them. Unlike the rest of the teams in this tournament they were already assured of their semi-final slot at the start of play, which may have helped to account for the flamboyant, carefree manner in which they sent Australia packing. This outcome means that Bangladesh will be contesting the Edgbaston semi-final on Thursday.
Needing 278 to win England were propelled by a blistering partnership between Eoin Morgan and Ben Stokes. The margin of victory was dictated by the DLS method after yet more rain in Birmingham. But at least there was a proper result this time, England winning by 40 runs. They were 240 for four with 9.4 overs remaining when play was suspended.
On a surface that invited strokeplay, especially when there was pace on the ball, this pair had a packed house salivating in between singing: “Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,” to their favourite rivals. Both left-handers were in sublime form. If anything Morgan rather than Stokes, whose innings was a model of powerful orthodoxy, had everyone gasping.
Sometimes England’s captain shimmied down the pitch to the Australian pacemen to crack the ball through the covers. At others he stayed back to smash it square. One of his sixes, an instinctive swipe off Josh Hazlewood, just kept going – defying the wind and the longest boundary. The faster Pat Cummins tried to bowl, the further the ball travelled.
The situation facing Morgan and Stokes mirrored that encountered by Bangladesh on Friday against New Zealand in Cardiff as three wickets fell early in the run chase. Such a setback would soon seem a pinprick.
There is space here to describe Jason Roy’s innings in full: a straight-driven boundary first ball; lbw to Mitchell Starc second ball, though proceedings were delayed when he misguidedly sought a review. His judgment was awry there as well. So the Roy conundrum continues. One suspects the 1922 Committee might have got rid of him by now.
Alex Hales was caught at slip off Hazlewood for a duck and Joe Root edged to the keeper just before the first interruption for rain. It was 35 for three and briefly England might have been relieved that this was a free game.
However, it transpired that three early wickets were not enough for Australia, just as four were insufficient for New Zealand against Bangladesh. When the players returned Morgan unveiled some sparkling cover drives and Stokes was soon into his stride.
The boundaries are reasonably big here but not large enough to contain Morgan in this form. He hit five sixes and could only be dispatched via a chaotic run out after 159 had been added. Stokes spooned towards mid-on and scampered for a run; Morgan watched the ball rather than his partner and Adam Zampa’s throw lit up the stumps. This was the best piece of Australian fielding amid some messy out-cricket, albeit in the gloaming of the late afternoon when it was obviously tough to pick up the white ball.
Morgan’s departure was not a great setback. Jos Buttler settled in without many alarms and Stokes with a hint of serenity – let’s hope he is not maturing too fast – had posted his third ODI century when the rain returned. By then an undercooked Aussie side had just about accepted the inevitable.
The rustiness of the Australian team was also reflected in their inability to make the most of a vigorous start when they batted. After 32 overs they were 181 for three and another target over 300 was on the horizon. But they could not capitalise. At one point they lost five wickets for 15 runs in the space of 26 balls with Adil Rashid and Mark Wood, who took eight wickets between them, their chief tormentors. In the end Australia reached 277 for nine thanks to a sparky innings from Travis Head, who was exasperated to watch the lower order come and go in the blink of an eye.
That rustiness, a consequence of the rain following Australia wherever they tread in the UK, did not appear to hinder the top order so much. David Warner had struck four crisp boundaries before he edged a delivery from Wood to Jos Buttler. Aaron Finch was less silky but eventually began to connect with the ball in his no-nonsense style. He shared a run-a-ball partnership with Steve Smith before lofting a catch to the extra cover region off Stokes, who would have one of his more profligate days with the ball.
Up went the ball into a swirling wind and it seemed to stay there long enough for the odds on the catch being taken to lengthen considerably. Morgan swivelled in a 360-degree arc, never a good sign, yet he caught the ball without fumbling or falling to the ground. No honest armchair critic from another era could profess that this was a simple catch which would have been easily gobbled up in his/her day.
Smith and Moisés Henriques, who looked devastating for 15 minutes, both fell to more straightforward catches by Liam Plunkett. Then Glenn Maxwell fell to what is regarded as a routine catch in this decade, but one which has the old-timers gasping. A Maxwell hammer off Wood headed for the Hollies Stand when Roy came into view; he caught the ball above his head, realised that his feet were going to cross the boundary and so he calmly tossed the ball in the air before returning to the field of play to catch it, a run-of-the-mill moment of brilliance in this era.
From there Australia subsided against Rashid, who was excellent for the second game in succession. Both Matthew Wade and Starc embarked on premeditated contortions to make the bowler’s job easier as Head looked on aghast from the non-striker’s end. It was a case of Australia keeping their Head while all about him were losing theirs.
Warriors forward Draymond Green made no secret of how he feels about Cleveland fans in the aftermath of the Warriors’ 137-116 loss in Game 4 of the NBA finals on Friday at Quicken Loans Arena.
“I don’t pay that much attention to anybody in Cleveland, honestly,” he said. “They don’t seem to be the sharpest people around.”
Green was the target of a hostile reception from the home crowd throughout the lopsided defeat, which denied the Warriors a finals sweep and the first perfect postseason in league history.
Chants of “Draymond sucks” were audible whenever the Golden State firebrand was at the center of the action, never more than a controversial sequence during the third quarter which saw Green nearly ejected.
A year after his antics on this floor led to a suspension for Game 5 that began the Warriors’ historic collapse, Green was again in the middle of the night’s strangest scene.
The 27-year-old appeared to be ejected when he was called for what the Cavs and Warriors thought was his second technical midway through the third quarter. He waved his arms in frustration at an official after being called for fouling Kevin Love and was hit with the tech, which would have triggered an automatic ejection.
But Green didn’t leave the court, and referees said the technical they called after Green’s foul with 1:55 remaining in the first quarter was on Kerr – though the official box score had it listed as Green.
No announcement was ever made correcting the error, not that Green was listening for one.
Kerr said he thought the first technical was called on Green – though said he thought he deserved it – and believed his power forward was going to have to leave the floor when the one was called in the third quarter.
But Green stood stoically on the floor, then egged on the crowd to raise the decibel level of their jeers toward him. He said he knew all along the first tech wasn’t on him.
“I knew because the first tech on Steve, which I didn’t understand, Mike Callahan came up to John (Goble) and asked him who was the tech on and he said Kerr,” Green said. “So I knew I didn’t have a technical foul, but still trying to figure out why did I get the second one.”
The box was changed after the third quarter to indicate Kerr had received the first technical.
The officials acknowledged after the game they did not handle the situation very well.
Goble said he thought he had verbalized to the table that the initial technical was on Kerr, but said after watching the video that he should have done a better job with that. The problem then worsened when the officials didn’t catch the public address announcer saying it was called on Green.
“The procedure is to advise the table who the technical foul is on and with the player we give a number. With a coach or trainer, we just verbalize and at that time we should listen to the PA announcer to who it is on,” Callahan said. “At that time, we did not do a very good job of listening to the PA announcer and we did not hear him announce it. I take full responsibility for that.”
Late in Game 4 last year, Green swiped at LeBron James’ groin and was subsequently given a flagrant foul. That gave him an accumulation of flagrant foul points and forced him to sit out Game 5 as the Warriors lost their chance to clinch the series, and they eventually fell in seven games.
So even though Friday was a bad night for the Warriors, at least they head home with good news.
“Thank God I get to play in Game 5,” Green said.
For the first time in its four-year history, the Women’s Tour of Britain will enjoy a grandstand finale in the centre of London on Sunday, and Poland’s Kasia Niewiadoma will have every right to enjoy the occasion after dominating the three days of racing since her solo victory on Wednesday’s first stage from Daventry to Kettering, where she carved out a 1min 46sec lead that has proved impregnable, in spite of the best efforts of her rivals.
On the toughest stage of the Women’s Tour, 122km out and back, a finish close to the church with the twisted spire, the Dutch teams Sunweb and Boels-Dolman both put the 22-year-old under pressure. Sunweb placed their Canadian rider Leah Kirchmann in an escape that lasted more than 90km, surviving to the finish, where Australia’s Sarah Roy took the stage win.
Boels-Dolman used the strength of the 2016 winner, Lizzie Deignan, to claw back the early three-woman escape, including Kirchmann, to within reach of the peloton before – in a classic tactical move – sending their best hope for the overall title, Luxembourg’s Christine Majerus, across to join Kirchmann’s group with 50km remaining.
Together with Roy and Shara Gillow, of the FDJ team, Kirchmann and Majerus raced into a lead of more than two minutes, with Niewiadoma isolated in a select chasing group that had formed during the excruciatingly tough opening phase, which alternated leg-breaking climbs and greasy twisting descents. The Pole needed the support of her team-mate Marianne Vos, but the multiple world champion and 2014 winner of this race had pulled out on Friday with a cracked collarbone after a late crash.
Deignan’s hopes of a repeat victory had evaporated after she was struck down by stomach trouble during Thursday’s hilly second stage around Stoke, losing nine minutes. Here she was prominent, but only in a team role midway through the stage, as Boels-Dolman chased the early breakaways before sending Majerus across the gap, while she could be seen later on protecting her team-mate’s bid for the overall title as the chase intensified behind.
However, the chasing group swelled as riders left behind in the early kilometres regained contact, and a chase – led notably by the Canyon-SRAM team-mates of the British national champion Hannah Barnes – brought the peloton to almost within touching distance of the escapees by the finish.
“This was one of the hardest races I’ve ever ridden,” said Niewiadoma, the under-23 European champion. “There were lots and lots of short and steep climbs; after a while I was completely done in, and then I had to think about controlling the other teams. I had to stay calm and think positively, I knew other teams would be destroyed on that course.”
In April, during the Ardennes Classics, Niewiadoma offered a taste of the form she has enjoyed this week, matching Deignan and the Olympic champion Anna Van der Breggen in Amstel Gold, Flèche Wallonne and Liège-Bastogne-Liège. Her victory on Sunday should be a clear-cut one, but that proviso has a little more bite to it than usual. The unexpected can always happen, as evidenced by a freak crash on the finish line that sent the stage winner, Roy, to hospital.
With echoes of Deignan’s high-speed accident on the opening stage in 2015, Roy sprinted up the cobbled street in front of Chesterfield’s market hall, about 10 metres in front of Majerus and Kirchmann, with the peloton breathing down their necks behind; as she raised her hands in the air to celebrate after crossing the line, she lost control of her front wheel on the bouncy cobbles, jack-knifed her bike and landed heavily on her right side.
Roy was not alone in finding Derbyshire a road of pain. Within 20 miles of the start, the race was in ribbons because of the constant steep climbs – several tackled after dead turns, which meant the riders started them almost from a standstill. The weaker riders buckled rapidly, and midway through the stage the broom wagon that picks up the stragglers had no sitting space left, with those who wanted to quit reduced to finding places in other race vehicles.
The Olympic road race champion, Katie Archibald, finished with blood streaming down her right leg and her jersey ripped, after a crash 10km from the finish. She crossed the line on the coat-tails of the bunch and dropped to 19th overall. She is now out of the running for the prize of best Briton, which has proved an entertaining subplot, acted out by the Barnes sisters, Hannah and Alice. After the younger sibling, Alice, took the jersey on Friday, thanks to a fine second place in Leamington, it went to Hannah on Saturday thanks to a strong fifth place and a fortuitous split in the peloton in the uphill finish.
The 79 survivors will be more than conscious of the recent background to Sunday’s climax in the British capital, if the feelings of the Queen of the Mountains, Audrey Cordon, are anything to go by. “I’ve been thinking about everything that happened,” said the Frenchwoman in a reference to the London Bridge terrorist attack, adding: “Racing will show that life goes on. Women can be on their bikes, be strong, and show that we know how to live.”
Crisis? What crisis? Godolphin’s all-blue silks were carried to victory in the first four races hereon Saturday as Sheikh Mohammed’s team began to move on from the shock of suddenly losing their chief executive in midweek.
One waggish bookmaker used Twitter to suggest Godolphin were “doing a Leicester City” in showing such excellent form so soon after a change in management. In reality, there was nothing particularly new or surprising in three winners from Charlie Appleby, one of Godolphin’s two main trainers in this town, and another from John Gosden, who has a sprinkling of their horses in his nearby yard.
Appleby mopped up the first two races with a couple of two-year-olds, a division in which he has had notable success this year, which may have led, indirectly, to Tuesday’s resignation of John Ferguson. Saeed bin Suroor, Godolphin’s other main trainer, appears to believe the division of two-year-olds this year has been somewhat unfair and indeed he is yet to have even a single runner from that age group, while Appleby has now had 10 winners from 15 runners. Bin Suroor vented in the press, prompting Ferguson’s departure.
Bin Suroor’s only runner on Saturday was at Haydock, so he was at least spared the sight of seeing Appleby making so many trips to the winners’ enclosure – including after the first race with the debutant Glorious Journey, who cost £2.6m at auction in October, when Ferguson was doing the bidding.
Regally bred, the colt has clearly generated quite a lot of expectation at Godolphin, prompting a reporter to ask Appleby if he was relieved about this initial success.
Denying it, the trainer replied cheerily: “Do I look like Theresa May?” For the record, there is not much of a likeness and Appleby also appears much more willing than the prime minister to address difficult subjects in public, since he responded to a question about Ferguson’s decision to quit and how it affected the organisation.
“John made his decision and felt it was the right one,” Appleby said. “I can only thank him for the help he’s given me over the years. He’s been a pleasure to work with.
“For myself, I’m employed by Godolphin to race horses and prepare them to the best of my ability with the team I have and that’s what I shall carry on doing. I’m not going to get involved in anything more than that, it’s not my department. My department is the horses and, as I said to William [Buick], his department is to ride them and, as long as we’re doing our best at that, then hopefully we’ll carry on getting the results that we see.”
Joe Osborne, appointed as Godolphin’s interim chief executive while Sheikh Mohammed considers what should happen next, was in Appleby’s stable this week, introducing himself to staff. It appears he has only half of Ferguson’s job, as the departed man was also racing manager and liaised with the trainers over running plans. With no one now in that role, the trainers are free to make more such decisions by themselves.
In Bin Suroor’s case, this is not much of a change, since it seems he decided to cut Ferguson out of the chain of command some time ago. If the Sheikh decides to appoint a new racing manager, that person will surely view the winning of Bin Suroor’s trust and support as job No1. Whatever the fairness or otherwise of the way horses have been split between the two trainers up to now, Bin Suroor, a native Dubaian who clearly has the Sheikh’s ear, can expect to get the cream in the future.
In the meantime, Appleby hopes to take a good number of his juvenile team to Royal Ascot in nine days’ time. “There’s not a standout among them but they won’t look out of place in the lineup,” he said. He also has the newly gelded Bay Of Poets for the Hampton Court, Endless Time for the Gold Cup and Frontiersman for the Hardwicke. His classy Hawkbill is likely to be saved for another day and a softer surface.
Hugh Anderson, Godolphin’s MD, said: “It’s been an interesting week but on Saturday, at the business end of the operation on the racetrack, we have seen a Group One win in Australia and a four-timer here at Newmarket. Godolphin is about great horses being prepared by excellent teams in our yards and studs. It’s about first-class trainers and winners. It’s been a good day all round and we look forward to much more success over the season.”

Roland Garros is where the Open era of professional tennis began in the fabled summer of 1968, when students took to the streets of Paris and Ken Rosewall picked up 15,000 francs, roughly £2,000, for beating his friend and rival Rod Laver in the final of the French Open.
Rosewall, who had been the youngest French champion at 18 in 1953 and then the oldest at 33, could have bought half a dozen houses in London with his winnings if he wanted to – although probably not around Wimbledon, where the All England Club matched the French purse in that year of social and political turbulence, joining the professional revolution and sending a definitive signal that the amateur sport had changed for ever.
When Rafael Nadal reaches for his 10th Roland Garros title on Sunday, and Stan Wawrinka tries for his second, the prize will be an altogether more stratospheric €2.1m, somewhere near £1.8m … at the time of writing. Turbulence is cyclical.
If life was simpler in 1968, the game was too. Coaches were what you arrived at the ground in. “We used to travel with each other, hit with each other,” Laver said. “That was as good as any coach.”
But Sunday’s final on Court Philippe-Chatrier, while resembling the collision of two small armies, should be every bit as significant and devoured with equal enthusiasm. Tennis in the 60s was played with different rackets and attitudes, perhaps, and had a different constituency but there would be no holding back change.
The Spaniard has been making history all of his career, much of it this year as he completed La Décima at Monte Carlo and Barcelona. Now, he goes for the hat-trick of 10s at the place where it matters most – to him, his fans and loyal devotees of clay-court tennis.
There have been minor rumblings that the red dirt of Europe might one day be swamped by low maintenance hard courts – just as the treasured grass of Wimbledon was meant to be under pressure, which has forced a longer lead time on the preparatory tournaments to sustain the interest of the top players – as if millions of whatever currency were not enough.
The titles still matter, though, and Nadal is desperate to move on to 15 majors and to within three of the absent Roger Federer. The Swiss cannily gave the clay season a swerve after his lightning start to 2017 so he could be at his refreshed best for Wimbledon, still his best chance of adding to his collection of majors.
Clay might not have been a graveyard for Federer but, until the arrival of Novak Djokovic to make life uncomfortable for Nadal, it was always on his list. Not any more. There is a possibility that after his 36th birthday in August he will not play here again, although his sponsors would cringe in disbelief were he ever to say so.
For now, the stage belongs to Nadal and Wawrinka. Selecting a winner might seem straightforward, given Andy Murray stretched Wawrinka’s total court time for the tournament by four hours and 34 minutes to 15 hours and 20 minutes in a brave but doomed semi-final over five sets on Friday.
Nadal, meanwhile, has sailed through the fortnight in a minute over 10 hours. To get here he did not have to go past two hours in any of his matches until the second semi-final on Friday, when he crushed the sixth seed, Dominic Thiem, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. Murray avoided the concluding bagel against Wawrinka but only because he fought like a starving dog in a final set of stupendous hitting by Switzerland’s highest ranked player.
Nadal insists, not with much conviction, that: “I don’t care about the games I lost or not, or sets or these kind of things. The only thing I care about is I have been playing very well during the whole event and I was able to win all the matches. That’s the only thing that really matters.”
Tell it to Murray, who operated at considerably more draining level and admitted his legs had gone in the end against Wawrinka. Quick wins do matter in seven, best-of-five matches – it is absurd to suggest otherwise – so the advantage is most definitely with Nadal.
However, Federer does not call his compatriot “Diesel” for nothing. Wawrinka has the genetic gift of being able to chug through a long campaign like a tank, never weakening and always potent. Some of his hitting off the ground against Murray was as hard as it is possible to strike a ball and the Scot, perhaps the best retriever in the game now that Djokovic has declined, could do nothing about the 87 winners that flew by him – and was equally grateful for the 77 unforced errors that came off Wawrinka’s some times impetuous racket.
He will not play any differently against Nadal. Nor will the Spaniard alter his game. He plays with more urgency, perhaps, all fast-twitch fibre and sweat, while Wawrinka will have his trigger ready to press on any given occasion. He will move to No2 in the world behind Murray if he wins; Nadal will stay in that slot if he lifts the Coupe des Mousquetaires again.
If confirmation were needed that history always wraps its fingers around our memories Wawrinka and Nadal are the first pair of finalists here aged 30 or more since 1969. The combatants then were 30-year-old Laver and the 34-year-old Rosewall. The younger man got his revenge that day. And the younger man this time, having lost to Wawrinka in their only previous slam final, the 2014 Australian Open, will probably do likewise on Sunday.
There was good and less good news for British tennis on Saturday. Ivan Lendl confirmed he had decided to go straight to London to prepare with Murray for his Wimbledon defence rather than return to Florida. But Dan Evans had to retire with a calf injury when leading Dustin Brown 6-3, 4-2 at the Aegon Trophy in Surbiton. “I don’t know [the extent of the injury] until I have a scan on Monday. Hopefully, it’s settled down a bit.”
Things like this are not supposed to happen. In just her eighth grand slam event, the unseeded, fearless Jelena Ostapenko produced a stunning fightback to win the French Open title here. Her 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Simona Halep, the pre-tournament favourite, who would have been world No1 had she won the title, made her the first unseeded woman to win here in the open era. At 20, she is the youngest woman to win here since Iva Majoli of Croatia in 1997, the first Latvian to win a grand slam singles title and the first person to win their first tour title at a grand slam since the Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten lifted the first of his three titles here in 1997, something he achieved on the day Ostapenko was born.
Halep will wonder how she failed to clinch victory, having led by a set and 3-0 and having three break-point chances in a long fourth game of the second set that would have put her two breaks up. The Romanian also led 3-1 in the third set but, in truth, nothing about Saturday’s final was in her hands against Ostapenko, whose outrageous ball-striking sent the ball flying past her outstretched racket time and time again as her hopes of a first grand slam title were dashed in the dirt.
It was a stunning victory for a woman who went into the French Open as the world No47, a 100-1 shot and not even spoken about as a contender. The junior Wimbledon champion three years ago, Ostapenko had never even been beyond the third round of a grand slam until this fortnight but the way she played here suggests that she will be here for many years to come.
It was also fitting, on a sultry day at Roland Garros, that she should finish it off with yet another backhand return down the line, one of 54 clean winners she struck in the final.
“I still cannot believe I am the Roland Garros champion and I’m only 20,” said Ostapenko, who showed no nerves and never deviated from her simple, devastating gameplan of attack, attack, attack.
“I know Simona is a great player and she was playing great but I kept trying, stayed aggressive and I’m very happy things turned around for me. I have no words,” she added.
In the absence of Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka, all missing for a variety of reasons, this year’s French Open had been considered one of the most open of all time. Halep, most people’s favourite after winning in Madrid and reaching the final in Rome, was expected to be able to tame Ostapenko and when she withstood an early barrage of groundstrokes from the Latvian to take the first set, the 25-year-old was on track.
Knowing Ostapenko was capable of reeling off winners seemingly at will, Halep was well aware she needed to stay patient, accept when she was outhit and wait for the mistakes, while taking any chance she had to be aggressive. She must have hoped that Ostapenko would freeze on the big occasion but instead the Latvian looked relatively relaxed. The simplicity of her game means she does not second-guess herself, as she proved in beating players such as Sam Stosur and Caroline Wozniacki en route.
She had also come from a set down three times on her way to the final and when Halep failed to take any of her three break points at 3-0 in the second set, she had hope. That translated into belief when she cracked several winners on her way to levelling at 3-3 and when she broke for 4-3, she whipped up a crowd who were already willing her on, gasping at times at the ferocity of her flatly-struck groundstrokes. Though Halep broke back for 4-4, Ostapenko broke again and served out to force a decider.
At the start of the third, Halep saved two break points and then broke on her way to a 3-1 lead as Ostapenko’s radar went astray as she sprayed the ball long and wide, her focus dipping for a moment.
However, from 3-1 down she broke back for 3-3 and then, thanks to a bit of outrageous fortune when she got a dead net cord on a backhand that had been heading way wide, the 20-year-old broke to lead 4-3.
Finally in front in the match for the first time, Ostapenko might have blinked but she held serve brilliantly for 5-3. At 30-40 on the Halep serve, Ostapenko had match point and she rifled an unstoppable backhand down the line to clinch victory, leaping in the air and turning in delight in the direction of her two coaches, her mother and the former Spanish player, Anabel Medina, who had been on the edge of their courtside seats throughout.
Both players struggled on second serve and though Halep may chastise herself for not attacking more, she rarely had the chance. Ostapenko defended well when she needed to and as soon as she got in position, or even sometimes when she was not, she slapped the ball at break-neck speed.
Halep will be world No2 when the women’s rankings are updated on Monday and she was gracious in defeat. “All the credit for what you have done,” she said. “It’s an amazing thing. Enjoy it be happy and keep it going because you’re like a kid.”
She may be a kid but the kid is a grand slam champion and if she can continue to play without a semblance of fear for as long as possible, then this may be the first of many.
It sounds like a beginning of a strange joke, only it’s not. Usain Bolt and Mo Farah really are sat in a hotel room in Jamaica discussing who would win a 600m race between them. “I think I’d have a good chance,” says Farah. “Just because of my endurance.” Bolt throws him a look of mock-horror. “So what about me, you and David Rudisha?” Farah laughs. “That completely changes it,” he replies, chuckling. “Rudisha is strong. He has run 1min 40sec for 800m. He could jog and still have us.”
Rudisha, the great Kenyan stoic, is sat between the pair saying nothing. Bolt turns to him. “What do you think?” The double Olympic 800m champion is aware that he is on Bolt’s home turf in Kingston and doesn’t want to cause offence. “Er … well …,” he begins. Everyone cracks up.
Eventually, Rudisha decides that honesty is the best policy. “I have a bit of an advantage because I do a lot of 400m and 800m in training and races,” he says. “So I don’t think you have a chance there.” Cue more laughter. But there is no comeback. Everyone accepts that Rudisha tells it as it is.
A few minutes later, with the Observer, Rudisha makes another startling admission. He believes he is in even better form than last year, when he glided away from the field to win his second Olympic gold in Rio in 1min 42.16sec – his fastest time since that glorious night at London 2012 when he smashed his own world record and was hailed by Sebastian Coe as producing the greatest moment of those Games.
“What’s changed is that I have been able to do a lot more mileage again,” says Rudisha softly. “That is something I lacked since I seriously injured my knee in 2013. After that, if I attempted long runs I would feel some pain and have to stop because I didn’t want any setbacks. But I was able to put more work in during the winter and I am really happy.”
Rudisha did not looked overly impressive when he was beaten by the 19-year-old Kenyan sensation Kipyegon Bett in Shanghai last month. However, he explains that he had a minor strain, which has now cleared, and that his recent times in training over 400m and 300m – which he always uses a benchmark for how he will perform in competition – have surprised and delighted him. “I am in a better form than last year and I feel fantastic,” he says. “I just needed to do some fine‑tuning and I think my season will be great.”
Understandably, he has tunnel-vision focus on London in August and winning a third world championships title to go with his 2011 and 2015 victories. “I am really excited to go back to the stadium where I made history,” he says.
“The UK will always have a special place in my heart. The fans always welcome me and it has a great history of middle-distance athletes, from Sir Roger Bannister to Steve Ovett, Steve Cram and Lord Seb Coe.”
Rudisha has run six of the eight fastest 800m times in history and for years looked almost invincible. But, for the first time, he admits he is struggling to come to grips with losing after his career-threatening injury. “Mentally I used to be a very strong,” he says. “I never wanted to lose. But the injury affected me. When I came back I lost a lot of races. And sometimes I would be a little bit reluctant in some races. Afterwards I’d look back and say to myself: ‘I don’t think I have done my best there.’”
Slowly, though, the magic returned. “In 2013 and 2014, when I had that pain in my knee, it was tough. I love running, but it is a short career. So no matter how hard it is, no matter how painful it is, I thought to myself: ‘If you love something you can do it.’ If it was not for the love of sport I would have struggled to come back.”
Rudisha hopes to be a role model for young Kenyans and notes with pride how kids chase after him shouting “Rudisha. Rudisha” while he is jogging around the hills of Iten.
“They are always there,” he says, smiling. “Even when we are doing track sessions they like making fun of me, saying things like: ‘You can’t beat us – we want to run against you.’ It is always fun and I love that.”
His deep enjoyment of running has now been passed to his seven-year-old daughter, Charin. “She used to say ‘No, don’t want anything to do with running. I don’t want to run like Daddy’. But now she loves it. When I am training at home we do some exercises and jog together.”
Rudisha’s father, Daniel, won a 4x400m silver medal at the 1968 Olympics. Could she be the third line of a Rudisha dynasty? “Well, she has good genes – I can say that,” he says, laughing. “But it is hard. Running is not only about talent and genetics. It is also about hard work and your spirits.”
There is nothing wrong with Rudisha on that front and, at 28, he has enough time on his side to compete at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. “I would love to emulate Bolt and have three Olympic gold medals,” he says. “Wouldn’t that be fantastic?”
Brazil’s football federation said the striker Gabriel Jesus sustained a broken eye socket during the 1-0 loss to Argentina in a friendly.
The Manchester City player was taken off the field on a stretcher late in Friday’s game after being hit by an errant elbow during an aerial challenge with club team-mate Nicolás Otamendi.
Jesus was initially given the all-clear after precautionary tests but the CBF said on Saturday that, after a more detailed examination, a fracture was diagnosed in the bone that protects his left eye.
Brazil will not call up a replacement for Tuesday’s friendly with Australia, also in Melbourne.
Andy Lynch joins a select club on Sunday. The venerable Castleford prop, who retires at the end of this season, will become the seventh player in the Super League era to reach 500 club appearances and he is in esteemed company.
Lynch, who could yet finish his career with the record for Super League appearances, joins Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Leon Pryce in one of the game’s most exclusive groups, yet there is one thing missing.
While Sinfield, Peacock and Pryce won championships aplenty during their illustrious careers, Super League glory has evaded Lynch, but, at the age of 38, his final season represents his best chance in years to win the title. Castleford are top of the table going into Sunday’s game with Warrington and are overwhelming favourites to reach Old Trafford in October. “To do it for my hometown club would be an incredible achievement for myself and for Castleford,” he said. “But we aren’t getting carried away. It’s good for the fans to be where we are but we’re taking things slowly – nothing is won at this time of the year.”
It is a commendable attitude, especially as the sense of excitement in Castleford, a town of 40,000 people, is palpable.
The club have waited their entire 91-year history to be crowned champions of England but under the commendable work of Daryl Powell that drought could end: a point not lost on Lynch, whose closest call to winning the title came when he watched from the stands as a Bradford player in 2005.
“I love this club and I will always be a Castleford fan,” he said. “Bringing a trophy home would just be a brilliant way to sign off on a career I have truly loved. To bring a trophy back to this club and this town would mean everything to me.”
While Cas attempt to remain four points clear at the top, Warrington, last year’s Grand Finalists, find themselves in the bottom four and face an unlikely battle against relegation in the Qualifiers. Lynch, however, is adamant the league leaders will not take their opponents lightly.
“We know Warrington will be tough. They’re due a good performance and this run they’re on can’t last for ever. But it’ll be a special day; just to be named among those players who’ve made 500 appearances is a great honour and something to look back on in years to come.”
Lynch’s career has lasted so long he spent his teenage years playing against Powell. If player and coach can bring the championship to Castleford it would be a fitting finale to a career that undoubtedly makes Lynch one of the finest of his era.
Tom Briscoe scored two tries to help Leeds come from behind and climb back up to third in the Super League table with a 18-16 victory at Wakefield.
The Rhinos, temporarily deposed by Hull’s win at Salford on Friday, conceded quick-fire scores to trail 10-0 after 11 minutes but ran in two tries either side of the half-time to claim their third win in four games.
Trinity responded with their third try with seven minutes left but it was too late to prevent the visitors’ third successive win at Belle Vue, now known as the Beaumont Legal Stadium.
The result brought to an end a run of six straight wins for a Trinity side that have impressed so many during the past two months. Yet Trinity took an early lead thanks to Mason Caton-Brown’s fifth try in three games and Kyle Wood’s dart over from 15 yards.
Stevie Ward replied for the Rhinos and Leeds were quickly in again as Callum Watkins put Briscoe over. Trinity held out to maintain their 10-8 advantage into the break.
Briscoe’s second try gave the Rhinos the lead for the first time and they extended their lead shortly afterwards thanks to Joel Moon. Ben Jones-Bishop replied for Wakefield but they could not find a winner.
Jake Mamo produced a man-of-the-match performance as Huddersfield Giants moved into the Super League top eight with a 56-12 win over Catalans Dragons in Perpignan.
Mamo scored four tries for the Giants, while Jermaine McGillvary and Danny Brough both crossed twice, and Aaron Murphy and Shannon Wakeman completed the scoring.
Catalans showed no sign of turning their form around –they have now won only one of their last eight matches and sit precariously in the bottom four. PA
Scotland helped their new coach, Gregor Townsend, get off to a perfect start by easing to a comprehensive victory over an inexperienced Italy side in the first Test of their tour.
Scotland made light of losing three experienced players to British & Irish Lions duty in New Zealand with the hooker, Ross Ford, leading the way with two tries after the break as Singapore hosted a tier one Test for the first time.
Townsend was delighted to get off to a winning start. “To win is important but as a coach we still have plenty to work on,” he said. “We came out with a win and that’s what we work for but there’s room for improvement next week and we are already thinking about how we can get better.”
Despite dominating for most of the opening half, Scotland were unable to shake off their stubborn opponents until they scored two brilliant quick-fire tries through their scrum-half, Ali Price, and winger Tim Visser shortly before the break.
“We believe the kind of open rugby we play, they are not used to playing with the speed of ball. So it was great to get those scores then,” Townsend said. “If we’d gone in at 3-3 they would have had a lot of confidence but the tries gave us a boost and really set us up for the second half. Italy are a tough opponent and the rugby they play takes a lot out of the forwards, but you have to keep working at it because there will be times in the game when opportunities will be made.”
Scotland made good on a pre-match promise of a fast start and forced Italy into desperate defending in the first five minutes through quick and expansive passing as they probed for an opening. Scotland’s ambition was soon rewarded when Finn Russell slotted over a penalty to open the scoring but Italy pegged them back almost immediately when Tommaso Allan kicked from long range after an infringement at a ruck.
Scotland were dominating possession but unable to capitalise on good field position due to poor offloads and a lack of discipline. Italy were content to soak up pressure and seek to trouble their opponents on the counterattack.
Italy, however, continued to give away penalties with Scotland persisting in opting for attacking set pieces and a couple of moments of brilliance in the final two minutes of the half enabled Scotland to pull clear.
Price scored the first try when he fooled the defence with a dummied pass and dived over in the corner. Visser then hauled down an exquisite chip-kick and stretched to touch down as he fell to the ground. Duncan Taylor added the conversion for a 15-3 half-time lead.
Scotland stormed out of the blocks after the break, immediately recording another seven points when Ford burrowed over from a driving maul and Russell added the extras.
Italy were looking ragged and after Dean Budd, making his debut, was sent to the sin-bin for persistent infringements Ford added his second try after a well-worked passing move as Scotland ran away with what had rapidly transformed into a one-sided contest.
Italy briefly stemmed the flow with an intercept try finished off by Michele Campagnaro in the 66th minute but their ill-discipline returned when the replacement back-rower Abraham Steyn was sent to the sin-bin for a dangerous tip-tackle.
Damian Hoyland capitalised on a man advantage by rounding off a sweeping move to touch down in the corner with five minutes remaining before Italy’s Angelo Esposito completed the scoring with a consolation try out wide.
“It was very humid but we thought it was going to be worse. Happy to play some good rugby in tough conditions,” the Scotland captain, John Barclay, said. “We scored some good tries, let in a couple, but we’re pleased as it was our first outing in a few weeks.”
Both sides will complete their tours with matches away to Australia and Fiji in the next two weeks.
Ireland made a blistering start to their summer tour with an emphatic 55-19 victory over the US Eagles at Red Bull Arena in New Jersey. Tries from Keith Earls (2), Jacob Stockdale, Niall Scannell, Kieran Marmion, Jack Conan, the debutant James Ryan, Luke McGrath and Simon Zebo did the damage, with the fly-half Joey Carbery adding four points from the boot. Garry Ringrose added a solitary conversion with Rory Scannell, on his Test debut, kicking four points.
The outclassed Eagles replied with tries from Nic Civetta, John Quill and Ryan Matyas with the former Connacht fly-half AJ MacGinty contributing four points from the kicking tee.
Joe Schmidt’s side had too much pace, power and precision for the Eagles, who are ranked 13 places below fourth-placed Ireland in the world rankings. That gap in class was blatantly apparent throughout a frantic first half with the visitors bagging five tries to establish a 29-7 half-time lead. Ireland added a further four tries after the break to seal a comfortable victory before they set off to Tokyo on Sunday for their two-Test series with 2019 World Cup pool opponents Japan.
Ross Cronjé scored a try on his debut as South Africa returned to form with a 37-14 victory over an under-strength France in the first test at Loftus Versfeld. The Springboks started nervously but scored four tries as centres Jesse Kriel and Jan Serfontein also crossed over, to go with a penalty try. France, who had made 10 changes from the side that played Wales in their final Six Nations match in March, were in the game until the final quarter as centre Henry Chavancy and replacement scrum-half Baptiste Serin crossed the line for the visitors.
There were green shoots of recovery for the Boks after their disastrous 2016 season in a game watched by just 29,313 fans. “I am really pleased, we are moving in the right direction,” the Springbok head coach, Allister Coetzee, said. “It’s step one of 13 games this season but our attack, defence and kicking game were all good.
“We are not there yet, we must acknowledge that the French played without a lot of their leading players and still put us under pressure at times.”
Israel Folau and Henry Speight each scored two tries as Australia opened their season with a dominant 37-14 win over a gallant Fiji in Melbourne.
Warren Gatland and his players insist there is still plenty more to come after the British & Irish Lions revitalised their New Zealand tour prospects with a hard-fought 12-3 victory over the previously unbeaten Crusaders. With the first Test looming on Saturday week, Gatland feels the outcome will give his squad belief that they can upset the All Blacks and take the three-Test series.
“The most important thing was the result,” said Gatland, admitting the last few days had been “very tough” following the team’s midweek defeat to the Blues in Auckland. “Tonight was another step up but there is still a lot to work on. This team was outstanding in training on Friday, the players looked sharp and I knew there would be a performance because they have had time to gel.
“The result was pretty important for us. There’s been a lot of criticism and people have written the tour off already after two games. That’s been challenging for all of us. We need to stay strong in the group and keep the faith. We’ve always known about the quality of the players we’ve got and I just keep repeating myself that with more time together we’ll be better.” Gatland then took a wry swipe at his critics: “I hope we didn’t disappoint any people tonight with the result.”
Gatland also revealed he is planning to invite the tour captain, Sam Warburton, to prove his fitness against the Highlanders in Dunedin on Tuesday, with the Wales flanker having been sidelined for the past week with a strained ankle. The Irish back-row forwards Sean O’Brien and Peter O’Mahony were both praised by the head coach, who also hailed the impact of his bench replacements.
The England lock George Kruis, meanwhile, has suggested the Lions could do a lot worse than adopt a similarly aggressive defensive gameplan against the All Blacks. “We talk about how we want to be a brutal pack, a set-piece dominant pack. I think today we showed good signs of that,” said the Saracen. “That was a big test for us. We knew it in the week and we trained hard for that. They average 37 points a game so to concede only three is huge for us. They have six internationals in that pack and we knew it would be a tasty game.
“ It got a little bit heated at times but we held our own and did a good job. We’re trying to come up with scenarios that on the pitch we can be unflappable. We’re taking steps in the right direction.”
The Crusaders’ coach, Scott Robertson, was not too impressed with the Lions’ attacking creativity – “It wasn’t a spectacle we’re normally used to but they got the job done” – and reckons his All Black counterpart, Steve Hansen, will find ways to sidestep the touring team’s committed defence.
“We thought they were going to play that way and we couldn’t negate that but Steve will do his homework,” said Robertson, hailing Owen Farrell as the man the All Blacks will particularly need to counter. “He’s world-class and can see both the game and the space. His skill execution of those flat kicks to the corner is something we need to look at.”
Alfie Hewett became the first British winner of the men’s wheelchair singles title at the French Open with a dramatic victory over the defending champion, Gustavo Fernández. The 19-year-old from Norwich lost the first eight games and saved two match points in the second-set tie-break before going on to win 0-6, 7-6 (11-9), 6-2.
“I played him a week and a half ago in another final and I was 6-0, 3-0 down, and when it went 6-0, 2-0 this time I was thinking: ‘Oh no, here we go again,’” Hewett said. “But I remembered coming back that time so I knew I could come back. When it got to that tie-break, it was very up and down, he had I don’t know how many match points, I had set points.
“Mentally that was a big positive for me to just keep in there and hold out. I felt good after I won that second set. I knew I needed to get off to a good start in the third and when that happened I just grew in confidence.”
Hewett showed his nerves in the first set, making far too many errors as his Argentinian opponent clinched the set in 17 minutes. The British player, ranked seventh, finally got on the board in the third game of the second set and it was nip and tuck after he fought back from 3-1 to make it 3-3. The tie-break proved to be the decisive moment, with Fernández, who beat Scotland’s Gordon Reid in last year’s final, unable to take either of his two chances.
Hewett carried his momentum into the third set to add his first grand slam singles title to double Paralympic silver from Rio last summer and a Wimbledon doubles title. There were a few tears but no great outpouring of emotion from Hewett who had a doubles final to come after with Reid. The British pair went on to lose against France’s Stéphane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer 6-4 6-3.
Celebrations on Saturday night will be limited to a pizza before he heads home to see his parents, brother and sister, who were following from the UK.
“I can’t imagine what they were feeling in that second set tie-break,” said Hewett. “I’ve always believed I can beat anyone on my day. Clay is one of my favourite surfaces. Norwich only has about three clay courts but there’s something about it I love.
“I had a good feeling about this week. This time last year I was outside the top 10, hadn’t really won anything. A year on I’ve got two silver medals, Wimbledon doubles champion and now singles grand slam at Roland Garros. I can’t believe it.”
The Cleveland Cavaliers are still the NBA’s current champion with essentially the same team from last year’s title and it was particularly cruel they had to spend three days at home enduring a debate about whether these Golden State Warriors are the greatest team ever. What happened Friday night with Cleveland’s 137-116 Game 4 trampling of the Warriors shouldn’t be a surprise.
Did everyone really think Golden State – as good as they have played – are that much better than the Cavs?
The Warriors might have two of the game’s three top players, but LeBron James is still the best of his generation. And though he tried to pretend late Friday night that he missed all the chatter of about Golden State’s historical brilliance, he certainly picked up enough to carry a grudge as big as the arena into Game 4.
“Some of the other guys heard it and told me that they wanted to celebrate on our floor once again and they wanted to spray champagne in our locker room,” said James, who seemed specific on details despite his protests that he wasn’t listening to the talk about Golden State’s dominance.
He even had an obvious culprit.
“I think it came from (Warriors forward) Draymond (Green),” James added.
The most honest words uttered so far in these finals came from Cavs guard Kyrie Irving who said: “We see everything, I’ll be sitting up here lying (if I said) we didn’t see it.”
If there is one truth about today’s NBA players it’s that they read and hear every word said about them. Players are constantly griping about seemingly innocuous lines from weeks-old stories or stray comments thrown out on radio shows. The idea they slip themselves into cocoons, blacking out a media world swirling around them, is a farce. What they don’t see on their computers or glimpse on television is fed to them by an armada of sycophants eager to deliver any news that might catch the player’s attention.
In other words, the Cavs – who still possess the most recent Larry O’Brien trophy – were well-aware that the Warriors have become the Showtime Lakers, Jordan Bulls and 1960s Celtics all in one. They also heard a lot of talk about how they were going to lose these finals in four games and that they were done as any real championship contender for the next few years.
When asked what part of the Warriors talk upset him most, Irving said:
“All of it.”
“It’s part of the game, I understand that,” he added. “But we knew what we were faced with, that’s what it was. But then you add, of course, some chatter out there and that adds some extra motivation. And you give us a day in between and we were ready to come out - especially me because that taste wouldn’t have been the same if we would have lost tonight and they would have celebrated on our home floor. So I’ll just leave it at that.”
The Warriors are a great team, they are probably the best team the league has seen in 20 years. They set the NBA record for regular-season wins last year and then got even better this year by adding Kevin Durant. Heading into Friday night, they had stormed through the playoffs with 15 straight victories, 30 wins in 31 overall, and it was plausible for people to wonder if they could become the first team to go 16-0 in a postseason.
They are all but certain to win these finals. While last year’s team blew a 3-1 lead to these same Cavaliers in a similar situation (with two of the next three games in Oakland), the fact Golden State won Wednesday’s Game 3 makes everything different. There is a big difference between going up 3-0 in a series as the Warriors did this year as opposed to losing Game 3 as they did last spring and having to fight back to go up 3-1. Golden State are too good to lose four straight to Cleveland. The Cavs aren’t strong enough defensively to stop this Warriors team. They have too many weapons.
But this expectation that Golden State were going to sweep Cleveland always seemed far-fetched. Remember, the Warriors – for all their dominance this spring – were down 25 points to San Antonio in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals and came back to win only after Spurs star Kawhi Leonard was knocked out of the series with a sprained ankle. Golden State probably would have won that series even if Leonard hadn’t been hurt, though it would have been more of a grind. And there wouldn’t have been any talk about the Warriors being the best team ever.
A lot went against the Warriors on Friday. The crowd was extra loud, there were several early fouls called on the Golden State players that seemed to upset them and the Cavs hit 53% of their three-point attempts. They even feared they had lost Green for Game 5 for a second straight year when he appeared to draw his second technical and an automatic ejection, but the officials later said they had given Green’s first technical on Friday to Warriors coach Steve Kerr. A huge break for Golden State.
But Game 4 was about the league’s current champion refusing to cede historic greatness to a team they beat last spring.
“They were aggressive, you have to give them some credit,” said Green, who nonetheless still complained that so many Warriors were in early foul trouble that they couldn’t be as aggressive as they wanted.
There’s still some pride in Cleveland.
Still not very pretty, but mightily effective against Super Rugby’s only unbeaten team this year – and as Warren Gatland said: “We needed that, didn’t we?” He has repeatedly claimed that only the Test series matters, but while there was palpable relief on his face after the criticism that followed the Blues defeat, you get the feeling he had targeted this match as the opportunity for the Lions to announce their arrival. Certainly they had a far more cohesive gameplan – with aggressive, suffocating defence at its heart – and his side were far more composed, finishing aside. Mako Vunipola’s apparent ambivalence towards the haka summed up the Lions’ refusal to be cowed.
Conor Murray and Owen Farrell dovetailed at half-back as well as Gatland and his coaches could have wished. Farrell scored all the points and his kicking from hand was superb. One effort stood out in particular, pegging the Crusaders back in their right corner, and Murray was equally effective with the boot. The Lions were deep in their own 22 at one stage in the second half and two box-kicks later – the second a beauty – and the Crusaders had a lineout near their own line. The All Blacks will ruthlessly punish aimless kicking, but it can be a powerful weapon for the Lions when they are on the money.
If there is one man who perhaps deserves more plaudits than Owen Farrell, it is his dad, Andy, who addressed the squad after the Blues defeat to lament their ill-discipline. Against the Crusaders, they conceded seven penalties – compared with 13 last Wednesday – and their ferocious line speed ensured their hosts could not get the ball wide as much as they would have hoped. Vunipola and George Kruis were excellent, but, more importantly, the pack, as a unit, was defensively superb. On the odd occasion the Crusaders broke through, the Lions scrambled well, and the set-piece was largely on top against a number of All Blacks forwards, who seemed to struggle with Mathieu Raynal’s officiating.
It is undoubtedly encouraging that the Lions created far more opportunities than in their two previous matches, but it is still a concern that they are not taking them; it is now two tries in 240 minutes. Early on, Jonathan Davies had the chance to put George North clear on the right, and Stuart Hogg might have released Liam Williams on the left. In the second half, a better pass from the otherwise impressive Ben Te’o would have put Williams away on the left, while CJ Stander’s knock-on after Anthony Watson’s break was horrible. Their opponents deserve plenty of credit for their last line of defence, but while it worked against the Crusaders, the Lions – to paraphrase Sean Connery – will not beat the All Blacks by bringing penalties to a try fight.
Gatland has been lukewarm to the idea of playing Jonathan Sexton and Farrell together, but with the Ireland fly-half finding his best form from the bench, we may well see them paired together against the Maori All Blacks next Saturday. With Te’o also on the pitch, interchanging with Farrell, it made for a robust midfield and the Lions benefited from having two playmakers. Indeed, their ability to adapt after losing Davies and Hogg in the first half was impressive, and the back-line that ended the match may well start the first Test. It would be bold to start Watson at full-back, but the others now have it all to do against the Highlanders on Tuesday if they are to make the Test XV.
For much of this season, Dustin Johnson’s dominance was such that the Masters and US Open looked like a race for second. If the world No1’s nonparticipation at Augusta was the result of a freak domestic accident, recent returns of 12th, 13th and a missed cut means suddenly Johnson does not seem quite so imperious.
While he will understandably have a successful defence of the US Open from Thursday as prime motivation, the other leading lights have been afforded hope at Erin Hills in Wisconsin. In a nod towards the past three champions, Johnson will have Jordan Spieth and Martin Kaymer for company in rounds one and two.
Unlike Johnson and the vast majority of the field, Spieth has playing experience of the course – from the US Amateur Championship.
“I know nothing about it,” said Johnson. “Before I injured myself, I was playing really well. Everything was just really solid. But it’s getting back to where I feel like where I’m getting a lot more comfortable and a lot more confident in the game. I feel like the game, as far as from last year to this year, is not really much different.”
Fascination elsewhere will surround how Rory McIlroy fares at a course that may well suit his game but who is returning from an enforced break after the recurrence of a rib problem. McIlroy is one of precious few players in recent times to destroy a US Open venue – but this tends to be the most attritional major of them all.
Erin Hills will be subject to intense scrutiny, as will those who preside over the second major of the year. It is a new venue for the championship, which need not be a remarkable factor but the criticism of Chambers Bay in 2015, added to the rules fiasco that overshadowed Johnson’s success last year, means the United States Golf Association is in need of positive publicity.
“They’ve taken criticism for the last two years, I’m sure they’re not liking it,” said Adam Scott, the 2013 Masters champion. “They’re going to have to try to run a really good event. The ball is in their court; they control it all. Hopefully, they get it right this time, just from a playability standpoint. Let’s just have something that’s a challenge and interesting, not just playing brutal golf.”
The early indications are not particularly good; the USGA has published a supposedly full tournament draw that includes a batch of to-be-decided player times. Phil Mickelson has been included despite saying he will attend his daughter’s high school graduation in San Diego on Thursday lunchtime. Handily, Mickelson has been given an afternoon slot for round one; his participation would become feasible in the event of a lengthy weather delay.
Mike Davis, the USGA’s executive director, denies the widespread theory that manufactured scoring is high on his organisation’s agenda. “We don’t even talk about it,” he said. “What we do talk about is making sure we can adjust the course to, say, if there’s soft conditions; maybe we tuck a hole location a little bit more versus if we get real firm conditions and it gets windy.
“We’re then sitting there talking among ourselves saying how do we tone this thing down, how do we slow the greens, get some more water on them, whatever the case may be. It really isn’t about the score, it’s about just setting the course up properly.”
Jeonju is eight time zones away from Cobham and when Dominic Solanke broke through the middle before cracking his second goal past the Italy goalkeeper, Andrea Zaccagno, on Thursday his former place of employment could hardly have seemed at a further remove. Solanke ended up sitting out this season at Chelsea after talks over a new contract broke down, early hopes of challenging for a first-team place fizzling into a limbo of training sessions and a handful of under-23 fixtures as it became clear he would not be considered for selection.
A move to Liverpool was finalised last month; he had been in danger of fading from view but now he will lead the line in England’s Under-20 World Cup final against Venezuela on Sunday as they seek an achievement that has no parallel in this country in the past half-century.
Solanke has learned the virtues of perseverance and there may be those inside Chelsea’s set-up who wonder whether the club should have stuck things out a little longer themselves. He joined the club at the age of eight and with starring roles in FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League titles behind him – not to mention the near-obligatory season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem – his trajectory appeared set.
It is rarely that simple for a 19-year-old attempting to break through at Stamford Bridge though and Solanke is hardly the first to seek an alternative path. Liverpool will be a fresh start with, should all go to plan, a clearer route by which to make up for lost time.
Give or take the finer details, Solanke’s was a depressingly familiar situation among English players of a similar age. Perhaps that will change if the Under-20s win their first final at this tournament and there is a sense that the current crop have a momentum that previous generations found hard to muster.
“We knew that we’ve got a winning bunch of players and we’ve got to repeat that,” Solanke said after that 3-1 semi-final win over Italy, referencing the Uefa Under-17 Championship title the core of the squad won together in 2014.
Solanke scored England’s goal in the final against Holland, which was decided on penalties; it appears not to have been a flash in the pan and when the players return for pre-season with their clubs – all bar four in the top flight – scrutiny over their use and treatment can be expected to intensify.
The cautious conclusion in Solanke’s case is that, whether or not England win the trophy and regardless of whether he scores the two goals that would almost certainly win the golden boot award outright, the tools are in place for the Premier League.
He has won admiration from those who have seen him work up close – particularly the Under-20s manager, Paul Simpson – for the way he handled his exile at Chelsea and has grown into this World Cup after, perhaps understandably, looking a shade below his best in his first two games.
Style wise, Solanke is a rangy figure who, rather than appearing awkward, has the strength and awareness to threaten when playing up against defenders or in deeper areas. He needs to be playing regularly at a high level now; so, too, do team-mates such as the Everton forward Ademola Lookman and the Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook.
If a lack of success in high-pressure situations has contributed to English clubs’ caution towards using young players, will an unprecedented victory this summer bring a change in mindset?
Venezuela need to be negotiated first and that, despite the country’s lack of presence as a power at senior level, is far from assured.
England will have the benefit of freshness after their opponents required extra-time to win all three of their knock-out games, but they will have to be wary of the forward Adalberto Peñaranda – who is on Watford’s books and has trodden a familiar-looking path in spells at Granada and Udinese – as well as Sergio Córdova, whose four-goal tally equals that of Solanke.
They are highly dangerous players but England’s biggest challenge may lie more in the mind – a situation that their distance from home, with few fans and media scrambling to make the 11-hour flight at short notice, perhaps improves. Interest and pressure may be ramping up before a first World Cup final at any significant level since 1966, but they are conveniently isolated.
“Everyone’s going to be rooting for us back home so hopefully we can make them proud,” Solanke said. If England do, their centre-forward might consider that those months on the sidelines were eventually well worth it. Chelsea, on the other hand, may feel precisely the opposite is true for them.
Every successful Lions tour needs a rallying cry and “remember Christchurch” will now be the mantra of the 2017 expedition. New Zealanders, at the very least, will have to readjust their opinion of the supposed lightweights in their midst. The Lions gave easily their best performance so far, brushing aside disruptive backline injuries and local scepticism to confound those who felt they might not win another fixture on this trip.
More than that, they breathed fresh life into this Lions enterprise, which would have struggled to escape a litany of gloomy provincial defeats. Their collective intensity and controlled physicality was right up where it needed to be and the victory margin could have been considerably wider. Four penalties from Owen Farrell ultimately proved sufficient in a try-less contest but it was the forwards who laid the foundations. Against an opposing pack containing six All Blacks, there was a discernible edge lacking from the initial two matches in Whangarei and Auckland.
Maybe it would have emerged in the Tests regardless but the Lions management now have first-hand evidence that even New Zealand’s leading provincial side, top of the Super Rugby standings and averaging 37 points per game, can have their attacking brilliance squeezed out of them. Here, broadly speaking, is surely the blueprint of how the All Blacks can be upset.
Had the Lions not lost Stuart Hogg and Jonathan Davies to head injuries inside the first half-hour and not let three potential try-scoring chances slip away it might have been even more convincing. As it was Farrell and Conor Murray exerted impressive tactical control behind a pack that at last showed signs of living up to its advertised potential. George Kruis, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola, Peter O’Mahony and Sean O’Brien did not feature in everyone’s starting Test XV before the tour started, but along with Tadhg Furlong, Alun Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau they all enhanced their reputations in these parts.
It was a cracking encounter from start to finish, with the sides fully committed and pumped up on a cold evening. Two Farrell penalties gave the Lions an early advantage and their biggest early concern was the stray elbow from the otherwise excellent Murray that inadvertently struck his own full-back and forced the bloodied Hogg from the field.
The Lions’ backline resources were further stretched when Davies was led away for a head injury assessment at the request of medical staff. Jonathan Sexton came on at 10, Farrell switched to 12 and Watson came on at full-back, an illustration of the Lions’ range of options and the versatility that Warren Gatland has deliberately opted for.
Luckily their forwards already had the bit between their teeth with the home side, not helped by a slightly slippery, dew-laden ball, initially struggling to claim restarts and losing their first three lineouts. The Lions also had some joy in the scrums against an all-international front row, aside from one backpedalling loss of control that resulted in a mass scuffle and a penalty to the Crusaders, who had won all of their 17 games this year.
For a brief moment, as Murray burst away upfield with the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, playing advantage, it seemed as if the Lions might be looking at a hefty interval advantage but an attempted pass off the floor by Jones found a lurking Crusader instead of one of his own team-mates. The visitors were slightly fortunate to concede just three points from the resultant intense period of pressure close to their own line.
Their 9-3 half-time advantage, however, was thoroughly merited and would have been extended had Farrell been awarded a 40-metre penalty he felt had sailed over but was ruled out by the referee’s assistants.
The Lions wasted another points-scoring opportunity when a poor right to left pass from Ben Te’o made life unnecessarily hard for Liam Williams outside of him. CJ Stander also spilt a glorious chance after Watson had broken clear and split the defence wide open.
In the final analysis it mattered not, with a fourth Farrell penalty in the 70th minute giving New Zealanders further food for thought with the first Test at Eden Park a fortnight away.
What a contest that will be if the All Blacks can be hassled and harried defensively, given scant time to think and repeatedly turned by the pinpoint kicking of Murray and Farrell. Despite having not operated in tandem in training, the Sexton-Farrell axis at 10 and 12 went reasonably well without dispelling the sense Gatland will opt for a bigger ball-carrier at inside centre. Te’o, that one stray pass apart, had another good game and the increasingly confident Watson may also have played himself into the Test 23.
Among the other interesting conundrums is whether Sam Warburton, in line to return from a strained ankle against the Highlanders on Tuesday, has sufficient recent rugby in his legs to oust O’Brien. And who starts alongside Kruis, who must be a dead cert, in the second-row? Gatland still has some decisions to make but at least he now knows his best XV will be genuinely competitive.
A minor tremor measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale was felt in the stadium after the game; if the Lions keep improving, a major shock could yet await in the Test series.

For Gareth Southgate there was progress of sorts. It has taken some time to reach this stage but finally England have got to the point where the manager of the national team can go through an entire press conference without a single question about Wayne Rooney, former captain.
Seven months into the Southgate era a new team is taking shape minus the chap who has 119 caps and 53 goals for his country. England, as Southgate said, need different leaders now, even if he is still going to great efforts not to alienate Rooney completely by naming a permanent captain. Not yet, anyway.
For the time being it will be Harry Kane leading out the team at Hampden Park when England and Scotland lock horns in their World Cup qualifying group. Jordan Henderson, Gary Cahill and Joe Hart have all previously worn the armband under the new manager and, at some point, Southgate is going to have to be selfish and discount Rooney’s feelings and decide which of the candidates deserves the role on a full-time basis.
Equally it is not difficult to see what Southgate is trying to achieve if the allegation against England is that when it comes to the crunch they lack genuine leadership and players who can cope when the pressure is dangerously close to intolerable. Or as Steve Holland, England’s assistant manager, noted earlier this week about last summer’s Iceland debacle: “Maybe you were in the stadium, or watching it on holiday like me, looking round at the players thinking: ‘Bloody hell, they’ve gone. Where are the leaders? Where is the leadership?’ That is a pressure moment, so who is stepping forward? It looked to me like there was nobody.”
Kane, ironically, was one of the players who crumbled, booed by the team’s own supporters and warranting three out of ten in L’Equipe’s ratings the next day. One bad night, however, should not be held against him forever, especially when he has just won the Premier League’s golden boot, and Southgate should probably not be criticised for devoting so much attention to his mission of “developing more leaders within the group,” with the emphasis on the plural.
That process took in a overnight trip to Woodbury Common last weekend when the players began their preparations for the Scotland game by mucking in with the Royal Marines. Team-bonding, they call it, although Southgate was also reminded that, when Clive Woodward did the same with the England rugby team, one of the senior training instructors subsequently gave him a list of names as “men we wouldn’t go into battle with.”
The feedback for Southgate was not quite so brutal – “there was nobody they said shouldn’t be on the journey with us,” he clarified – and when it comes to Kane there was also the clear sense that the manager sees him as the kind of player who drives others on with his own ability.
“His goals record over the last three seasons speaks for itself. Even when we worked together at the under-21s, the quality of his finishing was clear. You see the level of finishing from the likes of [Robbie] Fowler, [Paul] Scholes and [Alan] Shearer, and you could see that level from Harry from the first day.There was the question of whether he could transfer that into matches because he wasn’t playing for Spurs at the time, but he’s done that now. He’s always had the focus about being the best possible player and they are the attributes when you look at the really top players.”
By Southgate’s own admission it is not an orthodox way for England teams to operate. That, however, does not make it wrong. “Eventually I have to decide: ‘OK, this is what we’re going to do,’” Southgate said. “But it is important to develop a group first. I want a group of leaders. Then, when we’ve got strength in various levels of leadership, everybody can see the importance of their role in the team.”
Plus Kane is another reminder, in a week when England have reached the final of the Under-20s’ World Cup, that England is capable of bringing through elite footballers. “Everybody knocks youth development,” Southgate said. “Our coaching gets knocked, our youth development gets knocked, our young players get knocked but why shouldn’t young English players be able to achieve?
“We have clubs searching the world to bring in young players, some of whom are outstanding but others who are maybe not as good as the players who are already there under the clubs’ noses. And if we’ve got a team in a World Cup final at that age group, why are we looking around the world?”
When a furious Jordan Pickford conceded a goal during a training exercise with England’s Under-21’s at St George’s Park this week, he whacked and burst one of the inflatable mannequins that had been put up to complicate the strikers’ route to goal. “I just don’t like conceding,” he explains with an endearing chuckle. There was an obvious quip that could have been made about being accustomed to it after a campaign behind the dummies in Sunderland’s defence but his club’s relegation is no light-hearted matter for the 23-year-old.
Pickford is still hurt by his hometown team’s fall from the Premier League even if things are looking up for him personally, with his acclaimed performances throughout the season likely to result in offers from several top-flight clubs waiting for him when he gets back from this month’s European Under-21 Championship, from which he is confident of returning as a winner.
“It’s hard to take that I got relegated with Sunderland and it’ll always be hard to take but I’m mentally strong,” says Pickford, who has been on the club’s books since he was eight. “[The impact of relegation] is massive – 40-odd people lost their jobs throughout the season and financially it’s not ideal for the whole club. For me, having grown up and been there since I was a kid, seeing people you’ve known for a long time losing their jobs, it’s not nice. But I feel like as a team and staff behind the scenes we did the best we could do and it was just unfortunate that we never got the results we needed.”
Of course it was more than misfortune that caused Sunderland to finish bottom of the table but the failure was certainly not the fault of Pickford, whose excellence earned him a place on the shortlist for the PFA young player of the year award. It is fair to say promoting Pickford to No1 rather than buying a more experienced goalkeeper when Sunderland’s first choice, Vito Mannone, was injured in August was one of the few decisions David Moyes got right during a miserable campaign.
“He has been great, to give me that experience,” says Pickford. “There was a lot of talk about certain keepers coming in, like Joe Hart, but the manager just brought in a No2/No3 [Mika, from Benfica] and gave me the opportunity. It was top drawer, really. I was a young lad thrown in at the deep end but I felt ready for it.”
It would have been better if we had stayed up; my heart is massive towards the club. It’s a hard one, really.
His description of how he became ready for it begins with a memory from his early childhood, when his brother Richard, six years his senior, would invite him to kickabouts with the instruction: “Get on the tarmac and dive about lad.” He went on to hone his talent in the more formal surrounds of Sunderland’s academy and then, after turning professional in 2011, spent loan stints at a variety of Football League clubs, most recently at Preston North End in the 2015-16 season, when he kept 14 clean sheets in 30 matches. “That was proving that I was good enough,” he says with the confidence he has gained from working his way up steadily.
Another sign of that confidence, and his readiness, was the way he hollered instructions at veteran defenders as soon as he was thrust into Sunderland’s first team. “Around the place I’m just myself really but as soon as you cross that white line I feel it’s my job and I’m here to do it and get the lads going,” he says. “You don’t do it nastily, you do it to help the lads in front of you and you know you’re doing it when they look round and give you the thumbs up or, after the game, they bring up something you’ve done well and that you’ve saved a goal by talking.”
Pickford is all about the bottom line. The saves he cherishes most are not the most acrobatic or difficult ones but the ones that matter most. “I go back to the [Peter] Schmeichel thing: you save it how you have to, any way that you can. Technique goes out the window sometimes.” So his favourite stop in his career was the close-range one he made to prevent Leicester City’s Wes Morgan from equalising in the sixth minute of stoppage time at the Stadium of Light in December. “It wasn’t an unbelievable save, it was just the timing of the game,” he says. “A match-winning save and we thought that win might have got us going.”
The win did not get Sunderland going – they were battered 3-0 by Swansea City a week later – but it lengthened Pickford’s list of admirers. Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea have been mentioned as potential destinations for him this summer. He admits to being torn about the possibility of having to choose between staying at his hometown club or heading back up to the Premier League, where his talent suggests he belongs. “Ideally it would have been better if we had stayed up; my heart is massive towards the club,” he says. “It’s a hard one, really. What will be will be.”
He has resolved not to think about it until after the European Championship. England kick off their campaign on Friday against the holders, Sweden, before completing their group fixtures against Slovakia and the hosts, Poland. “The Euros is massive for me and a lot of the other players. I don’t want to be getting distracted and I am really excited for it. We have got a chance to win it with the squad we have got. We have come this far, we have to get out of the group first but we are capable of doing that easily. We will see where we go from there.”
One warm evening in the summer of 1971 I got home from work with a copy of the London evening paper in my hand. Look, I told my girlfriend, it says here that the Lions are arriving at Heathrow tonight. Let’s go. So we climbed into the car and drove out on the M4 to the airport. We were not alone. The arrivals hall was already packed – but with people who had arrived from the opposite direction, which meant from Wales.
The singing had already begun. Cwm Rhondda, of course, and much else, while we waited. By the time the heroes had passed through the baggage hall and passport checks and started to emerge, people were standing on chairs and tables, creating an impromptu arena.
Looks of astonishment crossed the players’ faces as they saw the welcome that awaited them. One after another, each newly minted legend received his massive cheer. John Dawes, the captain. Gareth Edwards, the genius. Barry John, the king. Willie John McBride, the giant. Ian McLauchlan, the mighty mouse. Gerald Davies, the uncatchable. John Taylor, the tackler. JPR Williams, author of a crucial drop goal – the only one of his career – in the final match of the Test series. And so on. All of them cheered to the rafters – with the exception of David Duckham, the dashing blond England wing, who received a few good-natured Welsh boos for having displaced John Bevan, the 20-year-old Cardiff prodigy, in the last three Tests.
The Lions had beaten the All Blacks in a series for the first and, so far, the only time. They had been away for three months. Their coach returned with them, too. It was he who had persuaded McBride to change his mind about undertaking a fourth Lions tour and he who had coaxed a reluctant John – a native of the same mining village – into joining the party with the promise that he would not be subjected to an unduly rigorous training regime. It was he who bent the Lions’ rules to allow Davies to fly out and join the party three weeks late, after taking his Cambridge tripos exams.
That was Carwyn James, whose achievement in New Zealand remains unequalled by any of his successors. At 41, and taking a chunk of unpaid time off from his day job as teacher of Welsh and head of rugby and cricket at Llandovery College, James was already a man of many facets, some of them seemingly contradictory: a lover of literature and the theatre, a deacon at his village chapel, a 40-a-day cigarette smoker fond of wine and gin, a compelling columnist (for this newspaper) and broadcaster, a solitary man yet a lover of company and stories and singing. But, most of all, a rugby visionary beyond compare.
Although a confirmed Welsh nationalist who stood in the 1970 general election as a representative of Plaid Cymru, he viewed the task of coaching the Lions as one of reconciling the characteristics of the four nations. And he did it his way, a way that persuaded the members of his squad to lay down their deep-rooted national rivalries. Lasting friendships were formed that would have seemed impossible before the party assembled to listen to an introductory speech given by a coach known to the Welsh players for his prowess as a fly-half and later coach with Llanelli, but who was a complete unknown to others.
Years later he put it this way: “The very first thing I said to them was: ‘Look here, be your own man. I don’t want Irishmen to pretend to be English, or Englishmen to be Celts, or Scotsmen to be anything less than Scots. You each have an ultimate quality to give to the team and you must know that you are able to express yourself in your own special unique way, both on the field and off it.’”
“I shall always remember his gentleness,” McLauchlan once said. “In New Zealand he was dealing with a fairly rough bunch of blokes, but he never had to utter a harsh word and never had to raise his voice. Our success was entirely due to him.”
I thought of him this week when Eddie Jones, the England coach, spoke of making his players into “participants” rather than mere “recipients”, as if this were something new. As John Spencer, the England centre who was a member of the 1971 party, said in a TV programme on James several years ago: “One of his strengths was that he left a lot of the ideas to the members of the team.”
But Spencer also called him “a great organiser”, and he was meticulous in his preparation. An amateur in an amateur game, he brought a professional’s commitment to the task as he assembled dossiers on their opponents, visited Matt Busby to talk about Manchester United’s training methods and called on Eric Ashton at Wigan to see how rugby league’s champions went about their work.
It was amusing to hear Sean Fitzpatrick, speaking in the aftermath of the 2017 tourists’ defeat by the Auckland Blues, suggesting that their task against the Crusaders on Saturday will be easier because “there’ll be a lot more structure to the game” – implying that spontaneity is alien to the Lions’ culture. In 1971, James gave his players a structure within which their individual creativity could find its fullest expression.
When it was all over, the defeated captain paid him a high compliment: “He kept a unity that transferred itself to the pitch,” the great Colin Meads said. “He did have stars, but no one could have coached the stars he had like Carwyn did. He was judicious and scientific in his approach, in a way we hadn’t seen in New Zealand before.”
Honoured and fulfilled in many ways, rejected and isolated in others, he died of a heart attack in 1983, aged 53. Now the many elements of his complicated life are explored in great depth and with exemplary sensitivity by Alun Gibbard in a new biography titled Into the Wind, whose English-language edition is published on Friday.
Speaking of James’s love of the work of Federico García Lorca, Gibbard refers to the way in which the presence of the Spanish concept of duende within the poet’s work – “a heightened state of emotion, expression and authenticity” – found a resonance in the rugby coach’s sensibility. Duende might not be an ingredient of Warren Gatland’s formula for this year’s Lions but, as much as anything else, it was what earned the 1971 team their heroes’ welcome home.

I have always loved dancing. I used to be a regular clubber, going out with friends on the weekend and dancing the night away. Unfortunately, all my friends reached a certain age, settled down and stopped going out. About the same time, four years ago, my gym introduced a new workout class called Zumba. I’d never done anything like it before: it was a fitness class, but it also introduced me to a new style of dance. Now I drag myself out of bed every Sunday morning just for Zumba.
I’ve been at my gym for 10 years and have tried pretty much every class going – Pilates, body conditioning, legs, bums and tums – but Zumba is top of my list. It’s a 45-minute fitness class where the instructor stands at the front of the studio and we all face her, shadowing her steps and movements. It’s more like joining a party. It’s a solo activity: you all move around the studio in sync, doing different sequences of choreographed steps along to music.
A lot of the movements are recognisable from other dance forms, from salsa and flamenco to hip-hop and contemporary. Every three weeks or so, the instructor will mix it up and introduce new steps. As a regular, it’s enough time to practice and learn the sequences without getting bored. Sometimes, I’ll miss a step here or there, but it really doesn’t matter: the steps are repeated, so you join back in when you’re ready.
The music is as varied as the movement, with songs from different genres and from all over the world. Whatever the style, the choreography suits it brilliantly, so you really get into it. Some songs are slower, allowing you to take a bit of a breather, while others are fast, making for a high-intensity workout. It can be hard work physically, but you’re having so much fun, you don’t notice you’re burning calories. It’s the only group workout I’ve done where pretty much everyone has a smile on their face.
Favourite music to dance to? Latin American, such as reggaeton and salsa.
Post-Zumba recovery snack? I make protein shakes: peanut butter and banana is probably my favourite.
1 If you’re feeling self-conscious about joining a class, but want to give it a go, there are lots of YouTube videos and Zumba DVDs, which are helpful for learning the basics. Get some friends round and turn it into a party.
2 It doesn’t matter how fit you are, or whether you’ve got an injury or a disability, Zumba can be adapted by the instructor according to your individual needs.
3 The most important thing is to feel comfortable, so wear something tight or baggy, plain or sparkly. Trainers are also essential, because there’s lots of high-impact jumping and twisting.
4 The most basic step that’s used in a lot of tracks comes from salsa. Step forward with your right foot, back with your left, then bring your right foot back to meet your left one, in a one-two-three rhythm.
5 Nowadays, it’s highly likely that any local leisure centre will offer Zumba classes; there will probably be a regular class in a local community hall, too. Enter your postcode on the Zumba website to find the nearest one.

The Cleveland Cavaliers aren’t finished yet.
The defending NBA champions delivered a breathtaking shooting display and led from wire to wire to stave off elimination and deny the Golden State Warriors the first perfect postseason in league history with a 137-116 victory in Game 4 on Friday night at Quicken Loans Arena.
The Cavaliers poured in a record-breaking 24 three-pointers to break the NBA finals record set by the Warriors in Sunday’s Game 2. They were led by LeBron James, who finished with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists for his ninth triple-double in NBA finals history, surpassing Magic Johnson’s previous mark of eight. No other player has more than two.
“It’s going to be even tougher in Game 5, but we look forward to the challenge,” said James, who remains on pace to become the first player to average a triple-double over an entire finals. “We know it’s going to be very difficult, but if we can continue to not turn the ball over like we’ve done the last two games, if we can continue to defend and keep bodies on bodies, we give ourselves a good chance.”
Can't stop watching this. #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/qfR8u6ApKe
Kevin Love finished with 23 points, including six three-pointers, while JR Smith chipped in 15.
History would suggest Cleveland’s win only delays the inevitable: no team in NBA history has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit to win a playoff series in 126 previous tries. But no team had ever won an NBA finals from 3-1 down until the Cavaliers pulled it off last year. Now they’ll look to repeat the feat starting with Game 5 on Monday night in Oakland. “Obviously the job is still far from over,” said Kyrie Irving, who finished with a game-high 40 points. “This is a good start.”
The Cavaliers came out swinging in the opening minutes as Irving, Smith and Love drained long jumpers to open a 24-9 advantage, their largest lead of the series. That’s when Golden State inserted Andre Iguodala for Zaza Pachulia for one of their vaunted death lineups. The Warriors had settled down and slowly chipped away on 10 straight points from Durant that cut it to 31-25.
But the turnover-prone Warriors couldn’t keep pace with the torrid shooting of the Cavaliers, who led 49-33 after 12 minutes, setting an NBA finals record for points in a quarter despite missing eight of their free throws – against a team that’s as well-regarded defensively as any in the league.
“Just one of those games,” said Curry, who was held to 14 points on 4-of-13 shooting and went without a made basket until midway through the second quarter. “Not going to overreact to one. Obviously I can play better and want to play better and will play better.
“They played with their backs against the wall. They had a free swing at it, and it was one of those nights where we just didn’t have anything clicking.”
The Cavaliers extended their lead to 19 points early in the second, but Golden State cut it to 11 with James on the bench. Then James returned and within three minutes the hot-shooting Irving and Smith stretched Cleveland’s lead to 69-49, prompting a timeout from Golden State coach Steve Kerr that saw the Warriors hanging their heads as they retreated to the bench.
Cleveland led by as many as 22 points during a record-breaking first half that saw them connect on 60.9% of their shots including 13-for-22 from beyond the arc. When the dust cleared the Cavaliers led 86-68 and had set the all-time playoff record for points in a half.
It was often physical and fraught with hostility: including seven technical fouls, a flagrant and a heated exchange of words between James and Durant, who finished with a team-high 35 points. At one point it appeared Draymond Green had been ejected for picking up a second technical foul, but he was allowed to remain in the game when officials said the first had been called on Kerr and mistakenly recorded in the box score to the Warriors forward.
Golden State chipped away methodically during the third quarter, getting as close as 104-92 with 2:38 remaining. But Kyle Korver, Deron Williams and James added three-pointers before the end of the frame, stretching the lead back to 19 points and giving Cleveland the record before the fourth quarter had even started.
But the Warriors could not get within single digits of Cleveland throughout the second half, prompting renewed optimism amid the sellout crowd of 20,562, who chanted “Cavs in seven!” in the dying minutes.
“We have championship DNA as well,” said James, who surpassed Michael Jordan for No3 on the all-time finals scoring list. “We just kept our composure. We shared the ball, we moved the ball and defensively we were physical.”
The result cost the Warriors, winners of 30 of their last 31 games extending back to the regular season, a chance at the NBA’s first ever flawless playoff run. Instead, they’ll try to join the select list of one-loss champions: the 2001 Los Angeles Lakers (15-1) and 1983 Philadelphia 76ers (12-1).
“(16-0) would have mattered but that’s gone now,” said Klay Thompson, who finished with 13 points. “But 16-1 sounds pretty good.”
Trainer form is a tricky beast. When David Simcock saddled the second and third in the Lockinge three weeks ago it looked as if the Newmarket man had probably overcome his slow start to the season and was now worth following but, almost a month later, he is still struggling along on a low strike-rate.
Breton Rock, one of his Lockinge heroes, is the likely favourite for today’s John of Gaunt Stakes at Haydock and the veteran should be suited by the likely squelch underfoot. But it is not comfortable being on favourites from his yard in competitive races just now.
Mitchum Swagger (4.05) is an interesting alternative at 5-1 or so, with Ryan Moore a fascinating jockey booking. This one faded away in the Lockinge but stepping back a furlong and down in class might be what he needs and he has got his ground again. He came within a head of landing a Group Three at this track in September.
2.20 Haydock Wiliam Haggas’s Pennsylvania Dutch had only one run but it was over this course and distance that he made an impressive winning debut in September. His rating for this handicap looks pretty tasty on that evidence and his pedigree suggests a softer surface may help.
2.30 Newmarket A half-brother to the winner of seven handicaps, Six Strings got off the mark in an autumn maiden but better can be expected this year, following a gelding operation.
2.55 Haydock Aged five, Handsome Dude is holding his form a lot better this term than last, winning on the all-weather in February and being first home on the wrong side at Thirsk last month. Another soft surface may help him here, which is not necessarily true of the likely favourite, Snap Shots.
3.10 Chester A half-sister to a Middle Park winner, Khamaary could not have been more impressive on her handicap debut at Redcar. She has gone up a whopping 16lb but looks capable of shouldering that.
3.30 Haydock The James Fanshawe yard is just getting going and Return Ace, unexposed and with an encouraging pedigree, is attractive if she can return in the sort of form that saw her score at Newmarket on her first run of last year.
3.40 Newmarket Lurking at the bottom of the weights, Batts Rock is a potentially significant improver after only five starts and punters should not be put off by his seventh placing last time, when he travelled well until clipping a rival’s heels. On the promise he showed that day and when second at Ascot two weeks before he is of great interest.

If Eddie Jones, assessing the situation in the expected cauldron of 25,000 locals raging beneath the Andes, decides to empty his bench – and he usually does – England will blood more new caps in this first Test against Argentina than they have since 1947.
The coach has selected 11 fresh faces in his squad of 23. Seventy years ago, England fielded 14 because they had to. It was their first Test since the hiatus in international rugby that was the Second World War. This time the circumstances are only slightly less compelling. Jones has precious little choice with 30 players unavailable for this first Test, of two, in the city of San Juan, 1,000km inland from Buenos Aires, wedged up against the Andes and Chile beyond.
It is not the All Blacks at Eden Park, but Argentina in Argentina is about as intense a furnace in which to forge new players as Jones could have chosen. “It’s one of the greatest challenges in world rugby,” he said with the grin that assures he is delighted with the situation. “Everyone is nice to you and everyone smiles, ‘yes sir, what would you like sir?’ And then comes the game. Bang. It’s on. That’s the difference here.”
Tom Curry is the headline selection, the Sale flanker set to become England’s youngest debutant – at just shy of 19 – since Jonny Wilkinson was introduced in 1998, a couple of months before Curry was born. Wilkinson came on as a winger for the last few minutes of a comfortable win against Ireland; Curry is going to have to mix it from the start with a pack of Pumas. He’s England’s youngest starter for 90 years.
The reception on the pitch will be ferocious, as will the backdrop. The Estadio San Juan de Bicentenario is a sell-out, and the locals, whatever the sport, do not enter an arena anything less than well up for it. “When we come to these provinces the people are fanatics,” says Martin Landajo, the Argentina scrum-half. “The Argentinian crowd is like a football crowd. They will insult you, shout offensive things. It is not the same as England where you have the people sitting together and nothing happens. If you are a bit cheeky they may do something to you.”
Fortunately, Curry, whose identical twin, Ben, is also on tour, seems a well brought-up fellow. At the other end of the experience spectrum, Dylan Hartley, on 84 caps, is sharing with him. He describes Curry as a studious room-mate who does his stretches every day and rings his mum. Such conscientiousness will have to be enhanced on Saturday by something more elemental, but Jones and Hartley have great faith in their young charges.
The opposition are more of a known quantity than England’s thrown-together XV, which includes three other new caps in Harry Williams, Mark Wilson and Alex Lozowski. Another five have fewer than a dozen caps each. Argentina boast 528, spread more evenly throughout their XV than England’s 345, 215 of which are shared between Hartley, Danny Care and Mike Brown.
The Pumas’ squad is entirely taken from the Jaguares, Argentina’s sole team in Super Rugby. They are the only other international side whose selection policy is as strict as the All Blacks’, so some of their best players are ineligible. The Jaguares have graced the Super 18 with some fabulous play but a consistent winning formula remains elusive. In this, their second season, they won four of their first five matches, then lost six of the next seven.
For now, the nascent arrangement between the Jaguares and Pumas is clearly unsatisfactory, the two sides essentially the same, but it has introduced the players to the rigours of regular professionalism. “In the future it will help us,” says Landajo.
He expects the dynamic of international rugby to galvanise the Pumas. “Jaguares is more like a job; this is our passion.”
Jones considers this the perfect challenge by which to test his youngsters, even if he knows patience will be required. “You don’t expect them to be world beaters on their first start. It is a process. I remember giving Matt Giteau his debut [for Australia]. He was terrible. He dropped the first ball, threw two bounce passes and was absolute rubbish. Second Test he was a little bit better and then his career blossomed.”
Words of assurance, perhaps, for Lozowski, who starts at inside centre. But for Williams, who makes his debut via a colourful route that took in a degree in English and sports science, a healthy social life, a stint as a pro with Jersey before winding up as a Premiership champion with Exeter last month, and his fellow prop, Ellis Genge, on one cap, the proposition is more brutal.
Jones, enjoying a similarly healthy social life, took a trip to Argentina when he was a teenager himself in 1979. “I remember the Australian scrum getting pushed back. You could see the tractor marks in the ground. That was when the bajada was at its peak.”
The bajada is the scrummaging technique around which Argentina built their first great side in the 70s and 80s. It was belligerent, focused and unrelenting. Few could deal with it.
We live in more enlightened times now, wherein Pumas are seen running with the ball, but that primal threat remains integral to Argentinian rugby. For rugby boys, Argentina in Argentina is an initiation ceremony without equal. England’s mission is to emerge from Saturday’s inferno with a few more fully formed men.
Ola Toivonen took advantage of a Hugo Lloris error to score an injury-time winner from inside his own half as Sweden beat France in their World Cup qualifier in Stockholm.
The Toulouse midfielder collected a low clearance from Lloris close to the halfway line and clinically lifted the ball into the unguarded net to earn a 2-1 victory that leaves Sweden top of Group A in qualifying for next year’s World Cup in Russia.
France, who are second to Sweden on goal difference, took the lead through Olivier Giroud’s superb left-footed volley after 37 minutes, only for Jimmy Durmaz to equalise for Sweden just before half-time.
Holland moved to within three points of the top two with a 5-0 win over Luxembourg in Rotterdam. Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder gave the hosts a 2-0 lead at half-time, with Liverpool’s Gini Wijnaldum and Tottenham’s Vincent Janssen on target in the second half. Bulgaria lost ground in the race for top spot, falling to fourth in the group after losing 2-1 in Belarus.
In Group B Marc Rebes’ first-half header earned Andorra their first competitive victory since 2004 as they beat Hungary 1-0. The tiny nation’s first qualifying success since a 1-0 win over Macedonia 13 years ago was also a humiliating setback for the visitors, who topped their group at last summer’s European Championship but are now eight points adrift of second-placed Portugal.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for the Euro 2016 winners as they won 3-0 in Latvia to keep up their pursuit of Group B leaders Switzerland. Goals from Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka and Stoke City’s Xherdan Shaqiri earned Switzerland a 2-0 win against the Faroe Islands which extends their 100% start in qualifying to six games.
In Group H Dries Mertens and Nacer Chadli were on target for Belgium as they won 2-0 in Estonia. Mertens opened the scoring after half an hour, turning the ball home after Mihkel Aksalu had spilled Kevin de Bruyne’s right-wing cross. The hosts had Artjom Dmitrijev sent off just before half-time with the score at 1-0. Elsewhere Gibraltar were denied a first-ever point in qualifying when Pieros Sotiriou scored the winner for Cyprus in the 87th minute.
Belgium now lead their group by four points from Greece, who drew 0-0 with Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnia forward Edin Dzeko and his Roma team-mate Konstantinos Manolas were involved in an altercation after the final whistle following a bad-tempered contest in Zenica.
There have been some encouraging performances from Hull in the first half of this season but given the personnel Lee Radford had to make do without here, it is well within reason to suggest this was their performance of the campaign so far.
Victories at Salford are certainly not the formality they used to be. In the space of eight months, the Red Devils have become one of the league’s most impressive sides, and they sit second in the table on merit as the season passes the halfway stage.
But, for a Hull side without four members of last season’s Super League Dream Team and their star half-back Marc Sneyd, this was an ideal way to prepare for next weekend’s eagerly-awaited Challenge Cup quarter-final with the leaders, Castleford. “We didn’t fight as hard as we did last year in winning it to just give it away,” said the Hull coach Radford, whose side moved back into the top four following this encouraging victory.
It would be foolish though to suggest Salford, one of the league’s real surprise packages this season, are on the slide following back-to-back defeats for the first time in 2017. They too have a cup quarter-final next weekend – but Ian Watson’s side looked noticeably tired here.
Watson has been fortunate in that he has not had a plethora of injuries to contend with this term, but the effects of two double-header weekends in six weeks perhaps took their toll. “They taught us a bit of a lesson,” he lamented afterwards.
The damage was done by the visitors in the first half. They led 22-0 by the interval thanks to tries from Fetuli Talanoa, Danny Washbrook and two for the half-back Albert Kelly. The Australian’s arrival from cross-city rivals Hull KR sparked some debate at the end of last season, but with 17 tries in 16 games so far in a Hull shirt, he has proven an inspired signing.
“He’s a gambler but he’s talented,” Radford said of Kelly. Hull were able to rest him in the final quarter, and while Salford were much improved after the break, tries from Niall Evalds and Weller Hauraki were mere consolation, especially with the visitors responding via Carlos Tuimavave and Jamie Shaul to round off a performance that puts them in good shape for next weekend’s tie with the league leaders.

On the basis that if even Gordon Strachan had abandoned hope of Scotland defeating England then the fixture would be pointless, perhaps the manager’s faith is understandable. History, recent and distant, is hardly in Strachan’s favour: Scotland have beaten England six times in 50 years and taken seven points from five matches in the latest quest to end a miserable absence from major championships.
“I don’t think this is a free hit, I really don’t think it’s like that,” said Strachan. “I genuinely believe we can win the game, I really do. I’d be really disappointed if we didn’t get anything from the game.”
Pressed on what possible evidence Strachan had for this bullish approach, he referenced the 3-0 loss at Wembley in November. Scotland’s showing there has routinely been worthy of more praise than is valid –mainly from the manager.
“I take stuff from the last England game, where we would all agree that there was nothing happening and we were comfortable and doing a lot of things we had worked on,” Strachan explained. “We get a couple of chances, we don’t take them, we could have been in the lead. If big Grant Hanley was playing regularly, he would have put that header in the back of the net and then Gary Cahill loops one in.
“That’s how close we were, so I take that. Then I take the training, the enthusiasm of the training, and what the guys who have had a good season are bringing to the group, all that adds up to feeling good.”
If Scotland are to lose – and the manner of defeat may be more significant than whether it happens – further pressure will surround Strachan’s position. There is a genuine possibility this could be his last match in charge despite, contrary to reports this week, the Scottish Football Association having no shortlist of alternative candidates. Strachan desperately needs a marquee result such as victory over the Auld Enemy to back up regular claims of progress.
Strachan, as is typical, swatted aside any discussion of this game being crucial to his own situation. “I’m OK. I’m fine,” he said. “Funnily enough I want to win for everyone bar myself. So we’re looking after one another.”
England’s record, of an unbeaten qualifying run that stretches to 34 games, is not lost on the Scotland manager but does not seem to be a source of fear.
“I know for a fact that playing for England brings it own stresses and pressures,” he said. “That’s what they have to deal with and so far they have dealt with it well. I’m sure they would have liked to do better at tournaments but qualifying has been terrific. We said getting second would be fine and it’s still the target.”
Strachan is believed to have considered a three-man defence as the most legitimate means of handling England but may feel he lacks the resources to deploy that formation. His two most serious calls would appear to be in the wide right attacking position – where James Forrest and Ryan Fraser are candidates to play –and at centre-forward, with Leigh Griffiths and Chris Martin the options. Martin’s late goal against Slovenia in March kept alive faint hopes of Scotland featuring in next summer’s World Cup.
Craig Gordon, who will start in goal for the hosts, will not lack motivation for a potential meeting with Jermain Defoe. When at Sunderland in 2009, Gordon was involved in a clash with Defoe, then of Tottenham Hotspur, which resulted in the goalkeeper sustaining a broken arm.
“I wasn’t pleased with the challenge,” said Gordon. “It was a long time ago and these things happen in football. There is no way it will have any bearing on this match. I went out to dive at his feet. It was a challenge where he kicked my arm and broke it. He tried to make contact after the game but I wasn’t interested in speaking to him. He did try, to be fair to him.
“It had a lot of impact on the progress I was making in my career at that time. When something as bad as that happens to you in your career – and because of the problems I had after, re-breaking it, I’ve still got the metal work in there from the three operations I needed to fix it – then it’s obviously going to stick with you a bit. Let’s just hope he doesn’t score.”
One quirk of previous encounters may be on Strachan’s side: the presence of his opposite number, Gareth Southgate, in the England team for the visit of Scotland in 1999 was sufficient for Don Hutchison to be belatedly drafted into the visiting lineup at Wembley. Hutchison scored to secure Scotland a 1-0 win.
It is when Dele Alli pulls up his chair and starts to reminisce about his younger days that it becomes apparent, contrary to the image he may project, it has not been an entirely seamless rise to put him the position where he is today – a footballer of rare quality, England international, superstar in the making.
Two months after turning 21, he is thinking back to his days in the academy at Milton Keynes Dons, when he was trying to make a name for himself as a striker. Just not very successfully, as it turned out, judging by his memories of being removed from the team and told he might have to think again.
“I was on the bench a lot in the under-13s and then the manager [Dan Micciche] took the decision to pull me back and put me just in front of the defence. I wasn’t as physically strong as the other boys at the age. He said it was so I could get more space, so I didn’t have to worry about the physical battles and could just focus on my strengths, which at the time were getting on the ball and passing.”
The transition into a more attacking player came when he broke into the first team and, again, when he moved to Tottenham, where he recalls it feeling “strange to be playing so high up the pitch again” and the first call-up from England arrived after six Premier League appearances – a decision that prompted something close to ridicule at the time.
Roy Hodgson might not have got everything right as England manager, but nobody should question why he fast-tracked the player who is now the subject of rumoured interest from some of Europe’s superpowers and has been named the Professional Footballers’ Association young player of the year for the past two seasons. Yes, he was part of the England side that disintegrated against Iceland last summer but there can be no doubt he is one of the players Gareth Southgate wants to shape his team around. Alli will win his 18th cap when England renew acquaintances with Scotland at Hampden Park and it does not need long in his company to realise he is perfectly at ease with his elevated new status.
“I heard someone use this line about something else – that it’s unbelievable, yet believable at the same time. When it’s happening, there are moments when you can’t believe this is happening, but then I think: ‘I’ve worked so hard for so long – so it is believable.’ I wasn’t expecting it to happen so quickly but you can’t wait for time and when you get chucked in at the deep end you have to make sure you take the chance.”
He sounds supremely confident but grounded, too, smiling shyly when it is pointed out he has a better goals and assists record than Paul Scholes or Steven Gerrard at the same age and noting he has “a lot to achieve before I can start thinking I’m as good as them”. Later he chastises himself for starting last season slowly – a hangover, he says, from the club’s unsuccessful pursuit of Leicester City and the ordeal of Euro 2016, a tournament he would sooner forget.
“It wasn’t really until I come back here [with England], and Gareth coming in, that I’ve even talked about it,” he says of that Iceland game. “Until then you don’t really want to talk about it, or even think about it, because it’s such a hard thing. “It still makes your heart go and, even now, you get a lump in your throat but it’s important, as a team, that when something like that happens you need to go through it and see where we went wrong. I’m sure Gareth is aware of how hard it is to talk about it as players, with it being such a low point in our careers, but it’s important that we do go to those dark places.”
His analysis of last season is that Spurs were “phenomenal”, even if they do not have any silverware to show for it, but it is tempting to wonder what he makes of the idea of a move abroad. “People get too worried about where they are going to end up sometimes, then lose focus on the journey and don’t enjoy it. I’m signed to Tottenham and I’m enjoying it. “Who knows where I am going to end up, whether I stay at Tottenham for the rest of my career or if I do happen to go somewhere else. I’m sure if it happens, if I do go somewhere else, it will be at a time when I think that’s what’s needed. But I am just looking forward to enjoying the journey.”
He is keeping his options open, in other words, but there is still plenty of time for all that when, lest it be forgotten, he will be one of the younger players on the pitch at Hampden Park, a game that leads to the inevitable question about whether someone with his temperament can be trusted to keep control.
“I know there are a lot of mixed opinions, but that’s the player I am,” he says. “When I was younger I always used to get into tackles and if Dan could see me losing my temper he’d pull me off the pitch straight away and put me in the sin-bin. It’s something that has always been in my game and it’s not something I’m looking to change. “Maybe if I didn’t have that in my game I wouldn’t have achieved as much as I have done so far at this age. You don’t want players to think they can walk all over you … it’s important you stand your ground.”
That, however, does not mean he is oblivious to the fact he has crossed the line in the past. “There are things I regret, like the West Brom one,” he says, referring to the off-the-ball incident with Claudio Yacob that resulted in a retrospective three-match ban for violent conduct. “After that game I regretted it straight away. It was one of those moments I have learned from and I’ve not done anything like that again.
“There was also the challenge in the Europa League [a red-card tackle on Gent’s Brecht Dejaegere]. I know it looked really bad – and it was a really bad tackle – but I also know I would never go out to hurt someone. It was just a poorly timed tackle. “I apologised to the guy straight away. To be doing a challenge like that is horrible. Horrible for me as well, to think about it. I apologised and felt sorry and I’ve learnt from it; it was a mistake.”
Chris Coleman has admitted that the pain of losing 6-1 against Serbia five years ago will never leave him as the Wales manager returns to the country for a crucial World Cup qualifier in Belgrade with a warning for his players that they need to deal with a hostile atmosphere and those periods when their opponents are enjoying a “power play”.
Sitting third in Group D and trailing Serbia and the Republic of Ireland by four points with five matches remaining, Wales have little margin for error on Sunday night in Belgrade, where a defeat would leave their hopes of qualifying for next year’s World Cup finals in Russia hanging by a thread.
The task is made considerably harder because Coleman will be without Gareth Bale, his most influential player, through suspension as well as Neil Taylor, who is serving a two-match ban. To compound matters, Hal Robson-Kanu withdrew from the squad on Thursday and added his name to an injury list that includes James Collins, Andy King and Ben Woodburn, leaving Wales looking rather depleted, especially in attack.
Although Coleman refuses to be downbeat and remains sanguine about the team’s prospects in Belgrade and beyond, he is prepared for the fact that Serbia will evoke some painful memories. The Wales manager admitted that everything came flooding back when he paid a visit to the country in March.
“It was only a recce but I had butterflies in my stomach: ‘Here we go, I remember this place,’” Coleman said, recalling the chastening defeat in Novi Sad that led to many Wales supporters calling for his resignation. “I can’t say this is another game in the group because it’s not for more than one reason. And one of the reasons is that [game in 2012]. I suffered there, we suffered there – and it was my fault. That will never leave me. Nor should it. It will be like that if I went back to Belgrade with my wife for the weekend.
“But I can’t wait for this game. I know it’s going to be tough but I like meeting those challenges. With Balo in the team or not, I can’t guarantee a win. And we’re desperate for a win. But what we must do is perform. We have to stand up to them and not go away with our tails between our legs having missed the game, because that’s unacceptable. I won’t accept that, but I don’t expect it from these players. For some time now they’ve stepped up to the mark.”
Although Coleman admitted Wales would miss the experience and knowhow the absent senior players could have provided, he pointed to the presence of Ashley Williams, the captain he described as a “natural born leader”, to set an example to others that they must “do anything but turn away from the challenge”.
Coleman added: “You go to these places and it’s almost like there’s a stage in the game where there’s a power play. All of a sudden, from wherever it comes, the crowd start getting really rowdy, the opposition up the tempo for five or 10 minutes and they bombard you. You stand up to it or you duck it. There’s no third option.
“This will come in Belgrade, I know it will before we kick a ball, and that’s what we’ll talk about with our players. You need to answer all the questions physically, mentally and tactically. It’s international football, your country against their country. It’s not war but it’s what you stand up for and what they stand up for and bang, it comes together. Something’s got to give and it’s whoever’s capable or not of mentally standing up to it.”
Manchester United’s hopes of signing Álvaro Morata have received a significant boost after the striker told Real Madrid he would like a move to Old Trafford. However, negotiations between the clubs may not be straightforward because of friction relating to David de Gea.
United have frustrated Madrid’s attempts to sign the goalkeeper and fear the Spanish club will drive a hard bargain over Morata as a result. The De Gea issue has led to a strained relationship in the past, with a proposed move breaking down in 2015.
United are not willing to pay more than around £60m for Morata, who is optimistic a deal can be struck. The 24-year-old is due to go on honeymoon in just over a week and would like the transfer to be concluded before then.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s release by United was confirmed on Friday and José Mourinho wants to secure a replacement striker as swiftly as possible. The manager worked with Morata at Madrid and has made the Spain international his principal target. United had an opening offer of £52m turned down this week by Madrid, who held talks with Morata’s representative, Juanma López, on Friday.
López is understood to have informed Madrid’s general director, José Ángel Sánchez, that the player who scored 20 goals in all competitions this season has decided to leave in search of regular first-team football. Morata, who came through Madrid’s youth sides before being sold to Juventus in 2014, started 14 times in La Liga during this campaign having rejoined the club in the summer and suspects his opportunities at the Bernabéu could be even more limited next season.
Morata has been convinced by Mourinho that Old Trafford is the best place to restart his career. Interest from Chelsea has not been followed up and, although Milan have emerged as suitors, Morata is determined to play in the Premier League.
Mourinho gave Morata his first-team debut at Madrid in December 2010 but Morata left for Juventus having made 37 La Liga appearances in nearly four seasons. The release of Ibrahimovic followed a serious knee injury sustained by the 35-year-old in the Europa League semi-final tie against Anderlecht in April. He is expected to be out until early 2018 and will continue his rehabilitation at United.
United are also interested in Internazionale’s winger Ivan Perisic after lodging a €40m offer. Inter are holding out for €55m and, while negotiations continue, the Torino striker Andrea Belotti remains an option as Mourinho seeks to rebuild his attacking options. Reports in Portugal on Friday claimed that a £30m move for the Benfica defender Victor Lindelof could be back on.
The fight between Mercedes and Ferrari remains finely poised at the front of the Formula One grid as Canada hosts round seven of the season this weekend. Certainly there was little to choose between them in practice on Friday at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve with Lewis Hamilton edging out Sebastian Vettel in the morning and Kimi Raikkonen ahead of the British driver in the afternoon but, behind them the gulf to the midfield teams remains a chasm.
It is in danger of becoming even more pronounced. The Williams chief technical officer Paddy Lowe has warned that the spending differential to the top teams is greater than ever and the sport’s senior management addressed the issue in Canada. Williams are currently in sixth place in the constructors’ championship. They have a quick car but they and their contemporaries on the grid are still two seconds off the pace of the leaders, not a gap that can be bridged while the financial disparity remains so drastic.
“We face a gulf of spending that has probably never been seen before in the sport,” said Lowe, whose first stint with Williams concluded in 1992 with Nigel Mansell winning the title. “It was a great reward to us that we came and beat McLaren. We knew they had a lot more money than us and we did a better job than them. But the distortion we have today is on another level. Probably a factor of two-and-a-half times in expenditure between the leading teams and the first of the independents. That seems like a gulf that is difficult to cross, certainly in a sustained way.”
Estimated figures from 2016 back him up, with Williams spending £100m to the £265m of Mercedes, £225m of Ferrari and £215m of Red Bull. Lowe has first hand experience of some of this largesse, having been technical director at Mercedes between 2013 and 2016. “It is clear something has to be done about that,” he said.
Williams are celebrating their 40th anniversary this year and the team are still held in high regard. Thirty-thousand fans turned out last week to attend a day at Silverstone for a display of their cars. The circuit will host a similar event at the British Grand Prix and the fans’ reaction will doubtless be similarly enthusiastic. But they have not won a title since 1997 and, as things stand, are not in the mix to do so again. Chase Carey, the chief executive of the Formula One group, acknowledged the issue on Friday in Montreal and insisted it was being addressed. “There is no question right now that there is a disparity in spending that is quite wide,” he said. “There are amounts being spent at the top that even the teams that are spending it would recognise it is tough to rationalise. It creates issues because it undermines the competitive balance of the sport.”
He was backed by F1’s director of motorsports, Ross Brawn, who also agreed that changes would occur but within parameters. “We don’t want to dumb Formula One down,” he said. “We don’t want all the teams to be exactly the same, there should still be the Ferrari, the Mercedes, the Red Bulls, the teams you aspire to beat but we don’t want domination. We need an environment where if a team does a really good job it can do well. We don’t want a situation where financial power enables a team to get a dominant position, as has happened in the last few years.”
Rob Smedley, Williams’ head of vehicle performance, joined the team from Ferrari having been with the Scuderia just as Brawn and Jean Todt were helping Michael Schumacher to his fifth consecutive title in 2004. He believes the current structure of F1 is a direct consequence of that period noting the role Brawn, the poacher now turned gamekeeper, played.
“It is essential F1 should not just be how much you spend. Williams showed you didn’t have to be the richest team but that it’s become less about that was probably created by my old team when Ross and Jean built a team around finding marginal gains,” he said. “F1 should be about engineering excellence and brave drivers going toe to toe on the track.”
The task is a considerable one. Damon Hill won his title with Williams in 1996 and recognises how much the landscape of the sport has changed. “It is very difficult for a team like Williams to break the stranglehold that Ferrari and Mercedes have,” he said.
The perennial problem is one of coaxing agreement from teams with vested interests but Hill believes it will be dealt with because of commercial expediency. “F1 is as much about teams competing as it is about drivers,” he added. “[Owners] Liberty see this as entertainment and their buck comes from the racing and if there is no bang they don’t get people watching.”
The long, lank boy in lane three is rigid with nerves. Understandably, given he is 15 years old and racing in the World Junior Championships 200m final against athletes three years his senior. Technically he is a mess too. When he runs his neck is cocked back and tilted rightwards, as if he has slept awkwardly and missed an osteopath’s appointment. It barely matters. As he rounds the bend he suddenly goes supersonic to win in 20.61 sec.
In front of his home fans at the National Stadium in Kingston, Usain Bolt has just become the youngest junior world champion in history.
On Saturday night, 15 years on from that golden hello, Bolt returns to the same stadium for his farewell race in Jamaica. They are calling it “Salute to a Legend”, and for once the hyperbole is not misplaced. Over 30,000 will watch a star-studded undercard, including Britain’s double Olympic champion Mo Farah, the double Olympic 800m gold medallist David Rudisha, and the 400m world record holder Wayde van Niekerk, and then party long into the night with dancehall stars such as Beenie Man and Ding Dong. As always, though, Bolt will take centre stage.
But, as he admits, saying goodbye – and coming to terms with his own sporting mortality – is going to be “emotional”. “I live to make my country proud,” he adds. “When I was growing up my idols were Don Quarrie and Herb McKenley. I watched these guys dominating on the track, and working hard and I just wanted to be like them. I wanted to put my country on the map. Wherever I go in the world and see Jamaicans and they tell me I make them feel proud, and for me that is a big honour.”
In truth, Bolt’s 100m race at 10.10pm local time will be more of a celebration than a contest. His most dangerous rivals, including Olympic silver medallist Yohan Blake and the young South African sensation Akani Simbine, who has dipped under 10 seconds six times in 2017, have been planted in a much tougher 100m earlier in the evening. He will win. And win well.
He started at 15 on a winning note and he wants to leave the sport on a winning note
Even so, it will still serve as a useful barometer given that Bolt has not raced competitively since January and missed training for nearly three weeks following the death of his close friend, the British high jumper, Germaine Mason. With the world championships in London two months away, he needs to make a statement. As his father, Wellesley, puts it: “He started at 15 on a winning note and he wants to leave the sport on a winning note. So his main aim is to win here and be in London.”
It is hard to overstate the outpouring of love and pride Jamaicans have for Bolt. In dozens of conversations the same phrases are uttered like mantras, especially “People person” and “Makes our country proud.” There is also no doubt among Jamaicans that, despite the chequered history of the 100m and doping, Bolt has done everything the right way.
And at the Spartan Health Club where Bolt does regular cardio, fat-burning and step sessions (although he draws the line at the Friday evening burlesque class), his personal trainer, Steve Ming, insists that what you see is what you get. “The moment he walks in, he lights up the room,” says Ming, who has known Bolt since he was a scrawny teenager. “There’s a big rivalry inside the gym between Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea. We are the [Manchester] United crew and he’s a United supporter. So when Arsenal are losing he will walk in and start joking. He’s just a normal person.” The owner of the gym, Andro Henry, adds that Bolt’s other big passion is Japanese manga comics – especially Naruto and Bleach – and that Bolt “talks to everyone”.
The Jamaican minister of culture, gender, entertainment and sport, Olivia Grange, goes further still. She believes Bolt ranks alongside Bob Marley as the biggest star to ever come out of the country. “Anywhere around the world you go, if you say ‘Jamaica’ they say ‘Bob’ and ‘Bolt’,” she says. “We have a saying: ‘we’re little but we are tallawah’, which means we maybe small but we are awesome. It’s wonderful that Jamaica – which is such a small country – has such an awesome presence through its music and track and field.”
It helps, too, that Bolt is considered humble and willing to do so much for charity. As Andre Lowe, the sports editor of the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, puts it: “He’s not your quintessential mega-rich, diva-type superstar. He loves kids and that’s why helping to improve the quality of life for Jamaican kids is such a big part of his charity efforts. There’s a joke – if you want to get Bolt to appear anywhere, tell him there will be kids there.”
But in Jamaica they know that the 6ft 5in star will cast a long shadow when he retires after London - especially given that he has contributed to 40% of the country’s medals at Olympic Games and world championships since 2008. True, there is a long treadmill of talent, but few dispute that freaks such as Bolt come along once in a generation. “We will certainly miss his dominance,” admits Lowe. “His international appeal, his personality … these are things that all added to brand Jamaica, these are all things that we will no longer be able to point to.”
Bolt, meanwhile, is yet to make any firm plans for retirement. His coach, Glen Mills, wants him to take over as coach of the Racers Club, but he has always shown a certain reluctance for early morning starts. And while the Jamaican government says he is pushing at an open door if he wants to go into politics, he insists that it is not for him and he “tries to stay as far as possible away from that.”
Even so, the sports minister is still hoping that Bolt will continue to do his bit for Jamaica in the future. “I wish he would change his mind,” she says, before adding, with a twinkle in her eye. “But if not, I look forward to him settling down and making a family with some little Bolts.”
A former member of the Newcastle United youth football system has appeared in court charged with 29 historical sex offences committed over the 25-year period from 1973 to 1998.
George Ormond, 61, also a coach at the Montagu and North Fenham boys football club during that period, appeared by videolink at North Tyneside magistrates court on Friday. He is charged with 28 offences of indecent assault committed on boys aged under and over 16, and one charge of buggery on a 15 year-old-boy, alleged to have been committed between 1982 and 1983. Ormond, wearing black steel-rimmed spectacles, with grey hair in a side parting, a greying beard and wearing an open-necked blue shirt, spoke at the five-minute hearing only to confirm his name, age and current address in Devon and to say that he understood the charges and conditions of the court hearing.
Of the charges 10 alleged victims of indecent assault were under 14 when the offences took place; the youngest was aged 11 at the time. Eight of the indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed on boys aged between 14 and 16; a further 10 charges relate to young men who were over 16 at the time. The charges collectively relate to alleged offences committed against 17 different victims over the 25-year period.
None of the victims can be named for legal reasons. The chair of the magistrates, Lillian Molloy, informed Ormond, who is on bail without conditions, that he will appear next on 7 July at Newcastle crown court.
In 1939 the Football League made the wearing of numbers on the backs of shirts mandatory, and in 1951 it officially allowed footballs, previously a shade of mud brown that given the state of many pitches at the time must have been extremely unhelpful, to be white. These novelties stand as two steps on football’s long journey to modernity though superficially they have little in common, separated as they were by 12 years and a world war. In fact, however, they were introduced in a single pioneering week during the pre-season of 1927, a time of wild experimentation which appears to have gone forgotten or unnoticed in the game’s many histories and timelines.
Herbert Chapman, who had already won two leagues titles and an FA Cup with Huddersfield Town and was in due course to repeat that feat at Arsenal, has been credited with playing a decisive role in both. In fact he seems to have been supportive but only tangentially involved, with credit for player numbers more rationally belonging with Chelsea’s manager, David Calderhead, his chairman, Claude Kirby, and later with Everton’s William Cuff, and for the white ball with a certain Mr EL Roberts of Kingsland, Shrewsbury.
At the end of July 1927 Roberts, a humble reader, wrote to the Athletic News to “draw the attention of the Football Association and all lovers of the game to the desirability of changing the colour of the football, which I have no doubt whatever will meet with universal approval”. A white ball, he suggested, would not only be more visible but also inherently more exciting. “The attraction would be to see a white globe travelling low and high,” he suggested, “with its twists and turns increasing our interest and excitement as it goes towards the goal.”
Ivan Sharpe, once of Derby County, Leeds United and Watford and a member of Britain’s gold medal-winning football team at the 1912 Olympics, was editing the paper at the time. So taken was he with this idea that in his next edition he not only published the letter in full, but also an editorial at the top of the front page. “A ball of white leather … has advantages for spectators and players,” it read. “On sunny days the players probably would find it more difficult to see than the ball now used, but as the bright days of the English winter, as in the modern summer, are comparatively few, more might be gained than lost. In the murky weather characteristic of the football season it is probable that the white ball would be a very welcome innovation to spectators. The idea seems fanciful, but is worthy of thought.”
This is where Chapman came in. He, along with several other managers, was sufficiently intrigued to test white balls in pre-season friendlies that summer. “We realise the possibilities of the suggestion appearing in the Athletic News,” he said, “and intend to explore them as fully as possible.” He did, however, admit that “I doubt it will ever be done in league matches”. “It certainly is a novel suggestion,” said the FA secretary, Frederick Wall, when challenged to declare it illegal. “There is nothing in the laws of the game to prevent a white ball being used, and as it is a practice game I personally see no objection.”
It wasn’t a completely novel idea. There are records of white-painted balls being used in games dating back to the end of the 19th century, and they were already in occasional use on the continent. Derby had come across one on a pre-season tour of the Netherlands in 1925: when dusk fell during a game against Ajax, making the brown ball hard to make out, a white replacement was thrown on to the field. The tourists kicked it back off again, refusing to play with “a lump of whitewash”. This time, however, the English game was a little more receptive. Only, however, a little.
Reading were among the first to try it, and no one there was particularly impressed. The referee, JV Pennington, said that “it is difficult to express a definite opinion after one trial” but also that “I am satisfied that it would severely handicap the goalkeeper on a bright day” and, puzzlingly, that “a ball painted white is dangerous to players heading it”. The Reading captain, Robert Eggo, sniffed: “I cannot see that a white ball is any advantage, and on a bright sunny day it might easily prove a distinct disadvantage.” Their manager, Andrew Wylie, declared the whole idea “a piece of nonsense – only a fad”.
The Guardian reported that of other trials that weekend, at Clapton Orient it “was a distinct disappointment, with the players complaining of finding difficulty in sighting it in the grey weather”, while at Huddersfield the white paint was swiftly rubbed off the ball, which “assumed the ordinary hue long before the end”, and at Blackpool players “were emphatic in expressing their dislike of the innovation”.
Arsenal played the first half of their game with a ball covered with shiny, enamel paint – the same stuff that was applied to golf balls – and the second half with one with a matt finish. The Athletic News’ correspondent “noticed particularly how the ball showed up against the dark background of the spectators standing on the popular terracing”, and declared “it was obvious that on a really dull day the white ball would be an enormous advantage from a spectators’ point of view”.
Those actually on the field, however, were less overwhelmed. The referee, WT Guttridge, described “one occasion when I entirely lost the ball as it flashed across the white crossbar”, and complained that “I found it even more difficult to follow when it travelled level with the players’ white knickers”. Billy Blyth, the Arsenal captain, said of the enamelled ball that “all the players agree it was impossible to control, slithering off the toe at all angles. So far as visibility was concerned, we could see the ball splendidly when it was on the ground, but it was a strain following its flight at a height.”
“We made the experiment as an experiment, and we are not going on with it,” declared Chapman. “I would not go so far as to say it was unsatisfactory, but it was not successful enough to justify any departure from tradition.”
The league season kicked off with balls unchanged and that, it seemed, was that. “The probabilities are that we have heard the last of the white football,” read an editorial in the Burnley News. “A proposal that seems to have had its origin in the craze for novelty, it only required the light of actual experience to demonstrate its futility. On Saturday the white ball was used on several grounds, and in all cases the experiment may be said to have been a complete failure. The experiment has met with a chorus of condemnation, and we may take it for granted that the white ball has been kicked for the last time.”
Calderhead had been one of the white ball’s vocal critics, perhaps because he was concentrating on alternative innovations, with his Chelsea side preparing to experiment for the first time with the use of numbered jerseys in a trial match the following Monday. Though it had been witnessed in a couple of amateur internationals at club level this was a true first, and though Calderhead declared it “certainly helpful, particularly from the spectator’s point of view” he said he was “not certain if it is worth putting it up to the Football Association council”.
This too had a hostile reception. Sidney King, manager of West Ham United, said numbers made “players look like horses and jockeys”, while Tottenham Hotspur’s Billy Minter said that “in my long experience of football, I have always found the crowd able to pick out any man after a glance at the programme”. Walter Hart, Birmingham president, declared it “hideous” and Wall, on behalf of the FA, declared the idea “very undesirable and unnecessary”. Chapman, a good friend of Calderhead’s, was a lone supportive voice. “I don’t see how the idea can be otherwise than useful,” he said, even if “the innovation would hardly be necessary”.
A year later both Chelsea and Arsenal wore numbers in their first league games of the season. That day the great football writer James Catton wrote an article in support of the novelty. “The objects of every club should be to play the game and give the greatest possible pleasure to those who throng the seats and terraces,” he wrote. “It is difficult to understand why some clubs are strongly objecting to a proposed change which is of great help to everybody on all occasions. The convenience of the public should be paramount.”
Not likely. Though Chelsea surveyed 700 fans after their game and received unanimous support for numbering, and the Guardian reported that “the spectators approved of a practice that should have become general years ago” because “the personality of a scoring forward in a ‘crush’ goal is not always revealed by the shape of his back”, the League immediately banned them. Chelsea, though, did not give up, and in 1929 wore numbers on a tour of Brazil, earning the nickname Los Numerados.
“I can see nothing whatever against the numbering of players and I hope to see this agreed at the annual League meeting,” their chairman, Claude Kirby, said in 1928. “League football has many new and powerful rivals to contend with, and we cannot afford to miss any opportunity of popularising it. I am convinced that thousands of casual spectators would become regular followers if they had this easy means of identifying players.”
His fellow chairmen were unmoved, but the idea never went away. There was some support at the FA, whose honorary treasurer, Arthur Kingscott, had seen numbers in use while acting as tour manager on a trip to Canada in 1926 and returned to declare that “at first I did not like the idea” but that “in the end I came to the conclusion that it was an excellent idea, and it enabled the crowd to follow closely the movement of every player”.
In January 1933 Tottenham were allowed to wear numbers for their FA Cup third-round match against Watford, which they won 7-1, and that March they were worn in a trial match between England’s first and second XIs at Fratton Park, leading to larger versions being used in the FA Cup final the following month between Everton, who wore 1-11 starting with the goalkeeper at No1 and ending with the outside-left, and Manchester City, who took 12-22 starting with their outside-left and ending with their goalkeeper, Len Langford, at No22.
The idea was debated and rejected by the Football League later that year (“What the advantage would be it is hard to conceive,” sniffed the Times) and the next time numbers were seen at Wembley was in 1939 (“It makes the game so much easier to follow that one wonders why players in League matches are not also allowed to be numbered,” enthused the Times), a couple of months before the league finally made them compulsory, the motion proposed by the Everton chairman, new league president and long-term numbering advocate, William Cuff, and carried by 24-20.
White balls would get their turn, though they had to wait a while. The late 1940s saw several colour-based oddities, with the winter of 1946-47, the snowiest of the 20th century, prompting Southend to paint their touchlines red and Reading to turn their goalposts blue, and soon alternatives to brown leather balls were being considered once again.
Of particular importance on the white ball’s road to acceptance was a televised match between England and Italy at White Hart Lane in 1949 when a white ball was used in fading light towards the end at the insistence of the Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, who felt that “against the background of high stands at White Hart Lane the ordinary ball becomes almost invisible in the air when the night is falling”.
After that game the league’s secretary, F Howarth, sniffed that “I do not think the ball offered many advantages over the ordinary one”, but it had been well received by the watching public and the FA resolved to keep experimenting: in February 1950 England B played Switzerland B at Hillsborough with a bright yellow ball being used in the first half, and a garish orange one in the second. The big push came the following year, the first to see top-level competitive floodlit football. It was under lights that the white ball really, in every sense, shone.
In 1951 the League permitted their use, but their introduction was haphazard. Initially most games started, according to tradition, with a brown ball, a white one being brought out only if it got a bit gloomy – the Guardian described the latter stages of one Chelsea game that year as being “like watching a ping-pong ball bobbing about in a darkened room”. But there was a catch. Back in 1927 one ball manufacturer was quoted as saying that it was, in his opinion, “practically impossible to make a white football”. By 1951 a solution had been found, which involved a different tanning process, the application of a layer of white paint, and then a layer of cellulose. The first layer made the ball white, the second protected the first from damage. It also, and quite accidentally, protected the ball from water: traditional versions might increase in weight by as much as 20% on a wet day, but white ones remained impervious. It was a discovery that was to change the game.
It certainly changed some games. In 1951, for example, an amateur international between England and Wales was tied at 1-1 with 15 minutes to play and the two teams battling to hoof a sodden leather ball around a muddy pitch, when a white ball was called for. England duly skipped to a 4-1 victory.
In 1952 the Sunderland Echo asserted that the ball particularly helped players who were “smaller in build and favouring a short-passing game”.
“Big players given an advantage on mud declare that this compensates them for the start and finish of the season when conditions favour smaller men,” it wrote. “They insist that the light ball, used as a counter to mud, penalises them.”
In 1953 the FA recommended that white balls should be used from the start or not at all, though this remained at the referee’s discretion. That November, Hungary showed quite how much it assisted more technical players when they put a white ball into the England net six times at Wembley.
The greatest possible advert for their use came with the arrival of another Hungarian team the following year, for what must surely rank among the most important friendlies in the history of the game, most probably at No1. The match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Honved was to inspire L’Équipe to propose a European Cup, which started in 1955, and an eight-year-old George Best to become a Wolves fan, as an estimated 12 million people watched the BBC’s broadcast of the second half, a rare glimpse of televised football beyond the FA Cup final and occasional internationals.
With his team 2-0 down at the interval the Wolves manager, Stan Cullis, sent his groundsmen and apprentices (including a 15-year-old Ron Atkinson) out at half-time to drench the pitch with water, and with the resulting bog frustrating the swift-passing Hungarians his side utilised more direct tactics to battle back to a thrilling, dramatic 3-2 victory.
The 1958 World Cup was the first to utilise a white ball, and the battle was effectively over, the sympathies of supporters made crystal clear two years later when the later stages of Burnley’s title-clinching 2-1 win over Manchester City at Maine Road were soundtracked by both sides’ fans singing “white ball, white ball” as they strained to keep track of the brown one.
Back in 1927, the often outspoken and always readable Derby Telegraph columnist bylined An Outside Right took aim at footballing novelties. “I am among the large army of football enthusiasts who regard the attempt to introduce such innovations as white balls and identity numbers for players as the mere vapourings of people who are not happy unless they are being given something novel. There is nothing wrong with the game. Let us get on with it. Players ought to be numbered, should they? Here is a proposition put forward by someone who, like the sponsor of the white ball idea, ought to see an optician, and yet wishes to evade that expense by football helping him out.
“The one great objection to players being numbered is that spectators would take a superficial, rather than an intelligent, interest in the game. Under existing conditions spectators have to exert their powers of observation and intelligence in order to follow correctly the play and the players. Make this [too] easy for them and there will be no fun in it. Man is a hunter; half the fun is in the actual hunt. I am against anything that makes football too easy a spectacle to watch and follow. Football will soon go to the dogs if the football administrators give ear to the faddists.”
Over the 90 years since those words were written the football administrators haven’t just given ear to the faddists but eyes, nose and mouth as well. Heaven knows what he would have made of the modern game, but an Outside Right would surely admit that he got this call wrong.
Mark Sampson says he believes “the most together team will be the last to go home” as England Women begin a month‑long training camp before the European Championship this summer. With hopes high after England’s third-place finish at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, Sampson says players and staff are focused on being “the best on the planet” and have not discussed any outcome other than winning the trophy.
Speaking before preparations that include friendlies, the first of which is on Saturday away against Switzerland, and a warm-weather training camp in Spain, Sampson said: “I think that the key quality in this tournament will be togetherness. The most together team will definitely be the team that is last to go home.
“We’ll be working hard on the training pitch to make sure we’re fit, to make sure we understand what we’re trying to do and to make sure that whatever the opponent throws at us we’ve got the relevant weapons to find a way to win. Refusing to go home, find a way to win, and staying together.
“I believe this team has the ability to be the best in the world, 100%. There’s been nothing on my mind since the final whistle of the [World Cup] semi-final than how we’re going to win this event. I’ve never once discussed with the players about getting through the group, of getting to this stage or whatever. It’s about winning.
“That’s no guarantee we’ll win. – of course it’s not. We might lose our first two and be eliminated. But our focus is completely on doing everything we can to give us the best possible chance to win this event.”
Sampson earned criticism from inside the women’s game after he named his 23-strong squad three months before the tournament and before the Spring Series, the climactic event in a reshaped Women’s Super League. Yet the England manager defended his decision and said the announcement was a necessary part of the squad’s preparation.
“I’ve got to give huge credit to the players,” he said. “They were all made aware of the announcement and their confirmed places in the squad early and I think the work they have put in has been incredibly diligent and professional. I’ve been really impressed with their level of performance [in the Spring Series] but I’ve also been impressed by their work away from the field. This was always the intention, to do the work behind the scenes that makes the big difference when you’re put in front of all the cameras.
“We said we need to rip into each other and have a right good go at this Spring Series. We said we had to compete, to tackle, to fight, to push each other. I think we arrive now with the right balance between toughness and freshness.”
England are planning to stay to the end of a tournament being hosted by the Netherlands and which begins on 16 July. “We’re looking at it that we’re away from 5 June to 7 August which seems a really long time,” Sampson said. “So we try to have a good balance as to when we switch on. When we do switch on with this team we demand the highest of standards, work ethic, competitiveness, learning – all the key qualities to be the best on the planet. But when we switch off we want to have fun, we want to enjoy ourselves and we’ve got a great balance, I think.
“I’m excited by the programme we’ve got, but like anything it’s great to see it on paper, but it’s the people that make it come alive. That’s the staff, that’s the players, that have to make it come alive and make it the best possible preparation camp they’ve ever had.”

A top New Zealand official says Warren Gatland is among the potential candidates to succeed Steve Hansen as the All Blacks’ head coach, particularly if the British & Irish Lions achieve a stunning series win. New Zealand Rugby’s chief executive, Steve Tew, has also said the visitors remain a serious threat in the Test matches and, even if they lose heavily, that the future of Lions tours will not be endangered.
The experienced Tew, whose spell at the helm of NZR has coincided with the All Blacks winning back-to-back World Cups, has acknowledged that assistant, Ian Foster, is in pole position should Hansen confirm his intention to step down after the 2019 tournament in Japan. If New Zealand were to suffer an unscheduled wobble, however, Tew anticipates Gatland’s name entering the frame.
“Ian Foster is sitting there as a very strong candidate when Steve does finish but there’ll be others,” said Tew, suggesting that the overseas-based Gatland, Joe Schmidt and Vern Cotter would be potential alternatives. “Joe is sitting in Ireland and we’d like to have him back. Vern is coaching at a very high level and you wouldn’t rule Gatty out either.”
Asked whether Gatland’s stock would rise appreciably if the Lions won the Test series, Tew replied: “You’ll have to ask Warren what he wants to do next. We don’t know what Steve’s doing yet but what we will do is manage the transition very well. We’ll be sitting down later this year to work out the process.”
The notion of Gatland taking over from Hansen might sound improbable to many in New Zealand but there is considerable respect for his successful stints in charge of Wales, Wasps and the 2013 Lions in Australia. “I’m still of the view this is a very good Lions team and once they get together they’ll be very tough in this Test series,” said Tew.
“I think the physical attrition of the series is going to take its toll. One team will come through that better than the other.”
The commercial benefits to New Zealand Rugby of staging a Lions tour are similarly striking and, unsurprisingly, Tew wants his country to host another in 2029. “It’s unique and something that’s worth preserving. The current contract between the Lions and Sanzar (South African, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) runs out after this tournament and needs to be renegotiated but the commitment from all of us is that the Lions are locked into the calendar.”
More contentiously he has dismissed switching to a 16-year cycle to allow Argentina, now part of the Rugby Championship, to host the Lions before 2033 at the earliest. “We’re not currently anticipating Argentina coming into it because there’s a history of them touring to the three countries.”
World Rugby’s vice-chairman, Agustín Pichot, feels otherwise, with the possibility of arranging early tour games in North America clearly an option, but the three leading southern hemisphere unions are, to varying degrees, kept financially afloat by the Lions. “In 16 years time it might change but I think you’d struggle to run a Lions tour with a meaningful schedule in Argentina,” said Tew. “There’s no doubt our good friend Mr Pichot has his eyes on the Lions but I don’t think that would involve turning it into a 16-year cycle. That’s not on our radar.”
Nor, predictably, is backing a Super Rugby franchise in the Pacific Islands – “In the immediate future I can’t see how you could sustain a professional team in a Pacific Island unless, financially, there’s significant private intervention” – but as recently as the past week Tew has had discussions with South African officials about rugby’s future viability across the southern hemisphere. “It’s not as simple as saying they [South Africa] want to leave Sanzar. I’ve asked that question in the last week. The complication for the southern hemisphere is that we all live so far apart. It’s an enormous cost.
“One of the things we’ve learnt [from Super Rugby] is to be careful about expansion. The Aussies, the South Africans and to a degree the Japanese are learning that the hard way.”
Tew has reaffirmed the All Blacks will continue to play financial hardball when it comes to negotiating deals to play Tests in the northern hemisphere. Despite not having agreed to play England on tour this autumn, discussions with the RFU’s chief executive, Ian Ritchie, proved informative. “We know that when we play at Twickenham you can ratchet the turnstiles up. Ian and I had a good commercial conversation so I’ve now got a good idea what the real number looks like. We certainly had a conversation about a fee that was higher than we’d ever had before. That’ll sit in the system until the next time we come back and discuss it.”
One of the great contrasts of the Olympic Games is that while they bring out the best in athletes, they often bring out the worst in host cities. This past week offered a sharp reminder of this dynamic, with fresh revelations that the National Security Agency engaged in indiscriminate surveillance during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. This was no mere quirk of history. The Olympics-induced state of exception has long afforded government authorities enormous leeway to break norms and bend laws.
If, as appears likely, Paris and Los Angeles are awarded the 2024 and 2028 Games respectively, the cities should bear in mind the events in Salt Lake City and not sleepwalk to the optimistic rhythms of the IOC. It’s time to face up to the past and make big asks for the future.
The NSA, according to former executive and whistleblower Thomas Drake, was not merely scooping up metadata during the Salt Lake City Games, alarming as even that would be. Drake said of the warrantless dragnet: “Virtually all electronic communication signals that went into or out of one of those designated areas were captured and stored by the NSA, including the contents of emails and text messages.” Drake’s input is part of a lawsuit brought in 2015 by former Salt Lake City mayor Rocky Anderson alleging an overreaching mass surveillance program that vacuumed up data on millions of innocent people.
Drake’s disclosure adds detail to what former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed in 2013, that according to government documents, the NSA met with higher-ups from “COMPANY E” ahead of the Games. As part of the President’s Surveillance Program, “NSA asked COMPANY E to provide call detail records in support of security for the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.” The CEO of “COMPANY E,” which turned out to be Denver-based Qwest, fully cooperated. Another document from the Snowden surveillance archive makes it clear that Salt Lake City was no one-off: “NSA has had an active role in the Olympics since 1984 Los Angeles games, and has seen its involvement increase with the recent games in Atlanta, Sydney, and Salt Lake City.”
The lesson for everyday people in aspiring host cities is threefold. First, governments are perfectly willing to use the Games to test-drive new methods and technologies, publicly denying it all the while. Second, private companies are more than willing to go along for the ride. Finally, the truth can take years to unearth.
Since the 2002 Salt Lake City Games – the last time the US hosted the Olympics – the country has cartwheeled forward with intensified surveillance measures. This should fuel serious public concern in Los Angeles. But the only group raising the issue is NOlympics LA, led by activists from the Democratic Socialists of America and their coalition allies. The LA bidding team simply avoids the subject.
The truth is that the Olympics are at an inflection point. The promise of memorable athletic performances is no longer enough. The terrain around the Games has shifted mightily in the last decade, with activists, academics, and elected officials asking tough questions during the bid process, kneecapping bids with data and in some cases torpedoing them with public referenda. Exhibit A is Boston where activists so vociferously opposed the Games that the mayor refused to sign on the dotted line for cost overruns, thereby killing the bid. The 2024 Olympics field originally featured five full-fledged candidates before public pressure derailed bids in Hamburg, Rome, and Budapest, leaving only Los Angeles and Paris.
For too long the IOC’s response to criticism has been to ladle out fat dollops of slapdashery. It starts at the top with the IOC president, Thomas Bach. The Rio 2016 Olympics left a herd of white-elephant venues already crumbling into disrepair, disgruntled residents who had their homes demolished for the Games, and broken legacy promises, most notably related to water cleanup. Former Rio mayor Eduardo Paes, who was one of the Games’ biggest boosters, has been accused of accepting nearly $5m for shepherding Olympic contracts into particular palms. Yet, in the wake of the Games, Bach proclaimed the Rio Olympics “marvelous” and heralded their “tremendous legacy to the people of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and South America.” He even claimed with a straight face that in Rio, “the financial model of the Olympic Games has really stood a stress test.”
Fast forward to today. In Los Angeles and Paris, the IOC has two relatively strong bids. Bach recently said “this is a position you like to be in.” But behind Bach’s stiff-lipped insistence, the smartest people in the IOC know that with the number of aspiring host cities dwindling the Olympics are in crisis. Even the Economist, the house journal for corporate capitalism, has admitted that the current dearth of prospective hosts indicates that “the business model for the Olympic Games is running out of puff.”
According to media reports, LA is engaged in backroom badinage with the IOC to squeeze out a few concessions, including financial aid to run its organizing committee for an additional four years. Last week, the LA mayor Eric Garcetti suggested that the IOC could also help finance metropolitan youth sports programs. If these are the best concessions that Los Angeles bid jockeys can wrest from the IOC, then they need to work on their game. This is a historic opportunity to extract fat satchels of cash from the IOC (and the group has plenty to spare) that could benefit everyday Angelenos. After all, LA has more people living in poverty than any other major US city and the highest number of chronically homeless people in the country. Last year, LA had the most officer-involved killings in the US. The Los Angeles County Jail is the biggest in the country, and is plagued by serious inmate abuse issues. Los Angeles need not squander this unique moment. Time to think big. The Olympics come with serious baggage, whether it’s blanket surveillance, public debt, or aggressive marginalization of the already marginalized. LA bidders have a rare chance to push back.
Apparently Liverpool are going to keep plugging away at this transfer negotiation lark until they crack it or land themselves a full-scale ban. But judging by the latest names being linked with them, the feast of new players that Jürgen Klopp was hoping to find waiting for him at Anfield is pie in the sky and he’s been told to make do with whatever he can find at the service station on the way home. His old muckers at Dortmumd might help him out by lending him the 19-year-old schemer Emre Mor for a season and there’s chat in France about grasping for Bordeaux’s sprightly forward Gaëtan Laborde. Mmmm...meh.
Klopp might also be waving goodbye to Divock Origi, whom Marseille are hoping will be fascinated by the prospect of forming a strikeforce with another of the club’s summer targets, the much-maligned Mario Balotelli.
Meanwhile, Chelsea are shopping at the top end and have their hearts set on Kylian Mbappé. One paper goes so far as to claim that Antonio Conte could try to charm the wonderboy in person after next week’s friendly between France and England. Sure, he might as well take him for a stroll down Blackpool promenade while he’s at it.
If that pair hook, it’ll be blues for Arsenal. And Gunners’ hearts will be properly shattered if Alexis Sánchez accepts the £350,000-per-week contract that Bayern Munich are reported to be pushing his way.
Meanwhile, Conte also wants to lure Idrissa Gueye to Stamford Bridge but Everton are refusing to play ball, which is a shame in a way, because it would be intriguing to see how opponents attempt to play ball against a midfield featuring both Gueye and N’Golo Kanté. Not a moment’s peace, that’s what there’d be.
Manchester United’s hopes of signing Torino’s Andrea Belotti have been complicated by the fact that Milan have put money on the table, and lots of it. And Milan are also keen on Porto’s André Silva, who Arsenal have been sizing up, too.
West Ham’s attempt to repair the damage they did to themselves last summer could begin with the capture of the mercurial Algerian winger Yacine Brahimi, who has reportedly been told by Porto that he can move on.
Kieran Gibbs have been given a similar message by Arsenal and now representatives from other clubs are fighting on his doorsteps like press photographers outside a polling station. Brighton’s man is understood to have thrown the first dig but Stoke’s chap got a good elbow in and Newcastle’s envoy won’t be shifted easily.
Representatives of Southampton, those most passionate defenders of transfer etiquette, are reported to be in the vicinity of the ex-Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel even though Claude Puel hasn’t been officially sacked yet. Can only be a coincidence.
Saudi Arabia’s national football team have been criticised for failing to observe a minute’s silence held before Thursday’s match against Australia in Adelaide.
The Socceroos lined up in the centre of the pitch before the World Cup qualifier and held the brief silence as a tribute to the two Australians killed in the terrorist attack in London at the weekend. As they did so, the Saudi Arabia team continued jogging, passing the ball between each other and taking their positions on the field. Pictures from the match show a single Saudi player, Salman al-Faraj, appearing to stand facing the Australia team with his hands behind his back.
Adam Peacock, a presenter with Fox Sports Australia, said on Twitter the Asian Football Confederation has approved the minute’s silence against the wishes of travelling Saudi officials. He said the Football Federation of Australia “tried to reason” with the Saudis but were unable to persuade them to participate in the tribute.
Pre game minute silence:AFC approved it pre game.Travelling Saudi officials said no.FFA tried to reason, no avail and went ahead.
Sara Zelenak, 21, from Brisbane and the South Australian Kirsty Boden, 28, were killed in Saturday night’s terrorist attack. Zelenak was working in London as a nanny and Boden was a nurse, whose family said she died running “towards danger, in an effort to help people on the bridge”. Two other Australians were stabbed in the neck in the attack, which has been claimed by the terrorist group Islamic State.
The decision not to participate in the tribute was met with criticism on Twitter.
Would've been nicer if our opposition showed some respect & lined up on the centre circle during the minute's silence. Not hard. #AUSvKSA
Others defended the Saudi team, suggesting the minute’s silence was not a recognised way to show respect and condolences in the country’s culture or in Islam more broadly.
It's misunderstood, even if the victims were in Riyadh or Dubai, They will not stand for a minute's of silence
But that appeared to clash with other instances of Gulf countries holding minute’s silences, including to mark the death of the former Saudi King Abdullah.

Another image appeared to show a domestic Saudi team, al-Ahli Saudi FC, standing for a minute’s silence before a Qatar Airways Cup match against Barcelona in December 2016.
Australia went on to win the match 3-2, putting the country on track to qualify for the next World Cup in Russia in 2018.
On Friday the Saudi Arabian football federation made an “unreserved” apology.
“The players did not intend any disrespect to the memories of the victims or to cause upset to their families, friends or any individual affected by the atrocity,” it said in a statement.
“The Saudi Arabian Football Federation condemns all acts of terrorism and extremism and extends its sincerest condolences to the families of all the victims and to the government and people of the United Kingdom.”
AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan has lamented being unable to ascertain what was injected into ex-Essendon player Nathan Lovett-Murray, who claims his child has been harmed by the club’s former supplements program.
Lovett-Murray reportedly claims his three-year-old daughter, who was conceived about a year after the 2012 supplements program ended, has a mysterious growth on her chest and behavioural issues. The 34-year-old is suing his former club over health fears for his daughter, News Corp Australia has reported.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that the injection program we were put through has had some impact on my daughter,” Lovett-Murray told News Corp.
Lovett-Murray last year served a year-long ban for his involvement in the doping program but his AFL career ended in 2012. League chief executive McLachlan said support was being offered to the former utility player but a lack of details clouded the matter.
“The AFL and the Essendon footy club will do everything we can to help Nathan and his family in what is clearly a very tough period,” McLachlan told 3AW on Friday. “Clearly, I think that’s been implicit in this is the uncertainty of not knowing what the players got. That’s always been one of the most challenging aspects of this.”
“In the broader sense, Nathan’s management is still negotiating with Essendon and I think he’s one of the last couple of people to not finalise their compensation claim. I’m sure that will get done. If there’s broader support or medical support we can provide we’ll do whatever we can.”
Lovett-Murray’s matter is the latest fallout from the supplements program, which has also contributed to mental health issues for former coach James Hird.
The AFL handed down a series of penalties in the aftermath, including kicking Essendon out of the 2013 finals, a $2-million fine and stripping of draft picks. Hird was suspended for 12 months and, in 2015, the Court of Arbitration for Sports ruled the 34 past and present Bombers players be banned for the 2016 season.

The night started with a catfish throw.
It ended with haymaker after haymaker – both literal and proverbial – from the ever resilient Pittsburgh Penguins.
The defending champions provided an emphatic and repeated reminder of what makes them such a difficult out in a 6-0 demolition of the Nashville Predators in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup final to take a three-games-to-two lead.
Pittsburgh will have a chance to become the first franchise in 19 years to win back to back Cups when the series shifts back to Nashville for Game 6 on Sunday night.
“Understand that we’re going to play a desperate team,” said Penguins captain Sidney Crosby after collecting three assists. “Nothing’s done yet and we’ve got a lot of work ahead of ourselves.”
So do the Predators, who can’t get back to Smashville fast enough.
Justin Schultz, Bryan Rust and Evgeni Malkin scored during a first-period barrage against Pekka Rinne that sent the Nashville goaltender to the bench for the rest of the night, all the good mojo he created during a pair of wins in Games 3 and 4 gone.
Conor Sheary, Phil Kessel – just as linemate Malkin predicted – and 35-year-old playoff newbie Ron Hainsey also scored for the Penguins. Crosby’s eventful night included becoming the franchise’s all-time leading scorer in the Stanley Cup final, a two-minute roughing penalty for trying to dribble Nashville defenseman PK Subban’s head on the ice near the end of the first period and an flip of a water bottle onto the ice during play.
“It’s just one of those things it slipped out of my hand,” Crosby said. “I had a gesture with my hand and before I knew it the thing was flying across the ice. I know you’re not allowed to do that, so I’m not going to start doing it in the Stanley Cup final.”
Matt Murray bounced back from so-so performances during Pittsburgh’s lost weekend in Nashville to make 24 stops while also benefiting from a dominant performance by the guys in front of him.
Penguins coach Mike Sullivan, as he has for each of the last two springs when his team finds itself in a tight spot, pushed all the right buttons again. He stuck with Murray, reunited Sheary with Crosby and Jake Guentzel, and stressed his team needed to play with urgency but not desperation after the Predators rallied to tie the series by outscoring the Penguins 9-2 during two wins in Nashville.
It took all of 91 seconds for Pittsburgh to get its swagger back.
Just 91 seconds after a Nashville fan flipped a catfish onto the PPG Paints Arena ice – a move that came shortly before a three-goal outburst by Nashville in Game 1 – Schultz powered home a slapshot to end an 0-for-15 power-play skid.
“We were on our toes tonight,” Schultz said. “We were really jumping and playing our game, playing fast. It all started with that start and got us going for the rest of the game.”
Rust made it 2-0 just 6:43 into the game with a nasty backhand flip over Rinne’s glove.
Then things got chippy (and a little weird) for the game’s best player. Crosby and Subban became tangled up behind the Nashville net late in the first period, with Crosby ended up on top of Subban. Crosby then started hitting Subban in the head repeatedly, eventually drawing a roughing penalty while Subban – who quipped that Crosby was complaining about Subban’s bad breath during a Game 3 exchange – went off for holding.
Malkin ripped a wrist shot over Rinne’s glove on the ensuing 4-on-4 to make it 3-0 with just 10 seconds left in the first. Rinne gave way to Juuse Saros at the start of the second period after stopping just six of nine shots, continuing his wildly uneven play. Rinne stopped 50 of 52 shots he faced back home in Games 3 and 4. He’s stopped just 34 of 45 in Pittsburgh during the series.
Saros hardly fared any better. Sheary took a pretty feed from Crosby and sent it by Saros 1:19 into the second to push Pittsburgh’s lead to four. Kessel ended a six-game goal drought 8:02 into the second. The score had been predicted by Malkin and it came just seconds after Crosby threw a water bottle onto the ice as the play went by Pittsburgh’s bench, a move he told referees was unintentional.
When Hainsey, who waited 907 regular-season games before reaching the playoffs for the first time this season, tapped in a pass from Malkin to make it 6-0, the stage was set for the Penguins to return to familiar territory.
The franchise has won all four of its Cups on the road. A shot at a fifth awaits Sunday, though it’ll hardly be easy.
The Predators are 9-1 at home in the playoffs, a place they will need to be a haven once again if they want to extend their improbable Cup run - and a flat-out odd final - back to Pittsburgh.
Crosby now has 20 career points in the Stanley Cup final, a new franchise record and one more than team owner Mario Lemieux. ... Crosby also moved into a tie with Denis Potvin for 19th on the all-time career playoff scoring list. ... The team that has won Game 5 in a 2-2 series has gone on to win the Cup 71 percent (17 of 24) of the time since 1939. ... The teams combined for 100 penalty minutes (58 for Nashville, 42 for Pittsburgh). ... Guentzel’s assist moved him into a tie with Dino Ciccarelli and Ville Leino for the most playoff points by a rookie in NHL history (21). ... Penguins F Nick Bonino missed his third straight game with a lower-body injury. ... Nashville F Colin Wilson made his series debut after missing the first four games with an undisclosed injury. Wilson skated on the fourth line with Frederick Gaudreau and Harry Zolnierczyk.
If a win can ever feel worrying, this may be the one.
Victory was crucial for the US’s prospects of automatic qualification for next year’s World Cup finals and duly obtained. Key job, done. But there was a certain slackness to the Americans that a superior side – say, Mexico – will surely exploit.
If the Hexagonal group’s bottom team was capable of exposing vulnerabilities in the Americans’ back line and midfield here in the Denver suburbs on Thursday, what might Mexico do to the US at home on Sunday?
A draw in Mexico would be an impressive result for the US in almost any conceivable context; on this evidence, that’s surely the right attitude to take into the fixture. No reason for hopes to be set too high.
Christian Pulisic was the hero - a sentence likely to become a well-worn sentiment in the months and years ahead. Ruthless and alert, the 18-year-old scored twice and provided a coolness in front of goal that more experienced team-mates lacked.
“He’s having fun,” Bruce Arena said, calling him “an exceptional talent.” He added: “I just think he’s a natural for the game, he sees the game very well and has good instincts on getting in good spots, especially his running off the ball’s exceptional.”
Arena said he felt frustrated at half time with the lack of sharpness at both ends, but overall pronounced himself content. “We played a solid 90 minutes,” he said. “We’ve started off 2017 in pretty good shape so I’m pleased at this time.”
Dennis Lawrence, the T&T head coach, felt his charges were unfortunate. “Individual errors is probably what cost us,” he said. “I felt all-in-all the boys probably didn’t deserve that.”
While any team can miss a multitude of chances, it was the number of good opportunities afforded to the away side that should be most worrisome ahead of the trip to Mexico City. And, curiously, Arena’s men had some of their worst defensive moments when leading 2-0 in the latter stages against a Trinidad & Tobago team that ought to have been demoralized and feeling the effects of the thin Colorado air.
Even if the US camp insisted in the build-up that the focus was squarely on this match, the structure of their international break demonstrated how seriously they are taking the trip to the Azteca. Like mountaineers heading to the pinnacle, the Americans played to a 1-1 draw in a friendly against Venezuela in Utah last Saturday; this stadium is 700ft higher, at 5,200 ft; the Azteca is at 7,200ft.
But the biggest altitude problem ahead of the game was the low position of the US in the standings: out of the rarefied air of the places ensuring automatic qualification for next year’s tournament in Russia and six points adrift of Mexico at the summit.
Three points against T&T was virtually essential – both to lessen the risk of missing the top three spots and facing a playoff against an Asian side, and to avoid being struck by self-doubt ahead of the toughest fixture of the campaign.
With few injury problems to worry about, Arena picked what looked like a strong and solid, low-risk line-up. John Brooks, who came off with a leg injury in the unedifying spectacle against Venezuela, returned to partner Geoff Cameron in central defense but did not convince.
Pulisic, the team’s most exciting player, had license to roam across the final third of the pitch. With Clint Dempsey also inclined to wander in search of the ball, it was important for the team’s shape that Jozy Altidore was a more robust and predictable spearhead up front.
The first chance of note came in the 15th minute as Dempsey found space on the edge of the area to unfurl a dipping shot that narrowly cleared the bar. The Seattle Sounders forward was chasing his 57th international strike, a number that would tie him with Landon Donovan at the top of the all-time US scoring chart. Not this time: he was substituted in the second half. Arena said he understood why Dempsey was visibly irked to be removed. “He’s got a really competitive edge to him,” he said.
After 25 minutes, Brooks tested Jan-Michael Williams from distance, and the T&T goalkeeper was called upon again seconds later to deny Altidore. Pulisic then ran down the left and lashed over. Amid the American pressure the visitors enjoyed a surprising amount of room on their left wing, though fashioned little when close to Tim Howard’s net.
Until the 32nd minute, that is, when Kenwyne Jones squandered an outstanding chance to head the visitors into the lead. With Howard flailing, the Atlanta United and former Sunderland striker – one of four MLS-attached players in the T&T starting XI – nodded the ball against the bar. Though Williams had to make five saves in the first half, the sides were level at the break.
American anxieties were soothed after 52 minutes with the opening goal. DeAndre Yedlin crossed low and Pulisic – operating outside the area for so much of this match – appeared inside the six-yard box, as if teleported, to slide the ball beyond Williams. Yet, in another sign that the home team was prone to lapses in concentration, T&T had the ball in Howard’s net almost immediately after the restart, but it was correctly ruled offside.
Two minutes after the hour, Pulisic finished a move that he started. Thanks to some incisive passing he was set clear on the right of the area and calmly slotted past the goalkeeper at his near post to make the game safe, though not exactly comfortable. While Arena did not get the assertive and cohesive team display he no doubt craved before Sunday, at least he could once again savor a fine performance from the teenager.
Fast graduating from starlet into star, the Borussia Dortmund tyro is not short of self-belief. “It’s gonna be a tough one down there in Mexico especially, but we really want some revenge on them [for their win last November],” Pulisic told FS1 post-match. “So we’re really confident going into that game,” he said with a nonchalant shrug. “We’re going to come out with a win there too.”
A legal challenge has been launched by Newcastle United over documents seized from the club by officials conducting a tax investigation.
A high court judge banned HM Revenue & Customs from examining, without the club’s consent, material taken in a raid carried out in April under search warrants issued by Leeds crown court.
Mr Justice Supperstone, sitting in London, said on Thursday that the ban would continue until resolution of the club’s application for a judicial review against HMRC. He directed that any material being retained by HMRC which is identified as attracting legal professional privilege must be returned to the club. He also directed that the legal action involving Newcastle, who have just secured promotion back to the Premier League, must return to court on 22 June. It is expected the club will then have to show it has an arguable case to take to a full judicial review hearing.
At the interim hearing on Thursday no details of the grounds of the challenge were revealed in court. During the day lawyers for the club did not respond to requests for further information about the case and HMRC lawyers said they could not provide any information.
Manchester United will not offer Zlatan Ibrahimovic a new deal when his current contract expires at the end of the month.
The 35-year-old had an option for a second season at United – following his influential first campaign in English football – but a cruciate ligament has finished his career at Old Trafford. The Swede will be 36 by the time he next plays, with the knee injury expected to keep the striker out until early 2018.
The Premier League’s retained list will be released on Friday and Ibrahimovic’s name is set to be one of the main talking points. The striker scored at Wembley in both United’s Community Shield and EFL Cup successes, as well as playing an important role in their triumphant Europa League campaign.
That competition has now witnessed his final appearance for United, after he sustained the ligament damage in April’s quarter-final second leg against Anderlecht. His agent, Mino Raiola, says Ibrahimovic is not short of offers. “Many clubs have asked for Zlatan,” Raiola said. “He can play two more years and will stay in Europe, 100%.”
Ibrahimovic’s release means a new No9 is high on United’s list of priorities this summer and a £60m offer for Álvaro Morata is expected to be submitted. José Mourinho has identified the 24-year-old as his primary attacking target after the France international Antoine Griezmann confirmed he will not be leaving Atlético Madrid. Negotiations with Real Madrid have taken place this week, with United’s first offer of €60m (£52m) turned down as the Champions League winners value him significantly higher at €90m.
Rory McIlroy has been grouped alongside another former world No1 in Jason Day and his Ryder Cup team-mate Justin Rose for the first two rounds of next week’s US Open.
McIlroy earlier this week confirmed his participation at Erin Hills after recovering from a stress fracture to a rib which forced him to withdraw from last month’s BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.
The Northern Irishman claimed his first major victory in a wire-to-wire triumph at the 2011 US Open, defeating his nearest challenger Day by eight shots. Rose was the 2013 champion in Wisconsin. The trio will tee off on Thursday at 2.09pm local time (7.09pm BST).
Rose’s conqueror at the Masters, Sergio García, will tee off with Bubba Watson, the 2012 and 2014 champion at Augusta, and Adam Scott, who walked away with the green jacket four years ago, at 1.36pm. The pick of the morning groupings sees Dustin Johnson begin the defence of his title alongside his two predecessors, Jordan Spieth and Martin Kaymer. The world No1, who broke his major duck 12 months ago at Oakmont Country Club, will play alongside the man who pipped him to the title in a final-round showdown in 2015 and Germany’s 2014 winner.
Johnson is looking to become the first man to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989 and clinch a first victory following a back injury which forced him to miss the Masters in April. The trio will commence their first round at 9.35am.
The English duo Lee Westwood and Ross Fisher and Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell go off at 8.02am while the Scottish pair Russell Knox and Martin Laird are in the next grouping setting off at 8.13am.
Almost a week on and England’s players are still piecing together the eccentricity of an end-of-season overnight stay on Woodbury Common mucking in with the Royal Marines. Harry Kane thrilled at the novelty of “putting up my own tent and sleeping in a sleeping bag”. Kieran Trippier, who can hardly have anticipated enduring the “sheep dip” or a four-mile early morning hike with 21kg on his back through a Devonian wilderness on his first call-up, admitted an initial sense of shock gave way to enjoyment. All spoke of admiration for their hosts and praised Gareth Southgate for thinking outside the box when it came to team bonding.
Yet it took the manager’s right-hand man to explain the true merit of a trip to the south-west which, like so much of the national team’s attempt at reinvention, was in effect born of memories of the feeble and high-profile capitulation to Iceland in Nice last summer. “It would be easy to assume: marines, army, run until you are sick, but that was actually the opposite of what it was all about,” said Steve Holland. “Gareth has identified issues we need to address and had come up with different ways to go through the process. Take leadership. There were various different exercises that weren’t physically challenging but did demand some to step forward, organise others and take responsibility. To lead.
“The guys were having to handle situations where there was pressure. They were out of their comfort zones, and they didn’t feel good about what they were being asked to do, even with limited physical risk. Standing knee high in water, having to pass through a tunnel full of water, not being able to see while in the tube before you reached the marine at the other end … personally, I didn’t fancy that for a second, but I pushed myself through, as did everybody. Now relate that back into football. There are moments on the pitch – and the Iceland game is everyone’s point of reference – where you have to react, when you’re one up and everything looks fine, then suddenly ‘bang, bang’, it’s 1-2.
The feedback Gareth’s had has been that, in some cases, the team’s ‘identity’ has been lacking
“Maybe you were in the stadium, or watching it on holiday like me, looking round at the players thinking: ‘Bloody hell, they’ve gone. Where are the leaders? Where is the leadership?’ That is a pressure moment, so who is stepping forward? It looked to me like there was nobody. Does what we did at the weekend solve that? Not in one hit, no. But having identified it, it is part of a process that hopefully, in the short term but also in the long term, will create a different mindset within the group that can help us. It is as simple as that.” The exorcism of that nightmare on the French Riviera is still continuing.
Scotland will test England’s progress in the ferocious din of Hampden Park on Saturday, with the group leaders charged with imposing themselves on their hosts. Coping with that level of expectation is part of the process. Roy Hodgson’s side were supposed to ease beyond Iceland, after all, and were ahead early on. Southgate and his staff have recognised that this young group’s potential will not be realised until hurdles such as these are vaulted with ease. “There is potential, yes, but there is also clearly some work to be done to get this group to where their maximum is,” said Holland. “If we can hit that then this team has a chance to win [tournaments]. I have no doubt, this team has a chance to win.
“Since coming in, Gareth has been very interactive in the way he has dealt with the players and what happened last summer: asking them what they think, not necessarily telling them what he thinks. It has been driven really by an ownership from the players. What did you recognise? What was right? What was wrong? How is it going to be different next time? What can we do to make that process different? The feedback Gareth’s had from players of the past and the present has been that, in some cases, the team’s identity has been lacking, whether that is tactical or philosophical. They want to get that back.”
The aim is to give the group some tactical flexibility, allowing them to switch from four at the back to three if required, as they have demonstrated under Southgate. Likewise, they need to mix between pressing high up the pitch when out of possession, or being able to sit deeper and look to counterattack. “And what are we doing with the ball?” said the assistant manager. “Are we obsessed with playing from goalkeeper to halfway line, or is that not so important? How are we going to get from the halfway line to make chances? Everybody has to be very clear about their roles and responsibilities. There is room for adaptation there, positionally, but I think that is the only way.”
All of which suggests a settled group will use international breaks, including the current two-game period, to familiarise themselves with Southgate’s demands and ensure that, come Russia next summer, England’s thinking is anything but muddled. Holland’s role is now full-time, his eight-year spell with Chelsea curtailed as a Premier League champion, with any fears rival elite clubs, Tottenham Hotspur among them, might have had over him gleaning inside information on players while on international duty presumably now allayed. “The job offered to me was not a ‘split duty’ job,” he said. “It was ‘come full-time or don’t come at all’, and I understand totally what that is. That is correct. I can see why people might have thought there were issues.
“I had the best eight years of my life at Chelsea, incredible experiences winning the Champions League and Premier League, so I am grateful to them. But it was not a wrench joining Gareth here. I’m 46 and I’ve never seen England in a final. My eldest son is 18 and he’s never seen England in a semi-final. When you can try and affect that, working with an England team that delivered success, that opportunity was impossible to reject.”
Sydney’s audacious bid to make the AFL finals faces another test against the last side to make a miraculous charge into September action. Thursday’s impressive 46-point win over reigning premiers the Western Bulldogs at the SCG lifted Sydney to a 4-7 record.
It bumped them three places up the ladder to 13th and ensured they will be no more than two wins off eighth by the end of the round. The resurgent Swans, who have won four of their last five after a 0-6 start, get a nine-day break before tackling Richmond at the MCG.
Three years ago, the Tigers were in an even worse mid-season position than the 2017 Swans, floundering in the lower reaches of the ladder with a 3-10 record after four straight losses. But the Tigers then reeled off nine straight wins to scrape into the top eight.
Long-suffering Richmond supporters are breathing more easily this season with the club firmly entrenched in the top eight with a 7-4 record. They were fourth going into their bye week and can’t drop more than one spot despite not playing.
Sydney coach John Longmire is clearly an admirer of the way the Tigers go about their business and knows his team will face a tough test at the MCG on Saturday week. “They have been fierce around the contest,” Longmire said of Richmond following the Swans’ win over the Bulldogs.
“Their pressure has been enormous, that’s the thing I’ve really noticed this year. They play a really strong hard brand of footy, so that’s a good challenge for us.”
Sydney utility Gary Rohan, who pulled out with sickness a few hours before Thursday’s game, is expected to be available next week. Recalled former co-captain Kieren Jack dlslocated fingers late in his comeback game against the Bulldogs, but earned praise from Longmire for lifting after a quiet first half.
“He was pretty important for us just in a leadership sense in that first half, and then he got going when he started to find his sea legs,” Longmire said. “His third quarter was really good and he started off well in the the last quarter as well, went in for centre bounces, and dislocated a couple of fingers there at the end, but he was pretty good in the second half.”.

What becomes obvious in conversation with Ivan Lendl is that his hard-nosed approach to the physical demands of his sport is the perfect antidote to the occasionally downbeat world view of Andy Murray.
It is a working athlete’s natural inclination to seek comfort in hardship. If it was easy, goes the thinking, everyone would be doing it; because it is not, the best survive and prosper. A word that recurs more often than most in a Murray interview is “tough”.
Certainly, with three slams to his name and the prospect of fighting for another one this weekend – after indifferent clay form, shingles, flu, injury and some struggles in his first five matches at this French Open – Murray has cause to wonder if he is in the best possible shape to play Stan Wawrinka in their semi-final on Friday. He says he is. “Physically, I feel great,” he said after defeating Kei Nishikori in four sets on Wednesday.
Enter his coach. “You have to put in consistent work to have consistent results,” Lendl said on Thursday. “If you have three illnesses and an injury which take you out for some time, you start again. You get going and you get ill or injured again, then you start again and again and again. It’s very difficult mentally for the player.
“It’s nice that Andy’s healthy and he can put the practices in – and I think the results are starting to come. I had a few injuries or have been ill at the wrong time of the year when I needed to do a training block. It happens.
“With the exception of the first two or three days, when he had a bit of flu, he has been putting in great work. He scraped through the first two matches and then the work started to come in.”
Murray has also complained in the past that the four-month gap between the first two slams of the season can affect a player’s motivation. Lendl demurs.
“Of course, you focus on the slams but, in order to play well in the slams, you have to have confidence. You get confidence through winning. You get winning through consistent work. So you are kind of feeding into that. I don’t think he’s low physically. He’s pretty strong out there. He doesn’t feel tired the next day. You don’t lose your conditioning over two- or three‑day flu. If you’re in bed for two or three weeks, you lose your conditioning. You just shake off flu and rebound very quickly to the level you were before. I’m not very concerned about that.”
Murray – along with everyone else at Roland Garros – was surprised to see Novak Djokovic wilt shockingly in the third and final set of his quarter-final against Dominic Thiem, shortly before the Scot came through his own dips to outlast Nishikori in 2hr 39min. The Serb, who has not won a slam since beating Murray in last year’s final here, has slipped well behind him in ranking points, and left the tournament dispirited and puzzled.
Djokovic could not explain his dramatic collapse – especially having beaten Thiem in 11 of the 12 games they played in the Rome semi-finals. Of the many theories circulating here, burnout was near the top of the list.
He had a public power outage at the worst possible moment and could do nothing about it after losing a tight first set – even with four chances left to repair the damage.
When Murray was asked how he has turned his tennis around this fortnight after early exits in the leadup clay tournaments where he did so well last year, he said: “I was doing a lot of very basic drills, a lot of patterns of play and just literally repeating those. Pretty boring. It’s not much fun. But, when I’m getting into longer rallies now, I feel like I’m on autopilot.”
He cannot afford to crash like Djokovic did. He must be fit enough on Friday to hold at bay an opponent regarded as the naturally strongest player on the tour, and who spent just 1hr 40min getting rid of Marin Cilic. Wawrinka has yet to drop a set; Murray has given up three and fought through three tie-breaks.
Lendl concedes it could turn into a battle of strength. “Yeah, possibly. It comes down to executing your gameplan and the conditions. Different conditions favour different players on the court – or not necessarily players, but the patterns you can do and can’t do. [On Wednesday] it was extremely difficult with the wind [at the start of the match]. Ball-striking was hard and Kei hit the ball incredibly well the first set. But then it left him. He was pushing Andy around because of the conditions and Andy couldn’t get the timing [right]. Then Kei couldn’t keep the timing because of the conditions.”
If Murray wins, he plays either Thiem or Rafael Nadal, who meet in the second semi-final. And that probably will be a slugging match. Of the four men left, the young Austrian hits his forehand with most venom, at 84mph, followed by Wawrinka (81mph), Nadal (79mph) and Murray (73mph).
As a comparison, the Latvian who on Thursday reached the women’s final, Jelena Ostapenko, has been averaging 76mph with her forehand. If Murray gets to the final for the second year in a row, he will be significantly in deficit in power off the ground, whoever he plays.
The British & Irish Lions have flown south, across the snow-capped Southern Alps, aware they have an increasing mountain to climb on tour in New Zealand. Some are billing their looming fixture with the Crusaders as a “fourth Test” on a par with facing the All Blacks and a second provincial defeat in four days would add to the pressure on Warren Gatland’s squad.
News that Sam Warburton has an ankle strain is another setback, with the tour captain having hurt himself in the opening game in Whangarei. His absence from the match-day squad to face the Crusaders does allow Sean O’Brien to stake his claim at openside but represents another headache for Gatland in an increasingly trying week.
The 22-16 defeat against the Blues on Wednesday has generated little external belief that the Lions are building towards a series win and the release of impressively strong All Blacks, Maori and Crusaders squads on the same day has not helped, either. When a young player as electric as the Chiefs’ Damian McKenzie cannot make even the All Blacks squad, let alone the starting lineup, New Zealand clearly have remarkable strength in depth.
At least the Lions have responded by naming their strongest side so far. Under the leadership of Alun Wyn Jones, the third successive Welsh captain named by Gatland, this is a team with a serious edge to it, with the first-choice half-backs Conor Murray and Owen Farrell also united for the first time and Liam Williams on the wing.
Gatland has stuck to his promise to give every player at least one start in the opening three games, with George North and Jonathan Davies featuring for the first time on this trip. Nine of the XV were involved on the victorious 2013 tour and have enough experience to know that Lions tours are defined by the last three weekends rather than the opening stanzas.
At least two thirds of this XV would appear to have a good chance of starting the first Test, although Gatland is insisting he has not yet commenced those deliberations, saying: “The players are going to get one or two chances before we start thinking about that. We haven’t spoken about Test combinations.” Plenty of others continue to do so on his behalf, however, and the centre pairing of Ben Te’o and Davies is just one area set to be closely monitored by all concerned.
What no one disputes is that Farrell is maturing into a top-notch international player and Gatland has been as impressed as anyone. “I’ve seen a massive development in him in the last four years,” the head coach said. “I think he’s been one of the top players in the northern hemisphere for the last two years. He’s a good age, he’s matured and he’s calm and confident.”
The fly-half himself is also not the sort to be fazed by a little adversity, particularly in a city that has had to show such extraordinary resilience in the face of the earthquake devastation from which the region is still recovering.
“Obviously you have to be mentally strong because of the standard of the opposition,” Farrell said. “We’ve got to have our wits about us, we’ve got to be in the game constantly. You can’t afford to have periods where you’re not on your mettle against teams like this.”
With the Highlanders, the Maori and the Chiefs also to come between now and the first Test on 24 June, Farrell concedes the touring team would not want to suffer five successive losses at this psychologically important stage: “I don’t think we would, no. You’ve got to take confidence from how you perform but that also comes from how you train, how you act and how you play. Games can be tipped on a knife edge sometimes, as you saw [on Wednesday]. It was a first outing for a lot of boys and I thought apart from the result it was a step in the right direction.”
That is a slightly debatable conclusion given the way the Lions’ discipline and execution began to fray in the second half. They conceded far too many “soft” penalties for Gatland’s liking and also made the mistake of compounding one error with another. “We need to make sure we’re a bit smarter than that,” Gatland said. “[Wednesday’s] result was disappointing. We know we can’t afford to give away so many penalties.”
The Lions will certainly need to raise their game to cope with a strong-looking Crusaders side captained by Sam Whitelock and containing a posse of All Blacks. “We are facing some of the best rugby players in the world but we have some of the world’s best in this team, too,” the head coach, Scott Robertson, said. “No matter how it unfolds, this will be a game the players involved will remember as one of the special moments in their careers.”

Fernando Alonso has said he will leave McLaren unless the team can provide him with a winning car by September, and insisted he would also walk out of the sport if plans to increase the number of races to 25 were implemented.
Returning to F1 after competing in the Indy 500 where he was running strongly until his Honda engine gave out, Alonso was unequivocal about the need for the manufacturer to drastically improve their power unit. His comments echoed those of McLaren’s executive director, Zak Brown, who warned this week that time was running out for Honda after they failed to bring hoped for upgrades to Canada.
“We have to win,” Alonso said. “If we are winning before September when I make a decision, I will stay.” Winning by September is not on the cards for McLaren and his options to go elsewhere are extremely limited but he insisted he would move on. “Things have to change,” he said. “I want to win. I joined this project because I want to be world champion and we are not in that position so if you don’t see things changing and you are not in a competitive position you change projects.”
Alonso was equally unenamoured by suggestions that F1’s new owners would be increasing the number of races to 25 in a season, stating a position Lewis Hamilton said he agreed with. “I started when the calendar was 16 races, plus the tests, and now we keep increasing the races year after year,” said Alonso.
“We are in a number that is quite demanding already with the life you have between the preparation, the sponsor events, the tests, the commitments, plus 20 or 21 races. I think it’s already enough.
“I consider that a good quality of life is more important than more seasons in F1. If the calendar stays between 20 and 21 races, I would be happy to continue but it if increases it is not for me.”
Hamilton, meanwhile, has admitted he goes into this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix on the back foot against his world championship title rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel. After two difficult races already this season, Hamilton acknowledged that his Mercedes team need to bring him up to speed quickly at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, a track that shares traits with the others at which he has struggled.
Hamilton trails Vettel by 25 points in the standings but crucially in his attempt to win a fourth title Hamilton has struggled with his set-up twice this season and he and Mercedes need to identify the issues if he is to keep Vettel in sight.
“We have seen Ferrari are the quickest and that they are the favourites,” Hamilton said. “We are working hard to rectify the issues we had in the last race and hope we can attack this weekend. They have got some unique bits on the car which will work well this weekend but it doesn’t mean we can’t take the fight to them.”
He was off the pace all weekend in Russia, then at the last round in Monaco he could not hook up the car again and failed to make the final session of qualifying. Bringing the tyres into the right temperature for their operating window has been the major issue and it has been of greater import to Hamilton rather than his team-mate Valtteri Bottas.
Identifying and rectifying the problem before this weekend’s grand prix is paramount. The track itself is similar to Sochi and Monte Carlo, a low-abrasion, low-grip surface with short-duration corners and the tyre selection in Montreal is also the same, including the ultrasoft rubber, which has proved most troublesome for Hamilton. But he admitted that although he returned to the factory to work on the problem they would not be able to identify whether they have solved it until returning to the track.
“After the last race, there was a lot of information for the engineers to be working on but we didn’t have all the solutions and the answers at that point,” he said. “We have done some analysis but we will find whether or not there are new things we can improve on this weekend.”
The three-times world champion, who has won five times at the track, remained optimistic he could put in a good performance. “There are lots of opportunities for overtaking here, you can follow a little better than other circuits, it suits an aggressive driving style,” he said.
Romania’s Simona Halep will take on the unseeded Jelena Ostapenko for the French Open title after two outstanding semi-finals here on Thursday which showcased some of the best ball-striking and athleticism the game has to offer.
Halep, the third seed and considered a weak favourite in what was called the most open of French Opens, reached her second Roland Garros final by outmanoeuvring the second seed, Karolina Pliskova, to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Ostapenko, the world No47, overcame Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 with a barrage of 50 winners, the last of which put the 20‑year‑old into her first grand slam final. She is the first Latvian player to achieve the feat.
There was more than a sense, when Halep came from a set and 5-1 down to win her quarter-final against Elina Svitolina of Ukraine on Wednesday, that the Romanian had survived the toughest moment she would face in the tournament. But the 2014 runner-up had to play well to cope with the easy power of Pliskova, the runner-up at the US Open last year.
Halep led 4-1 in the first set and though Pliskova hit back to 4-3, she broke again to move ahead. Pliskova hammered a series of winners to get the early break as she won the second set and looked confident when she recovered from 4-1 down in the third to get back on serve at 4-3. But Halep, who credits her coach, Darren Cahill, with her new positive attitude, did not panic. The Romanian dug deep and returned to her gameplan, getting the taller Pliskova on the move and hitting into space. It worked as she broke for 5-3 and she served out for a place in her second grand slam final. “It’s an amazing feeling right now,” Halep said. “I’m just happy. I don’t know what was yesterday, I just care about today. It was extremely tough.”
Victory in the final on Saturday would make Halep the world No1 for the first time in her career but first she will have to beat a woman who does not seem to know what pressure is. It is three years since Ostapenko won the junior Wimbledon title, since when she has taken time to mature, better known for her feisty attitude than her results. Until this fortnight, she had never been past the third round of a grand slam and she has yet to win a Tour title. Now she is one great day away from winning her first grand slam crown.
With the fearlessness only young players can truly show, Ostapenko bashed down winner after winner to defeat Bacsinszky in 2hr 24min. The Swiss, a semi-finalist two years ago, has the greater experience and more variety but for long periods of the match she was bludgeoned. Even when Bacsinszky fought back and levelled at 3-3 in the decider, Ostapenko never wavered from her all-or-nothing approach and she pulled away to become the first unseeded woman to reach the final since Mima Jausovec in 1983.
Both players were celebrating their birthday on the day of the match but Ostapenko will probably remember it best. “When I came here, of course I didn’t expect I would be in the final,” Ostapenko said. “But then, first match was a tough match as well, and I won it. I think it kind of gave me confidence. Then every match I was playing better and better and I got my confidence, and I think it works pretty well. She was playing pretty well, and I was telling myself that I have to still play aggressive but to be, like, smarter and to not make many unforced errors. And I think it helped me that I was still playing very aggressive.”
Bacsinszky said she regretted not taking some opportunities in the first set but for the most part was impressed at the outrageous hitting of Ostapenko.
“She’s 20, not afraid of anything,” Bacsinszky said. “She doesn’t measure maybe what she’s doing right now. She probably doesn’t care. Best example is the match point. I serve very well wide. She’s, like, hitting as hard as she can down the line from nowhere. It comes above the net and in the corner and, I mean, who tries that? Seriously? I mean, it’s like one out of 10. But she does it. So we’ll see if she does it at 28 years old.”
If Ostapenko wins the final on Saturday, she will not care too much about what happens when she is older.
England will take on one of rugby’s most formidable assignments – a Test match in Argentina – with four new caps in their starting XV and a further four players whose tally of Tests is in single figures. Most significant is the selection of Tom Curry, one of the twin brothers who have taken this England camp by storm.
Curry will become England’s youngest new cap since one Jonny Wilkinson made his debut, aged 18 years 314 days, in the 1998 Six Nations, just a couple of months before Curry was born. “My principle has always been that if a player is good enough, you play him whether he is old or young,” the head coach, Eddie Jones, said. “Some players at 18 are much more mature than players at 28. There were no qualms at all about throwing him in.”
If Curry’s career can be half as influential as Wilkinson’s, England are set fair indeed, all the more so as in this case there are two of them. The Curry boys, who play for Sale, turn 19 next Thursday, so Tom will be 18 years 360 days old when he takes to the field in San Juan on Saturday.
Whether England’s back row ever accommodates both brothers remains to be seen – their energy and industry might work well with a heavy-duty ball carrier, a Billy Vunipola, say – but for now they compete with each other. Ben was given the nod for the Barbarians game at the end of last month but had to withdraw from the bench with a back injury, so Tom replaced him, came on in the first half and was awarded man of the match.
Ben is not available for this match and joins Chris Robshaw and Sam Underhill as back-row forwards just failing to make it out of the treatment room. The loss of Robshaw’s experience is a particular blow for a squad shorn of 30 players by injury and the British & Irish Lions. “Chris is almost back to full training,” Jones said. “We just felt he was a bit tired. Certainly, he should be available for the second Test.”
The Pumas will face a XV with 345 caps, nearly a quarter of those owned by the captain, Dylan Hartley, who passes Martin Johnson to draw level with Lawrence Dallaglio and Rory Underwood as England’s third most capped player. All being well, both here and with the Lions in New Zealand, Hartley will claim third place outright, behind Wilkinson and Jason Leonard, in the second Test in Santa Fe on 17 June.
To conjure such names is to summon memories of England’s most glorious era. But, for all the success of more recent times, a victory on Saturday against battle-hardened Super Rugby players already up to speed with the game and each other will represent a feat every bit as impressive as any Jones has managed in his remarkable England tenure to date.
As well as Curry, he awards new caps to Alex Lozowski, Harry Williams and Mark Wilson. “He’s a good tough player, quite similar to Robshaw,” the England head coach said of the latter. “He’s a hard worker and a very tough player. He has impressed and really deserves his opportunity.”
Beyond the debutants, Henry Slade, Ellis Genge, Charlie Ewels and Nathan Hughes have fewer than 10 caps apiece. And if England should be looking for reassurance from the bench they will find only Matt Mullan with any caps at all. The anticipated debut of Denny Solomona may yet transpire, but he takes his place on the bench, having overcome the foot injury that had threatened his tour. Marland Yarde starts instead on the right wing.
“Test match rugby is about winning,” said Jones. “You only survive in Test match rugby if you win as a player and as a coach.”
Low on experience this collective may be, but the expectations of their coach remain as high as ever.
England M Brown (Harlequins, 60 caps); M Yarde (Harlequins, 11 caps), H Slade (Exeter, 5 caps), A Lozowski (Saracens, uncapped), J May (Gloucester, 25 caps); G Ford (Bath, 35 caps), D Care (Harlequins, 71 caps); E Genge (Leicester, 1 cap), D Hartley (capt; Northampton, 84 caps), H Williams (Exeter, uncapped), J Launchbury (Wasps, 42 caps), C Ewels (Bath, 3 caps), M Wilson (Newcastle, uncapped), T Curry (Sale, uncapped), N Hughes (Wasps, 8 caps). Replacements J Singleton (Worcester, uncapped), M Mullan (Wasps, 15 caps), W Collier (Harlequins, uncapped), N Isiekwe (Saracens, uncapped), D Armand (Exeter, uncapped), J Maunder (Exeter, uncapped), P Francis (Northampton, uncapped), D Solomona (Sale, uncapped).
Emirates Team New Zealand beat Ben Ainslie’s Land Rover BAR team in the first-to-five challenger semi-final on Thursday, ending British hopes in the 35th America’s Cup.
The New Zealand team held a 3-1 lead before Thursday’s races, and secured a 5-2 overall victory to end Ainslie’s dream of “bringing the America’s Cup back to Britain”. The New Zealand boat had capsized on Tuesday, with Wednesday’s four scheduled races then postponed due to high winds in Bermuda.
“We knew it was going to be incredibly tough at the first attempt,” Ainslie said. “Ultimately we weren’t able to catch up with the existing teams in time.”
Sailing’s most successful Olympian added: “I couldn’t be prouder of the team today. What we have achieved today is incredible.”
Ainslie has won the cup before, as tactician with Oracle Team USA in their 2013 comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand. But he wants to win it for “Queen and country” and under the banner “Bring The Cup Home” set about mounting his own challenge, launching BAR with the aim of doing something British teams have tried and failed to do on some 20 occasions.
New Zealand, helmed by Peter Burling, won the day’s first race by 31 seconds to move one race from eliminating the British crew. Ainslie steered his team to a 20-second victory to close the gap, but a mistake before the start line in the next race gave New Zealand a clear path to victory. Land Rover BAR tweeted shortly after their elimination, saying “our goal to win the 36th America’s Cup starts today”.
New Zealand will now progress to the challenger play-off, where they will face either Artemis Racing or SoftBank Team Japan. Sweden’s Artemis Racing currently lead their semi-final 4-3. The play-off winners will then take on the defending champions, Oracle Team USA, to determine the overall winners.
The body of the former Buffalo Bills wide receiver James Hardy has been recovered from a river near his home in Indiana, police have confirmed. He was 31.
Hardy was a college star at Indiana, where he also played basketball. He was drafted by the Bills in the second round of the 2008 draft but only played two injury-affected seasons for the team before a short spell for the Baltimore Ravens. He was released by the Ravens in September 2011, effectively ending his football career.
“We are saddened to learn of the passing of James Hardy today,” the Bills said in a statement. “We send our condolences to the Hardy family as they deal with his tragic loss.”
Hardy pursued an acting career after his retirement from football. In 2014, TMZ reported that he was arrested after attacking police officers but was declared unfit to stand trial by a judge and committed to a mental health facility.
Senior executives in British racing are starting to consider the possibility that some of the Flat season’s marquee events might suffer directly as a result of the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf, in which some of the sport’s most powerful participants are on opposite sides.
The current crisis, seen as the most serious in the region for several years, started on Monday when a coalition of states including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced that it was cutting all economic and diplomatic ties with Qatar. The Saudi-led coalition has accused Qatar of destabilising the region by supporting “terrorist and sectarian groups”, charges that Qatar denies.
Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, the most significant owner in world racing, is the UAE’s vice-president, prime minister and minister of defence. His Godolphin racing operation has 375 horses in training in Britain, and a total of 750 worldwide. Qatar, meanwhile, has also invested heavily in European racing in recent years through the increasing interest in the sport of two members of its ruling family, Sheikh Joaan al-Thani and Sheikh Fahad al-Thani.
The Qatari investment extends to racehorses and sponsorships, including the main Festival meeting at Goodwood in August and the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe meeting in France, both of which have Qatar as their principal sponsor. The British Champions Series, which includes races at a number of top tracks and Champions Day at Ascot in October, is sponsored by the Qatari investment fund Qipco, which also supports Ireland’s most prestigious all-aged race, the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September.
If the current crisis is not resolved swiftly it is possible major events including Glorious Goodwood could be affected. None of those connected to the key players that the Guardian contacted was prepared to comment on Thursday.
Godolphin was created to promote Dubai to the world and Sheikh Mohammed is its driving force. There is an acute awareness that, if the breakdown in diplomatic relations continues, it could seem inappropriate if the famous royal blue silks lined up for a race sponsored by Qatar.
Godolphin’s leading miler Ribchester, an impressive winner of the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury last month, finished a close third in the Qatar Sussex Stakes last season, and would be expected to be a leading contender for this year’s renewal. The Sussex Stakes is the feature event of what is now known as the Qatar Goodwood Festival as part of a 10-year sponsorship deal, which was the most valuable that British racing had seen when it was signed in 2014.
Ribchester is an obvious example of the possible dilemma that could face his owner, but Godolphin is such a major player in the sport that it would also expect to field fancied runners in other major events such as the Goodwood Cup, Richmond Stakes and Nassau Stakes, all of which are sponsored directly by Qatar.
The sensitivity over the situation among senior racing executives is considerable, and what all those involved in the administration and promotion of British racing are most desperate to avoid if the current situation in the Gulf continues is any hint of partiality. It is difficult to underestimate the importance of both sides to the future financial wellbeing of British racing, and the most earnest wish of all concerned is that diplomacy will find a way to resolve the crisis speedily.

On a grey, tense, occasionally febrile day at The Oval a Champions Trophy that has fizzled and sparked burst into vibrant life as Sri Lanka beat India by seven wickets to scenes of great joy among their flag-twirling fans.
This was a hugely impressive, relentlessly aggressive team batting performance as Sri Lanka chased down India’s 321, a total built around a fine century from Shikhar Dhawan. For India the match was probably lost in the middle overs as Sri Lanka bowled tightly and only MS Dhoni of that trio of grand middle order guns got into double figures.
Afterwards Angelo Mathews dedicated the win to Sri Lanka’s recent flood victims and said he hoped victory might “bring a smile” in some difficult times. The result at The Oval has also thrown up an intriguing turn for the tournament itself, with the final fixtures in Group B – Pakistan versus Sri Lanka and South Africa versus India – pared back into de facto knockout quarter-finals. It might have taken a while. We may have had to dry our socks once or twice. But the next 10 days look fraught with possibilities.
This match might still have turned late on with Sri Lanka closing in on India’s total.
Having limped his way to a feisty 47 Kusal Perera wandered off clutching a hamstring, breaking the spell of a wonderful partnership with Mathews that had seemed to be romping cloudlessly towards the finish. In came Asela Gunaratne in his place, a fun, slightly clubby-looking cricketer, who poked around a little before getting off the mark with a wonderful pulled six over square leg to leave Sri Lanka needing 43 from 36 balls. Gunaratne kept on swinging, plonking Jasprit Bumrah over midwicket. Mathews raced to his 50 and with eight balls remaining Sri Lanka were home.
The large Indian crowd was slightly chastened by the end, not to mention distinctly thinned out. But The Oval had been a seething and enthused full house for most of the day, with flags and colours of both nations ranged around the bleachers. The first great swirl of excitement came at the toss as Mathews chose to field, offering up the prospect of another display of muscular ignition from that bravura Indian top order.
At times, though, the most striking moments in a cricket match tend to arrive with a stunned hush. And so it was here midway though the Indian innings, with the deep blue platform set and the crowd cranking up the volume. Rohit Sharma had got to 50 with a flipped six off Thisara Perera, bringing up the hundred without loss in the 20th over. That first six was hit hard and flat and spilt over the boundary by Gunaratne, but the same shot led to Sharma being bounced out two overs later, spooning a catch to deep fine leg.
Enter Virat Kohli, to the familiar gale of triumphalist squeals and swoons. Bathos is defined as a sudden, unintentionally humorous anti-climax. Another definition might be Kohli c Dickwella b Pradeep 0, the world’s top white-ball batsman caught attempting a glide to a full-length ball that moved off the seam, as they will at times in England. Kohli trudged off, the silence broken only by some “who are you” chants from the Anglo-Sri Lankan ultras in the OCS stand. Kohli has batted five times now for India at The Oval for 54 runs and five times out.
At the other end Dhawan kept on motoring, that huge, pale sabre of a bat marking out a lovely high parabola and sending the ball disappearing at high speeds square of the wickets. But at 179 for two the second stunned silence arrived as Yuvraj Singh was dismissed, bowled by Gunaratne jamming a full loopy ball down into the ground, feet motionless, and seeing the ball bounce back on to his stumps. Asela bowls something perhaps best described as mystery trundlers. This was a floaty cutter that Yuvraj just seemed to lose.
Exit one galactico, enter Dhoni, who got off the mark with an extraordinary helicopter-upper cut – into the crowd over wide third man. The 200 came up at the end of the 38th over. Dhawan carved his way to his 10th hundred in one-day internationals, seven of which have come outside India. Hardik Pandya came and went, flogging Lakmal over midwicket for six before a flaccid exit next ball, swatting a wide yorker to cover.
Dhoni rattled along to 50 at a run a ball, a patient innings studded with brutal hitting, but was out soon after whirling himself almost off his feet skying a catch to long off. And for all the delirium of the crowd a score of 321 for six was imposing but still gettable.
Sri Lanka emerged cautiously in reply, edging to 44 from their opening 10 overs for the loss of Dickwella, caught slicing to short third man. The commandingly upright left-hander Danushka Gunathilaka drove with authority and produced one spanked swivelling six over deep fine leg that clattered the seats. He was joined by Kusal Mendis, who played with real wristy power all around the wicket as Sri Lanka got after Ravindra Jadeja, reduced on a bland English pitch to a rather glamorous purveyor of left-arm darts. Gunathilaka was run out for a fine 76, his top score in ODIs.
Mendis departed soon after for a lovely 89, brilliantly run out by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, but both Mathews and Kusal Perera carved fearlessly as India’s fielding grew a little ragged and a tough looking chase became a stately, occasionally violent procession.
Diego Costa’s decision to make public a text message exchange with Antonio Conte, in which the Italian apparently confirmed the striker has no future with Chelsea, could end up costing the Premier League champions millions of pounds with potential suitors now aware the Spain forward is unsettled at Stamford Bridge.
Costa, who is with his national squad having played a significant part in his club side’s title success, has said he will “have to find a way out” given his relationship with Conte and the club has effectively fractured beyond repair. Yet Chelsea have made clear to the 28-year-old that he will not be permitted to negotiate his own exit and, instead, the club will take the lead in overseeing the departure of a player whose contract has two years to run.
Chelsea had initially hoped to sell Costa to Tianjin Quanjian for £76m but their chances of generating such a mind-boggling fee, which could have been reinvested in the pursuit of Everton’s Romelu Lukaku, have been complicated by the player’s comments to the media after Spain’s draw with Colombia on Wednesday night. The striker had suggested his relationship with Conte “has been bad this season” before relaying a text exchange between the pair.
“I’m going to be honest, the other day Conte sent me a message saying he does not count on me for next season,” Costa said in the mixed zone, “so I’ll have to find a way out.” The fact the striker has made clear he has been told he can leave would appear to undermine Chelsea’s bargaining position with possible buyers. Costa could even pursue the payment of a loyalty bonus if sold given he has not formally asked for a transfer and has been told the club are actively looking to move him on.
It is understood Conte had sent an initial message detailing what he expected of the player in terms of fitness work over the summer, with the indifferent tone of Costa’s response apparently prompting a follow-up which cast doubt on the player’s future. The pair’s relationship has been tested regularly over the manager’s first year in English football. The first cracks opened in pre-season, when Costa had claimed a back injury prevented him from playing a full part in the manager’s monotonous if crucial pattern-of-play sessions, and an angry clash with a fitness coach in the wake of Tianjin first expressing interest in January testing matters further.
He was subsequently dropped for a league game at Leicester. Conte claimed that was because of another back complaint – he has been consistent in only selecting players able to play a full part in training – and had opted not to criticise the player in public after Costa was filmed enjoying a post-match beer in the dressing room following a win against West Bromwich Albion the previous month. On each occasion, the Italian made clear he would not tolerate the forward’s influence disrupting Chelsea’s pursuit of the title and, to his credit, Costa responded by leading the line effectively and taking his goal tally to 22 in all competitions. His last came in the FA Cup final defeat by Arsenal.
The player indicated in the aftermath at Wembley that he would resist any move to the Chinese Super League before the World Cup next summer, with his preference a return to his former club Atlético Madrid. Yet with the Spanish side’s transfer ban upheld and not due to expire until January 2018, he would face sitting out the first half of next season if Atlético mustered a bid deemed acceptable to Chelsea. He is unlikely to have the patience for such a scenario. “I love living in Madrid but I have to think about my future,” Costa had said. “It’s complicated because I cannot go four or five months without playing. I have no preference for a league, I just want to play.”
More plausible may be an initial switch to Milan, now under the ownership of Li Yonghong, to follow in the footsteps of Fernando Torres. The Spaniard ended up back at Atlético via a spell at San Siro, and Costa’s agent, Jorge Mendes, is believed to have been in Italy on Thursday to speak with the Rossoneri over summer recruitment. Costa’s situation will have been addressed, although Milan have alternative forward options they may opt to pursue.
Chelsea always envisaged adding to their forward ranks this summer, and had hoped to persuade Everton to drop their £100m valuation of Lukaku. Yet even that price may rise now that their eagerness to shift Costa has been exposed. The Premier League winners do retain an interest in Southampton’s Virgil van Dijk, who is no longer under immediate consideration by Liverpool, and will seek to purchase a back-up goalkeeper to replace Asmir Begovic.
Transfers are not part of Peter Moore’s remit as Liverpool’s new chief executive and the club’s alleged tapping up of Virgil van Dijk predated his official start date in the job, but his first Premier League meeting in Harrogate on Thursday will have been awkward regardless. Southampton are not the only member club to regard an emissary of Fenway Sports Group with scepticism and suspicion.
Liverpool’s owners, including John W Henry and the chairman, Tom Werner, were heavily involved in the damaging decision to withdraw interest publicly in Van Dijk on Wednesday, 24 hours after Southampton complained to the Premier League of a clandestine approach and 48 hours after it emerged the Holland defender favoured a move to Anfield over Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal.
In a statement Liverpool clalimed that “recent media speculation” was the source of “our regret”, which raises the question of why the plug was pulled on this summer’s transfer priority when countless targets who have been mentioned in the media have ended up at Anfield in the past. The evidence that Southampton allegedly have against Liverpool – Van Dijk meeting Jürgen Klopp in Blackpool, text messages from the manager to the player – suggests FSG would be justified in fearing an investigation into its club’s conduct should the Premier League take the complaint further. That could still happen, with the Premier League having written to both clubs to request their version of events. It is also worth noting that Liverpool withdrew their interest in a £60m-rated transfer, one that was months in the planning, following communication with Southampton earlier in the day.
Liverpool are under a transfer embargo at academy level for the next two years – the second year suspended – having been found guilty of tapping up a 12-year-old schoolboy from Stoke City and offering him and his family inducements.
Five years ago it was Fulham who received an apology from Liverpool after they reported the Anfield club to the Premier League for making an illegal approach to Clint Dempsey. Fulham were particularly aggrieved by a report on FSG’s website that claimed the USA international had joined Brendan Rodgers’ squad. It took a personal apology from Werner to Fulham’s then owner, Mohamed al-Fayed, followed by a letter from Liverpool’s then managing director Ian Ayre that stated: “Our club can do better and we pledge that it will,” before officials at Craven Cottage withdrew the complaint.
FSG is said to be concerned at the impact of the Van Dijk approach on Liverpool’s reputation, hence the sudden U-turn. Its dubious record in dealing with other clubs – whether on transfers or seeking to end the collective sale of overseas broadcasting rights – suggests an inability to learn from mistakes is the bigger problem.
It would be breathtakingly hypocritical of other Premier League clubs, or any professional club for that matter, to condemn Liverpool for sounding out a potential recruit. Equally, it is fair to accuse FSG or those who run the club on its behalf in England – the president, Mike Gordon, the sporting director, Michael Edwards, and Klopp – of turning what should have been a major statement of intent in the transfer market into a shambles. The warning signs did not emerge on Monday. It was 20 April when the Liverpool manager, discussing how Anfield is a more attractive proposition for recruits this summer, said: “The talks we’ve had so far are very positive. That doesn’t mean it will all work out but they are really positive and they all see the progress. That’s good.”
Klopp has missed out on a key defensive target before Liverpool had approached Southampton with a bid. Van Dijk may now question Liverpool’s commitment to a deal that always appeared problematic given he is under contract at Southampton for another five years. Liverpool have alternative central defensive targets having been conscious that Van Dijk would look elsewhere if Champions League football were not on offer – Burnley’s Michael Keane, Hull’s Harry Maguire and Napoli’s Kalidou Koulibaly are among them – but can ill-afford further blunders as they strive to build on last season’s progress. Efforts to sign Mohamed Salah have also stalled in recent days with Liverpool reluctant to meet Roma’s asking price.
It was only last week that Moore, on his first day as Ian Ayre’s successor, stated that Liverpool “won’t be spending £100m just because Manchester City has spent £100m”. But Liverpool, and FSG recognise as much, do need to invest £100m-plus in a squad that will be competing, Klopp hopes, for the Champions League and Premier League title next season. Considering Liverpool were offering £28m for Salah at the time and had treated a £60m target to a day out in Blackpool, Moore’s attempted contrast with City’s expenditure was somewhat inaccurate. City’s ability to get two signings worth £78.3m over the line with a minimum of fuss – Bernardo Silva and Ederson – is another contrast that reflects poorly on Liverpool.
There remains plenty of time and money for Klopp to enhance his squad of course but, without another dramatic turn of events in the Van Dijk saga, the rebuilding will continue without the player he wanted for the cornerstone of Liverpool’s defence. A severe and avoidable setback.
Eoin Morgan has been singled out as the most important figure behind England’s one-day revival by the team’s assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, who believes their current barnstorming approach to the format comes down to the captain’s near relentless backing of his players.
After wins over Bangladesh and New Zealand, England go into Saturday’s group game against Australia at Edgbaston with a Champions Trophy semi-final already sewn up and their one headache being whether to stick with Jason Roy or parachute in Jonny Bairstow as opener.
Morgan has previously said Roy will play through the entire tournament but his faith is being tested by the right-hander’s average of 6.71 from his seven international innings this summer. Farbrace all but ruled out a switch, however, saying it would go against the philosophy of the captain that has made their disastrous 2015 World Cup a distant memory.
“I think Eoin Morgan is the single biggest factor in England’s success in the last two years in white-ball cricket,” said Farbrace, who stepped up as caretaker coach during the New Zealand series that followed the World Cup and witnessed something of an epiphany when the side came out all guns blazing by posting 408 for nine in Birmingham in the first ODI.
“Andrew Strauss [the director of cricket] took a lot of credit in that he talked about a new emphasis, while Trevor Bayliss has come in as a very experienced coach. But for me, Eoin Morgan is the single biggest factor.
“In the buildup to that game here in 2015 [against New Zealand] he talked to players about going and playing your way – there’ll be no one getting stuck into you if you get out playing an ordinary shot. People have taken his lead and I think that’s why the team has flourished.”
Roy actually made a golden duck during that watershed total two years ago in his maiden international innings but it was the selflessness shown in attacking for the team that means Farbrace is fully behind Morgan’s current support of the 26-year-old.
He said: “We haven’t seen anything about him that suggests he is struggling for confidence. We’ve been consistent with our selections and we’ve stuck by people when they haven’t been taking wickets or scoring runs. It’s always paid dividends. I don’t see Jason being any different.
“At no stage has he ever tried to get runs for himself to keep himself in the next game. He’s always played in the way we want him to as a team and you stick by people in that case.”
Bairstow was one of four England reserves to train in the indoor school at Edgbaston on Thursday, with the XI that beat New Zealand in Cardiff given an extra day off.
On the prospect of knocking out Australia on Saturday, Farbrace added: “Our motivation is purely on keeping momentum going and playing well. We think we’re still learning. Who we’re playing on Saturday is irrelevant. It’s a case of us continuing to do well. Australia have a high quality. You want the players to be excited by that.”
Notwithstanding the vagaries of the London transport network, the biggest insult to an already beleaguered Scotland support at Wembley last November was not delivered on the pitch. As English fans vacated the premises in their thousands with plenty of time to play, their team 3-0 ahead, it became tricky to distinguish this occasion from the visit of Lithuania.
If this seems a strange scenario to highlight, consider the reverse. Should Scotland, by some miracle, find themselves coasting to victory against England at Hampden Park on Saturday there will be no rush to join the nightlife scene. Precisely the same desire to stay put and celebrate applied when the Scots recorded a famous home win over France in 2006.
Perhaps the fact that Scotland no longer pull off the kind of uplifting, surprise results when huge underdogs breeds desperation. If it has always appeared the case Scotland place more significance on a meeting with the Auld Enemy than the English – see Wembley 1977 as a case in point – respective attitudes have surely never looked more contrasting.
England’s supporters are perfectly accustomed to qualifying for major championships as a bare minimum. While Gareth Southgate can hardly be classed as a blue-chip manager, his players collectively operate at a level from which the Scots have long since been removed. But, intriguingly, as far as professionals are concerned any notion that Scotland actually care more about a fixture with England than their opposition is flawed.
“That idea is completely wrong,” says David Weir, who won 69 Scotland caps and spent a significant chunk of his career at Everton. “They might play it down beforehand – like they are not bothered and it’s not that important a game because they are a big country who play against big countries all the time – but they’ll happily rub your nose in it afterwards.
“It gets painted as Scotland’s World Cup final but the reality is if England get a result they like to enjoy it and stress the importance of it. They might even say how easy it was to beat us. It definitely means plenty to England, albeit they try to downplay it. There is always still an edge to that game”.
For England the stakes are, of course, higher in one respect. “We are talking about qualification for a World Cup,” says Weir. “England are in a decent position but that can change quickly. The English players also know the stick they get if they don’t win any international.”
There are many background factors that are pertinent here, of course. Scotland is the smaller neighbour, for starters. For so long, the production of top-class football players north of the border meant Scots loved causing embarrassment to the English – and could. The negative depiction of England, particularly when it comes to sport, in Scotland would always involve arrogance.
It is a truism throughout football that some fans would take one-off success over age-old rivals before more tangible reward. Scotland’s problem is, without a major tournament appearance since 1998 and a world ranking of 61, this rivalry exists on grounds of history alone. It is difficult to link battles for land dating back centuries as a motivation for people attending a football game in 2017 but the current political landscape – where an independent Scotland is very much part of the equation – fuels attitudes on both sides. “They want it badly too,” insists Craig Burley who, like Weir, was a Scotland international based in England.
“We tend to convince ourselves it means more to us as a mechanism to overcome [football] class deficit, particularly now. They’re depicted as caring less because of salaries and reputations. I can’t speak for individuals but as a whole the English lads I knew wanted it badly. This ‘they’re not bothered as much as us’ does not wash with me.”
For a spell in the late 1980s Ray Wilkins was the reverse of Weir and Burley – a decorated England international who enjoyed a club period at Rangers. “I always felt the rivalry was equally intense at both ends,” Wilkins says. “What I remember was hilarity when we came to play at Hampden, with some of the antics from the supporters towards us when we were on the bus or before kick‑off. We used to be in absolute fits on the coach.
“ You do tend to get the impression that it means more in Scotland. Most of the time when I played, Scotland were the underdogs, so there was that little bit of added intensity on their behalf. But believe me – if there was one fixture we wanted to win, it was that one.”
Jim Baxter enjoyed a superb club career but is best known as the player to do keepy-uppys in a Scotland shirt at Wembley in 1967. So much of the Tartan Army’s chosen verse involves barbs, putting it mildly, towards England. The trouble is, evidence that a sense of significance works both ways is increasingly difficult to find; off the field, at least.

The Dutch sprinter Amy Pieters beat the British national champion, Hannah Barnes, to victory on stage two of the Women’s Tour in Stoke-on-Trent.
Pieters, a Boels-Dolmans team-mate of Lizzie Deignan, edged out Canyon/SRAM’s Barnes and Ellen van Dijk (Sunweb) to take the win, while the stage one winner, Katarzyna Niewiadoma, was fifth to retain the overall lead.
The 144.5km stage around Stoke-on-Trent finished in a reduced sprint after the lone escapee, Lucinda Brand (Sunweb), was caught with seven kilometres left to go. Brand had sought to follow the blueprint of Niewiadoma’s solo win on Wednesday as she attacked off the front after Ipstones, the first of the two categorised climbs late in the day. Brand built a lead of one minute and 20 seconds over the peloton and was still almost a minute clear as she began the final 20km, but in contrast to the opening day there was no hesitating in the pack as the chase was on.
Barnes’ sister Alice, riding for the Drops team, was eighth while Dani King (Cylance) was ninth as three British riders finished in the top 10.
Niewiadoma continues to lead the general classification by 1min 42sec from her WM3 team-mate Marianne Vos, with Hannah Barnes third on the same time.
Meanwhile, Germany’s Phil Bauhaus beat the big-name sprinters to victory on stage five of the Critérium du Dauphiné in Mâcon. The 22-year-old Sunweb rider took his first WorldTour victory ahead of the stage two winner, Arnaud Démare of FDJ, and Direct-Energie’s Bryan Coquard, while Nacer Bouhanni (Cofidis) and Alexander Kristoff (Katusha-Alpecin) could manage only fifth and sixth respectively.
Thomas De Gent (Lotto-Soudal) finished in the pack to retain his overall lead – although he will expect to be spending his last day in the yellow and blue jersey on Friday with the general classification battle about to come alive.
This was the last opportunity for the sprinters before the race heads to the mountains for the final three days, with Chris Froome needing to make up time after he was only eighth on Wednesday’s time trial. He sits sixth overall, 64 seconds down on De Gendt, but it is his former team-mate Richie Porte who is seen as in pole position for overall victory. The Tasmanian, now with BMC, is in second place with 37 seconds in hand over Froome.
On Thursday morning, the French newspaper L’Équipe published a story suggesting Froome wants to ride for BMC next year but the Sky man told Cycling News the story was “complete rubbish” while BMC also denied having an interest in the three-times Tour winner. In 2016, Froome signed a contract with Team Sky which runs until the end of the 2018 season.
Usain Bolt has revealed how the death of his close friend Germaine Mason, the British high jumper, left him so devastated that he was unable to train for more than two weeks, threatening to derail his farewell season.
The eight-times Olympic gold medallist had been out with the 34-year-old Mason before he died in a motorcycle accident in Kingston in April, and was one of the first on the scene after the crash. Pictures of a distraught Bolt, in tears as he carried Mason’s coffin in the funeral, showed how much his friend’s death had affected him.
“It was rough for me at the start. It took us by surprise and set me back a little bit training-wise,” Bolt said. “Mentally, I wasn’t ready to even train for, like, two and a half weeks, which I had to take off and just collect myself.
“So I have been working hard trying to get back to where I was, but I am confident in myself and my coach that we can get it done because we have done it years and years, and this year isn’t any different. So it was tough, but I have to focus on what I have to do.”
Bolt is now back in training and hopeful of showing his form when he makes his last ever appearance in Jamaica at the Racers Grand Prix, at Kingston’s National Stadium on Saturday. The meeting is set to feature a star-studded cast of athletes including Britain’s four-times Olympic champion Mo Farah, the double Olympic 800m gold medallist David Rudisha and South Africa’s 400m world record holder and Rio gold medallist Wayde van Niekerk.
“I know my friend would have wanted me to go out there to do my best and to be strong and to be focused on what needs to be done,” said Bolt, who believes he is back on track in his preparations for the World Championships in London in August, where he is due to run the 100m and 4x100m relay.
“There is no other place to do the last one,” he told the Gleaner. “The Olympics in London was out of this world. The support, the energy in the stadium was magnificent. Everywhere in the world I go people keep saying: ‘See you in London’. I don’t know if they have so many tickets, but I know the energy is going to be amazing, and it will definitely be emotional for me,” he said of this summer’s championship. “It’s the last one, and so many Jamaican fans will be there, and it’s for me to go out in as much glory as I can. I am looking forward to it.”
Mason was born in Jamaica and trained with the Stephen Francis-coached MVP Track Club before switching allegiance to Great Britain in 2006. Two years later he won a silver medal for Great Britain in Beijing after jumping 2.34m – a height that equalled his personal best – to finish behind the Russian Andrey Silnov, who cleared 2.36m.
Craig Shakespeare has been confirmed as Leicester City’s permanent manager and given a three-year contract that provides a measure of the club’s faith in him after he steered the team away from the Premier League relegation zone in the wake of Claudio Ranieri’s sacking.
Leicester’s owners were hugely impressed with the way Shakespeare galvanised the players across the final three months of the season and the only surprise is that the club took so long to announce that the 53-year-old has been rewarded with the job.
Shakespeare, who had previously served as assistant manager to Ranieri and Nigel Pearson, won eight of his 16 matches in charge, including seven in the Premier League, ensuring that any fears of relegation were allayed as Leicester finished 12th after winning the title the season before. He also guided Leicester into the Champions League quarter-finals after overseeing a memorable 2-0 second-leg win against Sevilla at the King Power Stadium.
Although he had never managed before, Shakespeare made no secret of the fact that he was interested in succeeding Ranieri shortly after he was given an opportunity in February. It quickly became clear that he enjoyed the support of players who were disillusioned under Ranieri, and that showed in a turnaround that led to Shakespeare becoming the first British manager to win his first five Premier League matches in charge. Staff were also impressed with the way Shakespeare adapted to the role and looked like a natural manager.
Talks took place with the club’s owners at the end of the season and culminated in the news that Shakespeare has been given a long-term deal to build on the results of last season.
“This is a really exciting opportunity for me to continue along this new path in my career and to continue to work with a club and a group of staff I’ve grown extremely close to,” Shakespeare said. “I’m grateful to the owners and the board of directors for their continued faith and support.
“Our preparations for pre-season and the new Premier League campaign have been ongoing for some time, but we can now move on with certainty and ensure we are well equipped to compete at the levels now expected of a club like Leicester City.”
As well as trying to strengthen the squad over the summer, Shakespeare will need to bring in an assistant manager. He is also expected to add another coach to a backroom team that was left depleted when Ranieri departed along with several of the staff that worked alongside him.
For Leicester’s owners, who were vindicated in their controversial decision to dismiss Ranieri, Shakespeare is seen as the right man to lead the club after a couple of remarkable years, during which they have won the Premier League, flirted with relegation and got through to the last eight of the Champions League.
“Craig has shown all the qualities in leadership, motivation and talent management that are required to be successful in this role,” Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicester’s vice chairman, said.
“Those qualities, aligned with his first‑class coaching acumen, his knowledge of Leicester City and its philosophy, and the respect he has earned at every level of the club make him the ideal choice to help take us forward.
“Our primary objective for the coming years is to successfully translate the extraordinary experiences of the last two seasons into lessons that will strengthen and enhance the club’s pursuit of its long‑term vision of sustainable success.
“Continuity is among the key elements to making such a process work. Over the last nine years, Craig has built a unique insight into the catalysts for success at Leicester City, its impact on our personnel and the conditions needed to ensure its longevity.”
The Reverend David Warner, as he is now known by his Australia team-mates, has pointed to his late-night swing at Joe Root in Birmingham’s Walkabout bar four years ago as the turning point in his career, one that has led to him becoming the most feared of openers on the field while transforming him into a mild family man off it.
The meeting on Saturday between Australia and England at Edgbaston – a match Steve Smith’s side likely need to win to join their opponents in the Champions Trophy semi-finals – was always going to lead to Warner’s infamous punch being revisited. It came after the corresponding fixture in 2013, resulting in his banishment from the start of the Ashes series that summer.
Now 30, married with two young children and teetotal to boot, Warner looks back at that night as the making of him, with the numbers since certainly supporting the theory given that 26 of his 31 international centuries have come since the Walkabout incident.
“It was definitely [pivotal] in becoming the person I am today and not just the cricketer,” said Warner, speaking four years to the day of the episode that followed England’s 48-run win and led to his being suspended, fined £7,000 and packed off to Australia’s A tour of Zimbabwe.
“We all go through periods when young and naive. It’s not about stuffing up and moving on, it’s about learning the ropes of being away on tour for such a long period of time. There are things you have to think about as a youngster: ‘What can or can’t I do?’ I probably didn’t work that out at that stage but now I have and have a great balance on and off the field.”
There are things you have to think about as a youngster. ‘What can or can’t I do?’
The incident, called “an unprovoked physical attack” by England in a statement at the time, was said to have been sparked by Warner taking offence at Root wearing a wig on his chin in the belief he was mocking South Africa’s Hashim Amla. The Yorkshireman labelled this explanation “ridiculous” before the pair went on to bury the hatchet during the 2015 Ashes series. “People didn’t look too far or deep into it to see who was in the right or wrong – and that’s forgotten,” the Australia vice‑captain said. “But that’s all gone, it’s in the past and we can tell a ‘happily ever after’ story at the end of my career.”
Warner said the pair would shake hands this weekend and might even return to the Walkabout if they offer him a couple of free soft drinks. But while his previous nickname of “the Bull” has largely been replaced by something more ethereal these days, he insists the punchy side of his character has not fully disappeared.
“It depends on what day you get me,” Warner replied. “Most of the time, I’m probably the Reverend – as they say – but look, it’s about coming out and winning games for Australia and being the best person I can [be] around the team and around people outside cricket.”
Warner comes into the England match brimming with form, having crunched more one-day runs (1,957) since the last World Cup than any other batsman and top-scored in the most recent Indian Premier League, with his lower centre of gravity and brutal cut-shot making him one of the most thrilling players to watch.
But it is of course England who can land the knockout blow on Saturday, with Australia going into the game on the back of two washouts against New Zealand and Bangladesh that have left their hopes of reaching the semi-finals hanging by a thread.
Warner said: “England are a very good team – one of the best in the world. They’ve been playing fantastic cricket and in their own back yard, they know the conditions, they bowl well and they bat well. For us, it’s about coming out and playing our best cricket to beat them.
“I think the way Eoin [Morgan] has been handling the troops is fantastic – he has been the key and his form alongside Rooty has been fantastic. We know Jase [Roy], hasn’t been going well, but he is a key man for them at the top of the order and the same with [Alex] Hales.
“We have to respect each and every bowler that we face – they have been bowling well and used the conditions in Cardiff, we have to be mindful of that.”
The Bull of old may have looked to try a few mind-games ahead of match but that the rebranded 2017 version is now talking up his opponents is surely cause for a hallelujah.
A shiny bronze pfennig for the thoughts of Jürgen Klopp. The man worked absolute wonders last season to earn Liverpool a place in the Big Cup qualifiers. Just think about it for a minute: a top-four finish, despite a defence featuring a goalkeeper who only finally learned how to punch the ball correctly this March, a teenage striking sensation gone to seed, and Dejan Lovren. Klopp’s reward for turning base metal into gold? The promise of some transfer money for a few upgrades. So he gave sporting director Michael Edwards a list with the names Mohamed Salah, Naby Keïta, Ryan Sessegnon and Virgil van Dijk on it. But on the way to the shops, Edwards dropped the list. Then on the way back, Edwards lost his yellow basket. A-tisket, a-tasket! Won’t someone help him find his basket? Was it green? No! Was it blue? No no no no! Just a little yellow basket.
The thick black vapour currently pouring from Klopp’s lugs as a result of this clanking ineptitude brings to mind one of the great quotes regarding clodhopping transfer-market uselessness. “What do you think they’re smoking over there?!” quipped none other than Liverpool owner John W Henry, upon taking receipt of Arsenal’s pointlessly antagonistic £40,000,001 bid for Luis Suárez back in 2013. Now, four years down the line, Henry’s own club have taken needlessly self-defeating behaviour to a whole new level during their brash pursuit of Van Dijk. A level which, if Henry’s First Law of Negotiation Buffoonery is any measure, suggests we’re way beyond mere smokes, probably past hot knives too, and on to a contraption consisting of a sturdy bucket, a 10-gallon barrel of water and several metres of garden hose.
As if being forced into a humiliating climbdown after prematurely celebrating Van Dijk’s arrival wasn’t bad enough, Liverpool also look like losing out on Sessegnon to Spurs and Keïta to Milan, while the Salah deal has seemingly stalled over a stubborn refusal to meet a headline £42m bill, despite reports in Italy claiming Roma would be perfectly happy with £35m as a compromise. Given all four transfers were recently considered shoo-ins, it may be time for Liverpool’s backroom staff to be given a refresher course on arm-joint/large-intestine identification techniques. Although fair’s fair, they did start the summer by landing Dominic Solanke, who scored twice against Italy on Thursday to send England to the U-20 World Cup final. That’s England’s first World Cup final at any level since 1966 … and he’s the two-goal hero! So that’s got to be worth something, right, Liverpool fans? Eh? Y’what?

The obvious reaction three games into an NBA finals the Golden State Warriors are almost certain to win is that Kevin Durant is the series MVP. After all, he is averaging 34 points and 10 rebounds a game and pulled out Game 3 for Golden State with a three-pointer that clinched the 118-113 victory over Cleveland. Most will say he is clearly the difference between the 2017 and 2016 finals, which the Cavaliers won in seven games.
But they forget that the Warriors also have Stephen Curry back.
The man who was considered the league’s best player two years running was not himself in last year’s playoffs. Part of this was because he sprained his knee early in the postseason and didn’t appear to be playing at full strength. But there was something else too, something that might have had more to do with the Warriors losing the finals than an aching knee: mentally, Curry wasn’t there.
This wasn’t something that got much attention as Golden State built up a 3-1 lead in last year’s championship round, and yet it was discussed around the team. Something was eating at Steph. At the time, sources told the Guardian that Curry was “distracted”: that the previous 13 months had become too much. And it’s little wonder: in that time he had won a title and two league MVPs, as well as adapted to a new level of fame and all the obligations and pressures that come with that.
While some great players are good at cutting out the chatter around them, Curry hates to let anyone down. “Steph’s a pleaser,” Bruce Fraser, the Warriors assistant coach closest to Curry, told the Guardian early in last year’s postseason. “He wants to please people, that’s an incredibly redeeming quality.”
But as Golden State struggled to get past Durant’s Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference finals and then lost to the Cavaliers in the finals, some around the team worried that Curry was trying to please too many people and was draining himself. He still led the Warriors in scoring during the 2016 finals with 22.6 points a game, but averaged just 3.7 assists and never played with the joy he had in the previous two seasons. He appeared frustrated.
In these playoffs, however, that burden appears to have lifted, and Curry has been brilliant. Lost behind Durant’s excellent is Curry’s 28.7 points a game alongside 9 assists and 9.7 rebounds. Yes, the thinnest player on the floor is getting almost 10 rebounds a game. Quietly, he is having one of the great playoff runs in NBA history.
Undoubtedly the presence of Durant makes Curry and the other Warriors better. Durant forces the Cavs, who are not a good defensive team, to make choices over which Golden State star they will try to stop. He was huge in the late minutes of Wednesday’s Game 3 as the Warriors scored the final 11 points to steal Cleveland’s last real chance to get back in the series. His presence allows Golden State to survive Klay Thompson’s shooting slump in Game 1 and Draymond Green’s foul troubles. He makes the bench deeper and helped the Warriors endure the loss of coach Steve Kerr, who missed most of the playoffs with back problems.
Still, the Warriors should have won last year’s championship without Durant. Several times they stood on the brink of breaking the Cavs only to fall just short. Had Green not been suspended for Game 5 last year, or had center Andrew Bogut not gone down with a knee injury, Golden State probably would have won their second straight title and we’d be talking about a three-year run of championships. Durant helps a lot but the Warriors unselfish atmosphere that allowed Curry, Thompson and Green to thrive together also accepted the arrival of one the game’s top three players.
That culture, as anyone who has been around the Warriors will tell you, is Curry’s. At some level this remains his team. And when he is the Curry of old, Golden State are incredibly hard to beat. And so far this postseason, Curry has been the Curry of old. The enthusiasm has returned.
“Last season was a very unique year for a lot of different reasons and we learned a lot,” Curry said Wednesday night. “I think we have grown and matured just mentally of how to just pace yourself through this long year and take every day as a new experience and something that you can kind of take control of.”
He was speaking about the fatigue of following up a season in which his team won a record 73 regular season games, but he may well have been talking about himself. The drain of 2016 seems gone. Now the Warriors can break a new record and become the first NBA team to go 16-0 in the postseason.
Durant has been a tremendous in these finals and yet the Warriors’ biggest addition to this year’s title round might be that they have the old Steph Curry back again.
Paul Simpson has urged his England Under-20s to write their names into the history books after they became the first men’s team from these shores to reach a World Cup final since 1966. England play Venezuela in Sunday’s final after they came from behind to beat Italy 3-1 in the last four. Dominic Solanke, who is due to sign for Liverpool, scored either side of Ademola Lookman’s simple strike to propel Simpson’s side into the final in South Korea, with all three of their goals coming in the final 25 minutes. It is 51 years since England had a team in a major global football final, when Sir Alf Ramsey’s side beat West Germany at the old Wembley.
“It’s a dream to take a team to a World Cup final,” Simpson, the England Under-20s manager, said. “I was born in 1966 and that was the last time we did it. We’re delighted to be in it and I’ve said from the first day I am greedy and I want to go and win the final. I don’t just want to make the numbers up, We always thought we had a chance to go to the final. We’ve achieved that, but really we’ve achieved nothing yet because we have to go and win and put our name into the history books of English football.”
The spine of this England group has been neatly blossoming for some time. Freddie Woodman, Jonjoe Kenny, Lewis Cook, the captain, and Solanke helped England to the Under-17s European Championship title in Malta three years ago and last year they formed the nucleus of the team beaten by Italy in the semi-finals of the Under-19s European Championship.
England started brightly in Jeonju, earning an early corner after a surging Kenny run, but moments later they found themselves on the back foot and trailing. When Cook, the Bournemouth midfielder, was penalised for handball on the halfway line, Italy took England by surprise with a quick free-kick. Andrea Favilli lost his marker, Fikayo Tomori, and the Ascoli forward unselfishly picked out his strike partner Riccardo Orsolini, who fired his curling first-time effort beyond Woodman in the England goal.
Italy, though, failed to build upon their promising start and retreated deeper and deeper, happy to soak up England pressure. Yet there was only so long they could suffocate England’s attacking talents. Solanke twice went close to levelling before half-time, heading narrowly wide before forcing Andrea Zaccagno, the Italy goalkeeper, into a smart stop and Simpson’s side dominated large spells of the game but eventually they were rewarded for an excellent performance, with Kenny, the Everton full-back, and Liverpool’s forward Sheyi Ojo, a second-half substitute, particularly influential in giving England a cutting edge in the final third.
Ojo made an instant impact and struck a post with a fine, bending effort before his devious cross supplied Solanke, who reacted quickest in the box to finish coolly after 66 minutes. The 19-year‑old Ojo then sent in another cross from the right flank, which Everton’s Lookman, who calmly collected before smashing the ball low and beyond Zaccagno with 13 minutes left.
Italy were deflated but England continued to pour forward and added a third when Solanke struck ambitiously from 25 yards out. The forward, who will move to Anfield from Chelsea next month, saw promptly wheeled away after in celebration of capping England’s win after his powerful as effort slipped through the hands of Zaccagno, who failed to parry.
England’s best finish in this competition had been third in 1993, but now they have a chance to be crowned world champions in Suwon on Sunday against Venezuela, who had earlier prevailed on penalties against Uruguay in the other semi-final. Venezuela trailed to a 49th-minute penalty before Samuel Sosa equalised in added time, then won the shootout 4-3 after a goalless extra time.
It was a fine day for England’s youth sides. On Saturday the Young Lions will defend their Toulon Tournament title in France after beating Scotland 3-0 in the semi-finals, thanks to a Harvey Barnes double and an Elliot Embleton strike just hours after the Under-20s secured passage to the final.
The Stoppelkamp-Alle is a rather unusual boulevard that runs for precisely 82.3 metres in front of the Benteler-Arena, home of SC Paderborn 07. It was opened in October 2014, just weeks after the man who inspired it, Moritz Stoppelkamp, had scored the club’s most famous goal against Hannover 96, from the same distance. The goal came at a high point for the club, on the day they moved to the top of the Bundesliga for the first time in their history.
Less than three years later and Paderborn have fallen through the trapdoor, out of the third division into the Regionalliga and amateur football. Three relegations in three years: a feat never before “achieved” in professional German football. Paderborn put up a fight at the bitter end but by the time they started swinging it was already too late.
Or at least so it seemed, until 1860 Munich inadvertently did them a favour. Having been relegated from the second tier, 1860 Munich failed to stump up the €10m needed for a license to compete in the third division. Paderborn quickly stuffed their license application into an envelope, transferred the money to the DFB and now dare to hope that the backdoor to the third tier is still on the latch.
1860’s fate may rescue Paderborn but, even if they are allowed to start next season in the third tier, the club is still at rock bottom. Speaking after their final game of the season – a scoreless draw away at VfL Osnabrück – manager Steffen Baumgart made no excuses, saying they had simply failed. Parachuted in with only a handful of games to play in April, the former Hansa Rostock striker had a simple remit: halt the slide. The team picked 11 points in his five games in charge, so it is not his fault, but they still slipped over the precipice.
The club is currently swamped in gloom but the Paderborn story had been an uplifting one until very recently. The club’s roots date back to 1907 but they took on the name of SC Paderborn 07 in 1985, when three local sides merged together. Having spent most of their history in the Regionalliga, the club reached the second tier in 2005. Promotion ushered in a new era of prosperity and they established themselves as regulars in the second division, spending eight of the next nine seasons at that level.
The second tier in any country is generally unforgiving and unpredictable, with a handful of teams moving through the revolving doors at both ends. Clubs have to compete with lower-league upstarts who are charging up the tables, such as Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig, while fending off big-budget giants who have bellyflopped in from above – VfB Stuttgart and Hannover 96 last season, for example.
Despite the stiff competition, Paderborn made a couple of decent stabs at promotion to the top flight, finishing fifth in 2010 and 2012, before appointing freshly qualified coach André Breitenreiter for the start of the 2013-14 season. He helped them make history that season, when a second-place finish guaranteed promotion to the Bundesliga. Only a decade after playing in the Regionalliga, Paderborn were dining at the top table of German football.
Despite the euphoria and the confidence everyone had in Breitenreiter, Paderborn began the season among the favourites for the drop. The players, however, had no intention of playing with their old mates in the second division and began their maiden Bundesliga campaign with a bang. They went unbeaten in their first four games – including that 2-0 win over Hannover 96, the game still remembered for Stoppelkamp’s long-distance wonder strike – to go top of the league. They only stayed there for three days but reaching the summit of German football was something to sing about.
They had bolted out of the blocks but the mission was still to squeeze as much out of their early-season run as possible and survive. Next stop Munich and a 4-0 defeat. Welcome to the Bundesliga. Still, Breitenreiter’s team dusted themselves off and secured some decent results in the next few weeks, picking up another 11 points before the winter break to leave them relatively snug in 10th place at the halfway point of the season.
The winter break can slam the breaks on any momentum a club has built up and give rivals time to regroup and strengthen. Paderborn started 2015 sluggishly, quickly shedding the points reserve they had collected before Christmas, and they were soon flirting with the bottom three as the Bundesliga dream turned into the reality of a relegation fight.
They appeared to be sitting pretty in midtable but five of the eight teams below them were Stuttgart, Hamburg, Werder Bremen, Hertha Berlin and Jürgen Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund – all of whom were bound to improve. And so it came to pass. By Valentine’s Day, Hamburg and Bremen had leapfrogged them. And, by the time they had lost 6-0 at home to Bayern Munich, Paderborn were also watching Borussia Dortmund drift into the distance.
Suddenly things began to look serious. To their credit, they did not spend a second in the bottom three until the start of March – the problem was they only spent one week out of it after then, and not the final one. They fought for survival right up until the last day of the campaign but finished a point below 15th-place Hertha Berlin and went down. The dream was over and the nightmare was about to begin.
He had taken the club down but Breitenreiter’s good work had not been lost on the football world and he was appointed by Schalke. Markus Gellhaus took over as interim boss at Paderborn but he only lasted only until October, when Steffen Effenberg swapped giving his opinions in a TV studio to give instructions the touchline. Effenberg took over with the team already tumbling towards the bottom three but he did not lack confidence and said all the right things. He was typically bullish, batting away any talk of consecutive relegations. Effenberg, “the Tiger”, had been a winner in his playing career and hoped some of that mentality would rub off on his players in his first job in management.
It wasn’t to be. Less than five months down the line, Effenberg had only steered the club further into trouble, eventually being relieved of his duties with Paderborn in 17th place, already five points from safety. The new man, academy coach and former Paderborn player Rene Müller came in with 10 games to stop the unthinkable: back-to-back relegations. He won nine points in those 10 games and Paderborn finished bottom of the table.
Effenberg’s appointment had been nothing short of a disaster and Müller never really had a chance. Players were jumping ship and grabbing any lifeline they could, leaving the team was in constant flux, barely recognisable from the side that had performed so valiantly in the Bundesliga. After two relegations in a row, the club were in freefall.
They never really got going in the third division. Müller was sacked in November after a 6-0 defeat to Sportfreunde Lotte, a club competing in the third tier for the first time in their history, and his replacement, Stefan Emmerling, was already out the door by Easter. Paderborn were experiencing the now familiar slide towards the bottom of the league. They were fighting to stay in the Bundesliga pyramid – not just with the big boys, but on the map. If Baumgart been appointed just a few weeks earlier, they might just have managed it without the help of 1860 Munich.
Paderborn have likely been spared an arduous task. Coming back up from the fourth tier is very difficult. To have any chance of bouncing back into the third division, Paderborn would have needed to win the Regionalliga West outright. And, while there are three places in the third division up for grabs every season, they are split between the five regional leagues: Bavaria, Nord, Nordost, Südwest and West. Six teams go into the promotion play-offs – the champions of each league and the second-placed team from the league with the most clubs (this year it was Südwest) – where they play each other home and away for the golden ticket back into the bottom floor of the Bundesliga.
Paderborn have shown signs of life under Baumgart, who has committed himself to the club. Just days after their relegation, they lined up for the final of the Westfalenpokal, one of 21 regional cups that is effectively a qualifying tournament for the DFB Pokal, the German Cup. After serving up a season of misery and struggle for their fans, they were at least able to give them something to cheer about by winning the final 3-1.
Scant consolation maybe, but the victory and the funds that will come from appearing in next season’s DFB Pokal may just provide a touch of solid ground to halt the downward spiral. They will be even happier if and when the Bundesliga confirms that 1860 Munich have been demoted and their position in the third tier is secure. Regardless of which league Paderborn compete in next season, their fans will hope that the only way is up. And those walking the 82.3 metres down the Stoppelkamp Allee may be thinking “there but for the grace of God”.

Australian tennis player Thanasi Kokkinakis is facing a court battle over his right to use his Special K nickname commercially.
A directions hearing between Kellogg’s, the breakfast cereal maker that owns the right to the Special K trademark in Australia, and Kokkinakis took place in the federal court in Adelaide on Thursday.
Kellogg’s wants to stop the 21-year-old from using the term Special K as part of a branding campaign that would include clothing and tennis wear, the Adelaide Advertiser says.
“Special K is obviously an iconic cereal brand for Kellogg’s in Australia,” a spokeswoman for the company’s Australian division told the newspaper.
Justice Brigitte Markovic sent the case to a mediation conference in August. She also allowed Kellogg’s extra time to amend its statement of claim and for Kokkinakis to file a defence. The case will return to the federal court on 31 August.
The company’s Australian trademark for Special K dates back 59 years, but the cereal first appeared on the US market in 1955. Throughout its history it has been marketed as a low-fat, low-sugar breakfast targeted at dieters.
Kokkinakis has endured a frustrating run with injuries over the past two years and fell outside the world top 1,000. At one point, he managed only one top-level singles match in 20 months. He admitted last week that the prolonged period on the sidelines had emotionally drained him. “It’s been shit-house,” Kokkinakis said.
The sportsman returned to action during the French Open this week. Playing with a protected ranking of 81, he took the first set from world No 8 Kei Nishikori in their first-round singles encounter, but the Australian ended up losing in four sets.
It’s not how, it’s how many. Australia were far from their best against Saudi Arabia in Adelaide on Thursday night but they did enough to earn the three points that keep alive their hopes for automatic qualification for Russia 2018.
Two poacher’s goals from Tomi Juric and a screamer from Tom Rogic papered over the cracks of the latest unflattering performance from the Asian Cup holders. Despite scoring inside five minutes, Australia were lucky to be level at half-time, and despite dominating the second term they failed to secure the two-goal cushion that would have seen them leapfrog their Group B opponents on goal difference.
Ange Postecoglou deserves great credit for extracting a much improved second-half performance after a skittish opening term. At the interval Australia were second best and short of options, by the final whistle they could savour a job done, if not necessarily well done.
But for all the praise the coach deserves for his interventions, questions remain about the quality of this iteration of his national side. Notably, the back three again looked unsuited to the task and the attacking set-up lacked the craft and flow of their opponents.
Everything began perfectly. Tomi Juric’s beautifully taken opener rewarded his and his team’s early industry. Whenever a white shirt took possession two or more golden ones immediately swarmed in unison like a gang of pick-pockets. This was the training ground brought to matchday; Ange’s archetype, relentless without the ball and composed with it.
But in the blink of an eye that vim evaporated. The early goal failed to live up to its cliche and instead of settling the confidence of the hosts and forcing the visitors to overreach, it somehow sucked the life out of Australia’s press and the Saudis took control.
The purposeful harrying in the middle and final thirds was replaced by ball-watching and an inability to disrupt play. The equaliser on 22 minutes came as no surprise but the ease with which Australia’s midfield and defence was sliced open by a series of neat passes still exasperated. There was no tackle, no professional foul and no tracking of the runners. It was an indictment on the defensive mindset. Mark Milligan’s value grew in absentia.
The next phase was torturous. Saudi Arabia could have scored three and should have bagged at least one as Australia pondered in possession and looked unable or unwilling to adapt in transition or take the game on in broken play.
Plan A – used agonisingly often to reset – involved Trent Sainsbury, in front of his own D, feeding Aaron Mooy who then looked for Tom Rogic. It seldom worked and around them there was a lack of appetite or freedom of thought to interpret the game on the run. Time and again in this increasingly long and winding road to Russia players have declined opportunities to take responsibility. Again in Adelaide there were too many passengers and too few influencers. Everything productive Australia tried had the fingerprints of Rogic or Mooy on it. They cannot be relied upon to deliver indefinitely.
Rogic was excellent on his return to the side and his goal lit up the night. Jackson Irvine was anonymous alongside him in his advanced midfield role and his lack of impact highlighted the benefit to this system of someone like James Troisi, one of this country’s few risk takers. Troisi is a low-percentage option, shooting often and scoring rarely, but he brings an impetus to games, an unpredictability that such a predictable team could benefit from.
Defensively Saudi Arabia were a shambles, conceding two poor goals and at risk throughout of shipping more, but going forward their nimble combinations were everything Postecoglou’s sides aspire to be. Yahia Al Shehri, Mohammed Al Sahlawi and Salem Al Dawsari in particular all displayed excellent technique allied with a game awareness that allowed them to keep the ball moving with one touch, probing space, keeping defenders on the turn.
Postecoglou has stated, admirably, that he is not managing a team whose intention is merely to qualify for the World Cup, but to go to Russia and win it. On current form, that remains wishful thinking, but you have to be in it to win it, and a second win in a row after four spirit-sapping draws, is not to be sneezed at. Next up, the small matter of Japan away.
This might have been another year of European heartbreak for Juventus, but domestically it was the same old story. The Bianconeri won Serie A for the sixth consecutive season, and collected their third straight Coppa Italia as well. No team had ever won either trophy so many times in succession. They have made the unprecedented look routine.
And yet, this season was not lacking in drama. To the contrary, there was something wild about this campaign right from the start. There were 32 goals scored (not to mention three red cards) on the opening weekend alone. The final tally of 2.96 per game was highest among Europe’s top five leagues.
Quantity is not synonymous with quality, and the gulf between Serie A’s haves and have nots has rarely appeared more stark. Yet there was scintillating football to be found outside of a Juventus team that fell one game short of the treble. Roma and Napoli each broke the 90-goal mark while setting club-record points tallies for a top-flight campaign.
Despite finishing third, the Partenopei might have been the most entertaining team in all of Europe. A side that began the season fretting about how to replace Gonzalo Higuaín first discovered Arkadiusz Milik, and then unleashed Dries Mertens into a new centre-forward role. We called him a ‘false nine’ to begin with. Thirty-six goals later: not so much.
Then there was Atalanta, a defiant example of what can be achieved with a well-run academy and a dash of trust. Lazio sparkled under Simone Inzaghi before an end-of-season fade. Torino gave us helter-skelter entertainment and a breakout season for the prolific Andrea Belotti.
Some of the best stories, though, unfolded at clubs further down the standings. This season will be remembered for Crotone’s miraculous escape – claiming 20 points from their last nine games after previously having scraped together just 14 in 29. Over at Sampdoria, lifelong fan Christian Puggioni went from third-choice goalkeeper to dominating the Derby della Lanterna at 35 years old.
And how about Fabio Pisacane, The Guardian’s inaugural Player of the Year in 2016? Paralysed by Guillain-Barré syndrome at 14, then feted for reporting a director’s attempt to fix a third-tier match in 2011, he finally made his top-flight debut in September. His tears at the end of that 3-0 win over Atalanta were an abiding image of this campaign.
It was a season of farewells – from Francesco Totti to Silvio Berlusconi, but also one for new beginnings. Giovanni Simeone emulated his dad, Diego, with an iconic headed goal against Juventus. Moise Kean became the first player born this century to score in one of Europe’s top-five leagues, and then was trumped by the even-younger Pietro Pellegri.
If those were the positives, then we must also acknowledge some of the negatives. Senad Lulic avoided a racism charge for suggesting that Antonio Rudger had been “selling socks and belts” before he came to Roma, but many perceived a malicious undertone to his words. The Italian Football Federation then drew international condemnation for its initial failure to support Sulley Muntari when he walked off the pitch in protest at abusive chants in May.
Although the player’s suspension was eventually rescinded, the lack of coherence on such matters is dispiriting. If Juve’s hegemony on the pitch has become predictable, then so has the absence of strong leadership from Italian football’s governing bodies off of it.
Just call him Diego Armando Mertens. Or, actually, don’t, because he’s really not keen on those comparisons to Maradona. But do recognise that Dries Mertens has had an astonishing season at Napoli, adapting to his new centre-forward role with such ease that it is tempting to wonder how nobody thought to try him there sooner.
Drafted in to replace the injured Milik, the Belgian took a few games to hit his stride, but by December he was flying. Mertens followed up a hat-trick against Cagliari by sticking four past Torino a week later. His eventual tally of 28 league goals came at a rate of one for every 91.6 minutes played. He finished one strike behind Edin Dzeko in the race to become Capocannoniere, despite starting five fewer games.
Nor were goals the sum of his contribution. We can debate the semantics of whether or not he should still be called a ‘false nine’ (he believes that he has done enough to shed such a label) but in practical terms he was effective both playing off the shoulder of the last defender and dropping deep to direct play.
Napoli’s 2-1 win away to Milan was a case in point, Mertens providing both assists – the first a brilliant no-look pass, and the second a slick through-ball round the back of Davide Calabria to Lorenzo Insigne. Above all, from one week to another, Mertens just looked like a man who was having way too much fun.
He is the first to acknowledge the contribution of his team-mates to his success. Insigne, José Callejón and Marek Hamsik all had excellent seasons, as did a rotating cast of midfielders. It was Mertens, though, who shone the brightest. Who would have imagined, last summer, that this was the man to make Napoli forget about Higuaín?
5) There were not as many true overhead strikes in Serie A as we have seen in some recent campaigns (probably because Mauricio Pinilla was playing less often), but Andrea Conti pulled one out for Atalanta against Genoa …
4) It’s not just the smoothness of Mauro Zárate’s first-time finish, but the quality of the ball from Federico Bernardeschi that made this goal against Napoli so special (that said, Lorenzo Insigne’s finish in the same game wasn’t half bad, either) …
3) Did he mean it? Maradona reckoned that Mertens was only trying to cross the ball, rather than chip Joe Hart during his one-man demolition of Torino. Personally, I don’t really care …
2) Simone Verdi pays tribute to Marco van Basten …
1) Patrik Schick pays homage to Dennis Bergkamp …
Manuel Locatelli’s first Milan goal only narrowly missed the shortlist above. His second, a match-winner against Juventus two games later wasn’t far behind. These were the teenager’s first two shots on target ever in Serie A.
Joe Hart was named as ‘John’ on the team-sheet for his first game at Torino, and wound up conceding a goal from a misjudged punch. Regrettably, despite winning the adoration of his club’s fans, there were one or two more mishaps to come (hough, for the record, he did have his brighter moments in a Torino shirt, too).
Taken in isolation, Pepe Reina’s save from Diego Perotti this March was sensational. The keeper somehow reversed his momentum in a fraction of a second when the ball deflected off Kalidou Koulibaly right in front of him, tipping it on to the post before hooking the rebound away from another attacker with his leg. Context only makes the stop even more special. This was the 93rd minute, with Napoli defending a 2-1 lead at the Stadio Olimpico, where they had not earned a point in five years. This time, they held on to take all three.


In a season of seven, eight and even 10-goal thrillers, there is no shortage to choose from. But I’m going with Fiorentina’s 3-3 draw with Napoli just before Christmas. Twice the Partenopei had their noses in front, but in the end they were happy to scrape a point after Federico Bernardeschi turned things around with a sensational solo performance – evoking memories of great Fiorentina No10s such as Roberto Baggio and Giancarlo Antognoni.
After scoring twice, he set up a third for Zárate – a goal which, as you’ve already seen, made it into my shortlist for the best of the season. So did Insigne’s opener for Napoli. This was one of those days when the quality did match the quantity after all.
Gianluigi Donnarumma; Dani Alves, Leonardo Bonucci, Mattia Caldara, Alex Sandro; Felipe Anderson, Radja Nainggolan, Marek Hamsik, Lorenzo Insigne; Dries Mertens, Edin Dzeko.
Subs: Gigi Buffon, Andrea Conti, Federico Fazio, Kevin Strootman, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, José Callejón, Mohamed Salah, Federico Bernardeschi, Andrea Belotti, Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuaín, Diego Falcinelli. NB: Yes, 12 subs are permitted in Serie A. No, I haven’t picked a very balanced bench. But, boy, when we need a goal in the 90th minute …
This was the toughest decision of the lot, for me, because I can see four or five outstanding candidates. Davide Nicola did an astonishing job to keep Crotone afloat, maintaining his belief that survival was achievable even when all evidence suggested otherwise. He transmitted that same conviction to his players, but also knew how to keep the mood light in the face of adversity. Eight points adrift in late March, he took them to train on the beach.
At the top of the table, Massimiliano Allegri again demonstrated that he is one of the best managers in the world. It was not a given that Juventus would proceed seamlessly after losing Paul Pogba. And yet, they led from start to finish.
Indeed, Allegri imposed a major tactical reshuffle despite his team still sitting top of the table after a defeat to Fiorentina in January – finding a formation that allowed him to get Gonzalo Higuaín, Paulo Dybala, Miralem Pjanic, Mario Mandzukic, and Juan Cuadrado into the starting XI all at the same time. In doing so, he galvanised his players and pushed them to reach another level – both at home and abroad.
Maurizio Sarri also deserves credit for the way he remodelled his team’s approach to suit Dries Mertens, as does Simone Inzaghi for his work at Lazio. In the end, though, I think this award has to go to Gian Piero Gasperini.
It’s not just that he led Atalanta to fourth, their best-ever top-flight finish, but the manner in which he did it. He had inherited a bloated squad and lost four of his first five league games in charge, but thereafter put his faith in youth. Gasperini picked four Italy Under-21 internationals against Napoli in October and emerged with a 1-0 victory. He never looked back.
For such a young side, Atalanta showed remarkable resilience. Roberto Gagliardini, one of the most eye-catching performers during their pre-Christmas surge, was sold to Inter in January, and yet his former team-mates kept on winning all the same.
Together with breakout stars like Gagliardini, Mattia Caldara, Franck Kessié and Andrea Conti, Gasperini was also getting the best out of his veterans. Papu Gómez was reinvented as, in the player’s words, “a false second striker”, and went on to produce the best season of his career.
It is enough to think that Atalanta had already smashed their top-flight points record when they still had nine games left to go. As one front page headline on L’Eco di Bergamo put it, the whole story was “Bonkers, incredible, but marvellously true.”
The farewell tribute to Silvio Berlusconi from San Siro’s Curva Sud turned out to be a few weeks premature, but was astonishing in its scale. It’s fair to say that the man himself was satisfied.
Leonardo Bonucci’s oldest son, Lorenzo, was the one person looking glum at Juventus’s title celebrations. Understandable, really, since he supports Torino.
Bonucci Sr, who made up for that ordeal by taking Lorenzo to meet favourite player, Andrea Belotti, a week later.
Honourable mention: Papu Gómez, teaching his four-year-old son Bautista tough life lessons with a savage two-footed challenge on the beach.
Whoever it was that signed off on Udinese wearing their black-and-white striped shirts away to Atalanta – who wear blue-and-black. The visitors wound up having to smother their tops in tape to mitigate the clash.
Dries Mertens, out for a walk.
OK, so technically Roberto Mancini was never actually involved in this Serie A season, having left Inter before it began, but his response to speculation about Mauro Icardi’s future last July still bears recalling. “I don’t read newspapers or websites,” he insisted. “And I don’t watch pay-TV, if not for the odd porno.”
Finding out what weird and wonderful design Papu Gómez would be wearing on his left bicep this season was a weekly treat. He celebrated everything from Halloween to the movie Frozen, but most iconic was his tribute to the original Pro Evolution Soccer Master League XI.

Papu again, obviously.
Ciro Immobile, and his PlayStation.
Patrice Evra has moved on to Marseille, but not before he brought us this moment of surreal Instagram joy.
Luciano Spalletti, strolling into his press conference after Roma’s 4-1 win over Palermo only to be immediately confronted with a question about the negative atmosphere around the club (see also: We Will Rock You edit).
Gianluigi Donnarumma celebrated his 18th birthday in style with an edible San Siro.
Perhaps the greatest mystery of this season is how Mauro Icardi – Inter’s captain, no less – managed to publish an autobiography in which he bragged about being able to bring over “100 criminals from Argentina” to kill hostile Ultras without someone at the club pointing out that this probably wasn’t a very clever idea.
I don’t know how much more there is to say on Francesco Totti, but it would be wrong to sign off without a final thought for one of the most iconic and brilliant footballers of my lifetime. Certain fixed images of him will live long in the memory – of stunts and selfies, of that cucchiaio against Inter and of course the 2001 Scudetto.
Most of all, though, what I will remember Totti is the simple pleasure of the little touches, the elegance in possession and the complicated passes made simple. He is one of those footballers who was so much more than can be told by any curated highlights package. To watch him in the flesh was to see this sport played in a whole different way.
He truly loved it, too. Indeed, his reluctance to announce a permanent retirement suggests he still does. If there is an iconic image of Totti to be taken from this season, it was not that of him crying at his farewell address but rather of him warming up all alone during an 80-minute rain delay during Roma’s win over Sampdoria in September.
His team-mates were all inside sheltering. Totti just wanted to play. And so he did, coming off the bench to set up an equalising goal and then convert the match-winning spot-kick.
“Totti builds the ark, drives away the clouds, creates a rainbow and scores the penalty,” gushed Maurizio Crosetti in La Repubblica at the time. “Superstar and demiurge, and now a meteorologist, theologian and philosopher as well. Yes, the hurricane will end. Yes, there is life beyond life. Yes, immortality exists.”
Perhaps, but that is not the same as saying you can play on forever. Totti’s time had come, as indeed had that of Silvio Berlusconi at Milan. He, too, in a very different way, has been an icon of Italian football. Love him or loathe him, it was he who presided over the most successful era in the club’s history, a three-decade long stretch in which they won five Champions League titles and, for a time, called themselves “the most titled club in the world”.
No other team in Italy has ever enjoyed such success on an international stage. Whether Milan will ever do so again remains to be seen. This summer offers intrigue as both they and neighbours Inter press ahead under Chinese owners with apparently ambitious spending plans. They hope that this time next year, we will not be talking about the same old story atop Serie A yet again.
“I was in demand,” remembered Phil Babb. “I was on holiday and every other day I was reading the papers and I was going here, there and everywhere.”
Back in 1994, the player who was once rejected by his local club Millwall appeared to have the world at his feet. Fresh from his exploits for Republic of Ireland at the World Cup in the United States, Babb joined Liverpool on 1 September for £3.6m – a then British record fee for a defender. The very next day he was joined at Anfield by Wimbledon’s John Scales for £3.5m as Roy Evans set about attempting to transform the fortunes of a team who had conceded 55 goals in finishing eighth the previous season.
More than two decades have passed since then but, once more, Liverpool find themselves on the lookout for premium defensive reinforcements following a campaign that saw them concede more goals than any of the other top-four sides. But whereas more than a few eyebrows were raised in 1994 when Evans shelled out more than £7m for two centre-halves, the changing landscape of the modern transfer market means his successor was contemplating making Virgil van Dijk the most expensive defender in history until they were forced into a dramatic climbdown on Wednesday after being accused by Southampton of tapping him up.
Klopp must now find an alternative – and quickly – in an environment that saw Manchester City shell out £47.5m on John Stones last August and looks as if it will become more frenzied as the summer goes on.
“I don’t think they will ever be the same level as the strikers but the amount clubs are prepared to pay for outstanding defenders has certainly increased,” says Scales, who stayed at Anfield for only two seasons before moving to Tottenham. “The number of clubs at the top of the Premier League that had defensive problems last season shows there is a lack of depth in that area and that helps to drive up the price for those few that there are.
“There’s clearly a lack of top-class defenders who are available and clubs are prepared to pay ever more to get them, so that inflates the price. When you have Sunderland earning £100m for finishing bottom of the table then it shows just how much money teams have got to spend now. Add to that all the other teams from Europe’s top leagues and it quickly drives the prices up.”
David Luiz remains the costliest defender of all time after his £50m move from Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain in 2014. That ranks only 14th in the overall list but after several higher bids were received by Napoli last summer for the Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly, it seems a matter of time before that is broken.
“It’s a cliche but a player is worth what a club is prepared to pay for him,” says Scales, who works for the English Schools FA and as a pundit for Sky Sports’ coverage of the Eredivisie. “It’s very difficult to weigh up all the factors that must be considered but one of the most important things for a defender is maturity. There are exceptions to the rule but generally you want a defender who has three or four years more experience than a younger player.
“Attacking-wise you can take more of a risk to allow them to develop their talent in a slightly less pressurised way because you’re rotating them more until they have established themselves properly. A club will have more options offensively so some of them can be taken out of the firing line much more easily than expensive defenders that you’re buying to go in there and form a unit. You need that maturity and physical development to be able to do that because if you make a mistake it usually leads to a goal.”
Since the purchase of Eliaquim Mangala for an eye-watering £42m in August 2014, City have been particularly wasteful in their pursuit of a high-class defender to partner Vincent Kompany. Nicolás Otamendi arrived the following summer for £34m, meaning that the purchase of Stones took their outlay past the £120m mark and Pep Guardiola is thought to be weighing up a new approach for the France defender Aymeric Laporte from Athletic Bilbao, who has a €65m release clause. Meanwhile, Manchester United could surpass the £30m they paid for Eric Bailly last summer with the signing of Victor Lindelof from Benfica or to bring back their youth-team product Michael Keane from Burnley.
In terms of value for money, they may be better served taking a punt on one of the young Ajax defenders who performed so admirably in their run to the Europa League final. Matthijs de Ligt does not turn 18 until August but the Holland international has been tipped in his homeland to be the first £100m defender, and the Colombian Davinson Sánchez has been linked with Barcelona in recent weeks. According to Scales, however, things are never that simple.
“You’ve got to be wary of the Dutch League because the pace of the game isn’t as intense as the top leagues and players need time and space to adapt to moving up a level,” he says. “Having said that, if you’ve got the talent like both of them have then you have a great chance.
“The problem is you never know how they are going to do until they are thrown into the next level. Looking at the personality and mentality of the players is sometimes more important than their playing ability. That’s why it is so crucial that clubs do their due diligence properly.”

While I’m prepared to deal with the real world from time to time, as occasion demands, there are days when I’m particularly grateful for the diversion provided by the world of horse racing. For reasons that you can doubtless divine, this is one of those days and perhaps you, like me, will be delighted to see an absorbing Sandown card scheduled for this evening.
Of course, it would have been more absorbing if the nap, Utopian Dream, hadn’t become a non-runner because of a high temperature. Alas for John Gosden’s filly. But there’s still 12-1 about Envoy (7.00), which seems just a bit mad to me in light of his maiden success last month, his first outing since being gelded in the autumn.
This is a big horse who might reasonably be expected to do much better now than in his first couple of juvenile outings and indeed his return to action was a big improvement on what went before. He will also be well suited by some rain-softened ground.
His opening mark looks pretty reasonable to me and I can only think he is such a big price because he’s trained by James Eustace in a race featuring some more fashionable trainers. But the upside on Envoy is about as promising as anything else I can see in the race.
On To Victory (7.35) is proving more popular at 9-4 in the following race. From the Eve Johnson Houghton yard which is contriving to stay below most radars while winning plenty of races, he got off the mark in his first handicap a fortnight ago, beating a Clive Cox favourite. On To Victory is 8lb higher against a couple of unexposed types but the extra quarter-mile looks like good news and, again, he is proven on ground with some cut.
The pick of the prices this afternoon might be 14-1 about Boots And Spurs (3.30) at Ripon. He’s on a pretty serious losing run since last summer but came within inches of ending it at Thirsk two runs ago, on soft, and things didn’t work out so well for him last time. Back on ground with some cut, he can go well again and Franny Norton is quite an encouraging booking.

David Warner, the Australia vice-captain, has questioned whether his board truly want them to beat England at Edgbaston on Saturday given the release of a video during the week that has proved a major setback in the continuing contract dispute.
Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association are at loggerheads over the proposed end to the revenue-sharing model that has been in place for 20 years, and with a 30 June deadline approaching before their contracts expire – after which players would be free agents – time is running out for a new memorandum of understanding (MoU) to be agreed.
The two parties had recently resumed talks about a possible end to the impasse, only for the board’s lead negotiator, the executive general manager, Kevin Roberts, to release a video on Wednesday in which he described the current system – one the players want to keep – as “unbalanced and unsustainable” when it comes to the funding of grassroots cricket.
It prompted the ACA to hit out at “half-truths” from Cricket Australia and, with Steve Smith’s senior men’s side in all likelihood needing to beat England to progress to the Champions Trophy semi-finals – Eoin Morgan’s side are already through after winning the Group A – the timing of this video, believes Warner, is poorly judged.
“At the end of the day we’re here to win and if Cricket Australia want to try and help us win I think they wouldn’t be releasing videos like that,” said Warner, who has previous suggested his team-mates could even strike during the Ashes series at the end of the year. “We have an important game coming up this week and that is our focus and the MoU can wait until after the game and the tournament. But from where we sit as players it’s been the same as we’ve always said: 100% support of the ACA to get to the table with CA.
“For us we’re just sticking here together as one and all the players around the country and as we’ve said we just want a fair share but leave it until after the games.”
Under their proposed new system there are improved terms for female players at state and international level but, while the international men will also be better off under a capped system, it separates them from the domestic players, who will be relatively worse off. At present all professional male players share a fixed 20% of the revenue.
Speaking before her team’s departure for the upcoming World Cup in England, the captain of the Australia women’s team, Meg Lanning, said: “All the players are behind a revenue-share model for all cricketers, and we’ve been able to stay really strong and we’ll continue to do that and hopefully there’s a resolution pretty soon.”
Lanning and Smith requested in writing in February that the board deal solely with their union – a request that has been ignored, with the latest video from Roberts one of two in recent weeks, to go with emails sent directly to the elite players that included an offer of multiyear central contracts.
Ederson made sure he left Benfica for Manchester City with a bang. In the goalkeeper’s penultimate league match for the Portuguese champions, not only did he keep his 17th clean sheet of the season, he also got an assist.
A goal-kick from the 23-year-old led to Benfica’s second goal in a 5-0 defeat of Vitória Guimarães. It was a kick that found the forward Raúl Jiménez on the edge of the Vitória penalty area, the Mexican controlling it with his feet before turning it into the goal with his head. But not only was Ederson’s kick enormous, it was clever. It took advantage of the fact that his forward, dallying so far upfield, could not be found offside from a keeper’s dead ball. It is a little-known rule but understandable; after all, who is going to kick it that far anyway?
Prowess with the ball at his feet is thought to be a central reason why Pep Guardiola has made Ederson, depending on how you interpret historical exchange rates, either the most or the second most expensive goalkeeper in history. It is an incredible accolade either way, given that the record is held by Gianluigi Buffon, perhaps the greatest goalkeeper of all time. It is even more impressive when you consider Ederson has played only a season and a half as a regular at a major club.
The Brazilian played as a youth for his hometown club of São Paulo, before Benfica took him to Portugal at the age of 16. Not uncommonly, the move did not work out and the teenager moved on, first joining the second-division side Ribeirão then Rio Ave. His performances with the Primeira Liga minnows persuaded Benfica they had made a mistake. The club brought Ederson back in a deal that cost them only €500,000 up front but granted Rio 50% of any future transfer fee (20% of which, in a not entirely surprising development, then goes to Ederson’s agent, Jorge Mendes).
Ederson arrived as understudy to his fellow countryman Júlio César, but when César was injured in March 2016 the younger man seized the gloves and never gave them back. His performances in domestic competition have been consistently assured but it was his display against Borussia Dortmund that got Europe’s elite talking.
Eventually humbled 4-0 in the return leg at the Westfalenstadion, Benfica won the first leg 1-0, but they would have lost that too were it not for the Brazilian. The standout moment was a penalty save from Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang. Ederson not only out-thought the striker by staying on his feet as the ball flew down the centre of the goal, but he completed the save with a club of a punch that drove the ball clear of goal.
This was the second penalty that Ederson had saved in the competition but it was far from his only moment in the match. His speed of movement denied Ousmane Dembélé a goal from six yards out and the length of his reach allowed him to turn a Marco Reus 25-yard effort round a post. Best of all was a save from Christian Pulisic. The American’s fierce volley from outside the penalty area took two deflections but still Ederson found a strong hand to turn it wide. Within a month, the Portuguese press reported that Guardiola had made a personal call to Ederson to persuade him to come to City.
“Ederson has all the talent to become a top-class goalkeeper,” says Vitor Alvarenga, editor of the Portuguese magazine Maisfutebol. “The special ability that made Guardiola pay attention is that he is very strong with his feet, but Ederson also has not only the agility of a great keeper but the security too. I believe he will soon be the No1 keeper with Brazil.”
All the noises are that Ederson will soon graduate to the Brazil team. This, combined with his age, his footballing ability and the fact he recently renewed his Benfica contract, has meant his price is high.
Paradoxically, given the travails of City’s last big-money goalkeeping recruit, Claudio Bravo, it is Ederson’s confidence on the ball that could be his weak spot, says Alvarenga. “The risk is that he has to show he can cope with the pressure of a top league. In the Primeira Liga, he is facing minor teams 80% of the time. Ederson has a great game with his feet but in some matches he has shown overconfidence. He will have to learn how to be able to control that.”
When Ian McGeechan coached the Lions in New Zealand in 1993 his policy with the media was simple: say nothing in a polite way. He knew, even at a time when the Lions were a rugby entity rather than the commercial juggernaut they have become, that a difficult tour would become onerous if the tourists generated negative headlines through a word or two out of place.
Have a quiet word with him afterwards, as you were able to in those days, and you were given something more sustaining than gruel, but on top table, in front of New Zealand journalists, he would be like Geoffrey Boycott, dropping his bat to loaded questions and returning them gently to his inquisitors.
McGeechan was circumspect in Australia and South Africa, not wanting to incite a media agenda, but especially so in New Zealand where questions tended to be more technical and rugby-oriented. As a Kiwi, Warren Gatland knew what to expect on this tour, but even he was surprised at the persistent questions this week, before the defeat to the Blues, about the physical, confrontational gameplan he has employed with Wales this decade, caught on recording devices making a whispered aside at the end of one media conference.
The subject became live after Saturday’s opener against the New Zealand Provincial Barbarians, where an expected comfortable victory turned into one where the Lions were grateful to kick the ball into touch at the end, and a disdainful comment made by the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, about Gatland’s favoured style of play in his long coaching career.
Never mind that the Lions hardly rolled Warrenball in Whangarei where they played in the first half as they should in the second and vice versa, taking liberties before the game was won. They sought space rather than contact but a number of factors, not least untried combinations, skilful opponents, unforced errors and a rusty scrum-half undermined them. It was only when they went back to basics that they pulled ahead.
Hansen’s remarks were more complimentary than insulting and clearly self-serving. The underlying message seemed to be that he would rather the Lions try to take on the All Blacks at their own game, which is regarded as throwing the ball around and taking risks, than have them play for territory and drive through the forwards, exposing his players to a game they are not familiar with.
Not that New Zealand leave too much to chance. The Lions attack coach, Rob Howley, who had been kept away from the media since the announcement of the squad until Tuesday, talked about how in training they are trying to produce rugby chaos, uninhibited and unstructured play, but that is not the All Blacks, who combine deliberation with skill, pace and precision.
New Zealand sides tend to score their tries from set pieces, taking advantage of the 20-metre gap between backs at the lineout and 10 at the scrum to create space out wide by passing with alacrity, off-loading, kicking and turnovers. And a few interceptions. They do not see much reward in multi-phase moves, and the Lions’ travails in Auckland, when they failed to turn possession into tries, showed why.
A productive tactic of Gatland’s Wales earlier this decade was to get ball from the top of the lineout quickly into the hands of Jamie Roberts for the centre to smash his way over the gainline, take out any number of defenders and set up quick ruck ball.
Successful teams now, like New Zealand and Saracens, see the lineout as a licence to score tries by exploiting space rather than sending a juggernaut on a rumble. The Wales way, as it was with the scrum, witness the 2013 Six Nations decider against England, was to use it first as a means of gaining a penalty.
The ploy was devised at a time when the pace of the game was slower and attacking teams were given less latitude at the breakdown by referees. For all their battering of England in 2013, Wales only scored two tries, both in the final quarter, but more are needed now. When the Lions captain, Sam Warburton, said this week that his side would need to score at least 20 points to beat the All Blacks, he was out of date: that amount would have been enough to defeat them only seven times in 94 Tests this decade; 30 points would only have been enough 45% of the time.
For all the talk this week about Warrenball and boshing, the Test series will be defined at least as much by how the Lions cope in defence against an attacking style seen infrequently in Europe, and almost never in the Six Nations. Organised chaos is one way of putting it with the chaotic usually referring to the defence, again as the Lions found five minutes from the end in Auckland when they conceded a try out of the Super Rugby playbook.
The Barbarians gave the Lions a taste in Whangarei, so quick to detect opportunity, but they lacked the pedigree of the teams that were to follow, starting with the Blues, the runt of the Super Rugby litter, the New Zealand equivalent of the Premiership’s Gloucester or the Pro12’s own Blues, Cardiff.
It was a clash of styles: the set-piece superiority of the Lions against the ball-handling skills and opportunism of the Blues. The Lions were more coordinated than they had been on Saturday and they tried to play with continuity, but they were exposed to a game that is foreign to the Six Nations and not prevalent in any of the major leagues in Europe: the skill of the Blues, who had three tries ruled out on review, trumped power.
Why did Joe Schmidt, a New Zealander, all but outlaw the offload after taking charge of Ireland? Why did Gatland, another Kiwi, adopt a rigid gameplan with Wales having lamented, like Graham Henry before him, that innate talent was not complemented by basic skills such as passing? Because they recognised that players in Europe were generally less skilful and intuitive than in New Zealand and so they played to the strength of their charges. Eddie Jones has spent most of his time in charge of England talking about the need for players to take more decisions, appreciating that unless they are able to produce plays such as the one that won the match for the Blues, they will struggle to wrest the World Cup off the All Blacks.
Attacks on Warrenball are misdirected: it is the game as a whole in Europe, starting with the complacent Six Nations which bills itself as the greatest tournament in the world, which it will only have a chance of becoming if countries start finding tickets hard to sell, that is being questioned.
A common excuse for conservatism in the Six Nations in the opening rounds is the weather. It rained in Auckland, but the adventure of the home side was not dampened. It is what New Zealand know now, but in 1971 it was the Lions who attacked with aplomb and the All Blacks who were direct and predictable.
At least the Lions will be well prepared for the All Blacks, but they are taking aim at a moving target. They repaired faults after the opening game, clearing out harder at the breakdown to secure quicker ball and reading kicks quicker, but new ones were exposed.
It is the New Zealand way, constantly exposing faultlines, but the opening Test is not a lost cause. The Lions have a foundation in the set pieces and goal-kicking, but it is wider out, in attack and defence, where there needs to be a difference. With a tilt to McGeechan, they need to say nothing, no matter how many words it takes: torque, not talk.

Having held 22 managerial jobs at 17 Portuguese clubs throughout his long and continuing career, Vítor Oliveira has shown he has an extraordinary and irrepressible nomadic streak. But the 63-year-old is known throughout Portugal for far more than just his wanderlust. Over the course of his 32-year managerial career, Oliveira has achieved promotion 10 times, including an unprecedented five in a row in his last five seasons.
After calling time on a nondescript playing career in June 1985, the 31-year-old midfielder was quickly installed as manager of his most recent club, Portimonense, who just so happen to be the club he manages today. He showed little of the skill that would help him make his name in his first job and soon found himself seeking alternative employment. After a brief spell with FC Maia, Oliveira took over at Paços de Ferreira, where he achieved the first of many promotions at the end of his third full season. Oliveira led his team out of the Portuguese second tier and kept them up the following season, improving his reputation and earning a three-year spell as manager of established top tier side Gil Vicente, before moving on to Vitória de Guimarães.
Oliveira’s spell in Guimarães proved far from favourable and within less than a year he had set sail again, this time to lead an ambitious project at Académica de Coimbra. The move proved inspired and he secured the second promotion of his career in the 1996-97 season, guiding Académica to the top tier. Oliveira stayed with Académica for just one more season following their promotion before opting for another change of scenery, taking the União de Leiria job. He stayed for a single campaign, just long enough to guide the team to the league title and, of course, promotion to the Primeira Liga.
His success in Leiria gave him the chance to manage Braga, an opportunity that showed his stock was rising. But, after just three wins in his first 14 league matches, Oliveira set his sights south once more – geographically and competitively – as he returned to the division he had come to know so intimately, taking a job with Belenenses. He arrived a few weeks before Christmas but, by the end of the season, he had secured a runners-up place in the league and an immediate return to the top tier – the club’s first promotion in almost a decade and Oliveira’s fourth in nine seasons.
Then came something of a barren spell, the worst of Oliveira’s career to date. He stuck with his club-hopping credo, ducking in and out of short-lived spells with clubs old and new – Rio Ave, Gil Vicente, Académica, Moreirense – but could not replicate his recent success. Things picked up in the 2006-07 season, when he helped Leixões achieve promotion, but but then came another six years of relative hardship, with spells União de Leiria, Trofense and Aves bringing scant success.
Fortunately for Oliveira, this period of stagnation was the precursor to a complete shift in fortunes as his move to Arouca in 2011 brought about an astoundingly successful period, even by his own lofty standards. Oliveira steered Arouca to second place in the 2012-13 season, securing his sixth promotion, then stepped down in pursuit of a second spell at Moreirense, where he claimed his fourth second-tier title, along with his seventh promotion.
União da Madeira were the next lucky recipients of his close-your-eyes-and-point-at-the-map technique of career choices. They secured his services in the summer of 2014 and, sure enough, they finished runners-up the following May and earned the seemingly inevitable promotion to the top tier, where they joined nine of their coach’s former clubs.
Not that he stuck around to enjoy the company. By the time the club kicked off in the top division, Oliveira was off in search of yet another promotion party, this time with Chaves. Another second-place finish in 2015-16 brought Oliveira his fourth promotion in as many seasons.
This time last year, Oliveira brought his managerial career full circle by joining Portimonense, the club where his grand journey had begun 32 years ago. And how exactly did his old club fare under Oliveira? They won promotion, of course, as champions no less.
As another long summer ticks by, the allure of a sixth promotion in six years must entice the coach. But Oliveira says he wants to stay at Portimonense. “I’m going to continue in Portimão,” he said at the end of the season. Whether or not he will be able to stifle his impulse to drop a division in pursuit of another promotion remains to be seen. Perhaps he will stick around and try to win the Primeira Liga, one league he has yet to conquer.

Manchester City have confirmed the signing of the goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica. The 23-year-old Brazilian has cost €40m (£34.7m) and becomes Pep Guardiola’s second signing of the summer after the midfielder Bernado Silva.
Ederson’s fee is a British record for a goalkeeper but is eclipsed by the €53m Juventus paid Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001. He will formally join City on 1 July, when the transfer window opens.
“I like everything about Manchester City,” Ederson told the club’s website. “This is a great club, the league they have here in England and they have amazing fans and they play splendid football. I have always had the dream to play in English football and now I’m going to make it true.
“With Pep Guardiola, City are growing more and more. He is putting in place a young team for the future. Those were important factors in making my decision. Manchester City has an amazing squad. I think they managed to have a good season. Next season, we will have to be focused to achieve the goal of winning trophies.”
The signing of Ederson takes City’s contingent of Brazilians to four, joining Fernando, Fernandinho and Gabriel Jesus. The goalkeeper has played for Brazil at age-group level but not for the senior team. He was named in the provisional squad for the Copa América last year but injury forced him out of the final reckoning.
Ederson, born in São Paulo state in Brazil, went to Benfica as a teenager but left to play for two smaller Portuguese clubs – Ribeirão and Rio Ave – before rejoining in 2015.
Guardiola signed the goalkeeper Claudio Bravo from Barcelona last August but the Chile international failed to impress and Willy Caballero was preferred at times. Caballero is among the players who have left City this summer.
Ederson said of English football: “I have always watched it on TV. My impression is that it is a very intense game, box-to-box. The grounds are always full and the stadiums are nice. This is a very captivating football. The competition here would motivate any player. I’m ready, I’m always ready.
“I’m going to try to adapt to this league as quick as possible. Everyone knows here the competition is ferocious. It’s a bit different than the Portuguese league.
“At Benfica I played a little bit more advanced and I was involved a lot in the game. I think that revolution in the way goalkeepers get involved in the game was very important.
“I already had that skill to play outside the box. When I played for a team [Rio Ave] lower down I didn’t have the chance to play far from the goal, I had to stay close to it. But when I went to Benfica, I was able to improve what I knew and play further out getting more involved in the games, being more active. I have been developing that since.”
1) Cheick Tioté tragically died on Monday after reportedly suffering a heart attack while training with his club in China. If you haven’t already rewatched his famous volleyed equaliser in Newcastle’s 4-4 draw with Arsenal, here you go. He wasn’t a great goalscorer, his one international goal in 52 appearances for Ivory Coast coming against Nigeria in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. His best game for Newcastle undoubtedly came against Manchester United in 2012 – Wayne Rooney, Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick didn’t get a kick as Tioté put in a majestic midfield performance. RIP.
2) Alex Honnold this week became the first person to ever free-solo climb El Capitan, the legendary California cliff in the Yosemite Valley. The 31-year-old ascended 2,900 metres in less than four hours with no harness, no rope – his effort has since been dubbed the ‘moon landing’ of free-soloing.
Also, despite being the most famous free-climber in the world, he lives out of his van and seems to be a pretty nice bloke.
3) LeBron James is sick and tired of losing to the Golden State Warriors, and LeBron James is sick and tired of answering your stupid questions. This isn’t the first time he has responded spikily to reporters: two weeks ago he called out WHBC’s Kenny Roda: “There’s this weird thing with you, Kenny. You always come around when we lose, I swear. And in 2011, he blurted out “ask me a better question tomorrow” when he was with the Miami Heat. Maybe LeBron should take a leaf out of Russell Westbrook’s book: “I just don’t like you.”
4) It’s Scotland v England this Saturday – due to be the 114th meeting, Scotland have won 41, England 48 – which is a good excuse to roll out a few auld clips: Scotland’s Wembley Wizards tonked England 5-1 at Ibrox back in 1928 and became ‘unofficial world champions’ when they ended England’s 19-match winning run back in 1967 at Wembley, and repeated the trick 10 years later: invading the pitch and snapping the crossbar in two. Of course, England have also had their way, not least the biggest win, 9-3 at Wembley in 1961 – some fine commentary in there too – and the most recent meeting between the two sides: a 3-1 win for England at Celtic Park in 2014, which included two Wayne Rooney goals and one Wayne Rooney somersault.
5) The French Open comes to a close this weekend: defending champion Novak Djokovic is already heading home, losing heavily to Dominic Thiem. It had been a rough tournament for Novak – he also confronted the umpire during his match with Diego Schwartzman. If you’re looking for another meltdown, look no further than Nick Kyrgios, taking his racket to task, much to the surprise of the crowd behind him. There have also been some sublime shots – Gaël Monfils’s slam-dunk smash was a particular highlight, but it’s still some way off Roland Garros’ official top five French Open shots of all time.
6) And finally, Sunday league-style drama in Bulgaria, as Vereya’s Ivan Bandalovski finishes off a beer can thrown onto the pitch – and then scores a last-minute equaliser:
1) Stoke City’s Ramadan Sobhi becomes the latest victim of Egyptian prankster Ramez Galal, who likes his stunts with more than a hint of genuine peril. Needless to say, Sobhi is not best pleased.
2) Back in 1990, Singapore’s Paul Lim hit the first (and only) nine-darter at the BDO World Championship. 27 years later, 63-year-old Lim shows Gary Anderson that he’s still got it:
3) Team New Zealand’s bid to beat Ben Ainslie in the America’s Cup came to a dramatic halt, as their boat capsized just behind the starting line:
4) Diving is nothing new – here’s Rangers winning a dodgy pen back in 1945. Justice was served eventually.
5) To close, this Boston Celtics fan is livin’ on a prayer.

Wayne Rooney is on his way back to Everton. It’s the most romantic of stories, setting aside the bit about him swanning off for the more showy club down the road at the first opportunity, spending his golden years with them, and only coming back when said club don’t want him any more now he’s going bald and slowing up. Everton also might not be able to stump up the cash for the wages Rooney is demanding to return. It’s not exactly Mills & Boon, is it, never mind Jane Austen.
Manchester United will replace their outgoing record goalscorer with fresh meat in the shape of Torino striker Andrea Belotti and Real Madrid’s Álvaro Morata. They’ll table £87m for the former, £60m for the latter, though Real want another £20m on top of that. Some good news for United, though: superstar junkies Real aren’t that interested in spending huge sums on David de Gea any more, presumably working on the logic that everyone remembers Puskas, Gento and Di Stéfano, but who can name Rogelio Domínguez these days?
Chelsea, snubbed by Virgil van Dijk in favour of Liverpool, have just about stopped laughing very hard about Liverpool snubbing Van Dijk, and slapped a cash plus Nemanja Matic offer on the Juventus boardroom table. They want Leonardo Bonucci in return.
They’re also dangling a £150,000-a-week carrot in front of Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, with the big man reported as being very interested. No huge dissimilarities between this and the Van Dijk affair, really, when you boil the bones down, other than the small fact Chelsea haven’t started needlessly banging on about it yet.
Oh Liverpool!
Speaking of clubs going about their business in a cack-handed manner, Arsenal have made a bid for James Rodríguez. Real Madrid want £68.9m, so the Gunners have reportedly and pointedly offered an unspecified sum below that. Given their recent track record of being awkward just for the sake of it, £68,899,999 is the ballpark figure we’re guessing. Does bidding low ever bear fruit?
Tottenham Hotspur want £15m Borussia Dortmund defender Matthias Ginter. Speaking of BVB, those famous developers of hungry young talent ... this thing about buying Mario Balotelli ... erm ... y’what?
Finally, some assorted other news. West Bromwich Albion are interested in Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone and Le Havre full-back Ferland Mendy. Crystal Palace, Brighton & Hove Albion and Birmingham City are also looking at the latter. Fabian Delph wants out of Manchester City. Barcelona are preparing a £40m swoop for Arsenal defender Héctor Bellerín. And it’s only a matter of time before Southampton sack their manager Claude Puel, who five months ago led the club to their first major final in 38 years. Yep, romance is dead all right.
Code-hopping Karmichael Hunt will make his long-awaited Wallabies debut alongside Waratahs backrower Ned Hanigan, with the pair named to start in Saturday’s Test against Fiji in Melbourne.
Hunt was named at inside centre for the first Test of the year, while 22-year-old Hanigan will start as a blindside flanker. The Australian team will be led by Michael Hooper after veteran Tatafu Polota-Nau beat regular skipper Stephen Moore to the starting hooker role. Moore may still appear on the bench, which will only be named following Friday’s final training run. 
Hunt will become a dual international after playing playing 11 rugby league Tests, only switching to rugby in 2015 after four years playing AFL. His Queensland teammate Scott Higginbotham will return to Test rugby after a two-year absence, named at No8 while Brumbies duo Sam Carter and Allan Alaalatoa have been rewarded for their fine Super Rugby form in a new-look tight five.
Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said he picked the team on form rather than past performances. “I have been very pleased with some of the individual performances this season and this has really been the basis of many of these selections,” Cheika said.
“It’s been great to see the energy that Ned and Karmichael have brought this week. We know Test footy is a different beast and I know they have what it takes to step up. Tatafu (Polota-Nau)has been challenging Stephen (Moore) for the number two jersey for many years and his form has warranted his selection.”
“Stephen is our captain and he’ll be up to the challenge of what both Tatafu and Tolu (Llatu) will bring this series.”
Wallabies squad: Israel Folau, Dane Haylett-Petty, Tevita Kuridrani, Karmichael Hunt, Henry Speight, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, Scott Higginbotham, Michael Hooper, Ned Hanigan, Adam Coleman, Sam Carter, Alan Alaalatoa, Tatafu Polota-Nau, Tom Robertson Res: To be named Friday

With their season on the line, the Cleveland Cavaliers turned in a superlative performance before a rollicking home crowd.
It simply wasn’t enough against one of the best teams in NBA history.
The Golden State Warriors scored the game’s final 11 points over the last three minutes to erase a six-point deficit and stun the defending champions with a 118-113 victory in Game 3 of the NBA finals on Wednesday night, taking a commanding three-games-to-none lead in the best-of-seven championship series.
“We got stops when we needed them,” said Kevin Durant, who finished with a team-high 31 points, including the go-ahead three-pointer with 45 seconds left that silenced the Quicken Loans Arena crowd.
Added Durant, who scored 14 points in the fourth quarter: “We’ve got one more win, we’ve got to keep going. We can’t win this thing unless we do it together.”

Klay Thompson had 30 points for the Warriors, Stephen Curry added 26 points, 13 rebounds and six assists.
The Warriors, who have now won 30 of their last 31 games stretching back to the regular season, improved to 15-0 in the playoffs and are one win away from the first ever undefeated postseason, say nothing of a second championship in three years.
The 15 consecutive playoff wins surpasses the Pittsburgh Penguins (1992-93) for the most postseason wins in a row among the other North American professional sports, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
LeBron James had 39 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for the Cavaliers, finishing one assist short of a record-breaking ninth career playoff triple double, while Kyrie Irving added 38 points.
But they couldn’t hold off the relentless Warriors during the final minutes, with Durant depositing the long-range coup de grâce over James’ outstretched arm. The sport’s best player, as it turned out, was no match for its best team.
“I said it after we won the Eastern Conference finals that we’re getting ready for a juggernaut,” James said afterward. “It’s probably the most, most firepower I’ve played (against) in my career. I played against some great teams, but I don’t think no team has had this type of firepower.
“So even when you’re playing well, you got to play like A-plus-plus, because they’re going to make runs and they’re going to make shots and they got guys that’s going to make plays. So we made enough plays tonight to still win the ball game, but they made a couple more.”
After Irving’s missed three-pointer on Cleveland’s last full possession, four Golden State free throws closed the show. And just like that, the Cavaliers’ title defense is all but finished: no team in league history has ever rallied from a three-games-to-none deficit to win a playoff series in 126 previous tries.
“They’re a juggernaut of a team, do a great job of spacing out the floor, keeping a high tempo, and just made some big-time plays down the stretch,” Irving said. “You got to give credit when credit is due.”
Added Warriors coach Steve Kerr: “Overall, it was just an incredibly tough, resilient performance. It wasn’t our smartest game that we have played all year, but it was maybe our toughest in terms of our ability to just hang in there.”
The Warriors no doubt expected Cleveland’s best shot in the early stages given the stakes and they got it. James pumped in 15 points on 7-for-8 shooting in the first quarter, including a thunderous dunk in transition over Durant and JaVale McGee.
He was aided by JR Smith, who had not made a shot in only five attempts over the previous 95 minutes of game action, but added a pair of three-pointers in the opening frame.
But when James went to the bench for a breather, the Warriors rattled off 10 straight points to extend a 39-32 lead at the end of the quarter. Cleveland was shooting 61.1% from the floor and LeBron was off to a sizzling start, yet the Warriors were still leading by seven.
Both teams cooled after their torrid start, though James at times singlehandedly kept the Cavaliers within touching distance of the Warriors’ manifold attack. By the time LeBron scored on a spectacular left-handed reverse layup to win a one-on-one matchup with Durant and close Golden State’s lead to 46-45 with seven minutes left in the half, the Cleveland superstar had posted 23 points – more than half Cleveland’s total – on 10-for-11 shooting.
The Cavaliers had faded badly after half-time in the opening two games, but instead on Wednesday surged ahead behind more sensational play from James. That carried over into the fourth quarter, where they led 113-107 with three minutes left.
Now the Warriors will look to finish the series, and their bid for a perfect postseason, in Friday night’s Game 4, a markedly shorter turnaround after no less than three-day breaks before the opening three games.
“I think we’ll all be fine,” Thompson said. “This is the most minutes I think we played all year between me, Steph, and Kevin. And Coach Kerr’s done a great job managing our minutes. And we know what’s at stake, and that’s an NBA title.
“So we won’t be tired because we got adrenaline on our side and we got to act like this is a do-or-die situation. We don’t want to go back to the Bay and win it; we want to finish it here and forget this game quickly and lock in tomorrow morning and get ready for a battle on Friday.”
He cracked a small smile, then didn’t miss. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has never been one to waste an opportunity. This time it was to rubbish his Lions counter-part, Warren Gatland’s claim there’s little between New Zealand’s Super Rugby teams and what the All Blacks will bring to the three tests.
There’s a huge gap, Hansen suggested with a knowing shake of his head.
Hansen had just named two uncapped players in a largely predictable squad. Both are from the Hurricanes. Midfielder Ngani Laumape is the joint leading try scorer in Super Rugby with 14 and Jordie Barrett is one of three from the same family, alongside lock Scott and World Rugby’s best player last year, Beauden.
Two of the Blues backs who made life difficult for the Lions the previous night were also named – Sonny Bill Williams back after missing last year with Sevens duties and an achilles injury suffered at the Rio Olympics.
Blues wing Rieko Ioane entered a logjam of quality outside backs and will get another crack at the Lions with New Zealand Maori a week before the Test, along with his brother Akira, who is one of five players on standby for the All Blacks, and halfback Tawera Kerr Barlow. Before that game the Lions play an All Blacks-heavy Crusaders team and the Highlanders, who will have backs Lima Sopoaga and Waisake Naholo, and forward Liam Squire released for the match.
It paints a bleak picture for the Lions, with Gatland having tried to soften the defeat to the Blues by claiming they and the other four New Zealand Super teams are on a par with the All Blacks. “I don’t think there will be a lot of difference between some Super Rugby sides and the All Blacks,” Gatland said.
Hansen tossed him a bone when he said the former All Blacks hooker was trying for a bit of humour after reacting poorly to earlier suggestions his game plan was a predictable bash-fest. “I don’t think there’s any comparison between Super Rugby and Test rugby,” Hansen said with a nod and a chuckle. “He was probably just trying to make a light comment.”
Hansen made it clear he sees the Lions as a serious threat whatever happens in the games that precede the Tests. “I’ve always said this and I still believe it, I think they’re the best Lions side to come here. Gatland’s made it very, very clear that the first Test is all he’s got his eyes on. I don’t think they’re too bothered about what’s happening between now and then.”
“It would be foolish of us to think we can just rock up and expect a soft game. We’ll get the kitchen sink thrown at us and we need to be ready for that.”
Hansen touched on the Lions schedule, declaring the three-day lead-in to the first game was too tough and not something the All Blacks would have agreed too. Given that, he dismissed the performance against the Barbarians and said the loss to the Blues showed the players were still trying to establish combinations.
“They’re in the infancy of this tour,” Hansen said. “They’ll only get better and better. They’ll be a good side when the Tests come around. It’s well documented that that’s all they want to win anyway, they just want to win the Test matches.”
Hansen has named a formidable squad to counter the best of Britain and Ireland, those picked reflecting the depth he has to sift through and the form of many in the Super competition.
There are, though, a few injury concerns. Hooker Dane Coles isn’t expected to feature in the first two tests having been sidelined since mid-March with concussion. Midfielder Ryan Crotty is also in doubt with a rib injury while Ben Smith and Brodie Retallick have concussion issues. But there is a lot to like about this squad. There is x-factor and speed in the backs while the pack is simply the best New Zealand has to offer.
The only quibble would be the exclusion of Steven Luatua, but his departure soon to Bristol meant others were considered ahead of him. Laumape is a bold and inspired move. He has been in terrific form for the Hurricanes and deservedly pushed past incumbent All Blacks George Moala and Malakai Fekitoa.
And yet, Laumape may not feature in the Tests given Williams’ considerable ability, and if Ryan Crotty is able to shrug off a rib injury. Williams was a colossus in the Blues win against the Lions and revealed he is lighter, stronger and faster since his return from injury. “I’m starting to feel nimble, I just need more games,” the two-time World cup winner said.
Williams said he never thought his career was over when he ruptured his achilles in Rio, but confessed to “moping about” for a bit. “Then I made the decision I wanted to be a better player and that’s what I’m striving for.”
Given how well he played for the Blues, the Lions will be wondering just how much better he can be for the All Blacks. Williams will also test Gatland’s theory about just how close the Super teams are to the All Blacks. It could give Hansen another small chuckle.

Diego Costa has claimed he has been told by Antonio Conte that he is not wanted at Chelsea next season, with the Spain striker admitting he will “have to find a way out” of Stamford Bridge.
Costa, who is away on international duty after helping Chelsea to win the Premier League title last season, has been linked with a move to Chinese Super League side Tianjin Quanjian having seen a potential return to Atlético Madrid collapse after the Spanish side’s transfer ban was upheld. But with Chelsea interested in a move for Everton’s Romelu Lukaku, the 28-year-old revealed after Spain’s 2-2 draw with Colombia on Wednesday night that Conte had sent him a message this week to inform him that he does not expect the player who scored 20 Premier League goals last season to be a part of his squad next season.
“My relationship with the coach has been bad this season. I suppose I’ve had a bad season so I can’t go on,” Costa said.
“I’m going to be honest, the other day, Conte sent me a message saying he does not count on me for next season, so I’ll have to find a way out.
“I love living in Madrid, but I have to think about my future. It’s complicated because I cannot go four or five months without playing. I have no preference for a league, I just want to play.”
Costa has already made clear his reluctance to move to China, although it remains unclear whether he has other suitors in Europe. The Belgium striker, Michy Batshuayi, has also insisted he will not tolerate another season as a bit-part player at Chelsea as he targets a place at the World Cup in Russia.
A bizarre early own goal by defender José Giménez set Italy on the way to a convincing 3-0 win over Uruguay in a friendly played in Nice on Wednesday.
Two more goals in the last 10 minutes, a header from Brazilian-born forward Éder and a Daniele De Rossi penalty, condemned the South Americans to their fifth successive defeat while Italy extended their unbeaten run to nine games.
It was the first meeting between the two sides since their controversial match at the 2014 World Cup when Uruguay forward Luis Suárez bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, and was subsequently suspended from football for four months. Suárez missed Wednesday’s game through injury while Chiellini came on as a substitute in the second half.
In the seventh minute of the match, Lorenzo Insigne launched a long ball forward and Andrea Belotti chested it down with his back to goal – only for Atlético Madrid defender Giménez to take it off his foot, inadvertently rifling a shot past his own goalkeeper Fernando Muslera.
Uruguay, also missing Edinson Cavani through injury, rallied in the second half. Martín Cáceres headed the ball into the net on the hour but the goal was harshly disallowed for a foul on Riccardo Montolivo.
Éder diverted Manolo Gabbiadini’s shot into the net with a close-range header in the 83rd minute, before De Rossi scored from a penalty in stoppage time after Stephan El Shaarawy was tripped by the hapless Giménez.
In Murcia, Real Madrid’s Álvaro Morata rescued a draw for Spain against Colombia to extend Julen Lopetegui’s unbeaten start as national coach.
David Silva opened the scoring for the hosts in the 22nd minute, turning home Pedro’s cross, but midfielder Edwin Cardona equalised for Colombia five minutes before half-time. Falcao’s 55th-minute header from a corner gave Colombia the lead, as they extended an unbeaten run against European sides stretching back to 2011.
While other Real Madrid players were rested, Morata – a late substitute in the Champions League final – was brought on for Iago Aspas and earned a draw in the 87th minute, heading in from Saúl Ñíguez’s left-wing cross.
It would be daft to get too excited at England grabbing their semi-final slot days before anyone else. This does not guarantee a romp to the final and then the trophy. But the current climate makes a change to the agonising postmortems that accompanied England’s early flight home from the 2015 World Cup.
The margin of New Zealand’s defeat in Cardiff – 87 runs – was misleading. After 30 overs of their run chase the Kiwis were 156 for two in pursuit of 311; Kane Williamson, after some early scares, was cruising with Ross Taylor in his wake. There was no sign of an imminent capsize.
The New Zealand captain looked serene, rarely inclined to play a shot that involved risk, which was why Morgan had turned to the nearest he has to a “shock” bowler, the galloping Mark Wood. He needed a wicket badly. Then the ball misbehaved, bouncing steeply and flicking Williamson’s glove; Jos Buttler took a testing catch safely.
It may be that Morgan had a bit of luck since treacherous deliveries cannot be summoned up to order like pizzas. But from this moment on England did not require any luck. Morgan and his bowlers did not miss a trick.
The next batsman was Neil Broom and for the first time in the match a short leg was posted. Morgan must have noticed how Williamson had stared at the treacherous spot on the pitch before departing like a man betrayed. Here was the Kiwi captain suggesting that the fates were against him and his side.
That short-leg fielder was unlikely to take a catch but he was delivering a message to Broom. This surface was no longer to be trusted; the ball was popping (there was some truth in this since both Williamson and Taylor had been disconcerted earlier in the innings); more importantly there was no harm in reminding the new batsman of this. England were now hunting for wickets rather than containment.
There was a message here for Morgan’s pace bowlers: bang the ball into the pitch not at bouncer length, which was the policy employed by New Zealand when bowling from that end in the second half of England’s innings, but just short of a length, preferably using the cross-seam method. Then something might happen. Somehow the ball seems to grip the surface when bowling cross seam at Cardiff, a handy discovery by Stuart Broad a year or two ago, which had been dutifully passed on.
From here Morgan was in control on a day when the little things were counting for something – like the decision to give Jake Ball the first over; he had been carted for over 80 in two of his last three outings. But Morgan wanted him to start in place of Chris Woakes, an expression of confidence in someone who was considered a borderline selection before the game. How did Ball respond? With a wicket and two maidens and ultimately the man-of-the-match award in a game when there was no obvious recipient.
The other borderline selection was superb. Rashid obviously has not been sulking since his omission against Bangladesh. The suspicion is that Morgan must have convinced him that this was no slight on his ability or temperament. The conditions were nasty for a wrist-spinner: a gusting wind, a pitch offering little turn, those much-mentioned short, straight boundaries. Yet Rashid has seldom bowled better for England; there was barely a bad ball; the googly was employed frequently, which can be a sound indicator that his confidence is high.
In the field Morgan attacked adroitly throughout (not just with his brief dalliance with a short leg). With the departure of Williamson Morgan kept his seamers going and the asking rate started to climb; a less confident captain might have slipped on his vulnerable spinner immediately to shed the remaining four overs required from a slow bowler. In any case Morgan had faith in Rashid.
So for 20 overs on a blustery Cardiff evening England were brilliant. But it was only 20 overs. They must get better and contemplate whether a change of personnel is required. No prizes for the next name to surface: Jason Roy. The advice is echoing around. Some advocate that he should be more circumspect, that he should try just to bat some overs before elaborating.
That sounds like poor advice to me and I suspect this is the last thing Morgan will be saying to him. Roy is in the side because he is prepared to bat in a maverick manner at the top of the order. That is what England want him to do. He has neither the temperament nor the technique to play like a proper, old-fashioned opener. So if selected, he must be allowed the freedom to continue playing his way.
Whether Roy should continue to be selected is another matter. It would be convenient for England if they could play Roy and Jonny Bairstow on Saturday. However, England are likely to be hellbent on playing their best side even in a “free” game. After all, the opponents are Australia.
Chris Smalling, one of the players whose competitive courage has repeatedly been questioned by José Mourinho over the last season, has said it is wrong to allege he is not willing to put his body on the line and insisted he can supply the hard evidence to show the Manchester United manager was wrong.
Smalling chose his words carefully to make sure he did not say anything that could be construed as direct criticism of Mourinho but the centre-half said it was not true, contrary to what his manager had implicitly stated, that he was reluctant to play unless he felt 100% fit.
Mourinho clearly has a different view judging by the number of occasions when he has publicly challenged Smalling, as well as Phil Jones, to speed up their recovery from injuries, at one point stating that if he had the same problem he would declare himself fit the next day.
Smalling was one of the players to whom Mourinho was referring when he complained that the attitude was “cautious, cautious, cautious” and, again, when he talked about the player missing a game against Swansea City last November and spoke at length about there being “a difference between the brave, who want to play at any cost, and the ones for whom a little pain can make a difference”.
Those comments backfired on Mourinho when it emerged Smalling had a broken toe but played with the injury two weeks earlier at Chelsea, a 4-0 defeat when the defender needed two pain-killing injections to be involved.
Smalling, on England duty preparing for the game against Scotland on Saturday, confirmed there had never been an apology from his manager. “No, it’s just professional,” he said. “All of us are professionals and no player wants not to play. That was all just [him being] professional – get on with the rehab and then get out as quickly as you can.
“I think that was directed at everybody. We had a lot of injuries at that time and he was frustrated that quite a lot of players weren’t available. He knew the picture in terms of liaising with the medical staff and he was just frustrated, the same as us players who wanted to be on the pitch.”
Asked about the specific allegation that he would not play unless 100%, Smalling said: “I think in the Chelsea game I proved that I would play with injections.
“I had done the injury, I played on and it turned out there was a break. I had a couple of injections but it got worse and that’s when I had the layoff. You always want to push yourself because you don’t want to let the fans or players down. Obviously he didn’t know the full extent at that time. You just keep playing until physically you can’t and that was the story with the break. But I don’t think he knew the full picture then and once it was cleared up it was all good.”
Mourinho did, however, come back to the same point on several occasions when Smalling damaged a knee later in the season and it did not help that the injury was inflicted when he and Jones tackled one another in a training session with England. “We don’t hold anything back, either for our clubs or on international duty, so injuries are going to come,” Smalling said. “It was unfortunate that we are obviously from the same club. That’s been the story of this season, unfortunately. I’ve been lucky in previous seasons not to be too injury-prone.”
Smalling went on to describe himself as “a leader” and, referring to Mourinho’s public challenges to accelerate his recovery process, he said he would take it as a compliment.
“It comes back to the manager’s frustrations,” he said. “When I’m sitting down with the manager and the medical staff we set out a timeline and then we try to shave it, and push and push … because the longer it takes the fewer games you have. They are always trying to push us as much as they can. The manager has shown his frustration but we [injured players] are just as frustrated.
“It’s good when he shows that frustration because it shows he wants you back out on that pitch. If he wasn’t interested, he would just leave you alone and he wouldn’t say any of these things. So I take it as a positive, as a challenge to get back as quickly as I can – which I would have done anyway, regardless of whatever was said.”
Marcus Rashford believes Gareth Southgate determined what was best for England as well as for the Manchester United striker when selecting him for the senior squad rather than allowing him to continue his development in the under-21s this summer.
Rashford, who scored 11 goals in 53 club games last season, registered a hat-trick on his only appearance for the under-21s, against Norway last September, and the coach, Aidy Boothroyd, had hoped to take him to the European Championship in Poland, which starts next week. However, Southgate opted to “protect” the striker after a hefty workload last term, with the 19-year-old seeking a ninth senior cap against Scotland on Saturday having earned his place in the squad on merit.
The Football Association has in the past been keen for players to gain tournament experience in their age-group teams before playing exclusively for the senior side, and Rashford is still eligible for the under-20s, who are excelling at the World Cup in South Korea. “He [Southgate] has had to think about what’s best for England and for me as a player,” Rashford said. “I’m happy to be with the seniors and to continue my development. It’s important to be on the same page.
“It’s something you look forward to, being selected for your country. You have the under-20s in South Korea doing well, and the under-21s going into a tournament. Whatever age group you’re called upon [by] it’s important you have a mindset where you’re going to achieve great things. To me it’s not being fast-tracked. There’s been a lot of games; England and United have dealt with it in a positive way. I feel comfortable with the position I’m in.”
Rashford is one of three strikers available to Southgate for the qualifier against Scotland and Tuesday’s friendly in France after Jamie Vardy withdrew because of a thigh injury suffered in training on Tuesday. The forward felt a twinge and has returned to Leicester City for treatment, with his departure described as precautionary. Harry Kane will start at Hampden Park and Jermain Defoe joins Rashford on the bench.
The United manager, José Mourinho, had made clear his preference was for Rashford to be retained by the seniors rather than drop back into the under‑21s. There was, however, no dialogue between Mourinho and Boothroyd, who had long since grown resigned to being without the 19-year-old at the finals. “I want all the best players but my job is also a development role,” said the coach. “In the end it never came down to José. It was about me talking to Gareth and listening to what he had to say because he’s the boss.
“If he thinks Marcus would be better suited to the senior team and had gone past the under-21s, then I can put my tuppence worth in – which I did – but in the end, for the best of everybody, Marcus went with the senior team. Since March he has been scoring goals regularly. He has become Manchester United’s No1 goalscorer, their key player in the magnificent season they’ve had. If he’d had a bit of a dip it would have suited the under-21s more but the fact that he has just kept on going means he comes into the senior team. I think once you’ve moved [up], you’ve moved.”
Rashford was utilised more regularly in a central role at United after Zlatan Ibrahimovic suffered a serious knee ligament injury in April and had no qualms about stepping into the void left by the Swede. “I knew how I would react,” he said. “It is more about what other people learnt about me. Going into that situation some people had different opinions of what would happen, but none of that matters.
“We got the trophy we needed [the Europa League]. If you don’t believe in yourself you can’t expect other people to believe in you, so I was confident going into the games. It is just another step that you take individually. Taking on the responsibility of being in that role is something you take pride in.”
Marcus Rashford’s decision to visit victims of the Manchester terror attack in hospital was motivated by a desire to show the city remains united.
The Manchester United striker, with his club-mate Jesse Lingard, made use of a day off from England duty on Monday to spend time at Manchester children’s hospital with youngsters hurt in the blast after the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena just over two weeks ago, which left 22 people dead. A further 119 were injured. Rashford, who was raised in Wythenshawe, and Lingard attended Sunday’s benefit concert at the Old Trafford cricket ground.
“It was our spare time and this is something we wanted to do,” Rashford said. “We thought it was important. If you can make a difference, it’s important you do so. Going there and seeing the victims, helping them smile and having a laugh with them, creates a good feeling. Friends of friends of mine were affected. Manchester is a small place and it was more than likely that I was going to know someone who was a victim there.
“We are with the families as much as we can be and it’s important the families know that. That’s one of the reasons why we wanted to visit the hospitals. We are doing all we can to support the families and the victims of the attack. Things like the concert and going to the hospital shows the families and people around the city we are together and we have to fight it together.”
Manchester United are set to increase their offer for Álvaro Morata to £60m after their first bid of around £52m was rejected by Real Madrid.
José Mourinho has identified the 24-year-old as his primary attacking target for this summer after France international Antoine Griezmann confirmed he will not be leaving Atlético Madrid. Negotiations with Madrid have taken place this week, with United’s first offer of €60m (£52.3m) turned down as the Champions League winners value him significantly higher at €90m.
United are understood to be confident of persuading the Real president, Florentino Pérez, to settle for a reduced fee if they can pay the majority of it up front for a player who returned to the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium from Juventus last year after Madrid exercised a buyback clause of £30m. Chelsea had also registered an interest in Morata, who scored 20 goals in all competitions last season and helped Spain draw their friendly 2-2 with Colombia on Wednesday night, but are now believed to be closing in on a deal for Everton’s Romelu Lukaku.
“Alvaro is a player who wants to play a more important role,” his agent Juanma Lopez told Foot Mercato on Thursday. “He wants to play more. Which is normal for an attacker who has scored 19 goals. I do not know (if he will have another season at Madrid). This has been a brilliant season for Real Madrid who have won many titles. The player will take a clear and definitive decision in the coming days. I have not yet met with the representatives from Real Madrid.”
Asked about reported interest from Milan, he added: “It existed and continues to exist, like other big teams who are interested in a player of his quality.”
Madrid are also keen to sell James Rodríguez, with the Colombia forward thought to be available for around £60m, although there is less enthusiasm for that pursuit at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Paulo Dybala’s agent has denied reports that the Juventus forward is a target for both United and Chelsea by insisting the Argentina international wants to remain with the Serie A champions. “Paulo signed a new contract with Juventus last month. He is happy in Turin,” Pierpaolo Triulzi told the Guardian.
Pakistan lived up to every well-worn trope about the mercurial nature of their cricket, delivering a resurgent, prediction-defying performance in the field followed by a tense run chase that felled South Africa via Duckworth-Lewis and kept their Champions Trophy campaign alive.
Sarfraz Ahmed’s side had been written off as no-hopers after their lamentable defeat to India here on Sunday. But as the rain fell in Birmingham and forced the players off at 7.38pm, his batsmen were 119 for three from 27 overs, chasing 220 to win, and 19 runs above the par score of 100. Victory was theirs when the match was called off at 9.44pm.
It had followed a gloriously absorbing passage of play in the most compelling contest of this already soggy tournament. Babar Azam’s unbeaten 31 from 51 balls and a similarly watchful 26 from Mohammad Hafeez had battled to keep their side north of the crucial equation in front of a vocal Pakistani crowd and amid the growing mizzle and murk.
When the latter became Morne Morkel’s third victim in a hostile performance from the right-armer, as AB de Villiers shuffled his Duckworth-Lewis sheets Pakistan were just one run ahead. But Shoaib Malik emerged with a flurry of boundaries in an unbeaten 16 that would ease the tension and prompt huge cheers when the skies fully opened.
De Villiers said: “If I had known it would only be 27 overs, I would have attacked a lot more on the field. We have to up our ante a bit. We started well against Sri Lanka [to win] and we know which areas to work on.”
That Pakistan’s overall target was so meagre came down to a transformed performance in the field after losing the toss, as players policed the inner ring as if their lives depended on it. Sarfraz, speaking afterwards, credited an honest team meeting in which there was “no shouting” given their training day was ruined by the weather.
In quintessential Pakistani fashion they also got the two white balls to move off the straight for the first time seen in this tournament. Hassan Ali, the slippery right-armer from Punjab, was the chief destroyer with this, picking up three for 23 from eight overs including two in two balls as the eighth-ranked side limited the top-ranked team to 219 for eight from 50 overs.
The tone was set by the left‑arm seamers, Mohammad Amir and the recalled Junaid Khan, but it was the spinners who inflicted the first bout of panic in the South Africa dressing room. With dots mounting up through this renewed collective effort, Imad Wasim and Hafeez reduced the Proteas to 61 for three in the 15th over, capped off by De Villiers experiencing his first golden duck in ODI cricket.
The left-armer Imad struck first, pinning Hashim Amla in front on 16, before Hafeez – unused against India – repeated the trick to Quinton de Kock on 20.
If Edgbaston was throbbing at this stage, it found a whole new level when De Villiers rocked back to his first ball from Imad and carved it straight to backward point. What’s eating South Africa’s captain at present, given his similarly distracted dismissal against Sri Lanka, is anyone’s guess.
From here it was over to Hassan, who after persuading Faf du Plessis to chop on to his stumps on 26 produced the burst for the ages as from around the wicket and with just a smidgeon of line-holding movement, the edge of JP Duminy’s bat was found to reward an attacking wide slip, followed by the removal of Wayne Parnell’s off-stump first ball.
That South Africa did not implode fully came down to Dave Miller’s unbeaten 75, defying his usual belligerent style in stands of 47 and 49 with Chris Morris and Kagiso Rabada and finishing the innings with a bludgeoned four. Junaid accounted for both of his tail‑end partners before the conclusion, with Hassan – the man who dropped Yuvraj Singh on Sunday – summing up Pakistan’s head-scratching upturn with two swirling catches in the deep.
Pakistan’s reply began in bold fashion, Fakhar Zaman attacking anything wide in a breakneck 31 from only 23 balls. The debutant’s opening salvo was ended at slip via a smart off-cutter by Morkel, followed by Azhar Ali ramping the right‑armer to third man on nine to prompt a steady ascent first from Babar and Hafeez, before Shoaib’s decisive late cameo.
Warren Gatland believes that his British & Irish Lions squad could yet upset the All Blacks despite their frustrating last‑gasp 22-16 defeat against the Blues in Auckland. Gatland has warned his players, however, to stop conceding soft penalties if they are to put a tough start to their 2017 tour behind them.
With a string of tough provincial games ahead, notably the Crusaders match in Christchurch on Saturday, Gatland argues his side will be uniquely well prepared when they do finally encounter New Zealand in just over three weeks.
“There is so much strength in depth I don’t believe there’s going to be a massive amount of difference between the Super Rugby sides and the All Blacks,” the Lions’ head coach said. “These guys have been together for seven months and the All Blacks are coming together cold. We will have learned a lot from tonight and learned a lot about the opposition and I think we will keep improving.
“Look, we know the quality of the New Zealand sides but I thought it was a big improvement from Saturday. It was [settled by] a moment of magic which you do get from New Zealand teams. We have to be a little bit better at stopping their offloading game but we will continue to improve.”
In the dressing room, too, Gatland’s assistant Andy Farrell has been stressing the need for players to be more clinical and not give sides like the Blues easy points. “The big message from Andy Farrell to the players was the penalty count and penalties that were avoidable,” Gatland said. “In the first two games we have been a bit soft in that area. We have to be hard on ourselves as players and coaches to make sure we definitely tighten up in that area because it is causing us a few issues. If we cut down the number of penalties we give away it’s going to make a big difference.”
The Lions have slight fitness doubts over the Irish centre Jared Payne who aggravated a calf problem in Wednesday’s game, and the Welsh fly-half Dan Biggar, who failed a head injury assessment. Both are unlikely to feature this weekend when a number of likely Test starters are expected to be involved. After Christchurch the team will travel to Dunedin to face the Highlanders on Tuesday.
The scrum-half Rhys Webb said the result would make no difference to the squad’s morale. “We’re not going to drop our heads, we’ll review the game, learn from it and move on,” he said. “There’s no sense of panic. We knew it was going to be tough, we knew it was going to be a challenge coming over. These teams are pretty special and the strength in depth they’ve got in these teams is amazing. They can make tries from anywhere and score tries from anywhere. We just need to stay alert for the full 80 minutes.”
He also paid tribute to Sonny Bill Williams, who had a highly influential game in the Blues midfield and helped to set up a spectacular winning try for Ihaia West. “He’s a monster, isn’t he?” Webb said. “Everyone knows what he can do; he got them over the gain-line and he’s got that class about him. We know he’s going to be a threat in a couple of weeks’ time, so it was good to play against him now. He’s special, he’s an athlete and he’s world‑class. He showed a couple of glimpses today of what he can do. He’s been out with injury, but he’s coming back into a bit of form now. We need to be on our money to stop him in a couple of weeks’ time.”
The Cavaliers may be down in their NBA finals rematch with the Warriors, but LeBron James is far from out.
“Do I look tired?” the Cleveland superstar said at his team’s shootaround Wednesday ahead of Game 3 against the Warriors. “I feel great. I’m averaging a triple-double in the finals. I’m pretty good, I would think.”
James is averaging 28.5 points, 13.0 rebounds and 11.0 assists, but he’s been outshone by defensive assignment Kevin Durant, who’s averaged 35.5 points and 11.0 rebounds as the Warriors have taken the first two games of the best-of-seven championship series by a combined 41 points.
“They’re playing well,” James said. “They are playing exceptionally well, and I don’t get involved in what’s going on in the summertime or things of that nature. I’m too far removed from those talks and communications and all the things that go on. So at the end of the day, I want to win just as bad as they do.”
Cleveland was in a very similar spot a year ago, when the Cavs lost the first two games by 48 points, won Game 3 and then overcame a three-games-to-one deficit to win their first title.
In addition to all he does on offense, James has also been assigned to cover Durant. It’s unlikely Cavs coach Tyronn Lue will change the matchup at the start of Game 3, but he did use guard Iman Shumpert on Durant for portions of Game 2.
According to ESPN’s research, the first two games of the series were played at a faster pace – possessions per minutes – than any of James’ previous 212 playoff games. The three-time champion stopped driving to the basket in the second half of Game 2 and he looked spent on the bench when he took a break during the third quarter.
The Warriors are a perfect 14-0 so far in the postseason, and they seem intent on revenge after giving up a 3-1 lead to the Cavs in last year’s finals.
James, however, also rejected any notion that the Warriors are any hungrier than he and his teammates.
“I want to win just as bad as they do and obviously they probably got a bad taste in their mouth after what happened last year and we had one in our mouth last year from what happened the year before,” James said. “I’ve had a few bad tastes in my mouth from what happened in the finals, so and I’ve always had that feeling so it never changed for me.”
Boris Becker, who split with Novak Djokovic in December, says the Serb urgently needs another full-time coach to replace Andre Agassi, who was not in his box on Wednesday when Dominic Thiem knocked him out of the quarter finals of the French Open after beating him 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-0 in front of a stunned audience.
The defending champion, who appeared to give up in the third set, admitted: “I’m not close to my best, and I know that.” But he refused to blame Agassi, who returned to the United States on Friday after watching only three of his matches. The former world No1 has not added to his 12 slams since winning here for the first time in 2016.
“Novak certainly has to make a clean cut,” said Becker, who helped guide Djokovic to six majors in three years, on Eurosport. “He started to work with Agassi, a new super-coach. However Agassi missed the second week when Djokovic needed him there the most. He has to find a new Tour coach. It is said that there were conversations with some coaches who will support him, but this has to happen fast and not during Wimbledon, because Djokovic has to take advantage of the next three or four weeks to come back.”
Djokovic insisted: “Don’t put Andre in the midst of this. The final set, that’s all me. We’re gonna try to get together in Wimbledon, but that’s all for now. His influence and impact on my game, it’s gonna take time. It’s not something that comes out in the first week. We have spent seven days together. We just got to know each other. We will see where it takes us. There have been a lot of changes with the team and so forth. I’m so excited to work with Andre and the new team.”
Thiem took just one game off Djokovic in Rome two weeks ago. The 23-year-old Austrian said after the best win of his career that it was, “understandable” that Djokovic appeared to be suffering “mentally” at the end of this match. “The key for [my] first victory against him [after five straight losses] was to win this close first set, and then have a good start to the second set.”
Thiem plays Rafael Nadal for the fourth time in a month on Friday. The nine-time champion earlier went through on a retirement win over Pablo Carreno Busta.
Djokovic said of the world No7 who bamboozled him over two-and-a-quarter hours on Court Suzanne Lenglen with slice and power: “Thiem is one of the up-and-coming rising stars. He’s very hungry to beat you and to get his hands on a grand slam trophy. He’s got a really good chance. It was not there for me today, especially in the second part of the match. I was unable to hit the ball well, hit too many unforced errors. He was getting better and better and more confident as the match progressed. He deserved to win. He was definitely the better player on the court today.
“I love this sport. I’m motivated as any other player on the Tour. Even though I have played for many years, I still want to do well. The least I can do is give my all whenever I’m holding a racket in my hand. But sometimes circumstances are such that you are not able to perform as well as you want.
“I always expect a lot from myself, but it’s a fact that I’m not playing close to my best, and I know that. All the top players have been through [it]. I guess you’ve got to go through it, try to learn your lessons and figure out a way how to get out of it stronger. It’s a big challenge, but I’m up for it.”
Asked if he would take a break to refresh his mind and body, he added: “I was planning to play only Wimbledon. I might play a lead-up event; I might not. I have responsibility to the game itself, towards others. It’s not an easy decision to make.”
The British Horseracing Authority and the executives at tracks such as Ascot and Goodwood have – quite understandably – had little or nothing to say so far about the developing crisis in the Gulf, which places British racing’s two biggest benefactors from the region on opposite sides of a blockade.
Godolphin’s Sheikh Mohammed is the defence minister of the United Arab Emirates, part of a coalition led by Saudi Arabia which has cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar. Land, sea and air links have been severed, while Qatari citizens in the UAE have been given a fortnight to leave. The Saudi-led coalition accuses Qatar of support for terrorist groups and destabilising its neighbours, claims that Qatar denies.
Thus far, the BHA has noted the British government’s encouragement “of a strong and growing trading relationship with Qatar”, and that it is “not currently aware of any change in that regard”. Ascot, meanwhile, simply stated the obvious, pointing out the “significant contribution” that Qatar has made to British racing in recent years.
Of that, there is no doubt. European racing in general – and the sport in Britain in particular – has benefited hugely from Qatari largesse. It takes colossal wealth to buy your way on to the top table in international racing, and both Sheikh Fahad al-Thani and Sheikh Joaan al-Thani, members of Qatar’s ruling family, have done so in double-quick time, not just via their bloodstock but also through long-term sponsorship deals with major tracks.
Goodwood has a 10-year deal for sponsorship of its summer Festival meeting which is due to run until 2024. Qipco, whose board of directors are all members of the ruling family, has a deal to support the Champions Series and Champions Day at Ascot which also expires in 2024. The new money has led to significant boosts in prize funds, and helped to keep prices buoyant at the major yearling sales. Champions Day, the BHA’s most cherished project in recent years, might have struggled to get off the ground without Qipco’s support (and disappointment at the viewing figures for Champions Day on Channel 4 was, it is rumoured, a factor in the decision to switch coverage to ITV).
Any situation which threatens to disrupt or terminate the flow of Qatari money into British racing is one that the biggest beneficiaries will view with alarm, to say the least. The al-Thanis are young men in their early 30s, and apparently as enthusiastic about racing as Sheikh Mohammed and his brothers were when they caught the bug, back in the 1970s. There has been a growing, and possibly dangerous, assumption that the latest billionaires to fall in love with the turf would be around for decades to come.
And it is still very possible that they will. But however the current crisis plays out, it is a reminder that even where billionaires with sovereign wealth are concerned, nothing can ever be taken for granted.
It is difficult to imagine where British racing might be now without the staggering sums that have found their way into the sport since Sheikh Mohammed took a train to Brighton in 1977 to watch his first winner. But the next generation of the Maktoum family does not, as yet at least, seem to share the same zeal for the sport as the one before. Nor is there an obvious heir at present to the Juddmonte racing and breeding empire, which has seen the Saudi prince Khalid Abdullah race such brilliant horses as Dancing Brave and Frankel over the last 40 years.
One side of racing’s funding equation – the income from betting – was secured for the foreseeable future earlier this year with the introduction of a new funding mechanism to capture all off-course bets. Securing the other side – the income from owners – promises to be the greater issue over the years ahead.

Tottenham Hotspur are considering a move for the Borussia Dortmund and Germany centre-half Matthias Ginter. The 23-year-old is a target for Hoffenheim, who value him at around €17m (£14.8m) and need a replacement for Niklas Süle, who has joined Bayern Munich for €20m. Tottenham, though, could step in with a counter-offer.
Mauricio Pochettino was interested in Ginter last summer and the Tottenham manager admires him for his tactical flexibility and comfort on the ball. Pochettino has spoken on numerous occasions about how Tottenham must be smart in the transfer market, as they cannot compete in financial terms with their rivals at the top of the Premier League, and Ginter could turn out to be a value signing.
Ginter was a member of Germany’s victorious 2014 World Cup squad, although he did not play, and when he moved from Freiburg to Dortmund for €8.5m after the finals he was rated as one of the most promising centre-backs in Europe. He has not yet fulfilled his potential and he was left out of Germany’s squad for Euro 2016 but he has shown flickers of what he can do at Dortmund.
The club parted company with the manager Thomas Tuchel last week and they have replaced him with Peter Bosz, who led Ajax to the Europa League final in this past season. Ginter wants to know where Bosz sees him as fitting into his plans.
It is inconceivable to believe and ludicrous to suggest that Novak Djokovic will not rediscover the spiritual drive and technical facility that lifted him to the summit of his sport here only 12 months ago. But there were extended moments towards the end of the defending champion’s shocking three-set defeat against Dominic Thiem on the 11th day of the French Open when that prognosis seemed wholly valid.
Losing in the quarter-finals of a slam is hardly a disgrace. But when the third set screamed by in only 20 minutes there was a disturbing sense of surrender in the Serb’s demeanour. Later, his press conference felt like a wake that turned into a reading of the will, as Djokovic pondered his immediate plans, while giving his conqueror due respect.
While the 30-year-old expects to meet up again with Andre Agassi before Wimbledon, there was an air of uncertainty about their new partnership – which lasted precisely three matches here before the American returned home after fulfilling an engagement to promote a brand of coffee.
Djokovic insists he knows what is wrong with his game but appears unsure how to fix it. When he won the title last year, Boris Becker and the Serb’s long-time friend and coach, Marian Vajda, headed one of the biggest support teams in tennis. Both are gone. So is Agassi. Djokovic looks alone, lost and vulnerable.
He admitted he felt “lost” when losing to Stan Wawrinka in the final of the US Open last year. But before that the world No41 Sam Querrey beat him at Wimbledon, and after New York, Denis Istomin (117) put him out of the Australian Open. At least he lost here to the No6 seed.
His dilemma can be distilled into the unfolding of that third set. Djokovic won eight points. He won six of 20 points on his own serve, two of 14 on his opponent’s. His sole, meagre success was to prevail in the one rally that went longer than nine shots. He hit 12 unforced errors, a third of his total for the entire match. The score tells the story of his weakening resistance: 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-0 in only two and a quarter hours – the same time it took Hsieh Su-wei to beat Johanna Konta in the first round of the women’s draw.
Thiem played very well but, as Mats Wilander, who won this tournament three times in the 80s, observed, Djokovic played as poorly as he can have done “in the past seven or eight years”. He will drop to at least No3 in the rankings on Monday, possibly No4. He has not been outside the top two since he launched his magnificent assault on his opponents in 2011. It seems so long ago.
Thiem’s challenge, meanwhile, is to keep his composure for the semi-final on Friday against a rampant Rafael Nadal, who earlier had the benefit of a retirement result against his Spanish compatriot Pablo Carreño Busta when leading 6-2, 2-0.
As Thiem said courtside: “It’s amazing how difficult it is to go deep in a grand slam. You have to play the best guys round after round. It’s not getting easier on Friday.” It could not have been much easier on Wednesday.
There are moments when champions have to draw on the powers that make them special. Djokovic has recovered from unpromising positions so many times that even when he looked down and out, there was hope. Yet the passages of disappointment began to mount with such alarming regularity that, after a couple of hours, it seemed pointless to hold on to any notion of redemption.
Using the kick serve into the advantage corner, Thiem had drained Djokovic’s normally rock-solid backhand return. He invested a lot of his bread-and-butter strokes with a slice that confounded his opponent and he kept his own mistakes to a minimum, moving like a panther to hunt down the many short balls served up to him. But there was more going on than mere tennis shots.
The first set was close, although Thiem suspected this might not be the Djokovic who hit him off the court in the semi-finals in Rome recently. The Austrian had witnessed his opponent’s occasional struggles in the first week. This was his time. He stuck to his uncomplicated, robust shot-making and, gradually, forced Djokovic to drop deeper, then drilled home the angled winners.
He might have been waiting for the backlash but it did not materialise. At 0-30 and two sets down, Djokovic played a blinding point to get back into the rally. The patrons applauded and the Serb, who lives for love, smiled and raised a defiant fist. But it did not have the fire of old. It was just that: a gesture. Thiem broke his serve, and maybe his heart.
If Djokovic had realistic ambitions beforehand of reaching the semi-finals, his primary objective now was to avoid embarrassment. His ground strokes disintegrated. The net grew larger and the court shrank. Thiem was not looking across at a legend who had won 12 slam titles and probably would collect a few more yet; he saw a wounded bull.
As the confident 23-year-old rested before the final act, leading 5-0, he looked as calm as Djokovic often has done in similar situations. There was no room for pity. He wanted a bloodless conclusion.
Thiem coasted to 40-0. Court Suzanne Lenglen, the tournament’s second arena, went silent. Would he not only bagel Djokovic but not allow him even one more point? Thiem netted a backhand, the smallest of mercies.
He missed a serve – and then he lashed an exquisite backhand down the line. The deed was done.
There were press-box mutterings: did we just see Djokovic give up? Surely not. He had, though, been beaten out of sight by a young man who one day might be as great a champion himself.
Southampton are confident that Virgil van Dijk will remain at the club next season after Liverpool were forced into a humiliating climbdown over their pursuit of the player. The south-coast club were furious to read stories on Monday that Liverpool were primed to complete a £60m move for the Holland centre-half and they reported them to the Premier League for an alleged illegal approach.
Southampton felt that Liverpool’s fingerprints were on the stories and they questioned how there could have been the belief at Anfield that Van Dijk wanted to join them given they had made no official approach for him. Moreover, they wondered how – as per the reports – Van Dijk might be so keen to play for Jürgen Klopp if he had not spoken to the Liverpool manager.
It has been reported that Van Dijk met Klopp in Blackpool to discuss the proposed transfer – which would have been in breach of the League’s rules on tapping-up. On Wednesday evening, Liverpool released a statement on their website in which they apologised to Southampton over “any misunderstanding” regarding the pursuit of Van Dijk and stated that they had formally dropped their interest in him.
“Liverpool Football Club would like to put on record our regret over recent media speculation regarding Southampton Football Club and player transfers between the two clubs,” the statement read. “We apologise to the owner, board of directors and fans of Southampton for any misunderstanding regarding Virgil van Dijk. We respect Southampton’s position and can confirm we have ended any interest in the player.”
Southampton wonder how Liverpool could have dropped their interest in a player about whom they had never formally enquired – a clear admission, in their opinion, of the Merseyside club’s guilt in terms of the alleged illegal approach.
The Premier League had written to both clubs on Tuesday to ask for their version of events with a view to deciding whether to launch an investigation and it is unclear, at this stage, whether Liverpool’s apology will bring an end to it. If both clubs agree that the matter is closed, it is unlikely that the League would take it further.
Liverpool are serving a two-year ban on signing academy players – the second year suspended – after they accepted making an illegal approach to a 12-year-old Stoke City player in April and it is Southampton’s contention that the Merseyside club were panicked by the accusation they made against them.
Liverpool have signed five players from Southampton in the past three years for a total of £96m – Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Rickie Lambert, Nathaniel Clyne and Sadio Mané. But Southampton are adamant that Van Dijk will not tread the same path or, indeed, be prised away by any of the other clubs that covet him – namely, Chelsea and Manchester City.
Their robustness over the 25-year-old is based, in large part, on the strength of his contract; Van Dijk signed a new deal only last summer that tied him to St Mary’s until 2022. The chairman, Ralph Krueger, was typically strident when he outlined why the club had no need to sell.
“The trading in the last three summers was often out of necessity,” Krueger said. “We have contracts in place like never before. We go into the first summer ever where we do not have to sell a player. We built longevity in the contracts and that gives you a chance to move with a core of players into multiple seasons and build some synergy. Our goal is to keep the core in place.”
Chelsea and City will continue to monitor Van Dijk’s situation, although Chelsea might recoil at the £60m fee that has been mentioned. Van Dijk joined Southampton from Celtic in the summer of 2015 for £11.5m and he has been outstanding in their colours until a serious ankle injury sidelined him last January.
Los Angeles has apparently given up its bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, a move that effectively means Paris will host the Games in seven years. LA is then expected to be the host city in 2028.
“To be blunt, LA 2024 has never been only about LA or 2024,” LA’s bid leader, Casey Wasserman, writes. “Even when the issue of a dual award for the 2024 and 2028 Games was initially raised, we didn’t say it’s ‘LA first’ or it’s ‘now or never’ for LA: that sounds like an ultimatum.
“We could have used that strategy, but we didn’t because we thought it was presumptuous to tell the IOC what to do and how to think. We’re better partners than that. It has always been our contention that LA 2024 had to make as much sense for the Olympic Movement as it did for the people of LA - and we’ve stuck to that premise.”
On Friday, it is expected that the IOC will confirm the host cities for 2024 and 2028 will be announced at a meeting in Lima on 13 September.
In the wake of Wasserman’s statement, an LA 2024 spokesman insisted it had not yet given up on hosting the 2024 Olympics.
“LA has not conceded 2024. Indeed, LA has a firm belief that it is the best host for the 2024 Games given the current situation in the Olympic movement,” said the spokesman.
The attraction of hosting the Olympics has dimmed in recent years with huge expenses and redundant venues haunting the IOC. Hamburg, Rome, Budapest and Boston have all dropped out of the bidding process for 2024, partly due to protests from citizens concerned their cities would be saddled with debts.
“There is an absolute consensus among sports economists that it is economically damaging to host the Games, unless one puts a very high value on the local population enjoying the party,” David Forrest, an economics professor at the University of Liverpool, told the Guardian in February. “The only publications attributing benefits to hosting are by consultancies paid by politicians to validate their vanity projects.”
LA (1932 and 1984) and Paris (1900 and 1924) would join London as the only cities to host the Summer Games three times, should the IOC confirm that Paris will host in 2024, with LA hosting four years later.
Andy Murray is in the semi‑finals of the French Open for the fourth year in a row, exploding the myth, surely, that clay is his weakest surface. He is now consistent on all surfaces – certainly in big tournaments – and has a fighting chance of finally adding the title to those he has won at Flushing Meadows and Wimbledon.
However, the world No1 – who arrived in Paris in ordinary form and unable to train properly because of a lingering cold – was briefly in danger of following the defending champion, Novak Djokovic, out of the tournament before defeating Kei Nishikori in a four‑set match that he began poorly and finished in style on Court Philippe Chatrier on a warm, still Wednesday afternoon.
Murray, who lost against Djokovic in the Roland Garros final last year, won 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-0), 6-1 in 2hr 39min to book a place in the semi-finals on Friday against Stan Wawrinka, who breezed past Marin Cilic in 1hr 40min.
Murray said courtside: “I needed to put a little bit more pace on my shots. He was dictating all the points in the first set. Once I got a better rhythm, I was able to keep him away from the baseline and that made a big difference.”
Of his semi-final opponent, Murray said: “Stan has played fantastic this tournament. I don’t think he’s dropped a set. I had to play one of my best matches on clay to beat him last year.”
Nishikori broke twice in the first half‑hour, serving out the set without bother, and Murray needed to regroup quickly in perfect conditions once the wind dropped.
At the US Open last year, it was Nishikori who came from 1-2 down to beat Murray in the quarter-finals but, after his uneven win against Fernando Verdasco in the third round, it was still a surprise to see him start so fast here.
The match, predictably, was not without incident. The chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, gave Murray a time violation in the first set and he dropped serve, descending thereafter into a rolling rant that lasted all the way to the fourth set.
At deuce and 1-1 on Murray’s serve in the second set, Ramos interrupted him during his ball toss for a second time violation, penalising him the point, but this time the Scot was motivated to hold – not before letting the umpire know what he thought: “I’ve been on Tour so long and I’ve never seen that. Why did you do it when I was throwing the ball up?” The umpire replied: “Every single point, you are over the time.”
It was the spark that Murray needed – and Nishikori suffered. He handed him two break points with a dreadful smash and Murray was up 3-1. Within minutes, he had to save two break points – the second given up with his fourth double fault – to hold and went on to level at a set apiece.
Murray was coasting, a break up in the third set, when he dropped serve and Nishikori held to love. They worked their way to the tie-break – probably one of the worst shootouts either of them has played.
They swapped breaks again at the start of the fourth, and a worryingly familiar pattern reinstated itself. Coming into this tournament, Murray has handed back the break to his opponents 18 out of 80 times this year. Last year, he held on to his break 255 of 302 times (84%), similar to his strike rate in 2015.
That Murray managed to forge on to the finish line without blemish probably surprised him as much as everyone else.
Earlier, the erratic and tempestuous world No4, Simona Halep, who wondered before the tournament if she would even play because of a twisted ankle, defeated the fifth seed Elina Svitolina, 3-6, 7-6, 6-0, having come back from a set and 5-1 down. In the semi‑finals, she plays the second seed Karolina Pliskova, who defeated the home favourite, Caroline Garcia, 7-6, 6-4. Pliskova will become the first player from the Czech Republic to be ranked No1 in the world if she reaches the final.
British Cycling will appoint a new head of medicine, split its medical team into cure and prevention units and create British sport’s first clinical governance committee to maintain the highest standards.
The measures are the result of an independent review of the governing body’s medical services that was prompted by UK Anti-Doping’s investigation into allegations of wrongdoing within the GB team and its professional road cycling off-shoot, Team Sky.
That investigation is continuing but it has already emerged that medical record-keeping has been poor, with treatment notes missing, confusion over who has been ordering medicine at the National Cycling Centre and why, and an absence of records to show when drugs have been dispatched to races.
Commissioned by British Cycling, the review was led by English Institute of Sport director of medical services Dr Rod Jaques and he said he was “delighted” his recommendations have been approved by the governing body’s board.
In a statement, Jaques said: “I found members I met with from the British Cycling medical team to be competent professionals, working to the best of their abilities within their current structures.
“To ensure athletes are served in ways that best support performance and allow professionals to develop, the review outlines reforms that will bolster both areas and ensure that British Cycling makes changes to ensure the highest standards of professionalism and care.”
The changes, with immediate force, are part of wider reforms in response to both the Ukad investigation and an independent review looking at allegations of bullying and discrimination within the GB elite set-up. That investigation, instigated by the former GB sprinter Jess Varnish’s claims about the former technical director Shane Sutton, is expected to publish its findings next week after months of delays.
The wait for that report, though, has meant British Cycling has already made sweeping changes in personnel and practice, with a new code of conduct, chief executive, performance director, human resources head and chairman of the board.
The latter, Jonathan Browning, said: “The creation of the clinical governance committee underlines the importance of having the right people, structures and processes in place so that British Cycling can provide our athletes with best in class medical services.”
That committee will comprise British Cycling staff, including the new chief executive officer Julie Harrington, with external advisers, and will report to the board. The new head of medicine will be recruited and report to the new performance director, Stephen Park.
The medical team will be divided into a “rider health section”, which will focus on reducing the risk of injury, mental health and lifestyle education, including anti-doping, and a “medical services section” that concentrates on care and record-keeping.
A spokesman for British Cycling said these changes do not mean that the doctor at the centre of the Ukad investigation, Dr Richard Freeman, has no future at the National Cycling Centre. Freeman, who has described himself as British Cycling’s head of medicine, is off work with a stress‑related illness but is expected to return to duty when he is well enough.
The spokesman said this new head of medicine role is a more senior position with a different line manager and set of responsibilities.
Freeman was heavily criticised by MPs during a culture, media and sport select committee hearing into the allegations surrounding the GB squad and Team Sky for failing to keep adequate records of the treatment he gave riders, most notably the 2012 Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins. Both Freeman and Wiggins deny breaking any anti-doping rules.
Jos Buttler has said England intend to meet Australia’s phalanx of fast bowlers with aggression on Saturday and admitted the prospect of knocking them out of the Champions Trophy provides an extra layer of motivation.
With the top spot in Group A sewn up and a semi-final in Cardiff next Wednesday now booked following the 87-run win against New Zealand, Eoin Morgan’s side have earned a pressure-free shot at sending Australia home early when the two sides meet at a sold-out Edgbaston. Steve Smith’s world champions, whose opening two matches have been ruined by rain, feature a pace attack that could include Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins and which has thus far been unable to accommodate the talents of James Pattinson.
Asked about the chance to end Australia’s campaign, Buttler said: “Yes, it would be nice. We will not think too much about that. We want to win and keep our momentum going no matter who we play. But it is always nice to know that would be the outcome if we did win.
“They are a very good side and one to be respected but we always focus on ourselves, what we can do well, and will not change our style of cricket. We will keep trying to take them on. They have got some good pace bowlers but we will try and be aggressive with the bat.”
England’s reward for beating New Zealand is a day off from training on Thursday for the team that played, while Australia started their preparations on Wednesday with a full session at Edgbaston – a ground they have not won at in any format since 2001.
“We have got some good memories of playing there,” said Buttler. “It is a ground we like playing at, which is one of the advantages of being at home, isn’t it? We have to make the most of that.”
It was Buttler who turned England’s first innings against New Zealand in Cardiff into a match-winning total, with his unbeaten 61 from 48 balls steering his side to 310 all out on a pitch that did not suit his fluent stroke-play, and in winds that reached 55mph.
In a tournament yet to come fully to life, Buttler did provide one moment for the highlights reel when a scoop for six had the cameraman on the raised gantry at the river Taff end ducking for cover – a first, said the batsman, from that particular shot. “I have not done that from a scoop shot before,” he said. “It is something I try and work hard on and with the wind it was quite helpful. It is good form when it comes off.”
Adil Rashid has admitted he might have struggled with being dropped for England’s opening fixture against Bangladesh when he was younger but instead demonstrated his maturity when returning to face New Zealand and delivering one of his most accomplished international performances to date in his 10 overs, two for 47.
England may publicly claim the end justified the means, but it felt a duff call in what has been an otherwise impressive march to the semi-finals. Any fears over the impact on his previous exclusion were misplaced, however: “When I was younger, 10 years ago, maybe [I would have taken it badly]. But I think now, because of the way the team is, we back each other whether we play or not, it’s all together – 15 in the squad.”
Rashid has been a player saddled by expectation ever since he spun Yorkshire to victory over Warwickshire on his first-class debut with a six-wicket haul at Scarborough in 2006. While a brief international spell followed three years later – including the World Twenty20 that summer – it is a wiser and more relaxed cricketer turning out for his country these days.
“As you get older, play more, you experience more situations in games and how to react to them,” said Rashid, whose 47 caps have now yielded 65 wickets, 62 of which have come in the last two years. “Over the years I have gone better and when things don’t go quite so well, that experience can kick in.
“Sometimes when you don’t play, you think: ‘I’ve got to make sure I perform in the next game.’ But for me it wasn’t so much that. My mind was clear because I’ve been in this position before. I knew I needed to go out, relax, do what I have to do – bowl, mix it up, variations.”
With an eye patch and bushy beard, the face of Jack O’Neill, who has died aged 94, was known around the world as a logo for the company that bore his name. O’Neill was celebrated as a pioneer, if not inventor, of the wetsuit, which opened up colder waters to surfers, and the company that grew out of his tiny surf shop went on to sell sportswear that captured the imagination of surfers and skateboarders, eventually becoming a sought-after fashion brand.
O’Neill developed the wetsuit out of necessity: “I just wanted to surf longer,” he explained. Surfing San Francisco’s Ocean Beach, O’Neill and his fellow surfers tried to cope with the icy waters of northern California by soaking sweaters in oily water sealants. But it was the realisation that you do not need to stay dry in order to stay warm (hence the term “wet” suit) that prompted his move to the use of neoprene, in 1951. He had first tried stuffing PVC into swimming bodysuits, but as it absorbed water, it added too much weight to allow surfing.
The question of invention, or where the idea for neoprene came from, is a moot point. O’Neill originally claimed to have discovered neoprene in aeroplane carpets, but the flammable substance was never used for that. He later attributed it to a tip from a pharmacy student at San Francisco State University, Harry Hind.
Competing claims came from Bob Meistrell, who with his brother started Body Glove in Redondo Beach, south of Los Angeles. Meistrell and O’Neill traded threats of legal action for years until the Meistrells’ top surfer, Bev Morgan, revealed he had suggested neoprene to them after reading a paper by a University of California scientist, Hugh Bradner, who had successfully tested neoprene diving suits in 1950 but had never marketed his invention outside the technical world. O’Neill may not have been first, but it was his melding of a nylon interior to the neoprene shell that made the wetsuit suitable for the sport of surfers.
All my friends said, "Jack, you'll sell to five friends on the beach and then you'll be out of business"
O’Neill was born in Denver, Colorado, but his family moved to Long Beach, California, in which he became an avid body surfer. After the second world war, where he served as a US Navy flyer, he moved to Oregon to study business at Portland University and first encountered colder waters. After graduating in 1949, O’Neill settled in Ocean Beach, working as a lifeguard, longshoreman, fisherman, taxi driver and salesman.
He continued to surf, and recalled being fired from one job when he expelled salt water from his nose during a sales meeting. In 1952, he and his wife, the former Marjorie Bennett, opened what he called the Surf Shop in a garage on the Great Highway next to Ocean Beach. “All my friends said, ‘Jack, you’ll sell to five friends on the beach and then you’ll be out of business’,” he recalled.
In 1959 the family moved 75 miles south, to Cowell Beach in Santa Cruz, where he opened another shop. Although he trademarked the name Surf Shop, he never enforced his exclusivity against any of the hundreds of others using the same title. The O’Neill wetsuit, sold with the slogan “It’s Always Summer Inside”, a take on the classic surfing documentary The Endless Summer, led to a rapid growth in sales and expansion into other products. In 1971, O’Neill lost an eye while testing the now-common surf leash, developed by his son, Pat. In typical fashion, he turned the eyepatch into a symbol of his company.
O’Neill invented the sand sailer, a sailing boat on wheels for use at beaches, and continued to fly, primarily in hot air balloons, decorated in O’Neill colours, in which he would drop in to surfing competitions. By the 1980s, when his was the largest-selling wetsuit in the world, the company’s surf brand became a fashion accessory. Eventually the firm became part of an international conglomerate, though Pat still runs the business.
But in 1964, Jack had set up his O’Neill Surf Team, which provided new boards for kids in the Santa Cruz area, and in 1996 he set up O’Neill Sea Odyssey, a marine environmental education programme that has taken about 100,000 children on its catamaran around Monterey Bay national marine sanctuary. His own home, on Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz, overlooked what is now designated officially a world surfing reserve. “The ocean is alive,” he said, “and we’ve got to take care of it.”
O’Neill is survived by his second wife, Noriko, his sons, Pat, Tim and Jack, and daughters, Cathi, Bridget and Shawne. Another son, Michael, died in 2012.

The insertion of an earth-shattering event into a trundling everyday narrative is a common enough literary device. That was probably the best way to frame Michy Batshuayi’s title-winning contribution for Chelsea – an intervention as audacious as someone reading you the last paragraph of a novel you’d spent 700 pages toiling over. You might think Batshuayi, previously more impactful through his chirpy use of Twitter, would have warmed to his new role as champion shock jock but – struck down by the loose-tongue affliction that seems to afflict Belgians more than most when away on international duty – he had a very different kind of surprise in store for those who hold his fortunes dear.
“No, no, no. Everyone knows that I have to play more, that I have to score goals,” he protested when asked if he would accept next season panning out in a similar way on Chelsea’s substitute bench. There’s a World Cup coming up next year. I want to be ready for the World Cup.” Sitting it out until his winning penalty kick in the final appears not to be an option after all – so where will he be able to find the net regularly if not at Chelsea?
Perhaps it might happen to be at Sevilla, because things happen to just happen at Sevilla, without anyone having realise they’re happening. Another of last season’s yes-he-really-did-play-for-them quiz questions of the future, Manchester City’s Nolito, has been spotted in a Seville ice cream parlour and – whaddya know – just happened to catch the club’s sporting director Óscar Arias sprinkling on the hundreds and thousands.
“I was just casually shopping for clothes for my wife in Seville,” he said. “I went to get a coffee and bumped into Sevilla’s director of football casually.” All very casual, then, and certainly more casual than the disturbing revelation that his daughter’s face has “changed colour” and she “looks like she has been living in a cave” since living in rainy Manchester.
Neither can claim to rival David Lynch, but both Batshuayi and Nolito show an encouraging capability to subvert the mundane, something the Fiver wouldn’t know anything about. Besides, there is a beauty in the mundane: in running though Manchester drizzle, in spending another 90 minutes on a warm bench showing Ruben Loftus-Cheek how many retweets your last post got, in downing 3.8% Tin, in cosying up for another Wednesday night with Weird Uncle Fiver.

When Paul Simpson took England to South Korea for the Under-20 World Cup finals one of the biggest battles he had to fight was that of perception. Few observers, at home or abroad, have had much cause to consider that England take the competition seriously and unfavourable impressions can be virulently contagious. The statistics were grim: 17 games on this stage without a win stretching back to 1997, and that accounted only for the occasions on which they had qualified.
Simpson’s squad have turned it all round and stand on the verge of making history. Victory over Italy in Jeonju on Thursday would bring a first appearance in the final. England have overcome a broad range of challenges, and the occasional wobble, in getting this far and have played with an intensity that treats this competition in the way it is so often regarded abroad: as a big deal. “The players know the importance of what they’ve achieved,” he says. “There’s a steely determination about them and they want to go out there and achieve something. So far, so good, but we really want to make that next step and go to the final.”
England will have been together for 35 days by the end of the tournament on Sunday and Simpson speaks glowingly of a group that “has not given me one moment of a problem”. They have made a positive impression with their courtesy towards hosts and Fifa officials; there has been a keenness within the England set up to show that they are serious this time and, in reaching the last four for the first time since 1993, their approach has paid off on all fronts.
“We want to be recognised as good people but we want to be recognised as good football players as well,” Simpson says, and a squad bolstered through rare levels of co-operation from Premier League clubs has stepped up. In previous years an England campaign might have been remembered for the moment a fortnight ago when, with the team a goal up in the group stage against Guinea, the Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori drilled a 45-yard backpass past his own goalkeeper with no danger in sight. That now seems the smallest kink in a run that has brought wins against Argentina, South Korea, Costa Rica and, in Monday’s quarter-final, Mexico.
“We couldn’t have chosen a tougher first game than Argentina; they had so much of the ball but we were just clinical in both 18-yard boxes and killed the game,” Simpson says of a tone-setting 3-0 victory. “South Korea was another tough game where our only supporters were probably a handful of our players’ families. Costa Rica and Mexico were also difficult and I know that Italy will be a hell of a tough task – they look to be a typical well-drilled, well-organised Italian side.”
It is a fair impression, although Italy have not found goals hard to come by. They won a wild quarter-final against Zambia 3-2 despite spending almost 80 of the 120 minutes with 10 men; the Juventus forward Riccardo Orsolini has scored four times in the tournament and the impression before Thursday’s fixture is of two finely -balanced sides who may go the distance again.
Simpson was pleased to see his striker Dominic Solanke score the winner against Mexico days after the player’s move to Liverpool was confirmed. Solanke did not play a senior game last season, a situation said partly to have been rooted in a contract stand-off with his former club Chelsea, and his international manager regards him as an “incredible guy” for dealing with the frustration.
“He’d been a little slow to find his feet but I thought his performance against Mexico was outstanding,” Simpson says. “He really brought his game to the party, and I’m sure that it’s because his situation has now been resolved and it’s out in the open. That must have been a real burden to have hanging over him. Hopefully he can perform in the semis and show everyone what a top footballer he is capable of being.”
Plenty of others have come through with their stock raised, although Simpson will have to do without one important player against Italy after Josh Onomah, of Tottenham, was shown what the manager – along with most others – perceived was an “absolutely ridiculous” red card late in the Mexico game. That was the first real negative of England’s past three weeks but it has made no mark on their appetite to harness the new-found optimism.
“These lads have got an opportunity to play in a World Cup semi-final and not many players can say that – certainly not many English players anyway,” Simpson says. “We just hope they enjoy the challenge, grasp it and give it everything they’ve got.”

Steve Watson: Versatile defender and midfielder was part of Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle revolution before moving to Aston Villa, Everton, West Brom and Sheffield Wednesday. Has since managed Macclesfield.
David Unsworth: The Everton stalwart made more than 300 appearances at Goodison Park over two spells and returned as a coach in 2013. He is now head coach of the club’s Under-21 side.
Marvin Harriot: Began career at Luton and made 36 appearances for Bristol City before moving into non-league football.
Ian Pearce: Went on to win the Premier League title with Blackburn under Kenny Dalglish before joining West Ham and Fulham. Also had a spell as Chris Sutton’s assistant at Lincoln City.
Anthony Hughes: The talented defender played only 23 matches for Crewe in the Football League before quitting the game at 29 after a spell at Morecambe.
Darren Caskey: The team captain only made 42 appearances for boyhood side Tottenham before moving on to Reading and Notts County. Now the football consultant at York City.

Katarzyna Niewiadoma soloed to victory on the opening stage of the Women’s Tour to seize control of the battle for overall victory.
The 22-year-old Pole, among the pre-race favourites, broke clear with a little under 50km remaining of the 147.5km stage from Daventry to Kettering, and her rivals left it too late to respond.
It was a first win of the year for Niewiadoma, the Polish national champion, who is here as the race leader for the WM3 team despite the inclusion in the squad of the great Marianne Vos – winner of the inaugural Women’s Tour in 2014.
It was Vos who crossed the line in second place one minute and 46 seconds down, leading in the pack that contained the 2016 winner Lizzie Deignan (Boels-Dolmans) and the rest of the general classification hopefuls.
Alice Barnes (Drops) was the highest British finisher in seventh place, while the French rider Audrey Cordon-Ragot of the British team Wiggle High5 took the first Queen of the Mountains jersey by crossing the two main climbs of the day in first place.
After making her move Niewiadoma quickly pulled out a commanding lead, and it was allowed to grow to more than three minutes before the peloton got organised in their chase, with Boels-Dolmans taking the initiative.
But they were running out of road and, when Niewiadoma passed the 10km to go marker with more than two minutes in hand, it was clear where victory was going.
Thursday’s second stage, a 144.5km route around Stoke-on-Trent, contains a number of testing climbs and should help shape the general classification battle further before the sprinters can hope to have their chance in Leamington Spa on Saturday. The race will conclude on Sunday with a stage in London.
At the Critérium du Dauphiné, the Australian Richie Porte sent a warning to his Tour de France rivals by winning fourth stage, a 23.5km individual time trial, as Chris Froome struggled.
The BMC rider Porte clocked a best time of 28 minutes 7 seconds to beat the German Tony Martin (Katusha-Alpecin) by 12 seconds and Spain’s Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) by 24.
The Belgian Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Soudal) retained the overall leader’s yellow jersey after the solo effort between La Tour du Pin and Bourgoin-Jallieu.
Team Sky’s Froome, the defending champion who tipped Porte as possibly his main rival for the Tour, produced a below-par performance as he finished 37 seconds off the pace.
However, results are hard to assess on the Dauphine as top riders usually use it as a Tour warm-up and try not to peak to soon ahead of the gruelling three-week race, which starts on 1 July.
Spain’s Alberto Contador (Trek-Segafredo) was two seconds ahead of Froome, while last year’s Tour de France runner-up Romain Bardet (AG2R-La Mondiale) lost almost two minutes.
Drawing conclusions this early in a British & Irish Lions tour can be dangerous but there is one that can already be made with certainty: the phrase “rugby chaos” must be banished from the tourists’ vocabulary, never to return.
It always had the whiff of a soundbite, dreamt up by an anxious PR team eager to deflect attention from negative “Warrenball” headlines, but with a laborious opening victory now followed by defeat against the weakest of Super Rugby sides the Lions will face, it has backfired with an irony not lost on the caustic New Zealand press.
With four years of preparation Warren Gatland would not have at his disposal players who offload with the instinctive ability of Sonny Bill Williams or who attack with the grace of Rieko Ioane. To even suggest that the Lions will be in a position to take on anyone in New Zealand at their own game is ludicrous. Gatland’s side, particularly the backs, may lack the X-factor he speaks of, but they will not find it trying to mimic their opponents.
Instead the Lions must master what they are best at but Gatland’s greatest problem is that he does not yet know precisely what that is. Limited preparation makes it understandable but still the Lions are playing as if disadvantaged that the cream of the British Isles has been pooled. Whether it becomes an advantage – whether in this day and age that is possible – is the million-dollar question.
For it is not much of a reach to say that each of the four home nations would beat the Blues and four years ago the Lions succeeded largely because Gatland could rely on the spine of his Wales team against a below-par Australia side. It was less a mixture of the four home nations, more the best of the rest bolted on to a team Gatland knew inside out.
Increasingly Steve Hansen’s claim that the Lions would be foolish to attempt to replicate Ireland’s win against the All Blacks in Chicago appears diversionary. New Zealand were beaten that day by a side who got the basics right with unerring accuracy and if that does not sound quite like X-factor, it may be the next best thing for Gatland.
Back to events at Eden Park, though, and the temptation when looking for positives is to highlight Maro Itoje’s enthusiasm, Courtney Lawes’s work rate or Rhys Webb’s command of his forwards but to focus on individuals only underscores Gatland’s problem. In terms of cohesiveness, the scrum and the defensive line speed were encouraging but ill-discipline is more of a worry than those two pluses combined.
The lineout, meanwhile, cannot be considered a success because of the shambolic attempt in the final minute. Hookers can often take too much of the blame for a malfunctioning lineout but Rory Best has previous in this kind of do-or-die situation. He snatched at his throw, missed his man and the Lions were condemned to a morale-draining defeat.
Indeed, it is the final five minutes, after Ihaia West’s dazzling late try, that should be pored over before facing the Crusaders. The Lions rumbled up the middle only for Joe Marler to concede a needless penalty, before Best’s aberration, which again raises the question of why Dylan Hartley is not in New Zealand. He is the best throwing hooker in the northern hemisphere and the Lions are finding out what it feels like when these chances are not taken.
Fortunately for Gatland he has largely kept Owen Farrell under wraps until now and he is the most accurate fly-half at his disposal. But while his shoulders are broad it may be stretching it to pin the Lions’ hopes on his talents already – in both matches the backs have appeared lifeless even beyond the Saracen’s restorative powers. They do not have to offload out of every tackle but they must be sharper than the blunt instrument on show so far.
And they must be clinical – Jared Payne’s first-half try was correctly disallowed but that must be viewed as a missed open goal considering the Lions’ backs did not come close to creating a similar opportunity again. The expectation is that the starting XV against the Crusaders will not be far off that for the first Test but if the Blues match was one the Lions dare not lose then what does that make the trip to Christchurch to face the only undefeated side in this year’s Super Rugby competition?
It is here that Gatland must earn his corn. Months ago he celebrated the fact that the Super Rugby sides would be at full strength and that the Lions would be battle-hardened for the Test series. He continued to push that narrative in defeat but it is all the more difficult when his squad are already being written off as no-hopers. Gatland, however, must keep his nerve and instil an identity into this side that maximises their strengths both in the pack and behind it.
For it was not “chaos” that ensured the Blues won the day. It was clear thinking, trusting a skill-set that has been honed since childhood – relying on their point of difference when the stakes are highest – and the Lions must find a way to do the same. Chaos is the last thing they need.
Some NFL players are notoriously reluctant to attend pre-season workouts. Buffalo Bills cornerback Shareece Wright is not one of them.
Wright joined the Bills last month and found himself at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport at 11pm on Sunday faced with a 550-mile, trip to reach the Bills’ practice facilities the next morning.
“My flight ended up getting in late, so I wasn’t able to make my connecting flight,” Wright told the Bills website. He did not rent a car as he wanted to sleep before meeting up with his new team. “I called one of my ex-teammates that lives in Chicago ... and he wasn’t able to take me and Uber was my next thought.”
He soon find a driver, willing to take him. “This guy accepted the ride and I called him right away and told him, ‘Man, I need to go to Buffalo, NY that’s eight hours are you willing to take me there?’ and he said, ‘Yeah, man, I’ll take you anywhere you need to go. I told him the situation. I told him I had to make it there by 7am.”
The cost of an @uber from Chicago to Buffalo $632.08 fare + $300 tip = $932.08 https://t.co/Esxgt9OeK8
His ride cost him $632.08 – price surging doesn’t appear to have been in effect at the time – and tipped his driver $300. Wright is due to make $775,000 this year and has career earnings of $10.8m.
The Bills’ practice this week was voluntary but as a new member of the team, Wright will need to become familiar with a new defensive scheme.
Taking this long drive with @chadj19 and @mikeyj14 back to greenbay.
Earlier this week, the Green Bay Packers cornerback Davon House also needed help getting to practice after missing a flight. He put out a call for help on Twitter and brothers Chad and Mike Johnson gave him a four-hour lift to the team’s facility. “I went to bed and I was scrolling through my Twitter and saw he needed a ride,” Chad Johnson said. “My brother lives in Hudson, [Wisconsin]; I’m in Eau Claire. I tweeted him that ‘I could come pick you up,’ and in the meantime I texted my brother that House needs a ride. My brother also tweeted him. He was closer so he swung up to the airport and picked him up, and I met him on Highway 29 so my brother and I could keep each other awake.”
Dame Di Ellis, who has died aged 79, was a most unlikely physical specimen to ascend to the summit of British rowing. At 5ft 3in tall, she occupied a coxswain’s frame in a world of lofty men and women. But her skills as a competitor, manager and manipulator – in the best sense of the word – took her to the head of one of Britain’s most successful Olympic sports, and propelled her into the orbit of national and international sports institutions.
Competitively, she rowed for Great Britain in 1966, as part of the women’s eight at the European championships, coxed the England women’s four to gold in the 1972 home countries match, and won the women’s eights head of the river race seven times, four as a cox and three as a rower, from 1966 to 1973. She became the first national champion in 1972 on the new 2,000-metre course at Holme Pierrepont, near Nottingham.
However it was as an official that she made her biggest mark. As chair of the Amateur Rowing Association (ARA, which became British Rowing in 2009, much at her behest) for 24 years from 1989, she transformed the amateur body, which was in an impoverished muddle when she took over, into a professionally run and well-funded sport.
It was Di who persuaded David Tanner to take early retirement as a headteacher and set up the high performance rowing programme that has consistently produced Olympic gold medals since the National Lottery came on stream after 1996, when Steve Redgrave and Matt Pinsent won Britain’s only gold medal at the Atlanta games. Tanner described her as “a pulse of the sport, a pioneer, a very strong administrator and leader”.
Di also expanded and developed women’s rowing, which became a phenomenon during her 60 years in the sport. In 1997 she was the first woman elected as a steward of Henley Royal Regatta. Today about 20% of Henley’s stewards are women, and this year the regatta introduces three new events for women to bring their open events on a par with those for men. Meanwhile, Henley Women’s Regatta has grown from modest beginnings in 1988 to an enormous three-day event.
The second of three daughters of Robert Hall, a proof reader, and his wife, Mabel (nee Steadman), a nurse, Di attended Ealing girls’ school, in west London, and Guildford College of Technology, Surrey, where she studied management and nutrition. This led to a career with Surrey county council that included management of the school meal service.
She began “messing about in boats” as a teenage Sea Ranger, and competed for Middlesex, becoming a one-oar “sculling-over-the-stern” champion from 1954 to 1957. In 1960 she began rowing at St George’s Ladies rowing club, one of the first clubs to be affiliated to the Women’s Amateur Rowing Association. In 1966, the same year she began her winning streak in the head of the river race, she married John Ellis, a bank official.
She qualified as an umpire in 1978, was secretary of the national championships and chairman of the women’s commission of ARA (both 1984-87), and was made GB team manager in 1988, before taking up the ARA chair.
Di touched every part of the sport, from grassroots to elite, local to international. She was a sound voice as leader of the British delegation at the congress of the international rowing federation, or Fisa (world rowing’s governing body), from 1989 to 2013. Her abilities as a doer and a fixer resulted in a seat on the British Olympic Association in 1995 and promotion to the board (1997-2013). She was on the organising committees of the world championships at Strathclyde in 1996 and Eton Dorney in 2006, and the world junior championships in 2011 and world cup in 2013, both at Dorney.
She held trusteeships and board seats on a host of sporting organisations, including the River & Rowing Museum (2007-15) and the British Olympic Foundation. She won awards from the International Olympic Committee for services to women’s sport and from Fisa for distinguished service to international rowing. She was made a vice-president of the British Olympic Association in 2013 and honorary president of British Rowing in 2014. She was appointed CBE for services to rowing in 2004 and made a dame for services to sport in 2013.
Latterly she was in charge of the three-person team in the finishing tower at Henley. The team clock crews crossing the line by aligning a piece of cord with a black strip on the opposite side of the course. They have a monitor to follow the progress of a race, consult a waterline photo-finish camera if the result is in doubt, check that the umpire raises a white flag to indicate a completed race, translate seconds into “lengths” and pass the verdict to the commentary box.
It is a well-rehearsed routine that is hair-raising during close races, and Di possessed the temperament for it. “She was a very capable administrator,” said the former chairman of the regatta, Mike Sweeney. “She got things done and smoothed out rough water.”
Di is survived by John, their daughter, Claire, grandsons, Daniel and Joseph, and her sisters, Janet and Sue.

The very last time Pepe put on his Real Madrid kit and ran on to the pitch, it wasn’t to play. Képler Laveran Lima Ferreira joined team-mates in celebrations at the Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday evening wearing all white, knowing that he will not be back. The day before, he had been left out of the squad for the Champions League final at the Millennium Stadium; the night after, he finally confirmed what had long been an open secret: “It’s clear that I won’t be continuing at Madrid,” he said. There was sadness as he said it. There was a touch of bitterness, too. Ten years on, he was going.
At 34 and into the final year of his contract, Pepe had publicly said he would wait for Madrid “until the end”, but eventually gave up in April. He wanted to stay and asked for a two-year deal; Madrid offered only one. Most of his stuff has been in storage for the past two months, shipped back to Portugal, awaiting his next destination, which appears likely to be France. He knew it would end but it was not supposed to be like this. Everyone else knew it too, even as he kept silent – not least because he kept silent, in fact. He was the only player, with Fábio Coentrão, nowhere to be seen at the club’s pre-final media day.
When Madrid won the league in Málaga, Pepe filmed celebrations from the touchline, selfie stick in hand. In Cardiff, he joined them having watched the game from the stands. When they returned, visiting the cathedral and the town hall, he hung back. At the Bernabéu celebrations there was a photo with Cristiano Ronaldo in the dressing room – “with my friend Pepito”, Ronaldo wrote – before his farewell in front of the fans. He didn’t say goodbye to Zinedine Zidane, he admitted pointedly, as the coach already knew he was off – before he himself had.
The following night, party packed up, Pepe said that Madrid’s treatment of him had “not been right”. His complaints, made on the radio station Cadena Cope, have changed the atmosphere, ending things in a way that few expected, but beyond that immediate irritation, there will surely be gratitude for the past 10 years. Pepe said that Madrid had not protected him amid accusations of tax evasion; admitted that, unusually among the squad, he had connected better with Rafa Benítez than with Zidane; and expressed his disappointment that no one from the board had called him after he had cracked his ribs against Atlético Madrid on 8 April.
As it turned out, that was the last time he ever played for Madrid. Before he had been forced to withdraw, he had scored the goal that had put Madrid into the lead. He celebrated with a raised finger, Madrid badge held between his teeth. That image felt appropriate; fans at the Bernabéu have long appreciated him, celebrated him. Team-mates, too. When Pepe arrived from Porto for €30m, one question was asked repeatedly: “Who is Pepe?!” He leaves with three league titles, three European Cups and having played 334 games. Only five foreigners ever played more than the Brazilian-born Portugal defender.
Who is Pepe? For a long time, the answer from some was a villain, public enemy No1. Rival supporters chanted: “Assasin! Assasin!” at him. Catalan TV3 depicted him as Hannibal Lecter; Madrid tried, and failed, to sue. Few forgot that image of him treading on Leo Messi’s hand. In the aftermath of a series of tense clásicos in 2012 which turned genuinely nasty, he accused Barcelona’s players of acting. Andrés Iniesta admitted that he was offended, but scoffed: “What’s Pepe going to say?” He added: “We could do a whole video of his fouls. We all know him.”
On the pitch, perhaps. Off it, he was one of the most likable members of Real Madrid’s squad: approachable, friendly, funny, even gentle. It is not so unusual: there are plenty of players like that, men whose team-mates love them even as they admit they are transformed out there. Pepe was always remembered best for his attack on Getafe’s Javier Casquero in April 2009. At the time, there was no doubt that he was one of the toughest, most aggressive defenders in Spain, often a little wild, sometimes dirty, but that night was something else.
Pepe pushed Casquero over, kicked him twice in the back, raking his studs across Casquero’s spine, punched Juan Albín, and walked off calling them all “sons of bitches”. He was handed a 10-game ban, the sixth-biggest in Spanish football history, allowing some in the capital to present it as if he were the victim. Without him, Madrid lost five of the next six, the title slipping away.
He was hurt, he said. He said he didn’t recognise himself; he had gone “absolutely mad”. He described those days as “the worst days of his life”, and said he had spent much of the time in tears. Madrid’s full-back Marcelo said: “I have never seen him like this.” Pepe apologised to the Getafe players and to “football as a whole” but not to his team-mates, at least not straight away. “I suppose he doesn’t want to talk about it,” Christoph Metzelder said. “I hope he will soon be the happy lad we all know.” Pepe said: “I’m not sure I have the will to keep playing at the moment.”
He did, of course. He sought professional help to control himself. He didn’t exactly become an angel and certainly not straight away – those battles with Barcelona were still three years off, and fans celebrated his aggressiveness – but nothing quite like that happened again. And with time, maturity, his game did change, as did people’s perceptions – especially after the departure of José Mourinho. Pepe’s last red card for Real Madrid was in 2011. He has not been in double figures for yellow cards for four seasons.
Although some clung to that image, it wasn’t him. He came to be seen not just as a pantomime bad guy but a player and a very good one. The chant “Pepe, mátalo!” became “Pepe, marca un gol!”: they had gone from “Pepe, kill him!” to “Pepe, score a goal!”. In truth, his own fans had always liked the bad guy, too, but mostly they liked this defender: reliable, dependable, committed. He had become a symbol for the club, a captain without the armband. It was reported on Tuesday morning in Spain that the club were arranging a farewell for him. Sources at the club were quoted as calling his commitment and performance impeccable. At that point, they had not yet heard his comments from the night before.
Increasingly, he led. There was personality on and off the pitch that was appreciated. He ended up falling out with Mourinho when he publicly stood up for Iker Casillas, calling out the coach for his treatment of the club captain. Mourinho replied that, at heart, Pepe’s problem was that he was a 30-year-old who couldn’t take being “run over” by the 19-year-old Raphaël Varane. The manager described it as “life”, but there was life left in Pepe.
At that point, in May 2013, he was thinking about a departure but Carlo Ancelotti convinced him that he would be important. He trusted in Pepe. Varane was talented, he said, but “Pepe is Pepe”. Ancelotti said: “We’re more assured with him. He gives us confidence, personality and he helps the other players; he is very important for them.” The Italian coach always spoke admiringly of the defender’s honesty and professionalism in admitting that he wasn’t fully fit before the 2014 European Cup final against Atlético in Lisbon. In Milan, two years later, he started, aged 33, and he was superb. There is an argument to suggest that he was also Portugal’s best player at Euro 2016. A year on, injuries interrupted his season, although he impressed every time he was available, and the contract he waited for never came. On Monday night he admitted what had become an open secret.
Pepe once said that when he retires he would like to travel the world in a caravan. That’s still some way off. He believes he has matches left in him, just not, he now knows, for Madrid.
Liverpool are in talks with Sporting Lisbon regarding a deal for the winger Gelson Martins as the club continue their quest to bring more pace to their attack.
The Anfield club have been in negotiations with Roma about Mohamed Salah, but fear being priced out of a move for the Egypt international and Martins is seen as another viable option.
It has been claimed in Portugal that Martins has a buyout clause of €60m (£52m), but that Sporting’s failure to qualify for the Champions League means they would take €50m euros. The 22-year-old made 44 appearances last season, scoring seven goals and providing 14 assists, and produced a particularly impressive individual performance against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu in the Champions League in September.
Jürgen Klopp is known to want to add more pace to his side for next term. It is understood Liverpool have also been monitoring Keita Baldé at Lazio and Bayern Munich’s Douglas Costa in addition to Salah and Martins.
Roma’s valuation of Salah is believed to be far in excess of Liverpool’s, who had a £28m bid rejected last week,with the Serie A club asking for more than the €40m being reported in Italy. Roma’s American chairman, James Pallotta, told the US radio station SiriusXM: “For the moment, there is nothing with Liverpool. We’ll see what to do.” However, that did not prevent Salah, away on international duty, allowing himself to be pictured with two fans holding Liverpool shirts.
Klopp is keen to significantly strengthen his squad this summer in preparation for Champions League football and has been linked with a move for the Southampton centre-back Virgil van Dijk.
It is understood the Holland international has made Anfield his preferred destination, should he leave St Mary’s, although Saints have asked the Premier League to investigate an alleged illegal approach from Liverpool for the player.
Steven Gerrard believes the 25-year-old’s capture would be a major boost for the club. The former Liverpool captain said at an event in Belfast: “I’d love to see him in a red shirt. I’m a huge fan. I thought he was fantastic at Celtic and I thought we should have had a go for him back then. It will cost us a few more quid but I think he is a piece of the jigsaw that would be very welcome and very big for this team.”
It is difficult to understate the impact Kylian Mbappé’s clinical finishing, terrifying pace and prodigious skill have had this season. His emergence at the turn of the calendar year was the catalyst for Monaco as they turned on the afterburners and intensified their already scintillating form, taking the Ligue 1 title and galloping into the Champions League semi-finals. At just 18, he became the only man to score in his first four Champions League knockout games. He also scored 15 goals in 17 appearances in Ligue 1 and laid on eight assists. Young players regularly burst on to the scene in France – Sofiane Boufal and Ousmane Dembélé were the trailblazers last season – but Mbappé is on another planet entirely. His fluid, graceful style and unerring finishing draw natural comparisons with Thierry Henry. Yet, his warp-speed acceleration and ability to bamboozle defenders make him more like a young Ronaldo. The Brazilian was nicknamed “The Phenomenon”; it might be time to pass on that sobriquet.

This season has been a frustrating one for Rennes. They sold both of their wingers – prize asset Paul-Georges Ntep to Wolfsburg and longtime super-sub Kamil Grosicki to Hull City – and did not replace either of them. They finished ninth, without a place in Europe, but the development of 20-year-old defensive powerhouse Joris Gnagnon gave the club a rare bright spot. Gnagnon’s impressive physique is a clear asset but he has also proven to be an intelligent and wily operator, exhibiting superb positional play, anticipation and an astute ability to cover for his colleagues. With manager Christian Gourcuff now describing him as the leader of Rennes’ back four, bigger clubs are circling. Holding on to Gnagnon this summer will be a serious challenge for a side without clear ambitions for the forthcoming campaign. A sizeable offer may be inevitable and impossible to turn down.

Monaco have Fabinho, Paris Saint-Germain have Marco Verratti, and Nice have Jean-Michaël Seri. Fabinho and Verratti dictated play for the top two clubs in Ligue 1 this season and the Ivorian did the same for Nice. He should be considered as on par with the Brazilian and Italian as a deep-lying playmaker and passer. Seri can pick up the ball from his centre-backs and either command the pace and direction of play with his passing and close control or drive the team forwards with a sharp dribble. He racked up 10 assists in the league this season, further underlining his influence in the final third. Seri very rarely gives away the ball, even when under the pressure of a hounding, aggressive press. He has a knack for calmly wriggling away from danger or nonchalantly picking the perfect pass to negate the threat. With a €40m release clause (in theory banned by the LFP but still legally binding by taking advantage of loopholes), he has interested some of Europe’s richest clubs.

Cut adrift of the Champions League places and embarrassed by Ajax in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final, this has been an underwhelming season for Lyon. There have, however, been bright spots: Alexandre Lacazette’s phenomenal goal tally, young Lucas Tousart’s emergence at the base of the midfield and Mathieu Valbuena’s resurgence have all stood out, but Corentin Tolisso’s breakthrough campaign has topped them all. The 22-year-old is comfortable playing as a holding, central or attacking midfielder and his understanding with Lacazette has been the key to anything positive Bruno Génésio’s team have done this season. Perhaps most impressive is his ability to play insightful, deft throughballs, expertly judging the timing and weight of passes and selecting the right option on the counter. If Juventus follow through on their interest, he will be extremely difficult to replace at the Parc OL. Having rejected Napoli’s bid of €37.5m for Tolisso last summer, Lyon President Aulas will be ready for tough negotiations.

Ryad Boudebouz is quite simply far too accomplished to be playing for Montpellier. The club meandered in the lower echelons of mid-table this season but, without his goals and creativity, they might have been relegated. His skill, vision, ability on the ball, eye for goal and trademark swish of the hips have made him an under-appreciated delight in Ligue 1. Montpellier have little chance of holding on to him this summer. His form had fluctuated from the sublime to the anonymous during spells at SC Bastia and Sochaux, but his talent has finally won out and, at 27, he has entered his prime. A top-six club will snap him up this summer – assuming they are not beaten to it by a foreign giant.

Alexandre Lacazette’s form, sharpness and goalscoring have fluctuated frustratingly in the past but, as this season got into its stride, so too did the Lyon forward. Lacazette exemplifies the possible path that promising Ligue 1 players can take if they are not rushed out of the door as soon as they show some semblance of quality. The 26-year-old now emerges as a very complete article after enjoying his most assured and consistent season to date. His finishing is pin sharp; his touch and awareness of space have been refined; and his acceleration is as frightening as ever. He made 30 appearances in Ligue 1 this season and scored 28 goals. This summer is the perfect time for Lacazette to finally fly the nest and prove he is capable of becoming a top-tier European striker. He looked likely to join Atlético Madrid, but their transfer ban has thrown everything into uncertainty.

Without Fabinho, Monaco would probably not have won the Ligue 1 title this season. The difference between Leonardo Jardim’s side with and without their midfield general is stark. The 4-1 drubbing they received from Paris Saint-Germain the Coupe de la Ligue final when he was suspended shows how much they rely on his mobility, power, range of passing and ability to dominate midfield battles in tandem with Tiemoué Bakayoko, despite often being outnumbered in a two-man midfield. If Fabinho doesn’t play, Monaco’s freewheeling, relentless, high-pressing 4-4-2 starts to fall apart. The rangy Brazilian has been the most influential player in Ligue 1 this season. He could prove to be irreplaceable for Monaco, so finding a way to retain him will be the top priority for their vice president, Vadim Vasilyev, this summer.

In November 2015, Toulouse were floundering. After 13 games without a win, their manager at the time, Dominique Arribage, threw lanky 18-year-old centre-back Issa Diop in at the deep end for the visit of Nice. The team won 2-0 and although Arribagé was soon dismissed, Diop has been a permanent fixture in the Toulouse side ever since. His pace, towering aerial ability, reading of play and assured defending were key to their miraculous survival under the inspirational Pascal Dupraz last season. Diop has developed into one of the most consistent centre-backs in France, finishing the season as captain and working in tandem with the equally superb Christophe Julien in one of Ligue 1’s most eye-catching defensive partnership. Still just 20, Diop’s growing stature is already justifiably turning heads.

The question of how Metz stayed up has been the mystery of the season in France. They conceded 72 goals and finished the campaign with a goal difference of -33, the worst defensive record in Ligue 1, but somehow finished in 14th place. Cheick Diabaté, who scored eight goals in the 15 games he played since arriving on loan in January from Turkish club Osmanlıspor, provides half an answer to the question. The other half of the equation is the emergence of teenage winger Ismaila Sarr. Sarr’s explosive and direct wing play dragged his Metz counterparts towards safety in the latter part of the season. The Senegalese was signed from Metz’s partner club, Génération Foot, last summer and remains raw. His style resembles that of a lightening-quick Paulo Wanchope, all flailing limbs and unpredictability, but flashes of genuine brilliance have become increasingly evident in 2017. Superb strikes against Caen and Nancy gave his team crucial points and a virtually unplayable cameo was nearly enough to see off Paris Saint-Germain. He still has some way to go but the journey will be an enthralling one.

As Fabinho’s midfield lieutenant, Tiemoué Bakayoko has been pivotal to Monaco’s success this season. Leonardo Jardim’s attacking, high-swelling 4-4-2 can often be outmanned in central areas when pitted against possession-oriented three-man midfields but, with Fabinho dictating play, Bakayoko’s intelligently protects the back four. Their combined aggression and power means Monaco are often outmanned but they are never outgunned. Although Bakayoko’s core skillset places him somewhere between Ngolo Kanté and Claude Makélélé in the spectrum of midfield sentinels – astutely shutting down burgeoning attacks and harrying forwards into mistakes – his strong, leggy Patrick Vieira-like physique adds an extra dimension to his game. He needs to learn to concentrate for a full 90 minutes but, aged just 22, he has all the qualities to become a world class midfielder.

Michy Batshuayi has made clear he will not tolerate another season as a bit-part player at Chelsea as he targets a place at the World Cup in Russia, but will allow the Premier League champions to determine where his future should lie.
The Belgium forward, preparing for Friday’s qualifier in Estonia having begun the friendly win against the Czech Republic this week, made a solitary league start following a £33.2m summer move from Marseille. The striker scored four times in his last three league appearances, including the winner at West Bromwich Albion which secured the trophy, yet that full league debut came against Watford once the title had been claimed.
His only other starts came in domestic cup competitions and, with interest having been expressed by West Ham United and the Ligue 1 champions, Monaco, Batshuayi’s involvement next term looks uncertain. Chelsea have yet to determine whether he should remain at Stamford Bridge or depart, either on a season-long loan or in a permanent deal.
Asked whether he would accept another season on the fringes of the first team, the 23-year-old said: “No, no, no. Everyone knows that I have to play more, that I have to score goals. There’s a World Cup coming up next year. I want to be ready for the World Cup.
“But I’m not going to ask anything. I’m going to listen to what they are saying. They are the boss, not me. And afterwards I’ll discuss it with my agent and the club. Amicably, as friends of course. A loan? That’s not up to me. That’s up to them. They take the decisions, not me.
“I have lived difficult moments, but it’s in times like those that you learn the most. Certainly when you’re surrounded by top-class players, like Cesc Fàbregas, Eden Hazard, all of them, you only can make progress in a situation like that. I haven’t played a lot, you know, but I managed to scored one of the most important goals. It gave me a boost. Good for me, good for the team. Of course I wanted to play more. And of course I wanted to score more goals. That’s normal. All players want that. But we have become champions. That’s really good for me. It’s a wonderful experience.”
Batshuayi’s Belgium team-mate Romelu Lukaku is the subject of interest from Chelsea, with the player intent upon returning to Stamford Bridge having been sold to Everton in 2014 for £28m. Negotiations between the two clubs could prove protracted, with Everton seeking a world record £100m for their 25-goal leading scorer. Chelsea’s stance will be affected by Diego Costa’s situation, with the Spain striker having made clear his reluctance to move to the Chinese Premier League.
Tianjin Quanjian had initially been prepared to pay £76m to secure Costa, whose preference would be a return to Atlético Madrid. However, the Spanish club are operating under an incoming transfer ban and will not be able to register players until January 2018. They are able to make signings if they do not play them until after the winter transfer window opens.
“Diego is a top player who has played in top teams and has scored a lot of goals at the highest level,” said Batshuayi. “I’m still young, so I’ve learned a lot from him.”
The escalating diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its neighbours is a subject of concern to many in British horse racing, as a result of that country’s enormous investment in the sport in recent years. From a position of almost no involvement less than a decade ago, Qatar rivals Dubai for significance in Flat racing, thanks in large part to the interest shown by two members of the ruling al-Thani family, Sheikh Fahad and Sheikh Joaan.
But Qatar’s situation appears perilous, following the news on Monday that nations including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain had severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region and supporting terrorist groups. The countries involved declared they would halt all land, air and sea traffic with Qatar, eject its diplomats and order Qatari citizens to leave within a fortnight.
Peninsular Qatar has a single land border, with Saudi Arabia, and the prospect of its closure has reportedly caused panic buying of food. Qatari officials deny the allegations against their country and say the blockade is part of a plan to undermine their state.
In the context of a crisis on that scale, any amount of horse racing sponsorship is clearly small potatoes. Still, British racing is awash with Qatari money just now and officials at several tracks are clearly hoping that will continue to be true for a long time.
In December 2014, the state of Qatar signed up to back Glorious Goodwood, renamed as the Qatar Goodwood Festival, in a 10-year deal that was described as the biggest in the history of British racing. No value was put on that deal in reports at the time but it took the total prize money for the 2015 meeting to £4.5m.
Just six months later, another “biggest ever” deal was struck, estimated at £50m in value, between Ascot, Newmarket, the British Champions Series of races and Qipco, an investment vehicle for some members of the al-Thani family. Under the deal, prize money for Champions Day is supposed to reach £5m by 2024.
Qipco was already the sponsor of the British Champions Series and had already become Ascot’s first official partner, entitling it to branding rights during two days of the Royal meeting each year. Sheikh Joaan had runners in Britain last year with 11 different trainers, while Sheikh Fahad used 18. Sheikh Joaan’s Al Shaqab Racing, which sponsors Newbury’s Lockinge Stakes, finished fourth in the owner’s table by prize money won with a total of just under £2m.
Understandably, officials have responded with caution when asked to discuss whether Qatari investment can be expected to continue in the light of recent events, or whether it should continue. The British Horseracing Authority said it would be guided by the position of the British government in such matters.
“The UK government has encouraged the development of a strong and growing trading relationship with Qatar and we are not currently aware of any change in that regard,” a BHA spokesman said. “Qatar remains a significant investor in the UK, accounting for £35bn of existing investment.”
Individual sponsorships of races were a matter for the tracks involved, the BHA added. Goodwood did not respond to my requests for comment, while Ascot confined itself to saying: “Qipco has made and continues to make a significant contribution to British racing through its role as sponsors, owners, breeders and charity supporters.”
A spokesperson for the British Champions Series said: “Qipco is a privately owned company which has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to British racing through its role as sponsors, owners, breeders and charity supporters.”
So, steady as she goes, let’s see what happens and hope for the best, is the message. Doubtless everyone, or nearly everyone, is hoping for some sign of detente in the region.
Turning to Wednesday’s racing, Hamilton has passed a morning inspection after 22mm of rain but conditions are clearly going to be very testing there. Ugh, I’ve managed to nap an odds-on shot in Amy Blair. Taking 8-11 on that kind of ground is not really for me.
Archie’s Advice (4.10) might be more like it at 11-2. His last three turf wins have come on ground with some cut, two of them at this track. He’s been running OK so far this year, on much sounder surfaces, and I think it’s fair to expect a better effort here in a race that is threatening to fall apart through non-runners.
Half an hour later, the 4-1 shot Royal Connoisseur (4.40) is another who might appreciate the sog underfoot. This is his first chance on a soft surface since he scored a double in the autumn, one of those wins coming at Hamilton.
He’s only 1lb higher than for his last winning mark. Adam McNamara rides for the first time since scoring on him here in July. The favourite, Dandyleekie, is capable but has frustrated me on a couple of occasions and I’d rather be against him if 2-1 is all that’s on offer.
At Ripon tonight, Jordan Sport (8.05) is interesting at 12-1 in a sprint handicap. Just two days ago, he had his first run for four months, at Windsor, and ran well while suggesting he’d be sharper for it. He won twice on the all-weather during the winter, has winning form on soft and looks to me like a horse with more to offer.

The British & Irish Lions have suffered worse defeats than this in Auckland and a provincial loss or two will not define their tour. Even so, before they return to this stadium to face the All Blacks on 24 June some fundamental issues need addressing. Without sharper backline execution, better lineout execution and tighter discipline, they will not win the matches that really matter.
To suggest this was a contest they would have won if they had conceded fewer penalties also obscures the abiding lesson of a damp, showery evening. Ultimately the Blues emerged victorious courtesy of two vivid flashes of creative skill the Lions simply could not match; unless Warren Gatland’s squad conjures up some similar game-changing magicians, all their undoubted forward power is going to be insufficient.
Gatland had spoken before the game about X-factor contributors and his point was perfectly underlined by the home side’s match-winning 74th-minute try from the replacement fly-half Ihaia West, set up by Sonny Bill Williams. Williams is set to be named in the All Blacks squad to face the Lions and the sweet offload which sent the rapid West on a 40-metre slaloming run to score under the posts contrasted sharply with their visitors’ more pedestrian midfield efforts.
Nor could any Lion match the brilliance of the long pass from the 20-year-old Stephen Perofeta which put his similarly youthful team-mate Rieko Ioane away for the Blues’ opening try. If there was a hint of fortune about the Blues’ other try just before half-time, when it seemed to the naked eye as if the ball went forward off TJ Faiane’s hand, a try count of three tries to one reflected the home team’s ruthless finishing. The Lions are averaging one try per game and it is not nearly enough.
It should help to have Owen Farrell lined up at 10 as they transfer to Christchurch to tackle the unbeaten Crusaders; with Dan Biggar failing a head injury assessment and Jonathan Sexton still nowhere near his best, the Lions’ creative heart needs to start pumping with more ideas and energy. Then again, simply chucking the ball around and hoping for the best against New Zealand sides is never a great idea either. The tour itinerary remains brutal and, unless a sharp improvement materialises, the below-par success against the Provincial Barbarians last Saturday could conceivably be the first and last weekend fixture the Lions win.
The alternative is to bottle the frustration of this outcome and look to uncork it in the Tests. Courtney Lawes, Maro Itoje, CJ Stander, Rhys Webb and Leigh Halfpenny all had their moments and there was enough scrummaging success to suggest the Lions should be more than competitive in that key area. As Gatland rightly observed, however, no team conceding 13 penalties, several of them soft ones, is giving themselves much chance at the highest level.
Liam Williams being sent to the sin‑bin in the 57th minute, after a second mistimed aerial challenge on Matt Duffie, was merely the most obvious example of players not thinking straight. Stander’s high tackle shortly before half-time also allowed Perofeta the penalty shot at goal that ended up shaping the game profoundly. The ball struck the upright, the rebound – knocked on or not – went over the Lions line and Sonny Bill Williams was in the right place at the right time to score. The Blues were suddenly walking back to the sheds 12-10 up and the Lions could never muster quite the same authority again.
Injury-wise it also proved a wince-inducing night for the Lions. The centre Jared Payne limped off having apparently aggravated the calf problem that ruled him out of the opening fixture and Biggar never reappeared after departing for a head injury assessment. It was a particularly bittersweet occasion for Payne, who used to play for the Blues and has a brother living in Auckland. Before his evening ending prematurely he could have had a couple of first-quarter tries, once just failing to reach a rolling ball in the in-goal area and then being denied a try when his left knee grazed the touchline as he went to touch down in the left corner.
With Webb also being collared just short of the line when a try looked certain, the Lions were overdue a score when Stander finally finished off a rolling maul. Halfpenny’s conversion and penalty gave the visitors a 10-5 lead which their improved tempo and sense of purpose fully deserved. The ever-dangerous Ioane came close to bagging another score, having touched down for the Blues’ first try, within three minutes of the restart as the Lions made a sluggish start to the second half. Even before Liam Williams was handed a yellow card, the touring team were tightly marshalled in midfield, only for Halfpenny’s boot to put them back in front with nine minutes remaining.
It was to prove a false dawn, with the Lions over-throwing a last-minute lineout which could have transformed the mood. Rory Best will not recall the moment with much affection but he and his team-mates know it is what happens next that really counts. Can the Lions iron out such teething problems in less than three weeks? Do they have anything like enough in their attacking locker? And, most pertinent of all, if they are losing against New Zealand’s sixth-best non-Test side, how on earth are they going to beat the All Blacks? Slow and steady is not going to win this particular race.

Nolito is likely to leave Manchester City, with Sevilla thought to be favourites to sign the Spanish forward.
The 30-year-old fell out of favour during his first season at the Etihad Stadium, starting only nine Premier League matches, and told the Spanish radio station El Transistor that he had struggled to settle in Manchester and wanted to leave.
Rumours linking Nolito with a loan move to Sevilla were fuelled further when he was spotted in a Seville ice cream parlour with the club’s sporting director, Óscar Arias, though Atlético Madrid, Real Betis and the forward’s former club Celta Vigo are also reported to have shown interest in him.

Nolito told El Transistor: “I am under the contract, so the club will decide, but I want to leave. I haven’t played in six months. I will do everything possible to make Spain’s World Cup squad.
“I have learnt very, very little English – it’s very hard. Just ‘tomorrow’, ‘good morning’, ‘good afternoon’ and a little more. My daughter’s face has changed colour – it looks like she’s been living in a cave.”
Nolito insisted that the meeting with Arias was coincidental. “I was just casually shopping for clothes for my wife in Seville,” he said. “I went to get a coffee and bumped into Sevilla’s director of football casually.”
Nolito joined City for £13.8m from Celta last summer but has failed to establish himself in Pep Guardiola’s side, and has not started a match since the FA Cup draw at Huddersfield Town in February.
The English rider Davey Lambert has died after being injured in a crash during the Isle of Man TT.
The 48-year-old from Gateshead suffered multiple injuries when his Kawasaki crashed on the third lap of the opening Superbike race at Greeba Castle on Sunday.
Lambert, who had raced on the Isle of Man since 2014, was treated at the scene before being airlifted to Nobles hospital. He was later transferred to Aintree University hospital in Liverpool, where he died on Tuesday evening.
A statement on Lambert’s Facebook page read: “With a heavy heart it saddens us to have to break the news that Davey lost his fight at 19.50pm this evening surrounded by his family and close friends.
“He went out of this world in exactly the way he would have wanted, doing what he loved. He was a big man with an even bigger heart who will be sorely missed by so many. As a family we would like to thank everyone for their kind words and support.
“We would like to thank all of the amazing doctors and nurses who tried so hard to save Davey’s life at the scene, Nobles Hospital and Aintree University Hospital. We know you did everything you possibly could to help him and for that we are eternally grateful. Ride Fast Lambo.”
In a statement the race organisers said: “ACU Events Ltd wishes to pass on their deepest sympathy to his partner Tracey, his family and friends.”
There was a twist this year to Arsenal’s annual late-season injection of hope in that it came with a change of formation. Can a conversion to a back three really, after all these years, be the recipe that actually delivers jam tomorrow? Yet it’s not even clear that Arsène Wenger intends to stick with a shape of which he was once openly scornful, and that means that every transfer, every rumour, will be analysed not merely in terms of the player, but for what it may indicate about Wenger’s vision of the future.
The free-transfer signing of the Bosnia-Herzegovina left-back Sead Kolasinac from Schalke on a five-year contract this week makes the picture very little clearer, but what he should offer is flexibility and a steeliness Arsenal have often lacked. Although Kolasinac was not a regular wing-back with Schalke or his country, and has made his reputation as tough, powerful defender, there seems little positional reason why he could not operate as either a left-sided central defender or as a wing-back – as well as in his more familiar full-back role. He has, after all, played 19 games for Schalke as a wide midfielder (and four more in the centre of midfield), even if his more obvious assets are defensive.
Whether he has the technical capacity to operate as a wing-back is less certain, but Kolasinac is capable of getting forward and nobody has ever doubted his work rate or commitment. He scored three goals and set up five in the Bundesliga last season. No other defender registered so many assists (even if the stat is slightly diminished by the fact that some of them came when he was playing in midfield).
That should not, though, be taken to suggest he is a great passer or brilliant crosser of a ball and in that sense he is not an obvious fit for Arsenal – which may, of course, be no bad thing. He is frenetic and aggressive, somebody who relishes a physical challenge. There are not going to be many filigree interchanges involving Kolasinac and, say, Mesut Özil, but he is emphatically robust. “Sead is a tree,” said the former Schalke manager Jens Keller. “He gets hit on the head, but just shakes it off and continues to play superbly.”
Kolasinac was born in the German city of Karlsruhe, where his father, Faik, works in the Mercedes factory. Faik is a Montenegrin from Niksic who in 1969, when he was 10, moved to Capljina in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He played amateur football there and shares a similar muscular frame to his son. “It’s all genetics,” his father said. “When Huub Stevens [then the Schalke manager] saw us sitting together he said it was obvious where he got his physique from.”
Although Kolasinac played at youth level for Germany, he has always identified with Bosnia. He listens to Bosnian music and even when he was at Schalke, living in Gelsenkirchen, he would go back to Karlsruhe once a week to eat his mother’s burek and cabbage rolls. Until Kolasinac started playing, he would join the crowds watching Bosnia’s national team games on a big screen at his local mosque. Religion played a significant part in his upbringing. Faik remembers that his son would sometimes skip school to go to classes at the mosque and that there were times when he would go hungry rather than eat pork.
From a global perspective, Kolasinac is perhaps best remember for the early own goal he scored against Argentina in Bosnia’s first game at the 2014 World Cup. Safet Susic’s unusual tactical gamble meant Bosnia then didn’t play with a left-back against Nigeria but Kolasinac returned for the win over Iran. Three years on, as the arguments over Susic’s selection for that second match have begun to fade, the most striking aspect about Kolasinac’s World Cup, perhaps, is how untroubled he seemed by the own goal. A 20-year-old could easily have collapsed after scoring against his own side at the Maracanã three minutes into their first World Cup but Kolasinac was impressively solid thereafter.
Given Arsenal’s tendency to wilt at the first glimpse of pressure, that grittiness will be a useful addition. Again, that suggests that Wenger, at last, has acknowledged that not all the world’s problems can be solved by neat, slight midfielders with nice hair. Arsenal’s May uptick this season felt different to what had gone before because it involved such a radical structural change, such an admission from Wenger that his tactical outlook required modification. The signing of Kolasinac suggests that the process of reform, a return to a more physically aggressive Arsenal, is continuing.
“Chelsea have won the title in the last four general election years. Has any English team got a better record when Britain goes to the polls?” asks Jamie Navarro. “What governments do title winners deliver?”
This is right up Gary Fairclough’s street. “It turns out that Chelsea are far from the most prolific title winners in election years,” he writes. “In England that honour lies with Liverpool: they have won seven titles in election years (1906, 1922, 1923, 1964, 1966, 1979 and 1983), scoring three Labour, three Conservative and one Liberal government. But in the rest of the UK that record is dwarfed by our Scottish and Irish brethren.
“Rangers and Linfield have each won the title 17 times in election years, Rangers delivering the most Labour governments (nine) and Linfield delivering the most Conservative governments (also nine). Rangers’ third-place finish this season does not bode well for Jeremy Corbyn but Linfield’s 52nd Northern Irish title looks even more promising than the early polling figures for Theresa May. On the plus side, Linfield have also delivered the most Liberal governments but that, like Lib Dem MPs in parliament, is only a fraction of the other parties with two, most recently in 1910. Sorry Tim, don’t get your hopes up.”
Luca De Angelis has more by the way of this exhaustive effort. He has kindly scribbled a x2 in brackets next to the party who won both general elections in years when there were two, 1910 and 1974. “First of all, I have looked at all the general elections held since the foundation of the Football League, starting from the one that took place in 1892,” he muses. “I know that in some occasions a coalition/national government has been formed after the election, so I want to make a list of the general elections won by each party:
National/coalition Government: 1918, 1931, 1935, 2010. Liberal: 1892, 1906, Jan 1910, Dec 1910. Labour: 1923, 1929, 1945, 1950, 1964, 1966, Feb 1974, Oct 1974, 1997, 2001, 2005. Conservative: 1895, 1900, 1922, 1924, 1951, 1955, 1959, 1970, 1979, 1983, 1987, 1992, 2015.
“As has been said, Chelsea have just won the title for the fourth time in a row in a general election year, while before them no club had won the title more than two times in a row in those occasions. But which club have won the title in those years, how many times they won in those circumstances and which party won in the same year? Here’s the list: Arsenal two (two National/coalition), Aston Villa two (one Conservative, one Liberal (x2)), Chelsea five (three Conservative, one Labour, one TBD), Everton two (two Conservative), Huddersfield Town one (one Conservative), Leeds United two (one Labour (x2), one Conservative), Liverpool seven (one Liberal, three Conservative, three Labour), Manchester United two (two Labour), Portsmouth one (one Labour), Sheffield Wednesday one (one Labour), Sunderland two (one Liberal, one Conservative), Tottenham Hotspur one (one Conservative), Wolverhampton Wanderers one (one Conservative).”
“I can’t remember the last time I read of a club P45-ing a manager without a statement declaring: ‘The club would like to place on record its thanks to [wotsisname] …’” begins Dom Smith. “Wolves are the latest example at the time of writing. Someone’s to blame for this Ctrl+C/V-ery and I want to know who. So, who was the first club to use this firing formula?” [And how about the least thankful club statement on a manager’s departure? – Knowledge Ed.]
“You’d be hard-pressed to rival the double-whammy of ingratitude from Raith Rovers this year,” Iain Wallace writes. “An annus horribilis that resulted in our unexpected, and largely self-inflicted, relegation to League Two also resulted in two managers leaving without much love being lost. After Gary Locke’s calamitous reign was brought to an end on 7 February 2017, the Rovers had only the following to say:
The board of directors of Raith Rovers FC announces that we have parted company with manager Gary Locke and assistant manager Darren Jackson, with immediate effect
“They were similarly laconic when releasing the following regarding John Hughes, mere minutes after the final penalty confirmed relegation through the play-offs.
Raith Rovers FC announces that we have this evening parted company with manager John Hughes and assistant manager Kevin McBride
“It’s been a tough year …”
“I was browsing through some recent editions of The Knowledge, and spotted the segment on shortest international players, and wanted to bring your attention to a contribution of my own,” Nikolai von Stieglitz writes.
“Some years ago my brother and I tuned in to catch a group stage match between Nigeria and Benin during the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations,” he continues. “With fewer than 10 minutes remaining in the game we were astonished by the introduction of the fabulously miniature Arnaud Séka, replacing Nouhoum Kobéna. Listed at just 5ft 1in, the remarkably tricksy attacking player had little time to influence the result in a rather humdrum 1-0 loss to the Super Eagles, courtesy of a Yakubu penalty, but he was majestic to watch. Séka went on to play a further 20 minutes as a substitute during the 2-0 loss to Egypt, taking the place of Mickaël Poté. Surely he deserves an honourable mention on your list (here’s a video – featuring a wonderful dinked goal)?”
“Who was the first player to wear fluorescent boots?” wondered our very own Rob Smyth in 2014.
Black boots were under threat as early as the 1950s. Here was Simon Burnton in 2013 and his brilliant Joy of Six: tales from the boot room:
“Rewind to December 1959, when the Mansfield boot-manufacturing firm Ward Bros closed its doors with the loss of 60 jobs. “Fashions in football boots these days are as fickle as the indies’ shoe trade, if not more so,” said Harold Ward, a director of the family firm. “Until about three or four years ago a football boot was a football boot, varying only in size and weight, but following a sound basic design. Now the latest creation is likely to be in black and tan with silver eyelets, and in a couple of months’ time it will be out of date, replaced by something else. We can’t risk building up stocks that won’t sell.”
But the beginning of the end for the traditional black boot came in the early 1970s. The German sportswear company Hummel was looking to break into the UK market and signed up several professionals to wear its new white boots. Not that they were worn for sartorial elegance. Alan Ball, who debuted his white boots in the 1970 Charity Shield, used to paint an old pair of Adidas boots white, while Derby’s Alan Hinton risked Brian Clough’s wrath for the money. “The background to me wearing them was simple. A company called Hummel approached me and offered me a grand,” Hinton told the Star in 2011. “That was a fair bit of money back then. I thought Cloughie would crucify me, but he didn’t for some reason.”
They then dropped out of fashion for a time, with the next reference in the newspaper archive we could muster coming from David Lacey’s report on the 1995 European Cup final between Ajax and Milan in Vienna, where the Rossoneri’s Marco Simone was a trendsetter. “For a time it looked as if the amount of room Simone and his white boots were being allowed by Ajax would eventually return the trophy to San Siro. However, he was to come no closer to scoring than the volley, from Donadoni’s centre, which Van der Sar turned round a post at the end of the first half.”
When it comes to the first luminous footwear, things, ironically, are a little murkier. The mid-90s are the turning point once more and the earliest definitive reference we’ve uncovered comes in a report from Dundee’s Dens Park. “It was perhaps a portent that the afternoon was going to be a rather grim affair,” Archie MacGregor wrote in the Sunday Times in November 1996, “when St Johnstone’s Attila Sekerlioglu decided to dispense with his notorious yellow boots.”
“In seasons 1955-56, 1956-57 and 1957-58. Leeds United drew Cardiff City in the third round of the FA Cup at Elland Road,” Stephen Crump writes. “The score in the three games was 2-1 to the away team, Cardiff. Has there ever been a similar pattern and coincidence in the FA Cup – or other cup competition?”
“Following the John Terry farewell, have any other games been subject to pre-planned interruptions, either officially sanctioned or not?” David Gibson asks.
“As I was perusing the Liga MX page on Wikipedia, I noticed that Santos Laguna just finished the Clausura in fifth place despite losing only one game,” notices Brad Hill. “This makes me wonder … what is the lowest position a team has finished in the league despite losing only one game?”

It was hard to find anyone who begrudged Cleveland fans their championship 12 months ago. The fanbase had suffered through decades of losing and crushing defeats; there had been tears and screams and, yes, even flames. The collective futility of the Cavaliers, Indians and Browns had endured year-round, one failed season rolling into the next. And all the sports misery occurred at a time when the city and the entire region of northeast Ohio was struggling just to survive. So only the cruelest of souls were upset by the sight of a million people in the streets of Cleveland celebrating the city’s good fortune.
Good luck finding a person alive who feels the same way about Warriors fans. Golden State are two wins away from winning their second NBA title in three years and entering the conversation about the greatest basketball teams of all time. They’re also two wins away from making Warriors fans perhaps the most despised in all of American sports.
All due respect to the widely loathed supporters of the Patriots, Yankees, Cowboys and Lakers, but the Warriors are building a fanbase that could dwarf them all for unlikability. Golden State fans’ negatives are on a hockey stick growth curve as Oracle Arena increasingly fills with – apologies for the poor attempt at using Silicon Valley lingo – brogrammers who truly believe they offer a value add to the organization. (And for the sake of clarity, it is this new breed of fan that attracts ire, rather than the Warriors supporters who pulled for the team even during the bad old days.)
Part of the problem is simple demographics. Bandwagon jumpers are considered to be the lowest form of fan – even below drunk, belligerent and face-painted – whereas the diehard, thick and thin, fan-since-birth group is the most respected. Because of the massive influx of people into northern California with the tech boom, many of those filling the choice seats at Oracle Arena have ties to the region that are tenuous even compared to those of Kevin Durant. Yet they’re cheering their hearts out for their beloved Warriors every night, while across the street the last place A’s – with the second-worst attendance in all of baseball and portions of the upper deck covered in tarp – don’t seem to have captured the imagination of Silicon Valley big wigs. The new Warriors fan has not suffered anything near the sports heartache of a Cleveland lifer. Their toughest season to endure was one in which the Warriors won an NBA-record 73 games. Sad!
The biggest example of the new strain of Golden State fan is none other than Joe Lacob himself, the team owner. Born in Massachusetts, he grew up a Celtics fan before his family relocated when he was a teenager to Los Angeles ... upon which he became a Lakers fan. Who knew that kind of swap in loyalty was even legal? But avoiding charges, Lacob started a venture capital firm in the late 80s, became part owner of the Celtics in 2006 (another flip!) and then majority owner of the Warriors after the 2010 season. Like the worst Silicon Valley stereotype, he credits tech culture for his team’s success, telling the New York Times Magazine last spring: “We’ve crushed them on the basketball court, and we’re going to for years because of the way we’ve built this team. We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
Lacob is undoubtedly correct that his team is positioned to win for a long time, but that has more to do with hitting on Stephen Curry in the 2009 draft – a selection that came before Lacob arrived – and the ensuing benefits Curry’s abilities have afforded (on an under-market contract, mind) than it does with any sort of ingenious tech management style we in the small-brained community can’t comprehend. The Portland Trail Blazers and Sacramento Kings also have owners with tech backgrounds, don’t they? But their tech culture hasn’t created much success without the likes of Curry and Durant (who is deeply involved in Silicon Valley himself) on the rosters. Having an owner that irks is a near-necessity for despised teams, however – see Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft – and Lacob goes the extra mile there with his comments on how he and his fiancee had sex alongside the Larry O’Brien Trophy following Golden State’s 2015 title win. Thinking of that is like Uber but for vomiting.
Anyone else see Eddy Cue @cue say "tell that bitch to sit down" after @rihanna was cheering court side? #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/iwRjjYEqno
Lacob and his fellow tech gazillionaires have also priced many of Golden State’s long-time fans out of the market (and insulted Rihanna while they’re at it). The average ticket price for a Warriors home game increased nearly 300% from the 2006-07 season ($26.63) to last year’s 73-9 campaign ($79.84). The Warriors also had the fourth-highest average ticket price in the entire NBA. Lifelong Golden State fans, ones who can’t afford to spend $400 on a juicer that doesn’t actually work, undeniably exist and in large numbers; the Warriors have always had good support even in down years, but a lot of those diehards have lost their tickets to multi-millionaires who invented an app you have never heard of. It’s hard to associate Warriors fans now with anything other than the tech bros we see ringing the lower bowl at Oracle Arena every game. And that’s while they’re still at their present venue: they will soon move from their traditional home in Oakland to wealthier (and tech-ier) San Francisco.
Is some of it jealousy? Oh, no doubt. More than some. If the Warriors didn’t win, their fans would be easily ignored. Same with Patriots fans. They wouldn’t be worth the energy for hatred. And few among us would turn down a high-paying Silicon Valley job that afforded piles of cash to spend on seeing the NBA’s greatest team up close. But it’s all too much. Too easy. And it’s being done with a finesse, don’t-get-too-dirty playing style that is just too Silicon Valley. The one area of the country where you can get millions dumped on you for conceiving a quarter of a half-baked idea shouldn’t also get to have the most dominant professional sports team in a generation. It’s not fair.
But the new Warriors fan will surely take being loathed by the rest of sportsdom in exchange for a string of championships. And all we’ll be able to do is watch it happen on whatever devices they sell us next.
Arsène Wenger is proactive. He’s dynamic, he’s in charge and he’s going to sign your player. Hot on the heels of Sead Kolasinac’s arrival, he’s at it again – photographed by a quick-thinking citizen-journalist at Nice airport clutching a pricey-looking bag of shopping and flanked by his

vassal
 boss Ivan Gazidis. Does 2+2=Mbappé? Apparently a higher level of maths is needed for this one: Wenger was in the region to speak with Lyon’s top brass about trusty Rumour Mill steed Alexandre Lacazette, with the Gunners keen to get most of their big deals done uncharacteristically early.
Perhaps Wenger might make a quick hop over to Barcelona, who believe they have won the heart and mind of their former player Héctor Bellerín. Terms are said to have been agreed with the right-back and now, such is the way football works, the clubs need to get to work over a fee. £50m might do it, and reports in Catalonia say Bellerín wants out. There could even be another departure from the Emirates, too, with almost-top-class striker Olivier Giroud warning darkly that he “won’t settle for such limited playing time” when Arsenal get next season’s knockabout japes underway.
The Rumour Mill values its regular stars and if Romelu Lukaku is soon to flee the nest we do, at least, have James Rodríguez. Liverpool are in for the out-of-favour Real Madrid playmaker! And so are Arsenal! And so is pretty much every top-tier club you can name, according to Wednesday’s reports, all of which should end up meaning an agent does pretty well in a couple of months’ time.
That would all be big news but surely not as big as Bournemouth signing a new captain, leader and legend at the same time. So hold the back page, then, for imminent news of the Cherries doing exactly that – with John Terry apparently close to signing a £100,000-a-week deal to continue his top-flight career for a year longer than really seems wise.
Another Chelsea product, Southampton’s Ryan Bertrand, is in demand, with suggestions that Manchester City could steal in for the left-back amid problems with their bid for Monaco’s Benjamin Mendy. And if they don’t, Liverpool or even the Stamford Bridge club probably will.
City are about to bid farewell to one member of last season’s squad, with the lesser-spotted Nolito having touched down in Spain ahead of what is expected to be a loan move to Sevilla. The Premier League could see a new wide forward come in soon enough though: West Ham are looking to stem the flow of discontent at the London Stadium with a move for Jürgen Damm, a Mexican winger who plays for Tigres, with £4m apparently likely to do the job there.
And in the latest evidence that Championship club Wolves’s transfer policy definitely, undoubtedly, assuredly isn’t being led by Jorge Mendes, the Molineux side are interested in adding Manchester United stalwart Bebé – currently on the books of Eibar in Spain – to their cadre.
Ange Postecoglou says the time has come for his Socceroos players to pay back the significant investment put into them. The Australian coach is confident the payback will begin in Thursday night’s crucial World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia in Adelaide.
“As the games get more and more important and vital, that is where you want to see all the work we have done in the last two or three years come to fruition,” Postecoglou told reporters on Wednesday.
“We have invested two or three years in them but I think, over this next period, it will be interesting to see how far they can go as footballers and how far the team can go.”
Australia enter Thursday’s fixture three points adrift of group leaders Japan and Saudi Arabia, with three games remaining. The top two nations secure spots at next year’s World Cup in Russia but the third-placed nation is pitched into playoff rounds.
Postecoglou was preparing for some stodgy Saudi tactics in Adelaide, noting it had become a pattern of Australia’s opponents. “What we have found is, irrelevant of who we play, in recent times they tend to sit back against us,” he said. “I think it’s recognition from the opposition that the way we play our football, they will have no choice but to sit back.”
“I don’t think that is because of the (group) position or consequences. I think regardless, that is what they have to do to try to stop us. That’s what we’re expecting. But from our perspective, it’s about our growth and our ability to dominate games of football against all types of opposition and under any circumstances.”
“And tomorrow will be another challenge in that area.”
In the lead-up to the crunch game, players have deliberately kept in the dark about the starting line-up. In doing so, Postecoglou has maintained his usual stance of not naming his final line-up until match day.
“We don’t really know the team until match day,” captain Mile Jedinak told Adelaide radio station 5AA. “It’s a thing that keeps everybody on their toes and allows people to prepare as if they’re starting no matter what. Obviously there’s only 11 shirts up for grabs for that starting position.”
“But we’re always made aware that you might not start the game however you may make the biggest impact in the game when you do come on.”
Jedinak said players were comfortable with Postecoglou’s selection tactic. “It’s a great way of doing it,” he said. “We’re all used to it now so we just get on with it and we’re all here to support each other no matter what. Whether we start, whether we’re coming off the bench or whether we don’t play at all, everyone is just as important.”
Postecoglou has a full squad of 23 players to choose from for the Saudi match, with midfielder Jackson Irvine among those awaiting selection news. Irvine started the past two games and hoped to secure another starting midfield berth.
“You want to be involved in as much play as you can,” Irvine told reporters. “But I also recognise the talent and ability that we possess in this team. If my role is to play from the bench and be more of an impact player, or to play from the start, my mentality won’t change.”
Adam Gilchrist has broken ranks with past and present players by supporting Cricket Australia’s pay offer, labelling it fair. The retired Test great is confident the pay dispute between CA and the Australian Cricketers’ Association is on track for a resolution by the 30 June deadline.
That’s despite players standing firm on their opposition to the governing body’s move to scrap the existing revenue-sharing model under the new agreement. CA has been spruiking the deal’s 58% increase of guaranteed payments, benefiting men and women players.
Gilchrist has backed players for showing unity, in particular those at the highest level who are concerned the new deal will leave domestic players out of pocket. But he suggested CA’s argument that the revenue-sharing agreement takes money away from the grassroots of the game had merit.
“I think Cricket Australia are offering a very, very fair deal for players,” Gilchrist told Fox Sports. “No-one’s going to go without and everyone’s growing and increasing.”
“I do hope that they’re [the players] thinking of the cricketer at the most important level, and that is the kid signing on for his first year. Because grassroots cricket is under siege from other sports, like the various footy codes.”
Australians playing in the Champions Trophy in England have been vocal in their opposition to the deal, as have a number of former cricketers. But CA is maintaining its new pay offer has to be implemented for the long-term good of the game.
Gilchrist said the two sides will eventually negotiate. “There will be an end to it. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve been meeting in the last few days – the players’ association and the board,” said Gilchrist.
“I think both sides are going to have to compromise. Having spoken to people in both parties, I think they’re both starting to say that and understand that.”
The more practical concern of Australia’s players in the coming days is a simple equation: beat England at Edgbaston on Saturday or go home from the ICC Champions Trophy.
Eoin Morgan’s side booked their semi-final spot on Tuesday with an impressive 87-run win over New Zealand in Cardiff to secure top spot in Group A. England cruised to victory after bowling out New Zealand for 223 inside 45 overs having posted 310 having been put in to bat.
The result means Australia, Bangladesh and New Zealand all have a chance of reaching the semi-finals on Saturday. Victory for Australia over England, in what’s essentially a quarter-final match, will keep their tournament alive by virtue of having four points.
Only Aaron Finch, David Warner, Smith and Moises Henriques spent time at the crease in the tournament due to the weather but Smith is unconcerned and believes the pressure of needing a result will suit his players.
“I’m sure they’ll be OK,” Australian captain Steve Smith said. “Most of the guys have been playing a lot of cricket, anyway, having been at the IPL and things like that. I think once they get out in the middle, things will just click into place, and yeah, hopefully we can play well on the 10th in Birmingham.
“It makes the equation pretty simple for us. We have to beat England.”
Should Australia win, it will extend their stay in Birmingham where they would play in the second semi-final against the winner of Group B - which is likely to be South Africa or India - on June 15. One bonus for Smith in Monday’s wash-out at The Oval was the improved performance of his quicks, with Mitchell Starc particularly impressive alongside the consistent Josh Hazlewood.
It was a much-improved showing on what was served up against New Zealand last Friday and Smith said he was relishing the opportunity to unleash them on England’s powerful batting line-up.
“I thought all our bowlers were a lot better,” Smith said. “We hit some good areas early on and challenged the defence of Bangladeshi batsmen. Everyone that bowled did a pretty good job and it was nice that we were able to turn things around.”
The Football Association has issued its first life bans after being shown previously unseen footage of England supporters making Nazi salutes and slit-throat gestures amid growing fears among security officials that the national team have become a focal point for a new generation of troublemakers.
Other footage showed an England follower holding a finger above his lips to imitate Hitler, in between gesturing that he would stab Germany’s supporters, during March’s game in Dortmund that became an opportunity for many travelling Englishmen to go through their repertoire of songs about the second world war.
Of 59 people identified by the UK Football Policing Unit, 20 turned out to be members of the official England Supporters Travel Club. Sixteen have now been banned for periods ranging from six months to five years and the other four have received warning letters. However, the authorities accept the real number of offenders is significantly higher and that in terms of antisocial behaviour, England have one of the worst followings of any football nation.
Intelligence reports have also revealed that many of those causing problems are aged 18 to 25 and fit a new profile of troublemaker who operate differently to the old category C hooligans and regard England’s travels with a stag-weekend culture where they take pride in behaving badly.
When officials from the travel club emailed its members after the Germany game, a 1-0 defeat for Gareth Southgate’s team that took place with a backdrop of songs such as “10 German Bombers”, they even received some replies from people arguing that what happened in Dortmund was fine. Those people are now being monitored before the World Cup in Russia next year.
Two supporters were separately identified by travel club officials making Nazi gestures and the FA is so concerned it has banned them for life, in contrast to the kind of punishments that have previously been handed out. One racist incident, for instance, in 2012, led to a supporter receiving a five-year ban. However, there are now clear indications the FA wants to take an increasingly tough stance.
Using information from its own staff, the travel club has also banned another nine members for various offences, including aggressive behaviour and ticket scams around the Germany game, with two others receiving warnings and one case pending.
A system is being introduced whereby a team of six Wembley stewards will start to travel abroad to England’s fixtures and supporters have been emailed warnings that misbehaviour will not be tolerated around the World Cup qualifier against Scotland at Hampden on Saturday. England have a 4,761-ticket allocation for what is always a high-risk fixture and, when it comes to the habit of supporters gathering in a main square, the FA wants supporters to realise that drinking alcohol in the streets is forbidden in Glasgow.
The Scottish and English football associations, along with the police, are concerned about the 5pm kick-off, designated by Uefa, and the potential for drunkenness. That, however, raises questions about why the authorities have not made a concerted push to persuade Uefa to bring it forward.
One of the other problems, namely England fans travelling without tickets, has been exacerbated by the number of supporters who have dropped out of the travel club since a controversial system was put in place in January 2014 whereby ticket-holders were offered two loyalty points for attending Wembley games and only one for going abroad with the team. That system has now been changed to two points each but the FA privately accepts it was a mistake to change it in the first place, not least because many supporters now travel independently and get tickets from touts or other means.
The travel club had 57,000 members when the new Wembley opened a decade ago. It is now down to 8,000, its lowest total, and officials have noted a substantial drop-off in the number of families. One factor is that the next two World Cups, in Russia and Qatar, have drawbacks for visiting fans. England’s poor performances in the past few tournaments have contributed as well, but the dwindling numbers are still alarming bearing in mind there were 15,000 members a year ago and closer to 30,000 at other times.
Jack Butland has admitted there were moments when he feared he might never play again during his lengthy rehabilitation from a fractured ankle as the goalkeeper, now restored to full fitness, targets a fifth cap in England’s forthcoming games against Scotland and France.
The Stoke City player last represented his country in the friendly win against Germany in Berlin in March 2016 but was substituted at half-time after breaking the joint just before the interval. His rehabilitation proved a protracted process and he did not feature for his club side for over a year, returning in a defeat at Swansea City in April, before starting Stoke’s final five games of the Premier League season.
“Being out for so long makes you stronger,” said Butland, whose form at club level had thrust him into direct competition with Joe Hart to be the national team’s No1 prior to his injury. “You reach your lowest point. There are times when you don’t know if you are going to play again, when the next operation or injection might be.
“So there are times when you are at rock bottom, but that’s when you need the people around you: your club, your fans, everything, from little tweets on social media just to give you that bit of reassurance, that bit of positivity …
“I feel like I’ve pretty much experienced everything I can in football. Positive things, winning, losing, the injury side of it all the setbacks. I’m sure there’s plenty more to experience but I’m prepared for whatever is next. It feels extremely, extremely good to be back. It’s been a long time and to get the Three Lions back on my chest after some difficult times is really good, so I’m just thoroughly enjoying being back and looking forward to the week ahead. The worst thing about being injured is just missing out on what you love.”
Butland’s recovery stretched to 13 months, ruling him out of Euro 2016, before he broke back into the Stoke first-team for that final handful of games. “Missing out on being part of a team … it can be a lonely place when you are injured,” he said. “You miss being out there with your team-mates and just experiencing the highs and the lows. It was the drive and belief of wanting to get back to where I was that kept me going. I wanted to make up for all the lost time, missing out on the Euros and missing so many Premier League games. It’s not nice not being able to do something you love.”
The 24-year-old, who worked regularly with Gareth Southgate in the under-21 set-up, is one of four goalkeepers in the squad for Saturday’s World Cup qualifier against Scotland and Tuesday’s friendly against France. The game at the Stade de France would appear to offer Butland the best opportunity of returning to the side, given Hart remains first-choice, with Fraser Forster and Tom Heaton also included.
“I’m wherever I can get myself to,” added Butland. “I understand that I’ve only played five Premier League games, but I feel I’ve produced really good performances in those games. Whatever rank I am going into these games at the weekend and Tuesday is what I’ll accept. I will back whoever is in front of me, or behind me, 100%.”
Michael Keane, who is absent from this squad through injury, travelled down to St George’s Park on Tuesday to attend Southgate’s team meeting with the manager keen to make the Burnley centre-half feel involved in the set-up.
Whatever Andy Murray decides to do when he stops playing tennis, queueing up for a job with either of the major parties going toe to toe for the keys to 10 Downing Street this week might not be high on his list of options. Nevertheless, the Scot – who favoured independence in the 2014 referendum and probably would do so again, if given the chance – has an acute social conscience, and he will not be joining the many millionaires in his sport who have chosen to register as tax exiles.
The world No1 – who is two wins away from reaching the French Open final for the second year in a row – spends little more than a month of the year at his home in Oxshott, the semi-rural idyll favoured by stockbrokers and City workers, so he has every excuse to move abroad. The quiet, pleasant patch of north Surrey is a half-hour drive from Wimbledon and has been a welcome retreat for him and his young family during the championships, a rare few weeks away from the hotels on the global tennis circuit.
Because of the travelling demands of his sport, Murray – who has career earnings of nearly $60m, a healthy portfolio to top that up and a luxury apartment in Miami, his winter training base – could legitimately live anywhere. Indeed, among his peers, half of the world’s top 20 have used just such circumstances to justify living in low-tax havens.
Monte Carlo is home to Novak Djokovic, Milos Raonic, Marin Cilic, Alexander Zverev, David Goffin, Grigor Dimitrov and Tomas Berdych, while Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gaël Monfils live in Switzerland, and Lucas Pouille is based in Dubai. However, as Murray said after his quick but testing win over the next “big thing” in Russian tennis, Karen Khachanov: “I like living at home. The only chance of me living somewhere else is if I had a bunch of friends or some of my family were living elsewhere and I would move to spend time with them. But I wouldn’t want to go and live somewhere not to pay any tax and not to have any of my family and friends around me. I wouldn’t do that.”
Murray always votes even though his constituency, Esher and Walton, is among the safest in the country for the Conservatives. He said he has kept an eye on the political debates before Thursday’s general election – his choice is sealed in the postal votes he and his wife, Kim, have despatched to reach the returning officer.
“We’ve watched pretty much all of them,” he said. “With the team, we watched Sky News. We didn’t watch the ITV debate, which didn’t have Corbyn or Theresa May. Then we watched the BBC one. So I’ve tried to keep up with it as much as possible.”
After his match on Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, Murray also demonstrated that he has a social conscience and sense of the wider world that sometimes escapes celebrity athletes when, as the game’s leading player, he agreed to address the crowd with a brief and moving statement about the London Bridge terrorist attack.
“I try to follow as much of what’s going on back home as I can,” he said. “When something like that happens, it doesn’t matter where it is, that gets reported. There was a terrorist attack in Manila a few days ago, but maybe it didn’t get as much coverage as stuff in Europe.”
For now, he has to direct his energies towards handling Kei Nishikori on Wednesday. “Certainly I feel fresher than last year,” Murray said. “The start of that tournament was pretty tough. I didn’t play well in the first couple of rounds and they were hard matches. I got lucky that I ended up playing [John] Isner and [Ivo] Karlovic back to back, as they were not physical matches, really, after the first couple of rounds [each of which went five sets]. I came in then playing a lot of tennis – so the body probably feels a little bit better now than it did last year.”
Nishikori, whose match against Fernando Verdasco on Monday was his third in as many days because of the shifting schedule, was right to describe the 0-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-0 scoreline as, “a little bit unusual”. He explained later: “This court’s bounce was really high, he was using very heavy forehand and I was running side to side. I couldn’t do anything first set but I tried to play a little more heavy and a little more aggressive, and it started to work a bit better. Still, it was really, really tough battle. There was so many long rallies, second and third sets. Physically, I’m OK.”
While Djokovic has soldiered on here since Monday without the attention of his celebrity coach, Andre Agassi (who left as soon as he had fulfilled commercial obligations with a coffee company), Murray is happy to be reunited with Ivan Lendl after three months. “It sounds simple but it is not,” he said of resuming the regime with his valued mentor. “A lot of the time when things are not going well you start over-thinking things. You start wanting to try new things on the practice court, changing tensions in your racket. You think all sorts of things to work out what is going wrong.
“But the one thing we did when Ivan got here, we went right back to the basics. The drills we were doing were all pretty simple drills. We spent a lot of time on the court. We hit lots of balls – no time in the gym, really. It was just tennis, plain tennis, and literally getting back to doing the basics right, making a lot of balls, making myself difficult to beat.
“And then, once you start to do that, you get through a couple of matches, you start feeling better, your confidence grows. It can be right down here [gesturing low with his hands], and it can go right up here pretty quickly. That has been the case so far this tournament.”
Murray’s midsummer high point – and a month of sleeping in his own bed – is not far away. He has already restored much of his bruised confidence after an ordinary clay-court campaign. If he does well in the second week here, he will be in the best possible heart to defend his title at Wimbledon. Home for Murray has always been where the hearth is.
The former Formula One driver Robert Kubica has completed a test with the Renault team in Spain, suggesting he may return to the sport he left in 2011.
The 32-year-old Polish driver, who also raced for the Sauber team, has not raced in F1 since a rallying accident in 2011 saw him partially sever his right arm.
Kubica completed a full race simulation in a 2012 E20 car during a private test at the Ricardo Tormo circuit in Valencia.
Renault revealed the test had taken place on Tuesday in a series of posts on Twitter. The team wrote: “It’s true. It really is Robert Kubica. Back in one of our cars after six years. So why did we keep it quiet? It was a private test, for Robert. But we can tell you this … Robert complained about grip, understeer, downforce and had the biggest smile on after his 115 laps!!”
Kubica, who won the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix for Sauber, returned to rallying after the accident and earlier this year tested a Formula E car at Donington Park.

The sight of an onrushing Sonny Bill Williams is not necessarily a thrilling one for defenders but the Lions centre Robbie Henshaw cannot wait to bump into the multi-talented All Black at Eden Park. The Irishman was a big schoolboy fan of Williams and describes the prospect of making his Lions debut against his one-time hero as “pretty surreal”.
While the multi-talented 31-year-old Williams – who has boxed professionally as well as playing both codes of rugby – is by no means the sole threat in an attack-minded Blues backline, he will be Henshaw’s direct opponent and is set to provide the 23-year-old with a good indication of where he sits in the international midfield pecking order.
A good game would also propel Henshaw within touching distance of a Lions Test jersey but swapping shirts with Williams would be almost as exciting.
“I was a big fan of his when I was a kid, whether it was performing in league or for the All Blacks,” says the physical Leinster player. “To be coming up against him is pretty surreal. It’s going to be tricky but I’m looking forward to playing against him and having a go.”
Henshaw is also vowing he and his team-mates will take the game to the provincial sides they encounter, rather than allow their hosts to take the initiative. “We need to come with an attack mentality here,” says Henshaw, who scored Ireland’s final try against the All Blacks in last autumn’s win in Chicago. “We can’t sit off and let these boys play because they can tear teams up in the blink of an eye. Our mentality is to go after these teams, show them we’re coming here to play and go after them in defence as well.”
Warren Gatland is also inviting his backs to take calculated risks – “If it’s on to throw a 60/40 offload he’s encouraging us to do that,” says Henshaw – and his players have stopped using jetlag as an excuse for sluggishness. “We have settled in nicely, we are feeling really fresh and are pretty much raring to go,” confirmed Henshaw. “That [jetlag] is out the window now.”
As someone who studied Gaelic in his youth, Henshaw has already risen to the challenge of speaking in the language to Maori elders at the squad’s official welcome in Waitangi last Sunday. After receiving some tips from his sister Ali, a primary school teacher, he fulfilled his ceremonial duties having received the nod ahead of his team-mate Tadhg Furlong. “As I played in the west of Ireland with Connacht and it’s an Irish-speaking area, I was directly in line for it,” he says. “I was asking Tadhg a couple of days before if he wanted to go for it but he had to prepare for the opening game – so I had to take it on.”
With Ben Te’o having made a promising start to the tour, the onus is now on Henshaw and his defensive partner Jared Payne, who used to play for the Blues, to keep Williams’s offloading game quiet: “It’s obviously the top, top level of the sport for us and to be in this position is unbelievable. I just want to go out there and do myself proud, do my family proud and do the best I can.”
It has also emerged the Lions will face a series of hakas before all their provincial games, in addition to the Tests and the fixture against the Maori. For the first time in the Blues’ 21-year history, the team will perform a pre-match haka entitled He Toa Takitini which translates as “(The Strength of Many)”. “All credit to the Lions for embracing the opportunity to face a haka before kick-off,” said Nigel Cass, New Zealand Rugby’s general manager.
Team New Zealand capsized during the run-in to the second race of their America’s Cup challenger semi-final against Great Britain’s Land Rover BAR in Bermuda. All crew members were later reported safe.
After winning the first race on Tuesday against Sir Ben Ainslie’s syndicate to move 3-0 ahead in the first-to-five contest, the New Zealanders were heading towards the start line under strong winds when the boat rose up on its foils and plunged forward into the water.
Ainslie said in a statement on BAR’s official Twitter feed: “In 30 years of racing it is the most full-on, exhilarating sailing I have ever had. The most important thing is that everyone is OK on Team New Zealand after their capsize. We look forward to seeing them back on the race course.”
At a press conference Ainslie added: “I am sure they will recover from that and be out racing tomorrow or the next day.” Racing is scheduled to resume on Wednesday if weather conditions permit.
BAR were awarded the win as a result of the incident, which now means they trail 3-1.
The Team New Zealand helmsman, Peter Burling, told the press conference the capsize was “was fully our error” because the crew were “trying to get off the start clean”.
Burling believes the “fair bit of damage” to the AC50 – which appeared to include a top section of the wing smashed – would not prevent his team resuming racing.
The winners are set to progress to the challenger final and whoever wins that takes on the defending champion, Team USA, for the America’s Cup itself.
In the other semi-final series Team Japan won both runs against Sweden’s Artemis Racing to move 3-1 ahead.
England have long searched for a game-breaking bowler in one-day cricket and the hope coming into the Champions Trophy was that the fast but physically fragile Mark Wood would be Eoin Morgan’s trump card in this regard.
In keeping with his career to date figures of nine overs, one for 32 may not leap off the page but the 87-run win over New Zealand – one that booked England’s place in the semi-finals and now gives them a free-hit to knock out Australia at Edgbaston on Saturday – certainly swung on a crucial intervention from the Durham quick.
Kane Williamson appeared locked on a course that would steer his side to their target of 311. Sat on 87 in the 31st over and with the score 158 for two, New Zealand’s ice-cool captain had ridden an early storm that included a fierce Liam Plunkett bouncer to the side of the head and looked primed to settle matters.
But Wood, thrown the ball after a groan-inducing opening spell that saw him repeatedly beat the bat, got a cross-seam delivery to rear and flick the captain’s thumb on the way through to the diving Jos Buttler behind the stumps, with the wild celebrations revealing the value of New Zealand’s prize scalp.
As well as summing up the importance of Wood to the makeup of England’s attack, the wicket of Williamson also neatly encapsulated the challenge thrown up by the Cardiff pitch. Certainly the batsman himself, a player seldom prone to offering emotion, was left shaking his head at the apparent sorcery it had thrown up even if, after the match, he had praise for the bowler.
“He’s a very good bowler,” said Williamson. “He’s unique in the fact that he bowls at such good pace, off maybe a five-metre, 10-metre run-up, which you don’t see too much around the world. And he’s performed very well for England over a period of time, especially coming back after injury. He is certainly a strength of their bowling attack.”
This was billed as the pioneers of modern one-day cricket versus the monsters they created following the World Cup two years ago. Instead it became something of a scrap and though the short straight boundaries may have been inviting, the two-paced surface meant the long ones square could not always be cleared.
There was still time for some Buttler magic, the highlight of which was his outrageously audacious ramped six towards the river
A strong wind howled all day on the banks of the river Taff too, such that bowlers frequently aborted their run-ups, the bails took on a life of their own and the umpire Bruce Oxenford – he of the bulletproof arm shield – saw his fedora fly from his head and over the ever-moving boundary rope for four.
The flags on top of the pavilion – at half-mast for the victims of the London Bridge attacks on Saturday, for whom a minute’s silence was observed half an hour into play – were horizontal for the duration of the match, as the trees that line the ground swayed like drunken festival-goers, and spectators huddled in overcoats.
The batting they witnessed from England was a curate’s egg, in that they passed 300 in the first innings for the 11th time in their last 13 attempts batting first and yet still it seemed like runs had been left behind, with not one top-order batsmen kicking on to three figures. Had it not been for Buttler’s unbeaten 48-ball 61, it might have fallen distinctly below par.
A glance at Buttler’s strike-rate of 127 would suggest him simply putting on his latest clinic in power-hitting. Instead this was more workmanlike, in his own way, as New Zealand’s attack began slamming the ball into the surface at varying speeds to leave the batsman needing to force the issue.
The situation in which Buttler found himself, with England 188 for four in the 34th over after Joe Root’s Welsh drag-on with 64 to his name, was in many ways tailor-made for his talents, and yet it was not until his 24th ball faced that a boundary came.
Among the hustled ones and twos there was still some of the Buttler magic, the highlight of which was his ramped six towards the river that was outrageously audacious in its execution. With their wicketkeeper now up and running, it means Jason Roy remains the one piece of the batting jigsaw still causing heads to be scratched among the England management.
Morgan, speaking after the match, said the no-lose nature of Saturday’s match against Australia would see him likely granted a stay of execution. Another walk across the stumps, such as those in his last two dismissals, would test the captain’s previous backing of the opener for the entire tournament.
When the Wallabies play Fiji in Melbourne on Saturday the majority of players on the field will be of Pacific Islander descent. Obviously, the Fijians are Pacific Islanders, but 18 members of the Wallabies’ 34-man squad are of Pacific Islander descent,though centre Samu Kerevi, who was one of seven Fijians, has withdrawn following an ankle injury.
At present, there is also a decent percentage of Pacific Islanders playing for the All Blacks, while there is even a sprinkling in the British and Irish Lions, plus the English, French and Japanese national teams. It raises the a question for the game on a global level: are the Pacific Island nations just becoming nurseries for the top cashed-up countries in world rugby?
It is not as if Australia, at least, is actively poaching lots of Pacific Island players, but the talent is still finding its way to these shores. The vast majority of the Pacific Islanders in the Wallabies squad are the Australian-born sons of migrants, or migrated to Australia at a young age.
In this sense they are no different to Wallabies flanker Michael Hooper, who is the son of English migrants. But there is a key difference. England has a population of 53 million, while Fiji, for example, has a population of less than one million (892,000).
Rugby is hugely popular in the Pacific Islands, but the populations and broadcast revenues in the nations which comprise it are not big enough to create the professional infrastructure needed to keep their best players at home. As a result the national teams of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga have not really progressed very far since the inaugural World Cup in 1987.
Significantly, Pacific Island teams – Fiji (1987) and Western Samoa (1991 and 1995) – reached the quarter-finals in the first three amateur World Cups, but only one (Fiji in 2007) has made the top eight of the tournament in the professional era.
The performance of the Pacific Island nations is at odds with the enormous contribution players of Pacific Island descent have made to the game around the world. Under rugby’s eligibility laws, once a player has played for one country he cannot play for another even if he was eligible by birth or parentage.
World Rugby recently increased the residency period for Test eligibility from three years to five years in an attempt to dissuade major countries from poaching Pacific Island players, but this just means scouts will identify talent at an earlier age.
One practical way to help the Pacific Islanders become more competitive is to allow players who are no longer required to play for their adopted countries to return to their nation of origin or descent. Too often Pacific Island players are capped by a major country, play a few Tests and are never seen again on the international stage.
A recent example is giant Tongan-born second rower Sitaleki Timani, the older brother of Lopeti, who played 18 Tests for the Wallabies between 2011 and 2013, but has not been required since. Timani, 30, started for Clermont in their 22-16 win against Toulon in the final of the French Top 14 last Sunday.
Former Wallabies captain Mark Ella has told Guardian Australia he thinks that letting players return to representing their Pacific Island nation of origin could work. “In principle I agree with it as long as their focus is on their nation of origin,” Ella says. “They could add value and help build the reputation of the Pacific Island teams. I would have no problem with that.”
Which leaves a slightly more awkward question. Does the world of rugby really want to help the Pacific Island nations, or is it afraid they could become too competitive?
Eoin Morgan heaped praise on his bowlers after England’s 87-run victory over New Zealand sealed a Champions Trophy semi-final berth and a chance to knock rivals Australia out of the tournament in their final group game at Edgbaston on Saturday.
Morgan saw the wickets shared among his attack as New Zealand were bowled out for 223 in 44.3 overs chasing 311 for the win, with Liam Plunkett picking up four for 55 to top the figures.
Jake Ball, who was named man of the match, and the returning Adil Rashid picked up two apiece, while Mark Wood’s removal of Kane Williamson for 87 was pivotal.
“I thought they did an outstanding job” said Morgan. “They were truly the highlight of the day. Our batting performance was probably par or below par, pretty average, so I thought the bowlers as a collective unit were brilliant, really.” On the batting, which saw Joe Root top score with 64 but England bowled out for 310 with three balls to spare, Morgan added: “I thought we looked like we were getting about 340 at one stage, but we fell away, which is disappointing. But the fact that we’re still trying to win games with the bat, regardless of the situation that we’re in, I think is testament to the team. We’re staying true to what we believe in and what we’ve achieved over the last couple of years.”
Asked what approach his side will take into the Australia match, given they have now won Group A, Morgan replied: “A very serious attitude. We never take any opposition for granted. I think if we’re truly going to be contenders for this tournament, we need to beat the best teams and Australia are one of the best teams.”
Williamson, who escaped a ban for his side’s slow over rate but was docked 40% of his match fee to go with 20% for his players, had few complaints over the result and admitted England’s attack simply made better use of the two-paced pitch.
“A credit to the way England bowled,” Williamson said. “They got a lot out of the surface. They bowled very consistently, and made life difficult for us with the bat. Maybe the pitch changed just a fraction but they exploited it by cross seamers hitting the wicket hard. They’re all big lads, and they pretty much hit that six-metre length and created a little variability out of the surface. They didn’t give us much at all, to be fair.”
Chris Woakes, meanwhile, has revealed he is likely to miss England’s first Test of the summer, with the injury that ended his tournament against Bangladesh last Thursday revealed to be a grade-two tear in his left side that will take up to six weeks of recovery.
England take on South Africa at Lord’s on 8 June – Joe Root’s first Test as captain – and Woakes said: “I’m probably up against it. Sometimes these things heal quicker, sometimes they take longer, so we have to play it by ear. You can’t rush back – if you do, it can just ping again. The timing of it is frustrating, it’s terrible, but it’s one of those things.”
Rain and wind scudded through Paris on day 10 of the 2017 French Open, punching a three-hour hole in the schedule, but it was worth the wait for the combustible but talented teenager Jelena Ostapenko, and the Swiss outsider, Timea Bacsinszky, who will meet in the semi-finals on Thursday. As it happens they share a birthday that day, which is taking Hollywood scriptwriting to absurdity.
Ostapenko, who turns 20 on the biggest day of her career, said after beating Caroline Wozniacki in three sets: “It was tough because we had to go away two times from the court and Caroline is such a tough opponent. It’s great to play here on my birthday. I am really going to enjoy it.”
Bacsinszky, who is 28 on match day, finally got the better of the French favourite Kristina Mladenovic, 17 places ahead of her in the rankings at 14, having led 6-4, 1-1 before they departed Court Philippe Chatrier around 3.30pm. On resumption she held her nerve to close out the second set for the loss of a further three games over a full course of an hour and 49 minutes.
She said: “We had all the seasons in one day today – there was a storm, sunshine and I think even snow! It was very tough and to keep concentration was very difficult. I am exhausted.”
On Court Suzanne Lenglen, Wozniacki should have had – on ranking, experience, pedigree and sentiment – the beating of the not-quite-so-popular Ostapenko (who had an infamous bust-up with Britain’s Naomi Broady in New Zealand last year), but the precocious Latvian showed enormous cool to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.
The former British No1 Annabel Croft said of Ostapenko: “She reminds me of a young Monica Seles. She hits the line time and time again.”
At several points on Tuesdayyesterday it looked as if there would not be a single completed match as wave after wave of windswept rain thrashed through Roland Garros.
Unfortunately for the men, there was no space left in the day for the quarter-finals between Rafael Nadal, still the outright favourite, and his Spanish compatriot Pablo Carreño Busta, or the match between Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem, whom the second seed beat out of sight in the semi-finals in Rome two weekends ago.
The forecast for Wednesday is fine, so they should have no problem completing their obligations and still have a day’s rest before the semi-finals on Friday. In the other men’s quarters on Wednesday Andy Murray plays Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka, the No3 seed, takes on Marin Cilic.
In a tournament that has had controversy lurking like a cloud, the outspoken Australian Pat Cash entered the fray with a few harsh words for Murray’s coach, Ivan Lendl. “He is by far the most annoying person in the locker room that I have ever met in my life,” Cash said on Eurosport.
The former Wimbledon champion added: “And I’m not joking. First of all he’s got really bad jokes, they’re just horrendous, and he’s really loud. Certainly during my career he was always the loudest, he was like the king of the jungle.
“There was always a bit of chest-thumping going on amongst various players, and certain players liked that. Ivan was just one of those guys. He was always making fun of somebody or picking on you and that was his way of putting you down – you probably wouldn’t be surprised to hear that I gave a lot back as well.
“But he is the complete opposite [to what you see on TV]. I’ve been down in the locker room today a fair bit and Ivan was doing the same thing, telling jokes. It’s kind of cool because it keeps it very light and he’s not quite as loud as he used to be.
“It keeps it light and the players can relax and of course Andy’s got a full team there. Mark Bender [his physio] is there and he’s very easygoing. You need people like that. But, when it comes down to business, they get on with it. They don’t mess around. They’re a very professional team.”
England became the first side to secure a semi-final berth in the Champions Trophy by defeating New Zealand in conditions that would have had gnarled old yachtsmen scrambling for the shore and abandoned umbrellas flying off to the next county. That semi-final will take place in Cardiff on 14 June. Before that there is the small matter of a group game against Australia at Edgbaston on Saturday. Another victory there would send the Australians home.
Here, England won by 87 runs. Having batted competently to post 310 they bowled and fielded with superb discipline and intelligence, as polished a performance as they have delivered this season, especially since this was their most important match of the summer.
The pace bowlers, who were often blown off course in their approach to the wicket, were bang on target and brimful of intent. They even discovered an uneven patch just short of a length which made a few deliveries misbehave on what had hitherto been regarded as a blameless surface. At last the poor bowlers had something to aim at.
Critically one of those mischievous deliveries was directed at Kane Williamson and it would produce the key dismissal. Williamson had batted calmly for 87 and New Zealand, on 158 for two, were on course when Mark Wood ran up to bowl. The Kiwi captain, disconcerted by steep bounce, ended up gloving the ball to Jos Buttler behind the stumps; he left staring angrily at the surface, a signal that would not have a benign effect on his dressing room.
Now England seized their chance magnificently. They sensed the Kiwi batsmen had started to mistrust the pitch –Liam Plunkett had already caused some consternation when hitting Williamson on the helmet and Ross Taylor on the hand – and they gave them no respite. Jake Ball, who had started with two maidens, was as unrelenting as his senior partners and ended up as the man of the match. Ben Stokes, though a little more expensive, was hostile and appeared to bowl without pain. Morgan asked him to bowl eight overs. He would probably have bowled 10 if the match had gone the distance.
Adil Rashid, restored to the side, bowled as well as he has ever done in this format in conditions that offered him very little assistance. He is now surely in England’s best side even if the opponents are from Asia. After Williamson’s departure England’s out-cricket was flawless except for a spurned caught and bowled chance by Rashid. None of the Kiwis could threaten and the wickets fell in a flurry.
It ended up as a stroll yet at the halfway stage England’s total felt respectable but not invincible. Their innings never quite took off but it was never completely grounded either. In these conditions it was remarkable that the quality of the cricket from both sides was so high. At times the gusts reached 50mph, treacherously buffeting bowlers, while it was tricky for the batsmen to stand still.
Sometimes the electronic advertising hoardings were blown over; so too were the triangular covers stationed over the boundary ropes, which were often tossed infield. At least the gales blew away the rain.
As a consequence the game was almost unrecognisable, especially when the bowling was from the Taff end. The boundary there is perilously short even in normal conditions so later in the innings the Kiwi bowlers tried to take the straight hit out of the equation. Hence they bowled a succession of bouncers, fast and slow, so that the batsmen had to hit towards the long boundary and crucially into the wind. Given the exploits of the England bowlers from that end later in the day they might have been better advised to bang the ball in on a length more frequently in pursuit of some of the uneven bounce found by Plunkett and Wood.
The England batsmen, marshalled by Buttler at the end, gleaned their runs pragmatically, apart from a barren last over. They might have scored more but every time a promising partnership was about to flourish a wicket fell.
That even applied during the opening partnership since Jason Roy lasted a little longer than usual. He was there for eight overs and 13 runs before trying something extravagant against Adam Milne. He shimmied to the offside, prematurely leaving his leg stump exposed and that is where the ball ended up. Roy departed in a fury, presumably at his own premeditation. There can be no guarantees that he keeps his place against Australia.
Thereafter England were indebted to significant rather than major contributions from Alex Hales, Joe Root, Stokes and Buttler. As at The Oval against Bangladesh, Hales was dismissed straight after hitting a six, something for him to ponder.
Root purred as usual, caressing two sixes off the left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner, in the knowledge that he only had to clear mid-on. In his partnership with Stokes he was frequently denied the strike (he faced 15 balls to Stokes’s 37) and this seemed to upset his rhythm. He was bowled off his inside edge, almost his first false shot.
Stokes, who hit some wonderfully crisp boundaries, in between the dots was caught at third man and then Buttler did his stuff. In fact he was not as fluent as usual; his first boundary came from his 24th delivery and that was an edge over the keeper, but he was never becalmed. Later another shot from Buttler headed over Luke Ronchi behind the stumps but this one was intentional: a preposterous ramp over his shoulder off Trent Boult nearly struck a cameraman high above the sightscreen, who up until then had thought that the gusting wind was his biggest threat.
British Cycling is poised to sever its last remaining physical ties with Team Sky by asking the professional squad to move out of the Manchester velodrome which they have used as a shared home for the past seven years.
Board members at British Cycling are understood to have pushed for a discernible split between the two organisations which have shared a base and personnel since Team Sky were founded in 2010. They believe it would be a significant move in the battle to restore British Cycling’s reputation, with an announcement expected early next week.
The closeness of the two has been the source of great consternation during the past 14 months as each lurched from one damaging episode to another.
While British Cycling was fighting claims of a culture of favouritism and bullying made by the sprint rider Jess Varnish, it was also dragged into the crisis surrounding Team Sky, Sir Bradley Wiggins and a mystery medical package delivered to the rider at the end of the Critérium du Dauphiné race in June 2011.
While Team Sky also have bases in France and Belgium they still rent office space from British Cycling at the velodrome on the outskirts of Manchester which its director of business operations, Fran Millar, uses and where the team principal, Sir Dave Brailsford, regularly holds meetings.
But this is likely to come to an end after various British Cycling stakeholders determined a divide to be the best way forward. Team Sky are thought to be looking for another location in Manchester to set up home.
Brailsford was the architect of both teams’ successes, forming Team Sky on the back of British Cycling’s huge medal haul at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Initially they shared medical personnel and facilities, intellectual property and mechanics.
By early 2010 it was deemed necessary to instruct the consultancy firm Deloitte at a cost of £40,000, shared by UK Sport and British Cycling, to conduct a review into possible conflicts of interest. It determined there was a benefit to Olympic and Paralympic riders from their relationship with the Sky programme. In many ways that has proved to be accurate, with British cyclists continuing to dominate on the world stage in the velodrome and on the roads.
But the questions about whether the relationship with the media conglomerate left publicly funded British Cycling compromised have endured. For the past eight years Sky have given £2.5m a year in sponsorship to British Cycling. Some of that has been used to develop mass-participation cycling but a chunk has also gone towards supporting the Olympic team, who won eight gold medals at London 2012 and six in Rio in 2016.
Last year Sky dropped its backing for the participation programme and was replaced by HSBC but continue to back the professional Team Sky programme, standing by Brailsford and the riders amid a range of controversies.
British Cycling insists it no longer shares personnel with Team Sky and that any joint resources have been drastically scaled back over the past three years. But there is still a presence of Team Sky riders at the velodrome.
A UK anti-doping investigation into the mystery Jiffy bag package delivered to Wiggins, which took 1,000 man hours, twice led to the medical room at the velodrome in east Manchester being raided by investigators in searches for evidence.
Damian Collins, the chair of the culture, media and sport committee, said the saga left the reputations of both organisations “in tatters”. It emerged that Dr Richard Freeman, who divided his time between the two teams for a period, had received the package.
Simon Cope, a British Cycling women’s team coach at the time, dropped his other responsibilities and drove to France with the Jiffy bag, working on a freelance basis for Team Sky. A sizeable quantity of the controversial corticosteroid triamcinolone, at the centre of the story, had also been ordered into British Cycling’s medicine cabinet.
The blurred relationship between the two was heavily criticised by Collins and his select committee colleagues, and the British Cycling chairman, Jonathan Browning, said this year it would be subject of further examination. He said at the time: “There are some areas where there will be benefit of supporting each other and sharing but they need to be very clearly defined and boundaries drawn between the two organisations. I would characterise the separation as substantial now.
“There is still contact between the two organisations and there are no individuals with dual roles, but we are going to step back and look at it again to make sure we avoid any potential conflict of interest.”
The Ukad probe into the mystery Jiffy bag continued to rumble on. The Guardian understands Ukad investigators working on the case travelled to Manchester to meet with the former British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton on Tuesday.
The final report into claims of sexism and discrimination at British Cycling made by Varnish and other riders is due to be published next week after six months of delays and the Ukad investigation into the triamcinolone allegations continues.
Romelu Lukaku says remaining at Everton next season “is not really an option” and suggested his agent has reached an agreement over personal terms with a rival club, believed to be Chelsea, as he seeks to make his mark with a team in the Champions League.
The striker, who began Belgium’s friendly victory over Czech Republic on Monday in the run-up to a World Cup qualifier in Estonia on Friday, cast his future into doubt at Goodison Park in March when he confirmed he had rejected a lucrative new contract.
He has now stated his intention is to leave this summer though Everton will seek £100m for the services for a player who is contracted for a further two years, a world record fee Chelsea will be reluctant to pay for a forward they sold for £28m in 2014.
Yet, while he has also attracted tentative interest from Manchester United and Bayern Munich, Lukaku’s heart is set on a return to Stamford Bridge with the onus now effectively on the Premier League champions to negotiate a deal with his current club.
“Staying at Everton is not really an option for next season,” the striker said. “I am staying calm about everything. There is nothing concrete with another club at the moment, but my agent is busy discussing things. I’m not going to make big declarations on my future, but I know where I want to play: in a club who are competing in the Champions League and can win titles in England. Staying in England is best for me. I know the competition, and I’ve almost reached 100 goals in the league, which is a milestone I want to achieve.
“The Premier League is a dream for me, but I also want to win the Champions League, the FA Cup and other prizes. I don’t want to stay at the same level. I want to improve, and I know where I want to do that.
“My agent is now talking to a club. I know where I want to go, so I’ll just stay patient. I know meetings have been arranged, so I’m just waiting for a call. We are now in discussions with the club. We’ll see what happens.”
Lukaku conducted a number of interviews on Monday night and Tuesday, including one in English to Sky Sports in which he added: “My agent knows what’s going to happen and I know as well. I’m staying calm and we have an agreement with the club as well.
“We have a direction where we want to go. I’m just going to rest for a few days and then just prepare for next season. I want to put the time in on my holiday to take everything to another level and be better than I was last year.”
It remains to be seen whether compromise can be reached between Chelsea and Everton over a fee or, indeed, if the Premier League champions still prioritise Lukaku’s purchase if Diego Costa is to remain at the club next season.
The Spain forward is resisting the chance to move to the Chinese Super League, where Tianjin Quanjian were initially prepared to pay £76m for his services, with his preference very much a return to Atlético Madrid instead. However the Spanish club are currently operating under an incoming transfer ban and will not be able to sign players until January 2018.
The Miami-Dade Commission voted on Tuesday to approve a deal to sell David Beckham’s group nearly three acres of county land, representing a major hurdle cleared in the former England and Manchester United star’s push to bring a Major League Soccer team to the city.
The commissioners voted nine to four in favor to ratify a recommendation by the mayor to sell Beckham’s partnership a county truck-depot at the corner of Northwest Sixth Street and Sixth Avenue, which would become the last piece in a nine-acre site for a planned 25,000-seat stadium on the Miami River.
“By purchasing the last piece of land needed for our privately-funded stadium, Miami Beckham United (MBU) is achieving another major milestone on the way to Major League Soccer formally awarding Miami a franchise,” read a statement from MBU. “[The group has] assembled a world-class team of partners, presented a vision for building the premier soccer club in the Americas, and assembled the land needed to build our stadium. Now is the time for MLS to move forward in helping us deliver the soccer club that Miami has been waiting for.”
Beckham’s group will pay just over $9 million for the last piece of land. It has already paid $19 million for the other six acres needed. Beckham’s group says the planned stadium would be privately funded, and the stadium would also be subject to county property tax.
It’s a major development in what has been at times an arduously slow – and often frustrating – process for the English soccer icon and his plans for Miami. MLS has not officially awarded Miami an expansion franchise, because of the lack of a land and stadium deal.
A contract he signed in 2007 with the Los Angeles Galaxy gave Beckham the right to start an expansion franchise for $25 million, and in 2013 he picked Miami as where he would want to put a team. The plan has changed many times along the way, most notably because he was unable to get waterfront land that his group first coveted for a stadium site.
“I will tell you this is probably the best site we have found, for many respects,” Beckham group attorney Neisen Kasdin said, before listing reasons that include the site’s proximity to several modes of public transportation and the Miami River.
The vote in Miami on Beckham’s land deal was preceded by several members of the community urging commissioners to vote no, mostly citing noise and traffic concerns.
“This land has been an eyesore for years. ... Something needs to be done with it, now,” said commissioner Audrey Edmonson, who represents the neighborhood where the stadium is planned.
The deal that allowed the Miami Marlins to get a new taxpayer-built ballpark on the former Orange Bowl site is still the source of major contention for the city and the county. There’s also skepticism about the Beckham group’s plan to build a stadium with no on-site parking, with plans instead to rely on shuttles, walking and public transportation.
“As far as sports deals go with the county, this one isn’t so bad,” commissioner Joe Martinez said.
Beckham is not the only soccer name pursuing MLS expansion these days; Landon Donovan has joined the ownership group that is hoping to bring a team to San Diego.
It has not been easy going for either.
The victory for Beckham came just one day after San Diego’s city council decided not to finance a special election that would have brought plans of building a new soccer complex there to a vote. In a pair of tweets, Donovan wrote that “we have to respect the process” and that “just because we’re down at halftime doesn’t mean we stop trying.”
Much has changed for Lizzie Deignan since her victory in the 2016 Women’s Tour. Twelve months ago she was still Lizzie Armitstead – before her marriage in September to the Irish racer Philip Deignan – she was wearing the rainbow jersey of the world road race champion and, most notably, she was racing under the threat of a two-year suspension having just been given a provisional third “strike” for infringements of the whereabouts system.
The first of the three strikes was overturned in late July 2016 by the court of arbitration for sport, so she was not banned in the end, but Deignan has described how hard she found it to compete and appear in front of the public with her fate still to be decided. She also explained that, given UK Anti-Doping had yet to confirm that strike from early June, she felt she had no choice but to ride.
“By the end of the Women’s Tour this year I will be strike-free, which is nice, but that whole period is a blur. It feels like old news now. I’m supposed to have come to terms with it, but there will always be two camps – people who believe in me and those who don’t,” says Deignan.
“I’m getting there, I’m not totally back to normal, I’m always on the look-out for the next drama. I’m reluctant to get too comfortable. I’m lucky that within our sport there is always a race just around the corner. No one ever asks me about it in Europe, but I’m asked a lot by the UK press.”
Rather than being based in Monaco as usual, Deignan has spent the past month in England building towards her home Tour following victory in the 122km Women’s Tour of Yorkshire on 29 April. “It’s been really good. The terrain is relentless so I’ve been slogging away. I’ve just been building a base after the spring,” she says. “Hopefully the Women’s Tour will give me some speed ahead of the national championships. I’ll be looking to come out stronger than I go in.”
As last year, she will start as favourite on a course which again includes a hilly stage on the Saturday after three days on the rolling roads of the Midlands and Cotswolds but she admits to being concerned about the threatening form of last year’s runner-up, the South African Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio.
Deignan’s Yorkshire win ended a spring in which she scored three second places to her team-mate Anna van der Breggen in the triptych of Ardennes Classics – Flèche Wallonne, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Amstel Gold.
“I was definitely struggling at the start of the season with illness, and it was hard because I was so successful the year before. We had dual leadership in the Ardennes, we dominated and each time Anna went for it so we couldn’t ask for more as a team. I have to learn to attack after she does as each time I’d attack, I’d be brought back, then Anna would go for it.”
Van der Breggen repaid Deignan with strong support in the Yorkshire race, which she describes as “really important. It had live television all the way through so we could showcase what we do, how [her team] Boels-Dolmans do our job. It was a very special win because all my friends and family were there and I knew the roads. Normally attacking from 50 kilometres out is crazy but I knew what the roads would be doing to the riders behind me.”
After this week, Deignan’s priority will be taking a second world title in September on a course in Bergen which she feels suits her, having visited it in early May. “I liked it, it’s a hard climb to do eight times.” There in Norway she will be reunited with a Great Britain team for which she has had hard words in the past. She has not yet heard from the new performance director, Stephen Parks, but appears to have built a good working relationship with Julian Winn, the coach who looked after the Great Britain women in the run-in to the 2008 Beijing Games.
In the four editions since its inception in 2014 the Women’s Tour has gradually moved towards maturity, working from the principle that in terms of prize money and logistical back-up – such as hotel accommodation – women cyclists should be given precisely the same treatment as their male counterparts.
It now again shares a title sponsor with the men’s race, OVO Energy, the stages have been lengthened and last year it was routed over the Peak District to test the field to the full, an experiment which is repeated on Saturday.
This year’s innovation is a circuit race in central London on Sunday using the same extended course used in the past by the men’s Tour of Britain, which is unlikely to change the final outcome, but will provide a valuable showcase. The final hurdle is British Cycling’s unwillingness to let the organisers extend the event to seven days, thinking which could seem distinctly backward if this week’s race is a success.
Turkey’s captain, Arda Turan, has announced that he is quitting the team following a bust-up with a reporter on the flight back from a friendly international in Macedonia.
The Barcelona midfielder admitted he had made a mistake while representing his country, and was ending a career with the national team after 94 caps and 17 goals. But he said he did not regret the clash with Milliyet reporter on the flight after Turkey drew 0-0 on Monday, saying Bilal Mese had insulted him during the Euro 2016 tournament in France.
The broadcaster CNN Turk quoted Mese as saying Turan attacked him shortly after boarding the plane, hurling insults and swinging punches at him despite being restrained by another journalist, a security guard and team personnel. Mese said he would take legal action against Turan.
“At first I thought he was joking … Then, one of his punches swung by,” CNN Turk quoted Mese as saying.
Commenting on the events on the flight to Slovenia, where Turkey will train before a World Cup qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday, Turan said the reporter had spread rumours and insulted his family values while covering Euro 2016.
He said: “I made a mistake while wearing the national team uniform. It was something that should not have happened on the national team plane,” he said. “Do I regret it? No, I feel like a bird because I never forgot what was said about me.
“I am putting an end to my national team career. I am speaking as someone who has served at every level of the national team, who loves his country and is in love with this jersey.”
Turan was widely criticised for a disappointing performance at Euro 2016. The the 30-year-old joined Barcelona from Atlético Madrid in July 2015.
Turkey are fourth in the World Cup qualifying Group I with eight points from five matches, five adrift of the leaders Croatia and two behind second-placed Iceland.
Only three players in the Premier League have the ability, when at their awesome best, to make everyone else on the pitch look like immature creatures, toddlers trying and failing to compete with giants. Two of those players are on the wane – Yaya Touré and Zlatan Ibrahimovic – but the other should be approaching his prime. If Liverpool sign Virgil van Dijk they will be making the ultimate upgrade to their team.
On one level it could be argued that to splurge £60m or thereabouts on any player is to blare a huge scouting or coaching failure, since a really savvy club might be able find or develop a less obvious solution. But in terms of forking out for a surefire success, there is no better signing than Van Dijk that Jürgen Klopp could make to improve his rickety defence, no single purchase that could demonstrate more clearly Liverpool’s determination to clamber back atop that long-vacated perch.
Doubts about the seriousness of that ambition gained traction recently as the club’s apparent willingness to make do with half-cocked solutions suggested that their American owners might be satisfied with becoming the new Arsenal, full of tempered hope rather than true-blooded conviction. Signing Van Dijk would dispel such a notion. Of course if Van Dijk really has set his heart on a move to Anfield, then failing to complete the deal now, especially due to gauche antagonisation of the potential seller, would make the new Arsenal tag so apt that Liverpool might as well bang a cannon on their crest.
Van Dijk was majestic at Celtic and has been regal at Southampton, where, as soon as he arrived two years ago, he assumed a lordly guise, healing everyone who pined for Toby Alderweireld. Powerful, fast and perceptive, he dominates in the air and on the ground, often with seemingly effortless grace. Simon Mignolet and Liverpool’s defenders have seemed locked into the opposite of a symbiotic relationship, a mutually debilitating bind in which the flaws of each sap the confidence of the other and ensnare the lot of them in a vicious circle of decrepitude. Van Dijk is commanding enough to break that chain and impose order and confidence. That does not mean, of course, that Liverpool would not benefit from enriching their squad with a goalkeeper and left-back as solid as Fraser Forster and Ryan Bertrand respectively, but Van Dijk’s arrival would make such additions less urgent.
Liverpool badly need a wholesome meat-and-potatoes centre-back, a stalwart who excels at defending’s fundamentals. Picture Mamadou Sakho on a good day. Now picture Sakho having a good day nearly every day. But Van Dijk is much more than that. He is that most precious of talents, a ball-playing centre-back of the sort that John Stones can supposedly become, a stopper who also creates. He can sashay forward with even more finesse than Joël Matip and, to boot, is a potent aerial threat from set pieces and can even take a mean free-kick. Whether in a back three or a back four, he could be Liverpool’s answer to David Luiz, and more.
If Van Dijk is sincere about wanting to join Liverpool despite more lucrative offers from elsewhere, that speaks well of his character and that of Klopp. It suggests that he distinguishes between merely winning and winning gloriously, being a champion and a hero. At Liverpool his aim would be to become a leader in the team who satisfy one of English football’s most intense cravings, that generation-long yearning for the restoration of their domestic crown, and maybe their European one too. Nothing he could achieve at Chelsea or Manchester City could beat that.
If Southampton were to be seen to sell Van Dijk without a fight, meanwhile, then that, on the back of so many other sales, would confirm that they have different ambitions. To be acclaimed as canny scouts and developers would appear to be enough for them, and would make them, in one sense, a definitive success story of the Premier League age: expert and very well-paid middle men.
Sometimes the transfer market resembles one of the more elaborate submissions for the Turner Art Prize, as if conceived primarily for shock value rather than any reasonable standard of beauty or efficacy. One day it will be revealed that Mesut Özil’s Arsenal contract was created from microscopic reproductions of Dr Crippen’s moustache, that the fee Manchester United paid for Paul Pogba was delivered to Juventus entirely in the form of pickled sharks, and that David Luiz’s’s towels are fashioned out of kitten eyebrows interweaved with hyper-absorbent rhino ear-hair. Meanwhile an entire wing of the Tate Modern will be dedicated to the works of Mino Raiola, where men with metal-rimmed glasses and hipster beards will stroke their chins pensively while discussing, on a vaguely related theme, whether it is indeed the case that the first two initials in JMW Turner’s name stood for Jorge Mendes.
It is currently hard to tell if Virgil van Dijk is actually still a footballer, or some kind of installation who exists only to provoke debate and controversy. Is he staying or going? What is his value? What is value anyway? If a footballer’s “price” in the “market” is a reflection of his on-field performances, how has Van Dijk’s managed to rise by £20m over the last five months, when he has been knacked for four-and-a-half of them? Does he intend to join Manchester City, Chelsea, Everton, Arsenal or Liverpool, or to remain in Southampton? Is harmony achieved in the composition through formal, asymmetrical, or intuitive balance devices?
The story in brief: 13 months ago the Dutchman penned a new six-year contract with Southampton, legally tying himself to the club until his early 30s. “I’m so pleased, I’m so happy,” he trousered. “The club is growing and I definitely want to grow with them, that’s how I feel. Hopefully we can make it happen.” Now he feels he has outgrown them, while the only thing he still hopes to make happen is a move to Liverpool. His six-year contract quelled transfer speculation for less than six months, by which time rumours had started proliferating like rats in a particularly fetid sewer. According to the national press in January, Southampton were valuing him at £50m, in May at £60m and in June at £70m, while chairman Ralph Krueger publicly insisted all along he was going nowhere. “Virgil is committed to us for a long time,” he said in February, “and we don’t see anything but that in our future.”
In the last 24 hours widespread media reports have claimed Van Dijk has decided to join Liverpool “because”, to quote the Mirror, “of the vision Jürgen Klopp sold to the defender”. Southampton read these reports with arched eyebrows, in the belief that the only people actually permitted to sell Van Dijk anything to do with vision would be opticians and double glazing salesmen, and then they phoned the Premier League and said something along the lines of, “Oi”. The Premier League is investigating.
And thus we are presented with another summer Southampton-Liverpool transfer saga, which will be welcomed by fans of seminal 2014 pieces “Adam Lallana” and “Dejan Lovren”, the 2015 conceptual work “Nathaniel Clyne” and 2016’s “Sadio Mané”, but which others will inevitably consider somewhat derivative. Sure, it’s not groundbreaking, but in The Fiver’s view compared with the artist’s previous work the composition on this occasion is more refined, the colours more vibrant, and yet it still conveys the same essential message which – and our art appreciation isn’t always up to much but we think we’ve got the measure of this one – is something along the lines of: “Dear God please make it stop.”
“I loved him. He was everything that you want in a Newcastle player. Life is not fair sometimes and I will remember Cheick Tioté as a giant of a midfielder whom I loved to manage” – former Magpies manager Alan Pardew on the desperately sad news of the Ivorian’s death, at the age of 30, after reportedly suffering a heart attack while training with Beijing Enterprises in China.

Three Michigan State football players have been charged with criminal sexual conduct in connection with an incident that occurred on campus in January.
Arrests warrants signed Tuesday by an Ingham County judge name Donnie Corley, Demetric Vance and Josh King. It was not clear when they would be arraigned.
Corley and Vance face third-degree criminal sexual conduct. King is charged with first- and third-degree criminal sexual conduct and distributing an image of an unclothed person. King is alleged to have forced the woman into sex acts in a bathroom before inviting Corley and Vance into the room separately, where she was forced into oral sex.
Coach Mark Dantonio says all three players have been dismissed from the football program. They had already been suspended from the program in February after the school became aware of the allegations. “Sexual assault has no place in our community, and I want to share my deep concern for the young woman affected and her family,” said Dantonio via statement.
“This is an extremely challenging situation that we have taken very seriously and has affected everyone in this program. The high standards I have established for this program will not change, and the values that we teach to everyone in this program will be enforced. I expect all of our players and staff to conduct themselves in a manner that reflect the ideals of this university.”
Four of the 20 football players who joined Michigan State as freshmen in 2016 have now been charged with sexual assault. Auston Robertson was charged over an alleged rape in April and was dismissed from the program. Karen Truszkowski, who is representing King, Vance and Corley’s alleged victim, said that the school’s internal investigation had not looked at whether sexual assault was endemic to the program. “These are not the only incidents. There are a whole lot more out there,” Truszkowski said. “Is there a problem? You do the math.”
Vance, 20, is a redshirt defensive back from Detroit. Corley, 19, is a receiver from Detroit. King, also 19, is a freshman defensive end from Darien, Illinois.
It’s said that when Sultan Abdulaziz saw his very first game of cricket, between two teams of British officers, he told them that he thought the sport was “wonderful” but wondered why, since bowling seemed so “needlessly exhausting”, the men didn’t get their “servants and concubines” to perform it for them. The Sultan, who was eventually overthrown, imprisoned and murdered, had what you might politely describe as some eccentric ideas about how society should function, but with cricket, at least, he was on to something.
“There is more glamour attached to batting than bowling,” Don Bradman once wrote, since “the majority of people go to cricket hoping to see a scintillating innings”. Bowlers, Bradman reckoned, must “possess a tremendous love” for cricket. “What else would drive them to such exertions?”
The bowler’s lot is a rough one. If the workload is lighter now, the job has seldom seemed so utterly thankless. In the first four days of the Champions Trophy, we had successive totals of 305 for six and 308 for two, 291 and 53 for three, 299 for six and 203, 319 for three and 164. The 45 bowlers in the thick of all this managed exactly eight maidens between them. Altogether, they took just 42 of the 80 wickets on offer, at an average of 46 and an economy rate of 5.92. Before the tournament, we had England’s 328 against Ireland at Lord’s, their 339, and 330 against South Africa, and in the tournament warm-ups, totals of 318 and 319 in Australia’s match against Sri Lanka, 341 and 342 when Bangladesh played Pakistan, 324 by India, and then 356 and 359 between Sri Lanka and New Zealand.
Parse all that as the numerical expression of a whole lot of pain. It seems there are now two ways to keep a team to a total under 300. One is to pray for rain, and the other is to hope they stumble in their own hurry to score quickly and collapse in a heap. Which, if you’ve been paying close attention, won’t come as much of a surprise, because scoring rates have been rising steadily since the start of this decade.
It’s that exact reason, in fact, that makes it easy to forget just how large a leap forward the game has taken in the last 10 years. I watched England’s second ODI against South Africa with an old friend who’s moved to the US. It had been a while since he’d seen a one-day game. “Remind me,” he said at one point, “is 300 still a good total or not?”
Well, no, not really. In 2009, the overall bowling economy rate in ODIs topped five for the first time. In 2014 it grew again, to 5.19, and in 2016 it reached 5.40. So far this year, it’s running at 5.32, which is two runs higher than it was when they started playing ODI cricket back in the early 70s. Then, in 2013, the overall batting strike rate rose up above 80 for the first time. And then it shot forward in another leap in 2014, to 83.30. Since then it’s crept higher still, to 86.9 in 2015. Midway through 2017, it’s running at 85.73 for the year. Ten years ago the figure was 77.43, and 10 years before that it was 72.81. Imagine all this on a graph, and you’ll see the rising line take a sharp upward tick in the last few years.
The evolution of batting is coming on in a rush. For years, it has moved in fits and starts, advanced by the radical acts of individuals whose successful innovations would be widely adopted. Whether that was Fuller Pilch (ask your great, great, great, great grandfathers), who first had the idea of coming out to meet the ball at its pitch, or WG Grace, who taught everyone how to play both forward and back, Ranjitsinhji, who opened up the leg side, or, years later, Doug Marillier with his scoop-shot and Kevin Pietersen with his switch-hit. These days everyone is at it. Constrained for years by the orthodoxies of correct technique, the idea that there is a right and a wrong way to play, batsmen are free now, and have even been forced by necessity to explore all the possibilities. They’ve untapped the latent potential of a sport in which you can hit through 360 degrees.
It’s not just that batsmen have more shots now, or hit more fours and sixes, but that they’re more intent on scoring off every ball. T20, when each ball counts as 0.83% of the total available to the team, has taught the value of every single delivery, each too precious to waste by blocking or waving through. A ball that passes by the bat without being played at now seems like a surprising event in itself. The bowlers, then, are under more pressure than ever before. And their own arsenal is starting to look a little thin. A couple of their key weapons, the bouncer, say, or the doosra, have been legislated against. Others – the wide yorker, or the slow short ball – were solved soon after they were introduced. They’re being outgunned.
The Sisyphean futility of bowling was never more apparent than in the final overs of India’s innings at Edgbaston last Sunday, when Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya unleashed a storm of such intensity, such great vengeance, such furious anger, that Pakistan were broken like a ship on the rocks. They hit 117 in the last 10 overs, and 72 in the last four. Mohammad Amir left the field with cramp, moments later Wahab Riaz went off too, with an injured ankle. Amid the tatters of their attack, there were no servants or concubines to call on, only poor left-arm spinner Imad Wasim, who had the unenviable job of bowling the last over of the innings. He was hit for three sixes in a row, and in the end the over cost 23 runs, reasonably cheap at modern prices.

Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin operation lost its racing manager for the second time in three years on Tuesday when John Ferguson quit, having apparently lost the trust of one of its key trainers. Ferguson, a 25-year veteran in the Sheikh’s employ who has also been was also serving as chief executive, felt he could not stay on after it emerged that he was being bypassed in the chain of command by Saeed bin Suroor, who has instead been seeking his instructions directly from the Sheikh.
Bin Suroor used a pre-Derby interview with the Racing Post to make undisguised criticisms of Ferguson’s regime, with particular reference to how it had impacted the Dubaian’s ability to do his job. The trainer complained about being instructed to use the jockey James Doyle for the first part of last year and about the quality of two-year-olds he had been sent this year and the way in which they were delivered to him, which he blamed for the fact that he has yet to have a single juvenile runner this year.
Perhaps most damagingly of all, Bin Suroor harked back to the time Simon Crisford managed Godolphin, saying “everything was top class” at that time and that he was now trying to rebuild his training operation to get back to that level. Crisford was Godolphin’s racing manager from its creation in the mid-1990s until 2014, when he chose to step down a year after the organisation was engulfed by the steroids scandal involving the trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni, who had been recommended by Crisford to the Sheikh. Crisford has since set up as an independent trainer in Newmarket.
Ferguson, who became Godolphin’s chief executive in December 2015 after holding a variety of senior roles, decided his position had become “untenable” as a result of Bin Suroor’s pronouncements.
“In times such as these, what matters is the future and my stepping down will allow everyone to draw a line under things and move forward,” he added.
“All the staff at Godolphin are wonderful people who work so hard for the greater good and I want to thank each and every one. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed has given me so much over the years: trust, opportunity, amazing experiences and, perhaps most importantly, his kindness and counsel. For all these things I thank him with all my heart.”
Joe Osborne, managing director of Godolphin in Ireland and a key figure in setting up a branch of the operation in China, will now serve as interim chief executive of Godolphin’s global operation and is well placed to keep the job long term. Based at Kildangan Stud, Osborne is another longstanding employee of the Sheikh and the son of Michael Osborne, credited by the Sheikh with establishing the Dubai World Cup as a major international race.
“I’ve known Joe a long number of years,” said Jim Bolger, who trained Dawn Approach to win the 2000 Guineas for Godolphin. “He’s a thorough gentleman, very familiar with all aspects of thoroughbred breeding and racing.”
Bolger said Osborne is “more than capable” of handling the new role which has suddenly dropped into his lap. “He’s very efficient and what you see is what you get. It’s a big job but he’s got square shoulders.”
An early job for Osborne will be establishing a working relationship with Bin Suroor, who will require assurance that he is getting the same quality of stock as Charlie Appleby, Godolphin’s other trainer in Newmarket, whose assistant is Ferguson’s son, James. “This year we are behind by miles in regard to what we received for two-year-olds,” Bin Suroor told the Post. “I’ve never seen anything like it. They need plenty of time, and a lot of them will not run this year.
“It is a disaster. Normally the two-year-olds come here ... at the end of October, or early November. This year some came in January, some in February, some in May. They are very, very backward. I can’t train them, have no chance to run them. The system is not quite great this year. And two-year-olds are the future of any yard.”
Bin Suroor is yet to have a two-year-old runner in Britain this year, while Appleby has had eight winners from 13 runners in that age group. Bin Suroor also referred to the fact that his stable, which he described as “the main Godolphin stable”, had won just a single Group One race outside Dubai in three years. Appleby, meanwhile, won one in France last month and had the second and third in Friday’s Coronation Cup at Epsom.
“Now Sheikh Mohammed makes the decisions at Stanley House, nobody else,” Bin Suroor said. “I like things this way. Last year it didn’t suit me at all. Everything was top class in past times, from the work-riders to the people in the office. Now I’m trying to build that up again for the future. The last three years without Simon Crisford has not been the same, has not been easy.
“It is very good that now the yard is a happy place again – look at the results so far this season. Now I am very positive about the future.”
Southampton have reported Liverpool to the Premier League for allegedly making an illegal approach to Virgil van Dijk.
The south-coast club were furious to see stories on Monday that suggested Liverpool were in the driving seat to sign the defender this summer, in the face of interest from other leading clubs – namely Chelsea and Manchester City.
They argue that there is no way the stories could have been run unless Liverpool had spoken to Van Dijk and, thereby, put themselves in breach of Premier League rules over “tapping up”. Several of the stories contained the line that Van Dijk wanted to move to Anfield because of Jürgen Klopp’s involvement in his recruitment – which Southampton suggest adds up to an illegal approach. It is understood that the Dutchman’s preference is to move to Anfield.
Southampton have made it clear to the Premier League they have received no official approach from Liverpool for Van Dijk and, more generally, they have stressed the player has five years to run on his contract, meaning they are in a strong position regarding where he does play.
Liverpool are reportedly willing to pay a world-record sum for a defender – expected to be around £60m – to break Southampton’s resistance and they are also prepared to match City’s offer to Van Dijk of a contract worth around £200,000 a week. Van Dijk would become Liverpool’s record signing and highest-paid player should the deal go ahead. They declined to comment on Southampton’s accusations.
The league has written to Southampton and Liverpool to ask for their version of events. Liverpool have spent £96m on five Southampton players since the summer of 2014. In that transfer window they took Adam Lallana (£25m), Dejan Lovren (£20m) and Rickie Lambert (£4.5m). Nathaniel Clyne (£12.5m) and Sadio Mané (£34m) followed in the summers of 2015 and 2016 respectively.
Southampton’s position with their manager, Claude Puel, remains delicate and complicated given that he has all but left the club and they are actively pursuing a successor. Yet Saints will not confirm his departure until they have lined up the new man, who would have to represent an upgrade.
Puel, who arrived in June of last year, led Saints to the EFL Cup final, which they lost to Manchester United, and an eighth-placed finish in the league. But his style of football has frequently been derided as turgid, the team have struggled for goals and when the French manager was booed by the St Mary’s crowd on the final day of the season against Stoke City, the writing was on the wall.
Puel sat down with the board for an end-of-season review, which did not go well, and there have since been no messages of support for him from the hierarchy. He is away on holiday and has emerged as a target for the French club St-Étienne.
Southampton accept that Puel will be entitled to a pay-off on the final two years of his contract and they want a manager who is receptive to promoting players from the academy and with a vision for attractive, passing football.
There was something familiar about Gianluigi Buffon hoisting the Serie A trophy aloft after the game against Crotone at the end of May. Now, when had we last seen that? Ah, yes, in 2016. Oh, in 2015 as well. 2014? Yep, very much so. 2013 and 2012? Of course.
Juventus have racked up six consecutive Serie A titles. In those six seasons they have picked up nearly 200 points more than Internazionale. Their dominance has been spectacular.
It is very much the same story in Germany, where Bayern Munich have won the Bundesliga five years in a row since Borussia Dortmund secured the double in 2012. In France, Paris St-Germain have won four of the past five league titles.
Where is the fun in that. True, England and Spain have had a slightly better spread of teams who have won the league and the main cup (six different teams over the past six years in England and three in Spain) but the dominance of a few clubs means that, at least in Italy and Germany, we pretty much know in August who is going to win the league.
So why do we still care? Why do we still watch? We asked our writers how the dominance of a few teams is affecting their league and whether there are signs of fans turning off their TVs or not going to the stadiums.
After Juventus won a record-breaking sixth consecutive Scudetto, it’s fair to say that things are getting repetitive at the top of Serie A. The problem is that they have pushed the bar so high.
Back in 2011-12 Juve claimed their first title in this sequence with 84 points. Roma and Napoli exceeded that number this season, and yet neither has looked close to dislodging the Bianconeri.
The standard of the league is decidedly uneven. Juventus have re-established themselves as one of the best teams on the planet, and to some extent have dragged the chasing pack up with them. Napoli play some of the most entertaining football in Europe, and acquitted themselves better against Real Madrid in the Champions League this season than the 6-2 aggregate defeat suggested. Roma, too, have improved.
But there is a significant gap between those teams and the next tier. Lazio and Atalanta – the latter especially impressive for their development of homegrown talent – were compelling, but neither truly threatened the top three. The Milan clubs seem to be trapped in permanent disarray – albeit both are expected to spend big under new Chinese owners this summer. Fiorentina remain frustratingly flaky.
And as you drift into the bottom half of the table, so talent levels fall steeply. Hardly surprising when you consider that 13 teams posted total revenues below €68m on their 2015-16 accounts.
Overall, it is a mixed picture. Juventus’s European exploits have restored some prestige to Serie A, but also highlight how far others have fallen behind. Calls for the division to be reduced back to 18 teams are growing louder but the Italian Football Federation’s president, Carlo Tavecchio, called them “pure utopia”.
Has the league’s TV deal suffered? Serie A’s TV deal works out at around €1.13bn per year. Predictability may have harmed the league’s marketability but Juventus’s strong performances in Europe are also a counterbalance. Half-empty stadiums, the poor performance of the Milan clubs and a struggling national economy are more tangible concerns. PB
The accusation is as relentlessly repetitive as it is tiresome, not to mention a little baffling. Who chants for a league rather than a team? And why get so wound up about it? Why does it occupy people so much, to the extent that any reference to Spain, however innocuous, is guaranteed to immediately get a least one “pub league” or similarly dismissive comment in reply? The accusation is flawed, too, but that doesn’t mean that it is entirely false.
Spanish football does have more than two clubs: Atlético Madrid won the title three years ago and have reached two of the past four Champions League finals. That underlines the fact that if Spain is a two-horse race – and there’s an element of that, Madrid and Barcelona having won all bar one of the past 10 titles – it is not because the rest are a bunch of donkeys. Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao, Celta Vigo and Villarreal have in recent years reached semi-finals or beyond in Europe, which Spanish football has dominated. Celta, 13th in La Liga, were one dreadful miss away from eliminating Manchester United and taking yet another Spanish team to yet another final in this season’s Europa League.
Meanwhile, this season has not lacked surprises. Madrid dropped points against Eibar and Las Palmas. Barcelona lost the title against Deportivo, Celta and Málaga. For much of the year, Sevilla looked as if they might challenge for the title. Teams did compete with Madrid, the champions, who needed goals in the last 10 minutes in a quarter of their games. It wasn’t a stroll – and if their “B Team” kept winning in the final weeks, just look at how good those reserves are. Few doubt that Madrid or Barcelona would win the Premier League too; they don’t just dominate domestically, they dominate Europe in this super club era.
And yet Sevilla fell away, were knocked out of the Champions League by Leicester (whom they had overrun in the last-16 first leg), and it is true that by the end of the domestic season it was a familiar duo competing on the final day, as they had been all season, and there were few real shifts: the same top four, same next three and same bottom three all year. It is also true that at the bottom some of the teams could not really compete (although Madid needed a last-minute winner to defeat relegated Sporting Gijón, for example), and there simply is not the money that other leagues have – even if that is improving a little.
It is not Scotland in the sun but there are problems, even if the last couple of years have seen them mitigated a little, not as bad as it was six or seven seasons ago. Spain’s “other” clubs cannot compete economically and are a long way off Premier League teams in that regard. Another thing: fans are treated horribly in Spain, with kick-off times decided late and dictated entirely by TV (whose coverage is poor) and subject to change, with supporters criminalised and utterly voiceless.
Madrid’s and Barcelona’s enormity does eclipse everyone else and however brilliant they are – and they are brilliant – that can be discouraging. It is impossible to imagine it ending, too. But, then, everyone thought that the season that Atlético ended up as champions – a colossal, almost miraculous success that was rightly celebrated but might have hidden a deeper, troubling reality.
Has the league’s TV deal suffered? The new TV deal, at last managed centrally and negotiated collectively, as enshrined in law, was designed to increase the amount raised and redistribute the money. The plan was to help to reduce the huge inequalities in the league, although Madrid and Barcelona will still take far higher amounts than the rest under a new formula that calculates earnings based on league position, historical position, “social base” and audience. Barcelona and Madrid will expect to make around €140m this year, while teams at the bottom can expect closer to €42m – a huge leap from figures that were close to €15m as recently as last season. Every single game is televised live, with matches spread right across the weekend, starting on Friday night and finishing on Monday night. In between those, the slots are Saturday at 1pm, 4.15pm, 6.30pm, and 8.45pm, and Sunday at 12, 4.15pm, 6.30pm and 8.45pm. In total, the deal is worth an estimated €1,573,809m (€1,424,035 once Mediapro has taken its commission), €930m from domestic, €643m from international. SL
There are different ways of being predictable, and following what everyone thought was a refreshing intervention by Leicester City last season the Premier League’s big six clubs have quickly closed ranks to keep the major prizes between themselves. Six is quite a high number of course, and not many thought at the start of the season that Arsenal and Manchester United would be the ones missing out on top-four places, or that Pep Guardiola and Manchester City would end empty-handed. The same six into four situation will pertain next season too, and anyone who feels English football is always the same old story is advised to pick their 2018 top four in August and see how their guesswork looks nine months later.
England must be doing something right if clubs of the stature of Manchester United cannot always get their own way, and half a dozen potential title candidates is a lot healthier than the situation we used to have when the top four was set in stone and only Arsenal or Chelsea would take it in turns to challenge United’s dominance. Yet though this has been a reasonably lively and absorbing contest at the top of the table the big six are not the whole story.
Beneath the top six this season are Everton, seemingly stuck in a permanent no man’s land between the achievers and those with relegation concerns, followed by a long gap and then Southampton in eighth place with 46 points. To put that in perspective, 46 points is less than half of what Chelsea accrued and only five points more than Swansea and Crystal Palace managed after seasons haunted by fears of dropping into the Championship. Although entertainment might by sparkling in the upper echelon, the league as a whole cannot be considered healthy if two-thirds of it has no real purpose except ensuring survival.
Has the league’s TV deal suffered? No. The Premier League’s present TV deal is worth a monster £5.136bn over three years. Money is pouring into English football, and owners are no longer flaky types seeking self-promotion but investors who know how to turn a profit. The English top flight is divided into haves and have-nots, certainly, but remains watchable through being unpredictable at both ends. It is no easy task to pick a winner, and all the clubs near the bottom have the capacity to do what Crystal Palace did at Chelsea or what Hull did to Liverpool. Upsets occur in most leagues, but foreign players in this country frequently express surprise at the amount of fight in smaller sides who refuse to lie down. PW
That Bayern Munich have just sealed a fifth successive Bundesliga title – and by a margin of 15 points despite looking under-par for much of the campaign – is undoubtedly a concern. It’s only the second time that German football’s behemoth has managed such a run. The truth is, though, that Bayern’s dominance is partly a result of competitiveness, with Borussia Dortmund’s successive title wins in 2011 and 2012 almost provoking them to become their best-ever.
The other part of the equation is the club adopting a more internationalist strategy. Despite the image of Bayern’s approach being to take away their competitors’ best players, and signings such as Robert Lewandowski and Mats Hummels accentuating that feeling, they have been more adventurous in the transfer market in recent years, buoyed by profits from the Champions League and the Allianz Arena, which they now fully own.
Bayern’s dominance does drive international interest to the Bundesliga, and discovering the full picture often keeps people glued. Even if the title race was a non-event this year, there was drama throughout the rest of the table, in terms of the European places and at the bottom. On the season’s final day, almost half of the teams still had something to play for. The success of Europe-bound Freiburg, and the struggles of giants such as Hamburg, show it’s not always about money correlating to success.
Attendances are reassuringly stable – this season’s slight dip should be wiped out in 2017-18 with modest Darmstadt and Ingolstadt relegated and replaced by the better-supported Stuttgart and Hannover.
Has the league’s TV deal suffered? In terms of television rights, the Bundesliga has never been healthier, netting €1.16bn a year after a new four-year deal was thrashed out last summer. Sky, which shows 93% of live top-flight matches (Eurosport takes care of Friday nights), signed a new pact with the league at €876m per annum, almost double the previous figure of €486m. AB
Back in August it looked like the same old Ligue 1. PSG, despite changing their manager and losing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, were going to win a fifth league title in a row and probably a third domestic treble in a row too. Only a few weeks before, this great Paris side were crowned champions with a record 96 points and a 31-point gap on second-placed Lyon. Predictability had hit French football as in the nineties with Marseille and the noughties with Lyon.
Then, Monaco had a freak season where they exceeded all expectations but deserved to win their first league title in 17 years. Nice pushed PSG all the way for second place and for the first time the top three teams finished the campaign with 78 points (for Nice) or more (87 for PSG and 95 for Monaco).
Marseille have started their American revolution since the takeover of Frank McCourt and will invest up to €200m in the summer to compete for the title. Lyon, thanks to some investment from China, will also be ready to splash some cash, especially if they lose their two best players Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso, which is looking likely.
Bordeaux are going in the right direction under their bright manager, Jocelyn Gourvennec. It will be fascinating to see Lille’s progress under Marcelo Bielsa next season, and Sérgio Conceição has worked wonders at Nantes since taking over in December.
Overall, PSG have been the perfect driving force for Ligue 1, with the other historic clubs trying to catch them up. The Parisians are still the richest and most powerful but Monaco showed this season that winning Ligue 1 is not a given any more.
Has the league’s TV deal suffered? A little bit. Ligue 1’s TV deal is worth €800m per year until 2020. The dominance of PSG dented the appeal for the league somewhat but Ligue 1 is hoping to increase this amount as Monaco, Nice, Lyon and Marseille are building strong teams to compete with the Parisian club.

From David Beckham’s mohican to Roberto Baggio’s ponytail, haircuts can define a footballer. So eight-year-old Mili Hernandez put thought into it before going to the hairdresser. “When my hair starts to grow I put it short because I’ve always had short hair,” she told WOWT 6 News. “I didn’t like my hair long.”
It was a decision that would get her and her team, Omaha’s Azzuri Cachorros, in trouble. Mili, who is good enough to play for the Under-11s, had helped the team to the final of the Springfield Soccer Club tournament. But four hours before kick-off on Sunday, the Azzuri Cachorros were disqualified after someone complained there was a boy on the team.
“I was mad. I never had that problem before. She’s been playing so long in different tournaments,” her father, Gerardo, told the Washington Post. “I don’t want no problems with nobody, but that wasn’t the right way to treat people. Why they want to tell my girl looks like a boy?”
The Springfield Soccer Association said that a misprint in the team’s roster identified Hernandez as a boy in “violation of state and tournament rules”, although the Post says another form listed her correctly as a girl. When Gerardo took Mili – along with ID showing she is a girl – to the tournament he claims the officials “didn’t even want to take it”. Mili was understandably upset. “Just because I look like a boy doesn’t mean I am a boy,” she said. “They don’t have a reason to kick the whole club out.”
There was some consolation for Mili after World Cup winners Mia Hamm and Abby Wambach tweeted their support. Hamm invited her to a training camp and Wambach, known for her forthright manner, saw her as a kindred spirit. “Mili, don’t EVER let anyone tell you that you aren’t perfect just as you are.i won championships with short hair,” Wambach wrote.

Borussia Dortmund have appointed Peter Bosz as their new head coach.
The 53-year-old, who led Ajax to the Europa League final in his sole season in charge of the Amsterdam club, has signed a two-year deal to succeed Thomas Tuchel, who left the Bundesliga club last week.
Bosz was under contract at the Amsterdam Arena until 2019, so Dortmund have had to agree a compensation package to secure his services.
“These talks convinced me that this ought to be the next step for me,” Bosz said at a press conference on Tuesday, revealing he had spoken with Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke and the club’s sporting director Michael Zorc for around three hours. “I got a good feeling. It was a respectful discussion. I am convinced that we can work very well together.”
Watzke added: “We had a very, very good feeling about Bosz from the outset, the feeling that something can really grow together here.”
Reports in Holland claimed Bosz fell out with officials at Ajax in much the same way Tuchel supposedly did at Dortmund. It was reported he did not see eye to eye with some of the technical staff already at the club when he arrived last summer, such as former Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp.
Asked about the alleged disagreement, Bosz said he would “only look forwards” before adding: “What I can say is that I had a great time at Ajax.”
Ajax confirmed on their official website that an agreement had been reached with Dortmund, with the general manager, Edwin van der Sar, describing it as a “good deal”. The former Manchester United goalkeeper said: “I have mixed feelings about this move. When we brought Peter to Ajax last summer it was not the intention that the partnership would end after one year.
“We have had a great season, especially in the Europa League. As with our players, the coach also attracts the attention of clubs from Europe’s top leagues.”
Bosz guided an exciting young Ajax side to their first European final in 21 years, where they were beaten by Manchester United, but missed out on the Eredivisie title by a point to Feyenoord and ended the season without silverware.
The former Holland midfielder’s only previous coaching job outside his home country was a brief stint in charge of Israeli side Maccabi Tel Aviv before he took over at Ajax.
Dortmund finished third in the Bundesliga last season to qualify for the Champions League, and also won the German Cup.
This week will bring the launch of the Racecourse Association’s Showcase & Awards for 2017, designed to highlight the good things achieved by Britain’s racecourses while encouraging all tracks to learn from their rivals and copy their successes. I was on the panel of judges for the first time last year and have signed up to do it again.
I was struck by the effort made by some courses to impress the judges, with pages and pages of well thought-out submissions, and it certainly seemed in some cases that that reflected the effort made by the track to impress its customers and give them a memorable experience. I learned a lot that would otherwise have sailed below my radar and was especially taken with Pontefract’s ‘Art Of Racing’ raceday and by this charitable effort by staff at Cheltenham racecourse.
The awards have been going in their present form since 2011 and now appear to have caught the attention of most tracks and racecourse groups, with the result that the Showcase event was highly commended at the European Association Awards in Brussels early this year. Yes, I realise that having awards for awards nights is a bit circular. No, I didn’t get an invite to that one...
The great hope about Showcase is that it encourages racecourses to keep improving and to keep learning from what others are doing. The entries are not secret but are sent out to all other racecourses, in the hope that best practice standards can be quickly adopted elsewhere. I gather staff at one major track have a full day set aside to pore over the entries submitted by others in case there’s a good idea that can usefully be pinched.
The England & Wales Cricket Board is apparently among the other sporting bodies whose interest has been piqued by the Showcase system and they are now in regular contact with the Racecourse Association, so you may see a similar approach being adopted in county cricket.
Anyway, let me know about your own racecourse experiences through the comments section below, today or on any other day when you have a view that you want to get across. Which tracks do well, in your view, and which need to do better?
Yarmouth plays host to today’s nap, Albert Boy (3.20), an even-money shot for a middle-distance handicap. Having been rated 71 in the middle of last year, he dropped all the way to 55, a mark he has been exploiting this spring, with two wins from his last three starts. I have the impression that he struck for home rather a long way out on a testing surface on the only occasion he was beaten last month.
Anyway, he gets to run today from the same mark as when winning an apprentice race by five lengths just eight days ago. He comes from the Scott Dixon yard that seems to be doing well just now.
Knight Destroyer (5.30) is another popular pick, being just 5-4 for the last at Chepstow. This Jonjo O’Neill three-year-old took a big step forward when second on his handicap debut here last month, his first outing since being gelded in September. He ran on well but too late that day after a brief bit of traffic trouble and hopefully will get a clearer run in this smaller field on softer ground.
Balancing out these two obvious ones is Hitman (4.10), who appears friendless at 33-1 for a mile handicap at Wetherby. He’s only 3lb higher than when winning a Newbury handicap for William Muir last summer and, although that was followed by a couple of lifeless efforts, it doesn’t require a great deal of imagination to see him returning to his early form of last year, now that he’s had a break, been gelded and joined a new trainer in Rebecca Bastiman, who’s had a couple of recent winners.

Sead Kolasinac, the Bosnia-Herzegovina defender, will join Arsenal on 1 July after his contract at Schalke expires, the Premier League club have announced.
The 23-year-old free transfer is Arsène Wenger’s first summer signing as the manager looks to add to his squad and make Arsenal title contenders. Kolasinac came through the youth ranks at Schalke and made more than 100 appearances for the Bundesliga club.
The arrival of the Germany-born left-back casts doubt on the future of Kieran Gibbs, who has yet to negotiate fresh terms at the Emirates. Kolasinac had reportedly been attracting the interest of Chelsea and Everton but it is understood a move to north London had been on the cards for some time.
Arsenal will participate in the Europa League next season having missed out on Champions League qualification for the first time in 20 seasons. Kolasinac has experience of the lesser competition and is likely to be competing against Nacho Monreal for a place in the side. Wenger, as well as the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, and majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, are looking for a run at the title next season.
Arsenal, who have been linked with a big-money move for the Monaco forward Kylian Mbappé, announced Kolasinac had signed a long-term contract. Schalke’s statement said he had signed until 2022. “Sead Kolasinac will complete a move to Arsenal FC upon the expiry of his contract on 30th June 2017,” the German club added. “The reigning FA Cup winners, who finished fifth in the 2016-17 Premier League campaign, have agreed a deal with the 23-year-old left-back which runs until 2022.”
Ask the batsman dropped on 0 who makes a ton how to succeed in cricket and he will tell you it’s not how many breaks you get that matters, it’s what you do with them. Many county cricket fans were less than pleased to see Hampshire restored to Division One having finished 2016 in one of the relegation slots, but a second win in a row has left them sitting atop the table like a fat cuckoo. Captain George Bailey may have scored just two off his own bat but veterans Jimmy Adams (166) and Sean Ervine (203) – that’s runs not ages – amassed 367 for the fourth wicket and, once the No9 Keith Barker, the only partner centurion Jonathan Trott could find in the first innings, was dismissed for 63, Warwickshire’s fragile confidence collapsed and they were seen off by an innings, having followed on. Leg spinner Mason Crane did absolutely nothing to dampen down enthusiasm for advancing his burgeoning talent with match figures of 57-17-154-5, while Ian Bell’s team languish rock bottom, winless and looking for that break to get their season started.
Yorkshire leapfrogged Lancashire into fourth place with a three-day demolition of the old enemy in a match in which the disparity in seam bowling resources proved critical. While Steven Croft had only Ryan McLaren (396) with more than 72 career first class wickets to his name, Gary Ballance could whistle up Ryan Sidebottom (745), Tim Bresnan (499) and Jack Brooks (364). But it was the least experienced of his quartet to whom the captain had most cause to be grateful, Ben Coad backing up his six first-innings wickets with a couple more in the second dig to give him 31 Division One wickets at 14 this season, the best among England-qualified bowlers by a distance. With England slated to play seven Test matches in two months from 6 July, don’t be surprised if “Highway” gets a gig for his country before his breakthrough season is done.
Flogging results out of Lord’s roads (they should just call the pitch the A41a) is hard enough with a full complement of overs but, when weather intervenes, it can be a thankless task. Once Lewis Gregory had notched a maiden century and Dean Elgar continued his extended warm-up for the Test series with a second hundred of the season, Middlesex knew that a par score would surely be enough to make a draw the likely conclusion – and so it proved after their last four wickets added 110 runs. Though Somerset’s young skipper, Tom Abell, will be relieved to have batted almost three hours for a season’s best 71 not out, two of last season’s “three who could win it” going into 2016’s last day, are stuck in sixth and seventh places, both looking for the first win of the campaign.
Nottinghamshire’s charge towards Division One stalled with a draw against lowly Derbyshire at Trent Bridge. With four second-innings wickets down and the lead just 51, Chris Read will be thankful for even for that, his own 74 not out critical in setting the visitors a target of 216 which proved just 26 too many when the rain came for the last time, Derbyshire big favourites with five wickets and eight overs in hand. Missing James Pattinson and Stuart Broad (36 wickets at 14.7 and 281 runs at 46.8 in 2017), Notts lacked firepower and Derbyshire can count themselves unfortunate not to have registered their first red ball win for two years.
With second place Kent sitting out this round of fixtures, third-placed Worcestershire had the chance to jump into first with a win over Sussex, a club in turmoil after Luke Wright’s shock resignation from the captaincy on the eve of the match. As can sometimes be the case, the change at the top, with Chris Nash taking over the reins, galvanised the side, his charges racking up 579 for 8 declared in good time, with Luke Wells adding 155 to the 258 he made when he last took guard at Hove. When the visitors cruised to 215 without loss in reply approaching lunch on Day Three, the draw looked likely, but the admirable Daryl Mitchell fell for 121, the Sussex seamers scented blood, and, just 30 overs later, Mitchell found himself back in the middle, following on, 267 behind. Despite missing experienced new ball man Steve Magoffin, Nash rotated his five medium pacers who, on a pitch now offering assistance, restricted Worcestershire’s highest second innings stand to just 79 runs and wrapped up the win early in the afternoon session on Day Four. As auditions go, it wasn’t a bad one from Chris Nash.
Durham, whose place in Division One for this season was forfeited to current leaders Hampshire due to their financial problems, fought like cornered tigers to get themselves back into their match with Northamptonshire, only to lose off the penultimate ball, in the rain, with the visitors eight down. After conceding a first innings deficit of 172, a maiden century for Cameron Steel (who sounds more like a Pakistani team than an American born player) supported by 54 in nearly three hours from (who else?) Paul Collingwood, clawed Durham back into the game. But Colly’s opposite number, Alex Wakely, had other ideas and a captain’s knock of 84 laid the foundations for the last gasp win. Durham still seek that first victory of the season (and the points that will turn their total positive), but when it does eventually arrive, glasses will be raised well beyond the north east corner of England.

For someone who stands 5ft 2in, I hit the ball pretty far. During my professional golf career, I was one of the longest hitters on tour. I averaged 270 yards off the tee, and I consistently outdrove competitors by 30 to 40 yards. When I played in pro-ams (mostly with men) I’d be told I “hit it far for a girl.” To which I would retort, “Yeah? Well, you hit it short for a dude.”
But the truth is, I did hit the golf ball far for a woman, and particularly for someone my size. Recently, PGA and Champions Tour veteran Fred Funk came under fire for comments about the length of modern courses. “I feel like I should be on the ladies tour right now,” he said. “I didn’t mean that in a derogatory sense, not at all. Just because Annika [Sorenstam) outdrove me [in a recent skins game], I’m a little bitter.” The USA Today columnist Christine Brennan called Funk’s comments sexist. In her article, she called into question Funk’s views of women, “This was a man who sounded quite comfortable delivering a snide remark about women’s golf.”
This sparked an interesting debate about the difference between men’s and women’s golf, and in particular, about female and male athletes. It’s tough to dispute that, on average, men are stronger and faster than women. Look no further than stats for driving distances among PGA and LPGA players. The women on tour swing their drivers on average at about 95mph. The men? 113 mph.
Does this make men better golfers? No. And recognizing the differences in our bodies should not take away from acknowledging what makes male and female athletes great.
Let’s look at scoring average on each tour: currently LPGA player So Yeon Ryu has averaged 69.21 this season, compared to Jordan Spieth’s 69.41 on the PGA. Those figures are far from an anomaly – averages across both tours are comparable. And there is a case that women could be considered superior: Dana Finkelstein on the LPGA is ranked No1 in driving accuracy, hitting 88.2% of fairways this season. Her counterpart on the PGA, Steve Stricker, hits 72.85%. In addition, Lexi Thompson leads the LPGA with an average of 79.8% of greens in regulation this season, compared to Dustin Johnson, who is No1 on the PGA tour with 72.6%. Looking at these stats alone, women are more accurate than men. What they lack in power, they make up for in finesse.
The former US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy, said as much last year. “I especially like to see [women] hit shots with hybrids. It’s a joke how talented they are with those clubs. I’m actually prepared to believe that Lydia Ko is better than the vast majority of male pros from, say, 200 yards out. She is ridiculously good. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that the top women players consistently hit closer to where they are aiming than do the top guys,” Ogilvy wrote in an article for Golf Australia.
So while Brennan found offense with Funk’s comments, I only saw him pointing out something that most of us know: men in professional golf hit the ball further. It’s not sexist, but a fact. Acknowledging what makes men and women distinct – for example, male players’ huge drives or female players’ unerring accuracy – should only highlight the very things that make professional athletes so extraordinary.
What we should take offense to is when people think that women are not elite athletes simply because their bodies do not perform in the same way as those of their male counterparts. And what most critics of women’s sports should take into account is that any weekend warrior, male or female, could never get close to matching the performance of a professional athlete of any gender.
As a sportswriter, I hate differentiating between male and female athletes. I feared that by writing this article I would only be playing into the internalized sexism I’ve been raised to believe about women in sports growing up: that women aren’t as good of athletes as men. But my case is that female athletes are just as exceptional as their male counterparts, but are skilled in ways that men are not. Accepting this and embracing this provides a foundation for women to continue to flourish in their sports.
By the time the Lions return to Eden Park for the first Test against New Zealand on 24 June they will either be roaring or whimpering. The next five games – all inside 14 days – really will be a test of manhood and there is not a single local who anticipates the touring team returning unbeaten from their bruising provincial mini-tour.
If a talented, but occasionally flaky Blues side are not defeated in the opening midweek fixture on Wednesday, things will only get tougher. The Crusaders are currently heading the Super Rugby standings, the Highlanders are tucked in behind, a pumped-up Maori XV can make the All Blacks appear demure and the Chiefs play the most eye-catching rugby on Earth. Pick the easy option out of that lot.
The Lions are also battling on two wearily familiar fronts: gelling unfamiliar players and combinations over an impossibly short period in front of rugby’s least-forgiving audience. Most New Zealanders are charming to visitors but this is not immediately obvious in the rugby sections of the newspapers. As Warren Gatland is already being reminded, beating the world champions in their backyard requires rare resilience on and off the field.
Even with the tour still in its infancy, the news wires are awash with barbs. Gatland has been derided as the wrong man for the Lions job, with his team dismissed as less enthusiastic than a chicken heading towards KFC and incapable of finding their own hotel, let alone the formula for a victorious series. Knockabout insults, maybe, but an instinctive lack of respect for northern hemisphere rugby oozes from many media orifices.
The only way to chip away at such ingrained perceptions is on the pitch. And even if the Lions do somehow win all their next five games, howls of criticism of their style, the refereeing or some other perceived slight will inevitably follow. If a highly rated New Zealand team lose, particularly at home, the notion of the other side having outplayed them comes well down the post-match list.
This may well have underpinned Gatland’s irritation this week when the unflattering phrase “Warrenball” was predictably wheeled out in a press conference, albeit by a British reporter. This is a man who has coached winning teams all over the world – with Wasps, Waikato and Wales, among others – yet is still widely portrayed as a coach who merely picks a crash-ball centre and invites 14 other blokes to pile in behind him. “I don’t know what Warrenball means,” protested his assistant, Rob Howley, who has coached alongside Gatland for much of the past decade. “Have we played that over the last few years? I’m not too sure.”
Rugby’s eternal truth is that every professional coach adopts the approach he believes will win him the most games with the players available to him at the time. Which is why the Lions management are now talking repeatedly of the need to stretch opposition defences, as opposed to simply seeking contact or relying on forward power. Attacking scrums and lineouts largely depend on the opposition dropping the ball or kicking it out of play. If nimble, quick-thinking Kiwi sides do neither, where does that leave the Lions’ hopes of set-piece dominance? “Teams are smart, they know how to counteract physicality alone,” confirmed the ever-thoughtful Leicester prop Dan Cole. “You can’t just have one way of playing against those guys.”
Hence Howley’s recurring use of the phrase “rugby chaos” to describe the high-intensity training sessions the squad are taking to sharpen their reaction skills for what lies ahead. “That’s rugby in the southern hemisphere,” stressed Howley. “The majority of the game now is from kick returns and turnovers and it’s the ability to react in those situations, not get left behind and be ahead of the game. The challenge for us is for players to play the game they see. That’s the message we keep giving them. You have to get numbers around the ball sometimes but, ultimately, it’s about playing with some talent and playing some intelligent rugby.”
Yet in almost the same breath Howley was conceding it would be unwise of the Lions to reveal their full hand until the Test series starts: “We need to hold back on certain elements and make sure we put our players under the same fatigue and chaos in training that the All Blacks will do.”
The odd provincial defeat would not, he suggested, be the end of the world: “If we lose one or two games but get a good picture of how the All Blacks will play, we’ll be a better side for those experiences.”
Perhaps, even more importantly, the Lions need to display a greater lust for life than in their opening game in Whangarei. Training has certainly been getting feisty – according to Howley it has become “pretty heated” this week – and even an experienced Test Lion such as Johnny Sexton will need to shape up to feature against the All Blacks. “I suppose the word is inconsistent,” said Howley. “I spoke to Johnny and he admitted it.
“It was tough for him but he’s a world-class 10 and he’ll bounce back. He’s a very intelligent rugby player.”

Manchester United really, really want to sign Álvaro Morata, because he’s dead good. At a mere £50m he’s also – and this is important, because after all United have debt to service – cheaper than their other potential line-leading frontman recruits, Everton’s £100m-rated (by Everton) Romelu Lukaku and Torino’s Andrea Belotti (who has just scored more than 20 goals in a season for the first time, so that’ll be £87m please), though Alexandre Lacazette could emerge as an alternative. Real Madrid’s Spanish bench-warmer could end up England-bound as part of a complicated player/cash/other-stuff exchange deal also involving gifted gloveman David de Gea, though Morata himself says he’s perfectly happy in Madrid for the time being. As for Lacazette, he yesterday issued perhaps the football world’s most feeble come-and-get-me plea to English clubs: “The Premier League is interesting,” he enthused. “That does not mean I will go, and that does not mean I will refuse to go.”
While a Morata-De Gea swaperoo remains a possibility United have to identify potential replacements for their current goalkeeper. According to the Mail, “they have the likes of Manchester City’s Joe Hart on a list of names that also includes some from abroad with Gianluigi Donnarumma of Milan and Inter’s Samir Handanovic also discussed”. The same newspaper believes that United are interested in Renato Sanches, who doesn’t appear to be as good as Bayern Munich thought he was going to be but about whom José Mourinho enthusiastically gushed last summer, while his fellow Allianz Arena flop Douglas Costa is a £30m target for Tottenham and Juventus.
Morata might be happier to flee the Bernabéu should Real complete a mooted record-smashing €135m deal for another striker, Monaco’s Kylian Mbappé, which would effectively relegate him to third choice behind the young Frenchman and the older Frenchman Karim Benzema and would also frustrate Arsenal, who were just about ready to demonstrate their financial might with a meaty €100m bid. Arsène Wenger and Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal’s chief executive, set tongues a-wagging when they were spotted at Nice airport – just an hour’s drive away from Monaco, and that’s if you take the scenic coastal route – on Monday.
Virgil van Dijk’s future dominates today’s papers, with the Sun reporting that “Jürgen Klopp is convinced he will beat Manchester City and Chelsea” to the Dutchman, the Mirror announcing that it was the German’s “charisma and enthusiasm” that ensured “Liverpool have won their heavyweight scrap”, and even this newspaper joining in, declaring the Reds have been “informed by the Southampton defender that Anfield is his preferred destination”. Now all Liverpool need to do is actually table a bid for him, and for it to be accepted. Which given that Southampton aren’t terribly keen on selling would appear to be a significant obstacle, though the offer of Mamadou Sakho in part-exchange might help. According to the Independent, Van Dijk and the Roma winger Mohamed Salah will be the first two bricks in a large transfer wall for Liverpool, who by the time they’re finished hope to have signed seven new players. Happily the report contains the word “bumper”.
Celtic may say that Moussa Dembélé is not for sale, or at least not yet, but Milan want to test their resolve. According to the Daily Record, “Milan bosses held an informal meeting with Dembélé’s representatives a month ago, but are now looking to arrange a follow-up discussion.” Should that meeting go well, all the Italian giants would then have to do is actually table a bid for him, and for it to be accepted, though the same paper believes Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund are the Frenchman’s most likely destinations.
Talking of Chelsea, Eden Hazard’s ankle injury might convince them to seek another creative attacking genius, even though the Belgian won’t be out all that long and would have been on holiday for much of that time anyway. Real’s James Rodríguez, almost certain to move somewhere this summer, is apparently an option, while Ángel Di María’s name might also crop up.
On his way out of Stamford Bridge meanwhile is the juvenile goal machine Tammy Abraham, who seems set to take his shooting boots to Newcastle, after Rafael Benítez convinced both the player and his parent club that they could look after him better than rival bidders Brighton. Benítez, says the Telegraph, will now turn his attention to sorting out the opposite end of his team, with a move for the recently-released Manchester City shot-stopper Willy Caballero looking likely.
Frederick Gaudreau sure is doing his best to earn his own locker with the Nashville Predators with a Stanley Cup final debut for the ages.
And with Pekka Rinne turning in his best performance in this series, the Predators are going back to Pittsburgh having tied up the defending champs at 2-2, turning this into a best-of-three sprint to the Stanley Cup.
Gaudreau, an undrafted free agent playing just his sixth postseason game, scored the go-ahead goal 3:45 into the second period, and Rinne made 23 often-spectacular saves as the Predators beat the Penguins 4-1 on Monday night.
The 24-year-old rookie only has a chair in the Predators’ locker room, but he now is the second player in NHL history to score his first three career goals in a Stanley Cup final, joining Johnny Harms with the 1944 Blackhawks.
Calle Jarnkrok, Viktor Arvidsson and Filip Forsberg also scored for Nashville, which improved to 9-1 at home.
Sidney Crosby scored his first goal in the series after not getting a shot on goal in Game 3. The goal was his first in the Stanley Cup final since 4 June 2009 – a span of 12 games. The goal came after he was held without a shot for only the fifth time in his career in the playoffs.
The Penguins now have lost two straight for the second time this postseason. They also lost Games 5 and 6 against Washington. Goalie Matt Murray lost consecutive games for the first time in his young career.
Game 5 is Thursday night in Pittsburgh.
Nashville tapped country singer Dierks Bentley as the latest to sing the national anthem, while country singer Jason Aldean waved the towel to rev up the crowd. Former NBA star and TV commentator Charles Barkley also was on hand, accepting NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman’s invitation to watch in person.
Rain most of Monday kept the crowd outside from reaching the more than 50,000 who turned Saturday night for the first Stanley Cup Final game in Tennessee. Enough people turned out to fill up Broadway for three blocks with three giant TV screens, even with Nashville opening up a downtown amphitheater for fans to watch.
After the anthem, two catfish and one stuffed penguin hit the ice despite Nashville coach Peter Laviolette’s video plea earlier Monday asking fans not to throw anything.
Craig Smith, who had two of Nashville’s first six shots, ricocheted a puck off Murray’s pads that Jarnkrok tapped in at 14:51 to start the fans yelling. Pittsburgh lost a challenge for goalie interference.
Then Crosby, held without a shot for only the fifth time in the postseason in his career, tied it up for Pittsburgh on a breakaway. He skated in on Rinne, holding the puck before scoring behind the goalie’s leg just 66 seconds later for his eighth goal and 24th point of the playoffs.
Rinne kept it tied in the early minutes of the second first with a stop of Jake Guentzel before a big save on Chris Kunitz on a breakaway.
Play was underway when the horn sounded, and officials reviewed a play and ruled Gaudreau’s wraparound attempt slid the puck just over the line before Murray stopped it. Referee Dan O’Halloran announced it as a goal, giving Nashville a 2-1 lead 3:45 into the second.
Crosby had another breakaway nearly midway through the period, and Rinne stopped him not once, but twice. Then the goalie slid to his right stopping Guentzel with an assist from Nashville defenseman Roman Josi.
Arvidsson made it a 3-1 Nashville lead with his first goal since the end of the first round. James Neal started the play, getting the puck to captain Mike Fisher who fed the puck up to Arvidsson while falling to the ice. Arvidsson beat Murray under his glove, putting the puck just inside the right post at 13:08.
Forsberg sealed the win with an empty-netter with 3:23 left.
Fisher, scoreless until the Final, now has four points. He got his fourth on his 37th birthday. ... With his goal, Crosby now has 161 career playoff points and moved past Mike Bossy, Gordie Howe, Al MacInnis and Bobby Smith for 20th all-time by himself. ... The Penguins now are 13-3 after a playoff loss under coach Mike Sullivan, and Murray is 7-1 in playoff games started after a loss.
All blame for Tom Hawkins’ AFL suspension for a jumper punch should rest with the player and nobody else, says match review panel (MRP) member and former Hawkins team-mate Jimmy Bartel.
The MRP has been batting off claims of inconsistency in the AFL’s crackdown on jumper punches since Geelong forward Hawkins became the first high-profile player to cop a one-match ban. The Geelong forward has since accepted the suspension for punching Adelaide’s Matt Crouch.
Bartel, a retired Cats great, said his premiership team-mate Hawkins put himself in the position to be suspended having collected Crouch high. “People need someone to blame and every Monday afternoon, they blame the MRP and they get their frustration out,” Bartel told RSN radio on Tuesday.
“You could maybe blame your players for putting themselves up in front of the MRP. He (Hawkins) just needs to get it out of his game. He’s such a valuable part of the Geelong side. But in the situation (the MRP reviewed) yesterday, he pretty much asserted himself on the Crouch boy ... but he got him high.”
Hawkins’ punch came less than a fortnight after the AFL flagged its intention to crack down on jumper punching after Richmond captain Trent Cotchin controversially escaped with a fine for his blow to Docker Lachie Neale’s face. But in a subsequent game, Sydney’s Zak Jones was also fined rather than banned for a punch to the upper body of Hawthorn’s Luke Breust.
“People keep using the Zak Jones example,” Bartel said. “The difference between Zak Jones and Tom Hawkins: Zak Jones hit Luke Breust in the body, Hawkins hit Crouch in the neck, chin, wherever you want to put it. It’s still above the shoulders, still high.”
The Cats opted not to challenge Hawkins’ ban despite Chris Scott telling Fox Sports he believed the contact amounted to a push to the throat rather than a punch. The Cats have the bye this weekend with Hawkins to miss the round 13 clash against West Coast at Domain Stadium.
The former mixed martial arts fighter Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, known more commonly as War Machine, has been sentenced to life in prison after he kidnapped, sexually assaulted and beat his ex-girlfriend in 2014.
Koppenhaver was convicted by a Las Vegas jury in March of 29 felonies after he attacked Christy Mack and her male friend Corey Thomas. He had found Mack and Thomas together in her bedroom. At sentencing Mack told District Judge Elissa Cadish that she fears Koppenhaver will kill her if he is released. “I don’t know if my life will feel complete in 12 years or 30 years and neither do you, but I do know when he gets out he will kill me,” Mack said. She suffered a lacerated liver, broken rib and lost two teeth during the assault.
Koppenhaver, 35, will be eligible for parole when he is 71. “I should have killed myself by now. There’s no reason right now that I shouldn’t be in the dirt right now laying next to Aaron Hernandez. That’s 100% true,” Koppenhaver said in his statement. Hernandez, the former NFL star, killed himself in prison in April while serving a life sentence for murder.
Koppenhaver said anxiety and depression were to blame for his behavior, but claims he has changed since finding God in prison. “Not a day goes by that I don’t seriously regret all those things that I did. I was a very, very lost, very empty person,” Koppenhaver added in his statement. “And to top it off, something’s not right with my head. Plain and simple. I’ve known that a long time and I’ve hated it. I’ve hated the way that I think. I’ve hated my impulses. Half the time, I don’t know why I do some the things I do. And some of the times I do things and I don’t even feel like I did them until it’s already done.”
Koppenhaver fought in 19 MMA fights, winning 14. He also worked as a pornographic actor.
Most of the British Cycling directors accused of covering up a report into claims of bullying within the GB team will be replaced in reforms set to be voted on at an extraordinary general meeting on 22 July.
The governing body has been under the spotlight since the spring of 2016 when the former GB track sprinter Jess Varnish made allegations about the former technical director Shane Sutton and claimed there was “a culture of fear” in the organisation. The independent panel investigating the affair is expected to produce its final report next week.
On top of the Varnish allegations the organisation has also been faced with the UK Anti-Doping investigation into claims of wrongdoing in the sport, and the reforms mean that at least two thirds of the directors who have been dealing with both issues will have departed.
The independent panel’s preliminary report, which was leaked in March, was scathing about how an internal investigation led by the British Cycling board member Alex Russell had been handled. The report, sent to the boards of British Cycling and UK Sport in December, accused Russell’s fellow directors of “sanitising” and even “reserving” her findings, which resulted in Sutton being found guilty of one relatively minor offence out of the nine with which he had been charged.
A Freedom of Information Act request by Press Association Sport then revealed that UK Sport also had “serious concerns” about the board’s treatment of Varnish’s complaint.
Sutton, who has always maintained his innocence, quit in April 2016, with the former chief executive Ian Drake leaving his post in January. Since then British Cycling has appointed a new chairman in Jonathan Browning, brought in Julie Harrington from the Football Association as chief executive, hired a new human resources executive and revamped its code of conduct.
But even more radical surgery is required if British Cycling is to comply with the sports minister Tracey Crouch’s new governance code. From November, any organisation seeking funding from Sport England or UK Sport must comply with the code, which is intended to raise leadership standards across sport.
Sport England has allocated £17m to British Cycling and UK Sport has said it will provide £26m for the GB Olympic and Paralympic teams’ preparations for Tokyo 2020, but both payments depend on code compliance.
With any major reform needing a vote from the 130,000 membership and the next annual general meeting not scheduled until November, British Cycling was forced to call the EGM. The new senior team have been travelling the country to sell the proposed reforms to its members.
The key changes are a reduction in the number of elected regional directors from six to four, permanent seats for elected representatives from Scotland and Wales, an increase in the number of openly recruited independents from three to four and the appointment of an independent chair. Harrington will also be added to bring the board up to 12 members.
It means the president, Bob Howden, who gave up his role of chairman in February, will lose his position on the board and Browning will have to reapply if he wants to continue as independent chairman, as he must go through an open recruitment process. It is understood the former motor industry executive is considering his options and will decide on what he wants to do after the EGM.
But the other major change is the introduction of a limit for directors of three three-year terms. This means six of the eight elected members on the current board must stand down, with only the Eastern region’s Dr George Gilbert and the Welsh representative, Nick Smith, being eligible to continue. Current independents, Russell and Marion Lauder, can also continue and are expected to do so.
Great Britain’s Land Rover BAR were dealt a severe blow in their attempt to reach the America’s Cup after a failure in their wing handed Team New Zealand the initiative in Bermuda.
Sir Ben Ainslie’s syndicate suffered damage to the wing in the opening race as they rounded the leeward gate, forcing them to retire from the opening race of the challenger semi-finals.
They were unable to complete the repairs to their boat in the available time and they forfeited the second race as a result to hand the New Zealanders – who chose to take on the British crew – a 2-0 lead in the first-to-five races play-offs.
Another two races take place on Tuesday and Ainslie is upbeat his team can bounce back, despite admitting his frustrations at their misfortune on Monday.
He said on his team’s YouTube channel: “It doesn’t get any worse for the team, we felt like we’d made some great improvements overnight, the speed was really good, really positive.
“It’s just such a shame for the whole team to have lost two key races that way. The positive was we felt like we’d improved the speed and the performance of the boat so we’ll come back fighting; it’s another day, the team still very much believe we’re in this and can make it happen.
“When your back is to the wall that’s when you’ve really got to dig deep and we’ve got the team to do that. We’ve all been in tough spots before and we’ve got the experience to know we can come through that. It’s not going to be easy, for sure, but we’ll keep going until the end.”
The first crew in each of the two semi-finals to win five races progresses to the challenger final and whoever wins that takes on the defending champions, Team USA, for the America’s Cup itself.
June is the cruellest month – or at least, it is for Australians at this rather damp ICC Champions Trophy. On a drizzly, doom-laden day at The Oval Australia’s attempt to chase down a modest Bangladesh total was interrupted by heavy evening rain four overs short of a completed game. Maddeningly for Steve Smith, who blocked the final ball of the day before trudging off in exasperation, the Australians were 44 runs ahead at that stage on DLS calculations and strolling it before the skies closed in.
Cue three hours of hoofing bits of kit around the Oval dressing room, desperate to get back out for 20 minutes to prevent a wash-out. In the event a second no result after New Zealand at Edgbaston leaves Australia perilously placed. Bangladesh, who were outplayed here, could now sneak into the semi-finals by beating New Zealand should results fall their way. If England win in Cardiff on Tuesday, Eoin Morgan’s men will be through with a free shot at knocking Australia out in Birmingham.
As a lone, sodden cheerleading beefeater scampered through the evening puddles and a scattering of Bangladeshis cheered wildly at the return of the billowing covers, there were elements of farce to the proceedings. Had this game not been a day-nighter all would have been done and dusted by the time rain made it up the M4. On the other hand Australia probably would have lost to New Zealand in Birmingham, so their points tally is more or less par. But they were deprived here of a chance to boost their run rate by putting a tottering Bangladesh away, which could yet prove key.
And so the tournament goes to Cardiff for a potentially fun, adrenaline-laced encounter between England and New Zealand that is again threatened with the prospect of heavy rain. That game will mark a third of the way through a tournament that has fizzled and sputtered gamely without quite catching fire. Three of five matches staged have been affected by the weather, with a daunting forecast for the week ahead.
For all the discomfort at the intrusion into the International Cricket Council’s carefully planned extravaganza, this is not an uncommon experience in the first half of June. Damp early summers and bone-dry Septembers have become such a feature in recent years that there was, briefly, a move among schools to shift cricket a term back either side of the summer holidays. Four years ago in the last Champions Trophy seven of 15 matches played were affected by rain at exactly the same stage of the summer.
There is, of course, nothing to be done about this, although a useful tweak might be to introduce a little flexibility for drinks breaks and intervals. Four overs short of a full game in a match interrupted by people coming on with water bottles and the full whack for lunch: at times cricket’s enjoyably rigid routines can look unintentionally comic.
At The Oval there was at least a reversal of the batting dominance to date, a function of tight, assertive Australian pace bowling mixed with a supine performance from Bangladesh’s lower order. In keeping with a lop-sided tournament this was only ever going one way from the moment Bangladesh were bullied batting first by Australia’s pace attack, the top order falling away steadily and the tail visibly quaking at the sight of Mitchell Starc bounding in to bowl his death-over toenail-crushers.
Starc hoovered up four wickets in nine balls at the end of his spell, three of his victims bowled while leaping away towards square-leg to reveal all three stumps, like a waiter whisking the cover from a particularly appetising evening meal. Starc can be a daunting prospect. But this was pretty abject.
As it had been for the tournament opener The Oval was alive with a powerful Bangladeshi support on Monday afternoon. Mashrafe Mortaza won the toss and chose to bat, signal for boisterous cheers at every show of batting aggression on a muggy morning during which Australia’s pace attack confirmed its standing as the most powerful in this tournament, zinging the ball past both edge and grille regularly on a fairly docile pitch.
Josh Hazelwood showed the zip and guile England’s openers will have to contend with this winter. Pat Cummins bowled with speed and fire, touching 91mph. Tamim Iqbal kept on swinging, carving at anything with any width and manning the quietly crumbing deck all the way to a pugnacious 95 from 114 balls, before becoming the opening act in Starc’s bravura triple-wicket maiden at the end.
Chasing 182, Australia set off briskly. On 36 David Warner became the third fastest man to 4,000 ODI runs, behind only Viv Richards and Hashim Amla. Then came the rain and an unsatisfying slow death, the floodlights gleaming eerily off the slick covered square, stands long empty. There is still plenty of time for this tournament to catch fire even if, right now, it all looks a little soggy.
The prospect of Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup has been plunged into the most serious doubt after the country’s neighbours broke off diplomatic relations and blockaded its borders. In a culmination of hostilities simmering for years and accusations that Qatar is a major funder of terrorist organisations, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have closed the only land route into the tiny peninsula and refused to allow use of their sea ports or airspace.
The multibillion-dollar preparations to host the 2022 tournament, which involve building nine stadiums and huge infrastructure, is put into perspective by local reports that Qataris are so worried about the blockade that they are stocking up on food. The border with Saudi Arabia is the only road route into the country; Qatar relies on sea ports for its materials and the blockade of airspace is a huge logistical handicap to the country and its flagship airline, Qatar Airways.
The “supreme committee” responsible for building the 2022 World Cup facilities did not issue a public statement but a source acknowledged that the seriousness of the crisis is greater than any of the formidable challenges Qatar has faced since winning the vote in 2010 from Fifa’s now discredited executive committee. The tournament has been switched to the winter to avoid searing summer temperatures, a series of investigations has been held into strongly denied corruption allegations and there has been worldwide criticism of the country’s treatment of its migrant construction workers.
Saudi Arabia said in a statement that it had broken off physical and diplomatic contact due to Qatar’s “embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region”. Resentment has been growing for years, principally over Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, an organisation which the UAE vehemently opposes, but Saudi Arabia also accused Qatar of supporting al-Qaida and Islamic State, extremist groups which have carried out atrocities in the Middle East and Europe.
Qatar has always denied the accusations that it funds terrorist groups and its foreign ministry said in a statement responding to the blockade: “The state of Qatar has been subjected to a campaign of lies that have reached the point of complete fabrication. It reveals a hidden plan to undermine the state of Qatar.”
Qatar’s ruling family and emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, have always intended that hosting an event as globally captivating as the World Cup will dramatically boost the tiny but wealthy country’s profile, and that such “soft power” could help be a bulwark against interference from its neighbours. Now, although there are five years to go, the entire project is facing major doubt.
The English Football Association did not comment on the crisis but the German FA (DFB) president, Reinhard Grindel, said he would discuss it with the German government and Uefa. Grindel promised to look for a “political solution” but said: “The football community worldwide should agree that … major tournaments should not be played in countries that actively support terror.”
Fifa, now sponsored by Qatar Airways, declined to comment except to say: “Fifa is in regular contact with the Qatar 2022 local organising committee and the supreme committee for delivery & legacy handling matters relating to the 2022 Fifa World Cup.”
Hampshire lead the County Championship by 14 points and showed their clinical quality by taking Warwickshire’s last eight wickets for 65 to win by an innings and 94 runs. The contrast with the side whose relegation led to their reprieve last season is stark and unavoidable: Durham are bottom of Division Two on minus 21 points after their fourth defeat in five.
When, early on, Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, having shared 93 for the third wicket, fell in consecutive overs, Warwickshire were left at the mercy of the weather. The rain came but not early enough or for long enough to save them – they were eight down and off the field for only minutes.
Kyle Abbott, a signing exceeding even the loftiest expectations, finished with four for 32, Mason Crane claimed two wickets, including Trott’s, while Sean Ervine, the double-centurion and architect of the victory in his record-breaking stand of 367 with Jimmy Adams, took the final two with his new-fangled off-spin.
That result meant Warwickshire slipped below Somerset, who played out a typically dour Lord’s draw with Middlesex, to the foot of Division One.
For Somerset, after Lewis Gregory dismissed Tom Helm and Tim Murtagh to bowl Middlesex out for 358, a first-innings deficit of 85, there was a welcome return to form for their young captain, Tom Abell. He looked in fine touch for his first half-century of the season and was unbeaten on 71 (although the last few did come off the bowling of John Simpson and Nick Gubbins, so might need expunging from the record books) when hands were finally shaken.
Middlesex, who took 10 points to Somerset’s 11, won the title having drawn their first six matches in 2016 and their first four games this time have been stalemates, too. Scheduling quirks mean they have played two fewer games than Hampshire but already they are 37 points adrift and 14, rather than 16, Championship games means making up lost ground will be tough. They await news on the fitness of Adam Voges, who the captain, James Franklin, expects to be missing for some weeks. Swelling meant a scan on his groin injury, which saw him retire hurt on Sunday, had to be delayed until Tuesday
The theory that Division Two has already splintered into two halves suffered a blow as Worcestershire lost their unbeaten record in a thrashing (by an innings and seven runs) at Sussex, and only rain saved Nottinghamshire from defeat against Derbyshire. The rain arrived at Trent Bridge with the visitors – who have not won a Championship match since July 2015 – five down, and only 26 from victory.
Northamptonshire pulled off a remarkable two-wicket win with a ball to spare at Durham. Paul Coughlin, leading the attack in the absence of six seamers either injured or on international duty, bowled unchanged for 20 overs in Northants’ chase of 205. Defending three off the final over, he took two wickets to complete his maiden 10-wicket haul but the ninth-wicket pair scrambled home for a bye to seal the win. Alex Wakely had earlier made 84 to lead an impressive chase.
It does not get easier for Durham. Their next assignment is on Thursday at second-placed Kent, who welcome the Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah for a four-game stint, including visits to their promotion rivals Nottinghamshire and Worcestershire.
By August 2008 the word had already got out among Premier League scouts that a 22-year-old midfielder from the Ivory Coast, recently signed up by FC Twente after an eye‑catching season on loan at Roda JC, had something about him. It would be instructive to see how he fared at a higher level and a Champions League qualifier for Steve McClaren’s side against Arsenal provided an early chance to find out just how quickly Cheick Tioté was learning. The sight of him sticking to Robin van Persie like glue during Twente’s home leg, subduing the striker into irrelevance with an insistent performance that at times cared little for the boundaries of the law, lingered in more than a few minds and memories would be jolted firmly enough in due course.
Tioté eventually joined Newcastle, who had been attracted by his tenacity and undeterred by an inconsistency in possession that led some suitors to waver, in 2010 and would find himself working for McClaren again five years later. Both had seen better days than a 2015-16 season that reflected appallingly on the Tyneside club but, while McClaren ended up being sacked and scarcely mourned, Tioté was one of the few who rode out a turbulent interlude with his standing among supporters relatively unimpaired.
Given the revolving door at St James’ Park over the past decade, that says plenty. But there had always been good reason to enjoy the presence of Tioté, a wholehearted and proactive performer who played at the kind of intensity fans appreciate even when things are not going well. “I don’t like to make a lot of noise,” he said a few months after his arrival but he had non-verbal ways of making his point. It helped that, in only his 19th appearance for the club – having already picked up eight yellow cards and one red – he produced the kind of flourish that, in the blink of an eye, moulds a cult hero. The left-footed 25-yard volley that pegged Arsenal, opponents he always warmed towards, back to an improbable 4-4 draw was perfect in both execution and timing. The moment was etched instantly in Premier League folklore, never mind that of his club; a bolt from the blue that had never seemed likely and would rarely come close to happening again.
It would be his only goal for Newcastle; the tally of bookings would reach 14 by the end of his first season and discipline was never something he fully mastered. But that was how Tioté operated; there would never be any compromising when a ball was there to be won. “You take that side of the game out of Cheick and you don’t get the same player,” his team-mate James Perch said after a costly red card against Sunderland in October 2012. A Tyne-Wear derby is never an occasion for mistakes, but if anyone could be forgiven such an error it was Tiote. The idea of leaving anything on the pitch was anathema.
Tioté’s was not simply a tale of unchannelled aggression. Between 2011 and 2013 he and Yohan Cabaye formed one of the league’s best midfield partnerships – an efficient blend of vision, vigour and tactical intelligence whose apex came in a 3-0 win against Manchester United in January 2012. This was Tioté’s peak but, while Cabaye would move on, he stayed at Newcastle despite intermittent talk of interest from Champions League clubs – in particular Arsenal, a move he would certainly have welcomed. As Newcastle’s fortunes ebbed, his own form and fortune did too, injuries dogging his final two seasons and ensuring that, by the time he moved to Beijing Enterprises in February, disappointment about his departure was more sentimental than directed towards its impact on a revitalised team’s promotion campaign.
Joining a club at the highest level may have eluded him but Tioté appeared twice in Ivory Coast’s Africa Cup of Nations-winning campaign of 2015. That success meant everything; little had come easy during his early days in football, starting out at the semi‑professional club FC Bibo in his home city of Yamoussoukro and finessing his qualities without the aid of proper boots until the age of 15.
“That’s what made me who I am today,” he said of an upbringing that guaranteed nothing. Tioté, though, would turn into a player who guaranteed every ounce of perspiration he had as soon as he stepped on to a pitch. The frayed edges were there, but for a time he was one of the best; it is a tragedy that football, and the world he inhabited beyond it, should be mourning him now.
Eoin Morgan was not the first great Irishman to suggest that “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness” but he may be in agreement with Oscar Wilde.
For Morgan at least acknowledges that his England side, transformed since the calamitous World Cup of 2015, has now acquired many of the qualities of the Kiwi side that humbled them in Wellington, New Zealand, in February 2015. On that dismal day for English cricket Morgan’s team were beaten by eight wickets with 37.4 overs to spare. The New Zealanders required 124 runs for victory and were none too circumspect in their response. Brendon McCullum hit 77 from 25 balls.
Morgan was reminded of that contest “for want of a better word” while the rain was falling at Cardiff. “It was sort of men against boys,” he said before adding to no one’s surprise, “but I think it’s completely different now, two years down the line. We’ve got a completely new team pretty much [in fact five of those who endured that match at Wellington could play in Cardiff on Tuesday]. And hopefully we are moving forward.”
No doubt England have progressed and their template was very much in the image of New Zealand’s 2015 World Cup campaign. McCullum and Morgan are good friends and England’s captain, being an intelligent man, is bound to have picked the brains of the former Kiwi captain.
Morgan was not too keen to emphasise how England have learnt from New Zealand. To adopt the pupil/teacher pose just before a vital clash between the two countries might not be appropriate. But he acknowledged the impact of that 2015 World Cup.
“If you look at the top four teams that got to the semi-final stage in the World Cup, they all seemed to score regular totals over 350. So I think they’ve contributed to the change as a whole.
“The way New Zealand went about playing their cricket was probably closer to the way we go about it now. We have very similar characteristics and values as a side and it’s probably the easiest relate to them out of those four teams that made the later stages. I think the dominant factor with New Zealand was that they had that crucial confidence within the group at the time, whereas we didn’t have it.”
Morgan can claim with justification that there is that confidence within his squad now. This helps to explain a reluctance to tinker with his team – or at least his batsmen. Faith in Jason Roy remains and he will open the batting.
That yearning for consistency also enhanced the chances of Steven Finn getting the call-up once Chris Woakes’ side strain had been diagnosed.
Morgan said Finn was the straightforward choice, backing up consistency of selection and the trust they have shown in their players recently. “We’ve tried to go like for like [when choosing replacements] as often as we can.
“But when we can’t we go for a guy we can throw the ball to at any stage in order to try to make an impact on the game. And Finny is one of those guys. I’d have no hesitation in playing him tomorrow if we felt it was the right thing to do.
“It all depends on the wicket,” Morgan said, before remembering to mention the quality of pace bowling already in his squad.
However, he did not mention Finn’s chilling experience in that Wellington match more than two years ago. Sometimes bowling figures lie but, however one stares at 2-0-49-0, they do not look good. The one-word explanation is McCullum. At least on Tuesday the Kiwis’ World Cup captain will be in some commentary box, where he can cause little damage.
The make-up of the bowling attack will occupy Morgan’s mind on Tuesday morning. Mark Wood, Liam Plunkett, Ben Stokes – recovering fast from his knee problems – and Moeen Ali are bound to play. Then England must pick two from Adil Rashid, Jake Ball, David Willey and Finn.
A sweaty pitch favours retaining two pace bowlers; so, too, do the short, straight boundaries in Cardiff. However, there is also the notion that the Kiwis might not play Rashid as well as some of the Asian nations. And the leg‑spinner, though left out against Bangladesh, has been a trusted performer in ODIs.
New Zealand were probably robbed of victory when the rain fell at Edgbaston in their match against Australia. They retain the no-holds barred approach that McCullum insisted on two years ago, have three hostile pacemen in Tim Southee, Adam Milne and Trent Boult and some dangerous strikers of the ball as well as Kane Williamson, the Kiwi Joe Root – or is it the other way round?
Martin Guptill hits a long ball at the top of the order for such a mild-mannered man and a former opening batsman for Derbyshire. Like Morgan he did not wish to exaggerate the similarities between the two sides but he recognised that England “have a similar brand of batting to the way we’ve gone about our business over the last few years”.
He said: “So it’s probably going to be a pretty exciting game tomorrow and I think the fans are looking forward to it.”
There is indeed much to savour if the puddles disappear. An opening pair of Guptill and Luke Ronchi does not let many deliveries pass harmlessly by; or as our great Irishman (still not Morgan) once admitted they “can resist everything except temptation”.
Morgan reports Stokes to be pain-free and ‘nearly there’
England are bubbling with an optimism that defied the thick grey clouds and long white tarpaulins visible on arrival in Cardiff on Monday. Eoin Morgan, the captain, may have lost the services of Chris Woakes with a strained side but he is bullish about the advance of Ben Stokes, his totemic all-rounder with the dodgy left knee for a match against New Zealand where a win would secure a passage into the semi-finals.
“I think he’s very close to full fitness. He came through the other day [when England played Bangladesh at The Oval], bowling more overs [seven] than we intended. But I think we’re nearly there. He’s had no pain in five days now. So, if that continues, there’s a chance he may bowl 10 overs.”
Some of England’s players, including Stokes, were staying very close to the scene of the latest atrocity in London but Morgan is confident his men can deal with the climate of uncertainty and the nature of the security measures in place.
“Within our team there are no concerns. I think we sort of proved that we can cope in Leeds after what happened in Manchester [England played South Africa at Headingley immediately after the terrorist attack at the Manchester Arena]. Obviously the guys are chatting about it constantly because it’s not very far from where we stayed and a lot of us live nearby. So we’re always talking about it and making sure that everybody feels they can talk about it and not hide away from it.”
The make-up of England’s team is undecided, mostly because of the torrential rain that fell on Cardiff on Monday. Morgan has glimpsed the surface. “It looked like a reasonably good pitch yesterday [Sunday] but an extra 24 hours under the hot, sweaty cover might change things in the morning. There’s normally a lot of grass here, not necessarily green grass, but with quite a thatchy feel to the wicket. I’ll think about it for another 24 hours.”
Morgan will be thinking about his best bowling attack rather than his batsmen. He implied that Jason Roy, his out-of-form opener, will stay in the side for at least one more game. “Jason has obviously lacked runs but certainly everybody in the team, the squad and the backroom staff feel that a score is around the corner. So hopefully it is tomorrow.” And hopefully Roy is of the same mind as everyone else.
The choice of bowlers is dictated by various factors: there are two short straight boundaries to consider but perhaps more significant is the sweatiness of the pitch, which will be minutely examined this morning. The think-tank’s observations will decide whether England opt for two spinners by recalling Adil Rashid – surprisingly omitted from the first game against Bangladesh having played in 41 of England’s previous 44 ODIs.
Rashid might have been deflated by that decision but Morgan said: “Adil is quite relaxed about things. Everybody wants to play, all 15. It’s not easy leaving guys out sometimes. We select the man we think is the best chance of winning that particular game.” The prize for winning this game for England is unusually significant. Victory for Morgan’s side would guarantee them a semi-final berth.
Warren Gatland is demanding more physicality and intensity from his British and Irish Lions players but has dismissed claims he is a one-dimensional coach whose sides only play one way. Instead he has urged his reshuffled team to go out and be positive against the Blues on Wednesday under the captaincy of Scarlets’ hooker Ken Owens.
The Lions’ underwhelming display in their opening tour fixture in Whangarei has generated some unflattering local media coverage and Gatland is already sick and tired of the phrase ‘Warrenball’ being applied to his methods. He insists he merely encourages sides to play to their strengths and blames the former England attack coach Brian Smith for inventing the phrase.
“Look, a few years ago Brian Smith coined a phrase ‘Warrenball’, and I don’t know whether that was because he was jealous of how much success we had. We had a group of players who came through Wales at the time who ended up being pretty big physical players. The modern game of rugby is about getting across the gainline, trying to get front-foot ball and playing to space if that is possible.
“I think in a way it is an opportunity for people who want to be critical. We experienced that four years ago (in the 2013 series in Australia) when people decided to be critical and a lot of people got caught with their pants down afterwards, didn’t they?”
Far from relying on a simple crash ball approach on this tour, Gatland believes the Lions will have to vary their game if they want to win a series against the All Blacks for the first time since 1971.
“To match the All Blacks you have got to display a bit of X-factor. If that X-factor means an offload or doing something that is a little bit outside the box, the players are being encouraged to do that because that is what we are going to need to beat them. We don’t want to be prescribed and we don’t want to play by numbers.
“Hopefully, we can show that on Wednesday and the players can perform what they are being encouraged by the coaches to do. The message to the players is that we want to play positive rugby, we want to be able to move the ball and shift it and create chances. We know we didn’t play so well on Saturday and it gives us an opportunity to go out and against the Blues and be positive.”
Gatland was also interested to hear from his son Bryn that Saturday’s game against the Provincial Barbarians was more physical than a typical Super Rugby encounter. No one is suggestng the Blues, with eight current or former All Blacks in their ranks, will be a soft touch but the Lions management do want their forwards to make more of an impact at Eden Park. “We’ve got to be able to ramp that physicality up in the games leading up to the first Test,” confirmed Gatland. “These games will help us get to grips with the intensity of what New Zealand rugby brings.”
The Lions have opted for a completely fresh XV against the Blues, with Owens leading a team containing 11 new Lions, including the Irish centre pairing of Robbie Henshaw and Jared Payne and English wingers Elliot Daly and Jack Nowell.
Six of the eight forwards will be making their Lions bows, including James Haskell at 6 and Maro Itoje in the second-row. Pencilled in at inside centre for the Blues is Sonny Bill Williams, who is expected to play despite a slight knee problem, while the experienced Charlie Faumuina starts in the front row. Back-row forward Jerome Kaino (knee) and England’s current Argentina tourist, Piers Francis, are missing but a clutch of younger players will be hoping to use the occasion to further their reputations.
With over 40,000 tickets already sold, a near sell-out is anticipated, although head coach Tana Umaga is conscious of his team’s recent heavy schedule: “There’s no doubt it will be a challenging turnaround for us. In the last 30 days we have played four Super games in New Zealand, South Africa and Samoa and now the British and Irish Lions. But it is a special occasion and I hope the guys do themselves, their families and their club proud.”
Umaga’s last meeting with the Lions was in 2005 when he was involved in the fateful incident in the first Test in Christchurch that brought a premature end to Brian O’Driscoll’s tour. Memories of that episode have inevitably been rekindled this week but Umaga believes it is time to move on. “That was 12 years ago,” he said. “If people can’t put it behind them then I suppose they never will.”
Itoje, meanwhile, has spoken of his personal shock following the terror attack in his native London. “It’s tough,” admitted the Saracens lock. “These things are happening a bit too often for anyone’s liking. It’s a real dark and crass situation which we all wish doesn’t happen again. My heart and condolences go out to all those involved.
“These things are always more daunting when they happen on your doorstep, in your home city, the city you’ve grown up in. It is tough but in these kind of situations London and the whole of Britain show how resilient they are and how quickly we’ll bounce back.”

There are two meetings on the Flat this afternoon and two more this evening, but the most valuable card of the day – and by some distance – is over the jumps at Newton Abbot, where there is £68,000 to play for against the £57,000 on offer at Leicester. 
The feature event at the west country track is a £20,000 handicap hurdle which had eight runners, ideal for each-way betting purposes, at the overnight stage. Unfortunately, Ashoka has been taken out this morning and each-way punters will now need to find one of the first two home. That promises to be a much more difficult task in a race where five of the runners are currently trading between 5-1 and 6-1, and there is a fair case to be made for the 14-1 outsider, Magie Du Ma. 
Cleni Wells, the bottom weight, is attracting money this morning and goes to post with every chance having finished a good second over course and distance six days ago. He runs off the same mark today, but slight preference is for Rossetti (3.10), who returned to winning form last time out and is just 3lb higher today. Neil Mulholland’s gelding, who started his jumping career in Jersey where his wins included the Channel Islands Champion Hurdle, rattled off a four-timer last summer after joining his current yard, culminating in a three-and-three-quarter length success from a mark of 134. That form gives him a leading chance racing off 135 today, and a quarter-mile step up in trip could also eke out a little more improvement. 
Deauville Dancer (4.45) should follow up his easy win a week ago in the two-mile handicap chase, while Alcala (2.40) may be refreshed by a month-and-a-half off and resume his progress over fences in the novice event on the same card. 
Showers are forecast at Ayr today ahead of the card at the track this evening which could have an effect on the going, but Fieldsman (8.25) is worth backing to get off the mark for David O’Mears in the seven-furlong handicap. This will be Fieldsman’s fourth run for his new yard, and the most promising of those by some way was his fourth place over today’s course and distance five days ago. That race was run in a decent time and the five-year-old is still 3lb below his winning mark in a better race than today’s at Newmarket last May. 
Ice Age (7.40) and Arsenio Lupin (8.40) should both go well at Windsor this evening, while Meteor Light (3.20) could be the answer to the best race of the day at Leicester. Ed Vaughan’s three-year-old was gelded over the winter and returned to win a maiden at Nottingham last month with something to spare. That was just Meteor Light’s second start, he has fared well in the draw with stall 14 and he can make the most of a perfectly fair opening mark of 80.

On Sunday, Jürgen Klopp gave a wildly optimistic interview to Liverpool’s own website. “We can really improve, that’s what I’m really looking forward to,” he trilled. “I’m really optimistic for our future, not because I’m crazy but only because I know what we have, I know what we will get, I know what we can get.” Journalists immediately got to work discovering what they can get, and the answer they came up with was: Lyon’s wildly coveted £60m-rated striker Alexandre Lacazette, whose future is once again up in the air after the team he was set to sign for, Atlético Madrid, were hit with a transfer ban. “Klopp has set his sights on signing a big-name striker this summer and Lacazette certainly fits the bill,” screech the Express, while less encouragingly the Lyon chairman, Jean-Michel Aulas, said “the decision to let Alexandre go is now under scrutiny” and that “I would prefer that he stays”.
Liverpool aren’t going to stop there, and are unwilling to meekly yield to Manchester City’s massive chequebook in the race for Southampton’s Virgil van Dijk: the Liverpool Echo reports that they are prepared to match any offer made by City or Chelsea – with bidding set to open at £50m – and that, more encouragingly still, they “believe money will not be the decisive factor and have been encouraged by the feedback received from Van Dijk’s representatives”.
Another rumour concerning Klopp’s side is all over the back pages of several papers this morning, who reflect widespread excitement about the impending conclusion to their pursuit of Roma’s Mohamed Salah, with all parties concerned on the verge of agreeing a £35m deal to take the Egyptian winger back to England. Another much-mooted move that could be imminently completed is that of Tottenham’s Kyle Walker to Manchester City, with the Star revealing that “Etihad chiefs are confident of completing the move once England’s games with Scotland and France have taken place”.
If only everything were so straightforward. For example, Eden Hazard’s weekend pronouncements over his future have been carried by the Sun under the banner “Staying: Hazard’s not sub-standard” while in the Star the headline of choice is: “Hazard hints he may join Gareth” and the Express goes for “I’m open to Real deal says Hazard”. So, in short, he is either staying or going.
Elsewhere there is plenty of news about transfers that are not going to happen. Celtic, for example, will not entertain any offers for Moussa Dembélé, at least unless they are eliminated from the Champions League in August’s qualifying round, whereupon he’s yours for £30m. Also, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is happy at Arsenal, Gareth Bale is even happier in Madrid, and Anthony Martial’s agent says “there is no reason for him to leave Manchester” unless “Ed Woodward tells me they want him to leave” which, just to clarify, he hasn’t.
What would have come of Swansea last season if they didn’t have the one-man goal-and-assist-machine Gylfi Sigurdsson among their otherwise rank ranks? It is a question with only the miserable of answers, but thankfully for the Swans it is only speculation. Less happily next season they could find out for sure, with Leicester first to dip their toes in the Icelandic waters by tabling an official enquiry. Sigurdsson, adds the Mail, is valued at £30m and also “wanted by Everton as Ronald Koeman looks to add more goals from his midfield”. Swansea will strengthen this summer, though, and have held talks with PSV Eindhoven over their £12m-rated Chilean defender Santiago Arias – also being monitored by Everton, West Ham and Tottenham – though according to the Star they may end up with Barnsley’s Andy Yiadom instead.
Everton’s pursuit of more goals from midfield might also be achieved by snaffling Leicester’s own Riyad Mahrez, though the player would prefer Arsenal or Chelsea to sign him please, while Koeman – linked over the weekend with a move to replace the outgoing Romelu Lukaku with Jamie Vardy – has also identified a goalkeeper who would come cheaper than Sunderland’s Jordan Pickford, in the shape of Gent’s Lovre Kalinic.
The Cavaliers put up a strong fight but still fell 132-113 in Game 2 of the NBA finals to the Golden State Warriors, a superteam who are starting to look – and this postseason literally are – unbeatable.
The Cavaliers played significantly better than they did in the first game of the series, but a triple-double from LeBron James, 20 forced turnovers and 15 steals still weren’t enough to topple the best team in decades. It was Golden State’s 14th consecutive win in the playoffs, besting the longest postseason win streak in league history.
After the game, James summarized how it must feel to face the Warriors in this sort of form. Asked what he needed after the game, he replied simply: “some food ... and some wine.”
Leading the Warriors’ effort – again – was Kevin Durant, with 33 points. He did it all. He made incredible plays off his own rebounds. He swatted away the ball from several defenders, including James. He even made a shot while falling to the ground.
“We can’t give up 23 points off our turnovers. Especially a championship team like that, they’re going to thrive off it,” Durant said. “We could play hard every possession, but can we play smart?”
Team-mate Steph Curry danced circles around his defenders with some nasty crossovers, and ignited the offense with 32 points in his triple-double performance. The crowd shot to its feet whenever Klay Thompson scored. The Splash Brother has been struggling in the postseason but slipped out of his slump, adding 22 points and 7 rebounds. JaVale McGee continued to be impactful, with a huge block and a massive dunk over Kevin Love after he came off the bench. Andre Iguodala also had a colossal block on Channing Frye that brought the crowd to its feet.

Based on the first two games, the next NBA champion appears a done deal. Now it could just be a question of who will be finals MVP.
But it should be remembered that the Cavaliers were 2-0 down at this stage last year, and they didn’t take Sunday’s loss lying down. Indeed, they were just three points down going into halftime.
“It’s been a great run, but none of that matters unless we can finish the job,” said the Warriors’ head coach, Steve Kerr. “Heading to Cleveland we’re gonna have to be a lot smarter. If we play that game in Cleveland, we’re not winning.”
James carried the team on offense and defense, scoring 29 points and stealing the ball several times. He even joined Magic Johnson and Jerry West as the only players to reach 300 career assists in the finals. Kevin Love caught fire early, assisting James with 27 points and 7 rebounds. Kyrie Irving managed 19 points after being guarded heavily by Thompson.
The Warriors had a standout performance, but the loudest cheers at Oracle Arena went to Kerr. He returned to the bench to coach the Warriors after missing most of the postseason due to health issues. Each time the camera turned to him the crowd went wild, and they gave Kerr a standing ovation when the lineup was announced.
Another standing ovation for Steve Kerr. Everyone's very glad to see him back and healthy #NBAFinals2017 pic.twitter.com/zQeFBmO9Po
With the series heading to Cleveland for two games, the Cavs must hope they can improve again and level the series on home turf. But based on the evidence so far, the Warriors may be simply too good to beat.
Liverpool are close to agreeing a £35m deal for Roma’s Mohamed Salah, with reports suggesting the Egypt winger could finalise a move to Anfield this week.
Talks have been continuing between the parties for some time and Roma rejected an initial £28m bid from Liverpool a few days ago. However, Jürgen Klopp is determined to acquire Salah and, with the player also believed to be keen on the switch, it appears an agreement is close to being reached following an increased bid from the Merseysiders.
Should the transfer happen it would be a case of second time lucky for Liverpool, who wanted Salah in 2014 only to see him move to Chelsea instead from the Swiss club Basel. He struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge, however, and in 2015 moved to Italy, joining Fiorentina on loan before moving to Roma, also on loan, soon after.
That became a long-term move last August and Salah has subsequently flourished for the Giallorossi. In the 2016-17 Serie A season the 24-year-old scored 15 goals and assisted 13 others in 31 league appearances.
Klopp believes Salah can provide Liverpool with an injection of pace in their attacking front line, something that is all but absent when Sadio Mané is unavailable, as he was for the whole of January after travelling to Gabon to represent Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations and then for the final six weeks or so of the campaign just finished after collecting a knee injury in the 3-1 victory over Everton on 1 April.
Such is Liverpool’s determination to acquire Salah that they are willing to make him the joint most-expensive signing in their history, following on from the £35m spent on purchasing Andy Carroll from Newcastle United in January 2011. Salah is expected to earn in the region of £90,000 a week at Anfield.
Liverpool have already signed one player in the close season – the England Under-20 striker Dominic Solanke, who will arrive on Merseyside on 1 July following the end of his contract with Chelsea – and, with the club having reached the Champions League qualifying stages, Klopp is determined to add to his resources between now and the first leg in August.
As well as targeting Salah, the German is also believed to be keen on acquiring Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from Arsenal, Naby Keita from Red Bull Leipzig and the Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk.
Gareth Bale has insisted that he has no intention of leaving Real Madrid this summer amid speculation that Manchester United may attempt to sign the Wales international for a fee of more than £100m.
Bale was a second-half substitute in his home city of Cardiff as Real became the first side to retain the status as European champions since the Champions League era began with a comprehensive 4-1 win against Juventus on Saturday.
That victory ensured Bale became the first Welshman to win club football’s most prestigious tournament for the third time at the end of a season during which the 27-year-old has been plagued by injury.
Bale made only 19 league appearances for the club as they won a first La Liga title since 2011. Having attempted to prove his fitness for the final, Bale did not start against Juventus with the manager, Zinédine Zidane, opting instead for Isco. That has fuelled rumours that United could turn to Bale after cooling their approach for Antoine Griezmann after the Frenchman confirmed on Sunday that he would not be leaving Atlético Madrid this summer after the Spanish club’s transfer ban was upheld by Fifa.
Bale, who agreed a new deal in October lasting until 2022 worth £350,000 a week after tax and with a €1bn buyout clause, was adamant that he wants to remain at the club he joined in September 2013 from Tottenham Hotspur for £85m, which was then a world-record fee.
“I’ve signed a long-term contract at Madrid,” he said. “My family is happy and I am happy so, yeah, we will continue what we are doing. We are winning trophies and I am happy.
“I’ve worked double sessions for three, four weeks to get myself ready for this, to get myself fit, recover from the surgery – which still has a little more healing to do – but I will be able to rest in the summer, do some more rehab and then come next season stronger. It’s been a tough year with a lot of football and the injuries, but the main thing for me is to get my ankle sorted and give it that rest it needs. I came back too early from the surgery. But I still finished the season happy, it’s a great finish with another trophy.”
United tried to sign Bale in 2013 when David Moyes succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford but were beaten to his signature. The Welshman’s representatives have dismissed reports linking him with a return to the Premier League, stressing that he has no desire to leave the most successful club in global football. Given that he has now won seven major trophies in only four years in Spain, it is hard to argue that this Madrid side is up there with some of the most successful in history.
“We’re used to this,” Bale said. “We have won three Champions Leagues in four seasons so we have to be in that category. All we can keep doing is keep working hard and hopefully there will be more to come. I think we can get better.
“We are still quite young as a whole team and we have a great squad. We haven’t just got a great eleven, we have a great squad so if any injuries come along there are other people who can do a job. We are strong and confident and the plan is to win more.
“This adds to the history of this club. This club is the biggest in Champions League history ever and now we have even more. It’s great to be a part of.”
Since John McEnroe turned the air blue in the 80s, memorably at decorous Wimbledon but without fear or favour across the tennis landscape, the sport has struggled to accommodate what it regards as unsportsmanlike conduct, as quaint a notion as unparliamentary behaviour at Westminster.
There have been some classic outbursts in the first week of this French Open. Nick Kyrgios brought his fines for the past 12 months to £25,000 with a racket smash during his exit at the hands of Kevin Anderson, and Novak Djokovic was soundly ticked off for gesturing to throw his racket at the umpire at a stressful moment in his tortured win against Diego Schwartzman on Friday.
Andy Murray internalises his angst, beating himself up verbally rather than abusing his racket, the ground or the ball kids.
En route to the fourth round against the young Russian Karen Khachanov on Monday, Murray has chuntered, cursed, smiled and shushed – all in rhythm with his sense of comfort and the level of his play. After a lot of “shushing” to himself and a few wicked glances towards his box in his tense win against Juan Martín del Potro on Saturday, he was happy to explain, perhaps for the first time in detail, what makes his verbal tics tick.
“I was still muttering a lot today,” he said, “maybe not so much at the beginning – but I was losing at the beginning. I don’t know how much of an impact it has on my tennis. What is actually relevant is not what I say the four or five seconds after a point is finished; what’s relevant is the 10, 15 seconds before the next point starts, what is actually going through my head.
“If I’m thinking about the next point and what I’ve done wrong or what I’ve done right in the previous point, that’s very positive. If I’m muttering for 20 seconds, then that isn’t going to be a good thing because I’m not thinking about the next point.
“I felt like when I was getting frustrated [on his way to defeating Del Potro 7-6, 7-5, 6-0]. I stopped myself fairly quickly and got back to playing the right way. I turned it around quickly – and I deserve credit for doing that. I know my head right now is in the right place because I am working things out on the court and that’s what I care about.”
It would be a shame if Murray ever succumbed to the urgings of those who find his on-court ramblings odd or disturbing. They are part of who he is. He has discussed it with professionals, he reveals – although he has not considered using a psychologist this year, which is proving difficult after the non-stop highs of 2016.
“I feel like when I’ve used sports psychologists in the past, I’ve done it when I felt like I wanted to. That’s the most important thing. If it is forced upon you, I don’t really think that that works. You need to be the one deciding ‘I want to do this’.”
Murray’s is the contentment of the driven champion, not necessarily that of a banker, coalminer or journalist. The adrenaline that rushes through him in moments of tension during a big match is surely what keeps him coming back for more.
“I wasn’t playing well enough last week to win the tournament,” he also admitted. “When I was practising, I wasn’t playing well enough. But things can change very quickly. You don’t become a bad tennis player overnight. It can only take one or two good practices, providing you’re trying to do the right things in practice. It wasn’t going to be easy but I feel like I’ve done a good job of that. I’m playing way better than I was a week, 10 days ago.”
And that’s the beauty of Murray: it is impossible to predict which version of him will turn up.
But which Khachanov will we get? Murray takes a walk into the relatively unknown at the beginning of the second week – against a boy named Karen (with the emphasis on the second syllable, he reminded us on Sunday), who played some tough tennis to get the better of John Isner over four sets in three hours on the claustrophobic court 2.
The 21-year-old Russian has not quite lived up to the 2013 assessment of his compatriot, the former world No1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who said of him: “He will be in the top 20 by the end of 2015.” But he reached a career-high of 42 last month before slipping to 53, four places behind Kyle Edmund and two ahead of Dan Evans. He did look like a top-20 player against Isner, who struck 14 aces to go with the 66 he had already accumulated at the top of the tournament’s serving statistics.
Khachanov beat the stubborn American at his strong suit as well, prevailing in two of the three tie-breaks to win 7-6 (1), 6-3, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (3). He is unlikely to need motivation in the biggest match of his life but he might draw inspiration from trying to avenge Murray’s win over Del Potro. The Argentinian was Khachanov’s favourite player growing up in Moscow.
But, he said, he will not explode like his other hero, the eccentric Russian Marat Safin. Khachanov’s off-court obsession is chess, so there will be plenty of room for mind games.
The British & Irish Lions management have called for a rethink on tour scheduling following their team’s sluggish opening display on Saturday. The Lions hierarchy say the squad need more time to prepare, having been required to play their opening game within 80 hours of arriving in New Zealand.
John Spencer, the tour manager, remains confident his players will swiftly improve but he wants this Lions squad to be the last to embark on a major series on the opposite side of the world within a week of the domestic season ending.
“I certainly hope so,” Spencer said when asked if he wanted future tour itineraries to be amended in the light of his side’s lacklustre 13-7 win against a Provincial Barbarians XV in Whangarei.
There are also those who believe the Lions should reduce the amount of corporate and community work they do and allocate more time to their rugby. The players, still struggling to shake off the effects of jet lag, spent Sunday morning in Waitangi, where they received a stirring Maori welcome before returning to Auckland to prepare for their second game of the tour, against the Blues on Wednesday.
Spencer, who said the squad’s thoughts and prayers were with the victims of the London Bridge terror attack, is hoping the Lions will be allocated a more helpful slot in the global timetable from 2021 onwards.
“We have always been disappointed in the preparation time,” the former England centre said. “It is arranged for us and we have to take our lot. We hope that, when the global calendar is eventually resolved, just once every four years we will get an extra week at home.”
The Lions manager, however, has defended the decision to sign up to a tough 2017 schedule and not to fly out players early to prepare for the opening fixture. “We think it can be very divisive to split the squad and then try to get it back together again. It isn’t a great difficulty to bond four nations but you don’t want to add distractions to that.
“We don’t mind the schedule of matches and it is welcomed by the coaches and players. You cannot come to New Zealand and try to win Test matches without being tested to the core. I don’t think we need any knee-jerk reactions.
“The first match of the tour is always difficult because you have just travelled. I remember in 1971 we won all our provincial matches here. We won 20 provincial matches but lost the first one in Queensland. These things happen.”
However, Sam Warburton, the Lions captain, has acknowledged that his team need to play significantly better against the Blues and the Crusaders. “We want to be tested,” the Welsh flanker said. “We don’t want to be playing teams where we’re winning by 40 points. They’re the best teams for us right now to compare.
“On Saturday we lost the physical battle in the first half and I don’t think we won enough collisions in defence. That’s the way it is over here; nothing is going to happen easily. We’ve got three weeks now to get as good as we can. It’s how good we are in three weeks’ time that’s really important.”
Ben Te’o confirmed several Lions players were feeling the effects of jet lag before and during the match on Saturday. “The boys are still a little bit jet-lagged but no excuse,” the centre said.
“We had to come here and play hard. They were a good side and we got tested. If I’m honest, the last three days have been really tough: waking up at 1am, some guys getting one or two hours’ sleep.
“Boys were really, really tired before training, before games. But we’ve got to push through and over the next few days it’s going to get a lot easier. The guys playing on Wednesday will probably be feeling a lot better.”
In 2013, dual Brownlow medallist Greg Williams described Joel Selwood as “too courageous for his own good”, and a walking time bomb who needed to be protected from himself. That Williams had been diagnosed with a degenerative brain condition that he linked to repeated head-knocks provided his caution with a hint of menace.
Responding on Nine’s Footy Classified shortly after Williams’ warning, Selwood said there were many things that he’d learnt as a kid that he couldn’t take out of his game. “It’s just so hard to change,” Selwood said. “There are times in games when you have to go for the footy, and that’s one thing that I’ve never had a problem with.”
Here we are, four years later and still not much has changed. The atmosphere of a siege still pervades Selwood’s game and he consciously ignores every self-preserving impulse any normal person should have. He ignored them again during the first quarter on Friday night at Simonds Stadium, when he had a tête-à-tête with Andy Otten’s elbow. This time Selwood hit the ground hard, getting to his feet with a head that looked as if it had come out Kathy Griffin’s prop bag.
Notwithstanding the chunk missing from above his right ear, Selwood pushed away the club’s medical staff to try and return to the contest, ten years of hard-at-it football fashioning his stride, his face again painted in blood. As he reluctantly sought treatment on the bench, the editors at Seven’s Friday night football coverage began splicing together film of the collision to add to a Selwood showreel already crammed with enough blood and hits to the head to make the Rocky films seem tame.
Selwood returned to the ground early in the second quarter with 12 stitches and another scar on the side of his head. “He doesn’t need any more [scars],” said his younger brother and teammate Scott after the Cats posted an impressive 22-point win against fellow Premiership hopefuls Adelaide. “He has got enough scars and he is ugly enough as it is.”
He’s also got enough Brownlow votes (without having won it), but will probably end up with three more after another best afield performance – 21 contested possessions and nine clearances that continued the Crows’ sorry record at Simonds stadium, a venue at which they’ve not won since 2003.
Selwood’s game had been infused with iron long before he first walked through the door at Kardinia Park at the dawn of a Geelong era. The comedian Jerry Lewis once confessed that he tried to get his father to show some emotion by offering him $50,000 to smack Lewis around. Selwood had his two talented older brothers do it for free.
Like a lot of kids, Selwood played his first competitive game of football when he was eight. The difference was that Selwood played his in his brothers’ under-12 team. “We were short, so he bobbed up in his first game as an eight-year-old playing against 12-year-olds and he kicked two or three goals off the forward flank,” older brother Troy recalled to The Age’s Michael Gleeson in 2007.
All sporting eras contain a little bit of luck, and Geelong’s may have been that Selwood had to undergo knee surgery after just six games into his final season with the Bendigo Pioneers in the TAC Cup. This is the only reason why a kid who AFL national talent manager Kevin “Shifter” Sheehan rated as “the best 17-year-old in Australia” fell to Geelong after Hawthorn took luckless Mitchell Thorp with pick six.
From his first game of AFL football, Selwood has personified a harder and more talented Geelong. His early years were a reminder that it’s not always just the old guys who know what toughness means. But not only is Selwood the Cats’ hardest (it’s almost as if he seeks the stitches and scars), for a good part of his ten-and-a-half seasons he has also been the most influential.
By any conventional measure, Selwood is a champion of the game: three Geelong best and fairest awards, five all-Australians nods (three as captain) and three premierships. Selwood also has four AFLPA Robert Rose Awards for Most Courageous. After he won his last three in 2012, 2013 and 2014, you suspect the AFL now just award it to the runner-up.
But despite his burgeoning trophy cabinet, Selwood has been the star who hasn’t seemed to care much about being one. If Patrick Dangerfield has assumed the superstar mantle at Geelong, you sense that it suits Selwood just fine. Reflecting the impact of football’s most devastating one-two punch, Dangerwood has quickly become football’s most exhausted portmanteau.
Yet in many ways the term would be relevant even if Dangerfield didn’t return home to Moggs Creek, a one-hour drive from Geelong. Danger is what fires Selwood, and it is this danger and an appetite for the contest that makes him such a compelling figure in a game, particularly for fans.
While eighteenth-century philosopher Edmund Burke didn’t see a game of AFL, his theory of the sublime goes some way to explain our pleasure in watching Selwood. Part of Burke’s thesis is the notion of “negative pain”, the idea that a feeling of fear – paired with a sense of safety, and the ability to look away, can produce a feeling of delight. For those who don’t consume themselves with demands for him to appear before The Hague for his ducking, watching Selwood for the past ten years has been just that – a delight.
Week after week, the Geelong champion plays in a fearless style that brings into relief the plastic macho of those of us who write about football and question the mental toughness of players.
What cannot be questioned is Selwood’s hardness and his impact on the club where he has played all of his 239 games. In an era where a player’s worth is increasingly defined by multi-year, multi-million contract offers, Selwood is a generational player who not only defines Geelong’s most successful era, but personifies it. And he has the scars to prove it.
The Republic of Ireland secured a morale-boosting 3-1 win over Uruguay in a friendly match, with Jonathan Walters, Cyrus Christie and James McClean all finding the target in Dublin.
Ireland had taken a 28th-minute lead through Walters’s sumptuous effort and, although José Giménez levelled before the break, Christie’s strike and a well-executed third from the substitute McClean rounded off a good evening for the manager, Martin O’Neill.
He made eight changes to the side who lost 3-1 against Mexico with only the goalkeeper, Darren Randolph, and the defenders Christie and Shane Duffy retained, and his big names engineered a significant improvement on the performance at the MetLife Stadium to boost spirits before Austria’s visit to Dublin next Sunday for a World Cup qualifier.
O’Neill’s opposite number, Óscar Tabárez, named only five of the men who started Ururguay’s last World Cup qualifier in Peru, among them the Paris Saint-Germain frontman Edinson Cavani.
In the event Cavani lasted 12 minutes before over-stretching in a vain attempt to reach Randolph’s nonchalant pass across his own penalty area to Duffy at the start of a first half which was to move from the sublime to the ridiculous before it drew to a close.
Ireland’s 4-2-3-1 formation gave them a more solid base than they had enjoyed against the Mexicans when O’Neill’s three-man defence simply did not work but Robbie Brady found himself operating on the right and initially struggled to have his usual influence.
Walters enjoyed some early success in getting behind the Uruguay rearguard but it was Brady who tested Esteban Conde with a swerving 13th-minute effort before Duffy only just failed to connect with a diving header from the Burnley midfielder’s cross seconds later.
Cavani’s replacement, Cristhian Stuani, failed to trouble Randolph with a tame 18th-minute volley and the home side took the lead in some style 10 minutes later.
Glenn Whelan surged on to Jeff Hendrick’s pass and stabbed the ball towards Walters who, having urged his team-mate to step aside, took a touch and then curled a dipping right-foot shot past Conde and into the far corner.
Uruguay were level seven minutes before the break when Giménez made the most of Randolph’s ill-judged decision to come for Egidio Arevalo Rios’ free-kick, although he needed a piece of good fortunate as the ball came off his shoulder as he attempted to head it and looped into the unguarded net.
However, Ireland would have gone in ahead at the break had Walters been able to summon up even a morsel of the quality he had demonstrated earlier when meeting Brady’s volleyed cross in front of an open goal but he contrived to steer his shot against the crossbar from three yards.
Christie did restore the advantage within six minutes of the restart, though, when he cut inside the full-back Martin Cáceres and deceived Conde with a low left-foot shot which Sebastián Coates failed to block.
With Brady now playing in his more accustomed left-sided berth, the Republic were more of a threat despite O’Neill making five substitutions by the hour.
One of them, Keiren Westwood, announced his return to the fold with a fine one-handed save from Gimenez’s towering 68th-minute header but it was Ireland who finished the stronger.
Daryl Murphy tested Conde with a low drive and then set up his fellow substitute McClean to cement the win in clinical fashion. McClean stepped on to Murphy’s pass, skipped over Giménez’s desperate lunge and thumped a shot across the keeper and inside the far post.
Virat Kohli hailed a “massive win” against Pakistan as India delivered the message that, for all the talk of issues behind the scenes in their camp, they are more than capable of defending their Champions Trophy title this summer.
Kohli delivered a batting masterclass, with an unbeaten 81 from 68 balls as his side posted 319 for three in a rain-reduced 48 overs. In the reply Umesh Yadav took three for 30 as Pakistan were bowled out for 164 chasing an adjusted 289 from 41.
With Yuvraj Singh’s 29-ball half-century also wowing the Edgbaston crowd, India looked anything but a team reportedly looking to see their head coach, Anil Kumble, replaced when his one-year contract expires at the end of the tournament.
“It’s a massive win for us,” said Kolhi, who struck six fours and three sixes in a brutal late assault. “The way we played and the confidence we showed was very pleasing as a captain. The way Yuvi batted was the game-changing innings.
“The middle order was outstanding and Yuvi was outstanding. I felt like a club batter next to him. With bat and ball we were nine out of ten, in the field we were six today. If we tune that up to eight or nine we will be a strong side, it was a very complete game for us.”
Yuvraj added: “We started well with the bat and the bowlers came and stuck to the plan and took wickets at regular intervals. India-Pakistan is very special - the Indian fans make it special for us”
Mickey Arthur, Pakistan’s head coach, fronted up after the match, describing the result as a “reality check” for a side who are lowest ranked in the eight-team tournament while lamenting the two dropped catches that gave reprieves to Yuvraj and Kohli on eight and 43 respectively.
“We didn’t take opportunities and they made us pay for it,” Arthur said. “The worrying thing for me is we do the basics wrong. We dropped simple catches. We don’t run well enough between wickets. We don’t hit the keeper with our throws. But we’ll bounce back from it.
Asked how long before performances improve, he replied: “How long is a piece of string? I don’t know. We’re trying every day. Every time we go down to training, we try and get the basics right. We didn’t do it today. And that’s disappointing.”
Amid the hustle and bustle of the Edgbaston Road one man stood quite still. The crowd flowed around him like a river past a rock, men, women and children on their way to the game, all sporting splashes of brilliant green and bright sky blue. Nearby a band banged drums while fans danced giddy circles around them. Off to one side, pedlars cried out “hats, horns, scarves and masks” and touts looking for spare tickets muttered muted inquiries under their breath.
Theirs was a slow business, since no one was selling. TV crews cut back and forth across the stream, looking for people to interview. And over the back someone took a match to a pack of fireworks, so plumes of blue smoke swirled overhead. In the middle of it all the standing man held a homemade sign: “London, Manchester, Mumbai, Terror Never Wins”.
In the morning the International Cricket Council put out a press release confirming that the tournament would go on, just as the Ashes had after the London bombings in 2005. Security was already tight after the attack in Manchester and the police had warned spectators to expect long queues. So a lot of people were delayed getting into the ground. But no one seemed to mind.
Besides, India’s openers took it especially slow and steady in the first few overs, so the latecomers did not miss anything much. India took their time measuring Pakistan’s attack. They scored 72 runs in the final four overs, more than they managed in the entirety of the first 15. By the end of the innings one could spot the Pakistan fans by looking for the flat patches in the stands, because they were the only ones sitting down.
Time was when was the crowds at these games needed to be policed, not protected. India v Pakistan is one of the most fervid fixtures in all of sport and in the 1990s feelings ran so hot that matches boiled up and over. Games between the teams were often interrupted, sometimes abandoned. In 1996 a fight even broke out on the pitch during the final of the Under-15 World Cup between the teams, at Lord’s of all places. It got so bad that during the 1999 World Cup the England and Wales Cricket Board asked the government to introduce emergency legislation to outlaw pitch invasions at cricket stadiums after India’s captain, Mohammad Azharuddin, warned that “somebody was going to get killed” during the match between India and Pakistan at Old Trafford.
The fixture still carries a lot of baggage. The two teams have not played a Test in a decade and their last limited‑overs series finished in January 2013. Both boards say they are keen to play again but the Indian government will not allow it. This week the sports minister, Vijay Goel, said that India and Pakistan would not be playing a bilateral series any time soon because “cricket and terrorism can’t go hand-in-hand”. Lately they have played only when they have been drawn together in ICC tournaments, something which, luckily enough for the fans, sponsors and TV networks, seems to happen with uncanny regularity. But despite all that, or perhaps because of it, the fixture does not seem to generate as much heat as it once did.
“Nothing different, to be honest,” was Virat Kohli’s blunt assessment before this match. “I know it sounds pretty boring but this is exactly what we feel as cricketers.” Kohli could afford to be blasé. India have now won eight of the nine games the two teams have played in tournaments this decade, the only exception being a match in the Asia Cup in 2014. So the gulf between the two teams feels as wide now as it has ever been. Partly this is because Pakistan are rebuilding their team. The last time they played a one-day international against India, in the 2015 World Cup, they had Shahid Afridi, Umar Akmal, Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq in the team.
Three are retired now, and the fourth, Akmal, was kicked out of the squad because he failed a fitness test. This is a callow Pakistan team then, out-matched by an outstanding Indian side hardened by all those seasons of intense limited overs cricket in the Indian Premier League. When the game started to escape the Pakistanis they were not able to regain any measure of control over it. They ran flush out of luck too, which did not help. Their bowling attack collapsed in the final overs as Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz had to leave the field, injured. In the end the match was not much of a contest but it never stopped being an occasion.
At twenty past ten, almost exactly 12 hours after the attack in London, Edgbaston fell quiet in a minute’s silence. It was the only moment between dawn and dusk in which the streets around the ground were not loud with the sound of screams, shouts, whistles, horns and drums. There was succour to be found in the crowd, in their determination to go on with the frivolous business of singing, dancing and cheering to celebrate sixes and wickets. It was the largest attendance they have ever had for a one-day game at Edgbaston, just under 25,000 people altogether, a 50-50 mix, part Pakistani, part Indian, all proudly British. The fixture, which in the past has often split supporters apart, served to bring everyone a little closer together.
Authorities say former Los Angeles Lakers player and ex-New York Knicks head coach Derek Fisher has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving after he flipped his vehicle on a California highway.
The California Highway Patrol says neither Fisher nor his passenger, former Basketball Wives reality star Gloria Govan, were injured in the crash early on Sunday.
Authorities say Fisher was driving on US 101 in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles when his 2015 Cadillac veered onto the right shoulder while approaching an interchange. The car hit the shoulder’s concrete curb and guardrail, overturned and came to a rest on its roof.
The Highway Patrol says officers discovered that Fisher had been drinking and he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.
India are up and running in the defence of their Champions Trophy title following a brutal exhibition of ball-striking from Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh that, on the ground where they lifted the trophy four years ago, simply crushed their arch-rivals Pakistan.
But while the result – a 124-run win by Duckworth-Lewis – may have met pre-match expectations in terms of the current gulf between the two sides, the atmosphere at least exceeded them as a record crowd of 24,165 throbbed throughout a day that required patience given its regular stoppages for rain.
This was a match strewn with errors, perhaps because of the magnitude of the occasion given a global TV audience tipped to approach one billion, but at least it ended with the brollies packed away and the ground bathed in glorious sunshine. Pakistan, faced with an ever-increasing run-rate, were bowled out for 164 in 33.4 overs with the No11, Wahab Riaz, failing to emerge due to injury. Umesh Yadav led the Indian attack with three for 30.
Sarfraz Ahmed’s side had been chasing a rain-adjusted target of 289 from 41 overs but always looked up against it after India had stuck 319 for three on the board in 48. It was a total that was heavily bloated by the power-hitting at the end during which Kohli hit an unbeaten 81 from 68 balls, Yuvraj creamed 53 from 32 and Hardik Pandya launched three late sixes in his six-ball 20 not out.
A hostile opening burst from Mohammad Amir notwithstanding, the decision to stick India in at the toss by Sarfraz resulted in an ominous start. Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma eased to 125 by the 25th over, laying the platform for their side’s late assault while bringing up their ninth century opening stand in ODIs and a record third in Champions Trophy cricket.
Despite Pakistan’s head coach, Mickey Arthur, talking up their preparation leading into the match, his side were shabbier in the field than some of the items for sale in the nearby Moseley vintage fair and, though the two rain breaks that wiped out 75 minutes of play gave them a couple of chances to regroup, they instead got progressively worse. By the end, when Kohli and Yuvraj were clubbing boundaries for fun, the wheels were off completely.
Sharma’s 91 from 119 balls was an old-style affair from the owner of the world record ODI score of 264. Monopolising much of the strike first thing, he was duly first to his fifty off 71 balls when launching the 18-year-old Shadab Khan over midwicket for six. The much-denied Dhawan then briefly crackled in bringing up his own milestone before, on 68, the leg-spinner’s friend – aka a rank full toss – was plopped into the hands of Azhar Ali in the deep.
Kohli’s arrival to a wall of noise, one that doubtless left Edgbaston locals wondering why their glassware had begun to shake, brought with it a relatively sedate passage of play. A stand of 56 with Sharma, interrupted by the second downpour, came from 12.1 overs with the opener at one stage going 44 balls between boundaries.
Sharma’s eventual demise came to the surprise of many. A seemingly innocuous run-out attempt from point ended with the bat over the line but pushed up by the dive such that the third umpire, Richard Kettleborough, judged it not to be grounded.
With 10 overs of to go and Yuvraj new to the crease, the score was 202 for two and Pakistan were still in it provided they could apply the squeeze. But instead two regulation drops handed lives to both batsmen and, with Amir and Wahab succumbing to cramp and an ankle problem respectively, 117 runs were flayed, including an astonishing 72 from the last 24 deliveries.
Yuvraj was first to profit in the 39th over when, with eight to his name, he duffed a googly from Shadab to Hasan Ali at long-on only to see the ball grassed on the slide. From there the left-hander went into overdrive, carving a 29-ball half-century with short-arm bunts down the ground for four and one heaved six before eventually being trapped lbw by a Hasan yorker with 10 balls remaining.
Kohli, who was dropped on 43 in the deep by the substitute Faheem Ashraf, was not to be outdone and having hit four fours in his first 55 balls, joined the violent dismantling of Pakistan’s attack. Wahab was particularly to his taste, with the left-armer taken for two fours and one screaming six before hobbling off with his ankle apparently crocked and his figures – 8.4 overs, none for 87 – in tatters.
It meant Imad Wasim, the left-arm spinner who had bafflingly been given six overs with the new ball, had to see things out. It could not have started worse as the new man, Pandya, slapped him for three successive sixes before Kohli capped off the innings with a sixth four laced through extra cover; it summed up the dominance.
Pakistan’s reply, with an original adjusted target of 324 cut after a 35-minute rain break early on, hinged on Azhar converting his 64-ball half-century into an innings of substance and given support at the other end. Neither materialised, with Ahmed Shehzad trapped lbw for 12 by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Babar Azam slashing Yadav to point on eight before Azhar himself swept Ravindra Jadeja to deep square-leg the ball after reaching his 50. After Shoaib Malik was brilliantly run out by Jadeja and Mohammad Hafeez clubbed the left-armer up in the air on 33, the lower order simply disintegrated.
Castleford took another step towards finally securing the title after almost a century of trying with a narrow home victory against St Helens. The win was notable also for the fact that they were without a number of key front-line players.
Daryl Powell, the Tigers’ head coach, made no secret of how, with this third game of a gruelling 10-day period, he would rest several big names to not only make a point to the sport’s schedulers but also to ensure that his Castleford players do not burn out in the long term.
Powell was without more than 1,000 games worth of Super League experience , with England internationals such as Luke Gale, Zak Hardaker and Michael Shenton all missing. And while they have already beaten some of their opponents with remarkable free-flowing rugby on many occasions this season, given the circumstances this win surely ranks as their best of the year so far.
The added bonus for Castleford was that with Salford Red Devils losing at home against Wakefield, it extended the their own lead at the top of the Super League table to four points. “It’s one of the biggest wins I’ve been involved in, honestly,” Powell said. “We can’t get carried away with having a buffer at the top but we’ve got something special going here.”
St Helens had a 10-day turnaround for this game: another bone of contention for Powell pre-match given that his side played as recently as last Monday. Yet despite two earlier encouraging performances under their new coach, Justin Holbrook, the 12-4 half-time lead they established was eventually overturned with Tom Holmes’s late try nine minutes from time to inflict a first defeat on the Australian as coach.
“It’s a missed opportunity,” Holbrook said later. “They have the luxury of where they’re sitting in the table to rest players and they’ve earned that, but for us to fall just short is disappointing.”
Saints led when Mark Percival rounded Kieran Gill, one of several Castleford youngsters handed an opportunity in a much-changed side, to break the deadlock – though Gill would respond with a try of his own on debut as half-time approached. Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook extended the lead to eight points with a close-range finish on 37 minutes, and from there the visiting side appeared to be in control.
However, the Tigers were able to keep their opponents scoreless in the second half, scoring two tries of their own to secure a precious victory.
First, Mike McMeeken’s wonderful solo effort on the hour set up a dramatic finale, with Castleford going ahead for the first, and only, time nine minutes from the end when Holmes reacted quickest to a desperate kick to touch down and extend the Tigers’ lead at the top of the table.
Right now it would take a brave man to back against Castleford staying at the top for the duration of the season.

Steven Finn’s summons to the Champions Trophy squad was confirmed on Sunday and he was understandably delighted that he has been chosen to replace Chris Woakes. But being a conscientious student of the game he must be aware that he has not been invited to a picnic for bowlers.
So far it has been a batsman’s tournament between the exasperating showers. The pitches have been brown and true and the ball has declined to deviate. Often bowlers have been in survival mode and Finn’s experience made him the more obvious choice ahead of Tom Curran or Toby Roland-Jones.
Finn made his one-day international debut six years ago; has 69 matches under his belt and he was in England’s Champions Trophy squad in 2013 when he played one game against South Africa.
“It’s great to be here,” Finn said on arrival at a damp Cardiff. “It is obviously very sad for Chris Woakes, who is a good friend of mine, but I’m glad I have got the call. I’ve been on the periphery for a little while. You have always got a point to prove when you have been out of the team.”
The problem for the bowlers has been avoiding the middle of the bat. Moreover the middle of today’s bats occupies far more space than it did in the 20th century. There are two ways to do it: by lateral movement which can be achieved by seam, spin or swing, or by exceptional/ uneven bounce which can cause the ball to hit the bottom or shoulder of the bat and go nowhere.
So far there has been minimal swing, seam or spin, which helps to explain the absence of David Willey and Adil Rashid from England’s team at The Oval against Bangladesh. The current batch of white balls stubbornly refuse to swing and this is a source of frustration for such as Willey as well as being a minor stain on the tournament. It is a better game when the bowlers have a chance at some point in the innings.
This state of affairs makes tall bowlers who can gain exceptional bounce more appealing to on-field captains, who have often been as harassed as the poor groundsmen heaving the covers on and off. Finn at his best can hit the shoulder of the bat; two years ago he was arguably England’s premier one-day bowler, who was regularly tossed the new ball. Then he did not play a game between September 2015 and March 2017. Now it is just conceivable that, having been brought into the squad, Finn could play against New Zealand on Tuesday ahead of Jake Ball, who has conceded more than 80 runs in two of his last three outings, and Willey.
Off the field Finn is a mild-mannered, contemplative man (on it he is no Dennis Lillee) but he is prepared to outline what he brings to the squad. “I think I’ve got a good record in one-day cricket,” he says. “I am slightly taller than the other guys and can therefore get a bit more bounce. I’ve played a lot of ODIs. There is experience there. I think we have got a really well balanced squad and hopefully my personal attributes can bring something to that.”
He has seldom been regarded as a miserly bowler yet his economy rate compares well with those of his peers (in fact it is much better than that of any other bowler in the squad) but that is partly explained by his longevity – there has been hyper-inflation in run-scoring over the past 18 months. But he does satisfy the demands of the modern ODI game since he has always been a wicket-taker.
“Taking wickets is always something I try to do,” he explains, which sounds an obvious thing to say but has a particular significance in the context of ODI cricket. “I never take a backward step or try to be negative or defensive. I think trying to take wickets is the mantra we have tried to adopt as a one-day bowling side and I can help that.”
On Saturday he was playing for the England Lions against South Africa A and he was aware that he was under scrutiny after the injury to Woakes. In a straightforward victory he finished with two for 49 from 8.3 overs.
“I knew James Whitaker and Mick Newell were there,” he said. “You feel that pressure knowing that they are watching you to call you up for this game. But that is no different from every time I pull on an England or Lions shirt. I had a bit of a stiff back in the Lions game at Nottingham on Thursday so it was a case of making sure my back was 100%. So it was a mixture of seeing my fitness and how I was bowling. If I had bowled a big pile of garbage, then I wouldn’t be standing here now.”
Rafael Nadal is looking every inch the champion he was here five years ago and it is clearly going to take someone playing special tennis to stop the Spaniard winning his 10th title.
Whether that person is Novak Djokovic was difficult to say after another win that mixed waywardness with brilliance on Sunday evening.
The defending champion, who also looked lost at various points over five sets against Diego Schwartzman on Friday, has hardly had a sound preparation for a likely semi-final against Nadal, the rival who has won the title here nine times. But he finished a patchy assignment against Albert Ramos-Viñolas – Andy Murray’s conqueror in Monte Carlo – going through to the next round with a 7-6, 6-1, 6-3 win.
Who else can stop Nadal at Roland Garros? With all the generosity one could muster, it probably will not be Pablo Carreno Busta, who took 4hr 17min to defeat Milos Raonic over five gruelling sets on Sunday for the honour of playing his Spanish friend in the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
When Nadal won his seventh championship in 2012, he gave up only 19 games on his way to the last eight. On Sunday he raced into the quarters ahead of the field in a mere 1hr 51min, dismissing another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2. This time his first four matches have cost him 20 games.
Ena Sharples had fewer numbers against her trying to win Friday-night bingo than Busta has against Nadal but after defeating Raonic 4-6, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 8-6 he insisted: “Maybe I’ll lose easy, maybe I’ll win easy.”
Those two maybes are about as far apart as the players’ professional records. Nadal has won three tournaments this year and 72 in his career; Busta has won three titles in the eight years he has been playing tennis for a living.
Five years ago Nadal’s first four opponents had a combined ranking of 216. Here he has beaten Benoît Paire (45), Robin Haase (46), Nikoloz Basilashvili (63) and Agut (18): a total of 172.
Having turned 31 on Saturday, Nadal, statistically and by common agreement, is playing tennis as awesome as when he was at or near his peak. In 2012 he won four titles and 42 of his 48 matches; this year he has won 36 of 42.
If Nadal defeats Busta, he will post his 100th win in best-of-five matches on clay, against two defeats. Both of those were here, against Robin Soderling in 2009 and Djokovic two years ago. There cannot be a record like it in sport.
While that blizzard of statistics might be a lot to take in, pity the plight of Agut, who had to soak up 31 clear winners in less than two hours, 18 of them ripped on that forehand by the left wrist that last year gave up on Nadal after two matches. He is hitting the ball with as much venomous top-spin as he has done in a long while and he is without question the most dangerous player remaining in the draw.
“Probably I didn’t play as well as I did the other day,” he said later, which is not as arrogant as it sounds. “I made a few mistakes but not important ones. In general terms I played well.
“The most important thing for me is I was able to play with no injuries and not too many problems since [Carlos Moyá joined his team]. We have been able to practise as much as we wanted and the way that we wanted.”
There have been suggestions that his uncle, Toni – who will give up his main coaching role at the end of the year – admonished Nadal at the start of the season for what he perceived to be a lack of motivation. Nadal replied: “I believe that my attitude never was wrong, so is not a question of attitude; it’s a question of tennis and is a question of health. If you’re healthy, it’s easy to play with good attitude and easy to practise.”
What is obvious is that Busta, who has had a decent season and a solid tournament, will find this match tougher than any of their previous three, all of which he lost. Raonic kept the world No21 on court to contest 382 points and the Spaniard said later: “It was really tough. I suffered but I enjoyed it. And, of course, you enjoy it more when you win. He played very well on match point [the Canadian saved six of them]. The rallies were very long. He was defending well all the time.
“If I didn’t think I had a chance, I would not play. Of course it will be difficult because Rafa is the best player on the surface in history. I am maybe tired but I have one day off. We will see on Tuesday. He’s a really good friend. It will be a really special match for me.”
The short odds are that it will be a special occasion for Busta but not a match that will change his career. Nadal told Spanish journalists: “I fully respect each opponent and I fully respect the tournament. Just because things go well for you it does not mean things are going to continue like this. You have to be ready so that you can react to bad moments that might happen.”
A tearful Garbiñe Muguruza hit out at the crowd after her title defence was ended by France’s Kristina Mladenovic. The Spaniard, who defeated Serena Williams in the final 12 months ago, walked off wagging her finger at the fans on Court Suzanne Lenglen.
There has not been a French winner since Mary Pierce in 2000 and Mladenovic was cheered raucously during her 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 victory. But Muguruza felt the support went too far, saying: “I think the audience was really tough today. I can’t really understand. I don’t know how to explain. If you had been in my shoes on the court, I think you would have understood.”
She broke down in tears in her press conference and had to leave the room for a few minutes before returning. It appeared there was no love lost between the players either, with Muguruza asked about Mladenovic’s habit of shouting forza in Italian at key moments. “I think she speaks like 25 languages, I heard,” said Muguruza.
Along with intense disappointment, there was also relief for the Spaniard, who has struggled to cope with the expectation since her triumph here last year. “I lost confidence, and my opponent was on home turf, so it created a lot of tension,” she said. “Of course I’m sad. It’s a very painful defeat here at the French Open. I love this tournament no matter what happens. I’m going to be super happy to come back. It’s going to sound weird, but I’m actually happy that this stage of the year is done.
“I wanted to go as far as possible, but even if I didn’t, I think I’m going to feel much better now to continue the year, and everybody is going to stop bothering me asking me about this tournament.”
Mladenovic, though, praised her supporters. “The courage and the force you give me is just unimaginable. It’s thanks to you that I fought for every point. And we’re in the quarter-finals. Yes!”
She has been struggling with a bad back since the eve of the tournament and served 16 double faults, but the rest of her game made up for it. She said: “Everything wasn’t perfect. There were a few concerns.” She then joked: “I made about 35 double faults today, but everything’s OK.”
Venus Williams, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Sam Stosur also went out, meaning the women’s event will have a first-time champion this year.
Williams, who had been hoping to win the tournament for the first time in the month of her 37th birthday and add to her seven grand slam titles, lost 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 to Timea Bacsinszky, the second year in a row the Swiss has beaten her in the fourth round.
“I think she just played really well,” Williams said. “She had so many answers today. I just give her credit for playing well every point, even in the first set.”
Caroline Wozniacki, with two grand slam final appearances to her credit the most experienced player left, continued her fine year with a surprise 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 victory over the 2009 champion Kuznetsova. Despite facing an opponent proficient on clay, which is not the Dane’s best surface, Wozniacki showed unexpected aggression on her forehand, matching her opponent’s tally of 26 winners. Kuznetsova did not help her cause with 41 unforced errors. Wozniacki next faces the Latvian teenager Jelena Ostapenko, who knocked out Stosur 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 to reach her first quarter-final.
Four third-round matches were carried over from Saturday, and the top-five seeds Karolina Pliskova and Elina Svitolina went through. The Croatian qualifier Petra Martic defeated the No17 seed Anastasija Sevastova while Verónica Cepede Royg of Paraguay reached the fourth round for the first time.
Michael Carrick paid tribute to the Old Trafford crowd for supporting his testimonial but his Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney may have bade farewell.
Carrick marked 11 years at the club with a match to benefit his charitable foundation in front of 70,027 fans and, while the midfielder will be around for another 12 months after signing a contract extension, fans may have witnessed Rooney’s final appearance in a Red Devils shirt.
He played the entire first half and the final 17 minutes of the second and in that time the club’s all-time leading goalscorer, who has fallen out of favour with the manager, José Mourinho, and appears destined to leave this summer, lobbed one early effort on to the roof of the net.
While Rooney could be excused to some degree, having flown back from a family holiday in Barbados to play in the friendly, it was perhaps indicative of his current situation that he did not particularly stand out in the company of a host of long-retired former professionals. At the final whistle he gave a quick wave to fans before heading down the tunnel.
Carrick, who saw a deft first-half chip drift wide of the angle of crossbar and post, scored the equaliser in a 2-2 draw draw eight minutes from time before departing to a standing ovation.
Despite more than a decade at United the pre-match team sheet somehow managed to spell the main man’s name wrong – he was originally listed as Carrtick before the error was quickly corrected. The names of Clarence Seedorf and Harry Redknapp were also spelt incorrectly.

Carrick offered his condolences to the families and friends of victims of the London attacks on Saturday and those in Manchester a fortnight ago.
Kick-off for the game was brought forward so as not to clash with the One Love Manchester concert being held at the neighbouring cricket ground later in the evening, in aid of the those affected by the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena on 22 May which killed 22 people.
A number of victims’ families were in the Old Trafford crowd, as were about 300 members of the emergency services who dealt with the aftermath of the atrocity.
“Obviously this game has extra significance in the wake of what has happened in the last two weeks,” said Carrick, who laid floral tributes before a minute’s silence for victims of both attacks.
“I’d like to extend my condolences to those affected by the events in Manchester and also those in London. My heart goes out to all those affected and my message is stay together and stay strong.
“On my behalf I’d like to welcome some of the families of the victims. I’d also like to welcome about 300 of the emergency services who were heroic in their efforts in the last couple of weeks.”
Regarding the testimonial he said: “The atmosphere was incredible. There was no way I could have hoped for anything like this. I know we get full houses here every week but it is not something I take for granted and to get so many here today is sensational.
“I have to thank the fans for their support. Let’s not forget we’re back here next season to try to win some more trophies.
“And finally a thank you to Sir Alex [Ferguson], the man who brought me to the club.
“We all know how great he is and his achievements at the club but he’s been a massive influence on my career. Thanks very much boss.”
The former Lazio, Barcelona and Middlesbrough midfielder Gaizka Mendieta’s 22nd-minute goal was cancelled out by Nemanja Vidic’s header for the Manchester United ’08 XI before the half-hour. Midway through the second half Robbie Keane put the All-Stars XI ahead only for Carrick to have the final word.
ITV has joined Britain’s bookmakers in celebration after the 40-1 success of Wings Of Eagles in the Investec Derby at Epsom. Viewing figures for the channel’s coverage of the Classic showed clear improvement on those recorded by Channel 4 last year.
ITV Racing’s coverage drew a peak audience of 1.7m viewers for the race at 4.30pm on Saturday, versus a peak of 1.374m for Channel 4’s broadcast in 2016. ITV’s peak figure was also better than any of those recorded by C4 during its four-year contract to cover the race between 2013 and 2016 – but well below the 3.3m peak achieved by BBC Sport in the final year of its contract in 2012.
The average audience for ITV’s coverage was 820,000, an increase of around 30% on the figure of 628,000 in 2016, while ITV’s audience share of 11.3% was also the highest for the Classic since 2012.
This year’s Derby was one of the most open races for many years and Wings Of Eagles was the biggest outsider to win since the 1970s and the first winner at double-figure odds since 1998.
The colt’s unexpected success under the little-known jockey Padraig Beggy, allied to the improved viewing figures for the race, also suggest that racing’s finances should receive an unexpected boost from the outcome, since bookmakers’ contributions to the sport via a reformed Levy system are linked to their gross profit.
The Derby is normally the third-biggest betting race of the year, after the Grand National and Cheltenham Gold Cup, and a large field in which Cracksman, with Frankie Dettori aboard, started favourite at 7-2 is likely to have produced strong turnover.
Cracksman, who was having only the third start of his career, ran in snatches before staying on in the final quarter-mile to finish third behind Wings Of Eagles and Cliffs Of Moher, the apparent first string in Aidan O’Brien’s six runners in the race.
O’Brien said on Sunday that the first two horses home could go their separate ways for their next starts, with Wings Of Eagles a possible runner in the Irish Derby at The Curragh on 1 July while Cliffs Of Moher drops back to a mile-and-a-quarter in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park a week later.
“They seem to be fine,” O’Brien said. “Obviously they haven’t done much today but they seem to be fine so far.
“We might have a look at the Irish Derby with Wings Of Eagles and it’s possible we might have a look at the Eclipse with Cliffs Of Moher, but we’re not sure yet. It will be a week or 10 days before we decide anything but that’s what we are thinking at the moment.”
Wings Of Eagles was O’Brien’s sixth Derby winner at Epsom but the trainer has yet to win the French equivalent at Chantilly and his blank will extend for at least another 12 months after his three runners in Sunday’s renewal of the Prix du Jockey Club finished unplaced behind the favourite, Brametot.
Brametot took the French 2,000 Guineas at Deauville last month and was a 7-4 chance to follow up on Sunday but his prospects did not look good in the early stages of the race as Cristian Demuro sat at the back of the field after a slow start.
Demuro’s mount made some progress from the rear as the race developed but still had plenty of ground to make up as the 12 runners turned for home. The colt did not hit the front until the final stride, beating André Fabre’s Waldgeist by a short head with Recoletos in third. Bay Of Poets, from Charlie Appleby’s yard in Newmarket, fared best of the three British-trained runners in seventh, while William Haggas’s Rivet, last year’s Racing Post Trophy winner, was eighth.
No winner of the French Derby has gone on to win the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in October since the distance of the Classic was reduced to 10½ furlongs in 2005. Brametot is top-priced at 10-1 to become the first to do so, in a market headed by Almanzor, last year’s French Derby winner, at 6-1.
David ‘Dandy’ Nicholls, the trainer whose exploits with sprinters over the last quarter of a century had earned him the nickname “the sprint king”, has died at the age of 61. He saddled six Group One winners in his career, including Continent in the July Cup at Newmarket in 2002 and Ya Malak – with his wife Alex in the saddle – in the 1997 Nunthorpe Stakes at York, and won almost all the Flat season’s major sprint handicaps at least once.
Nicholls began his racing career as a jockey, recording more than 400 winners and forming a brilliant partnership with Soba, a filly who won 11 races in 1982 including the Stewards’ Cup at Goodwood.
Retiring from the saddle and turning his attention to training in 1992, Nicholls soon established a reputation for finding improvement in other trainers’ cast-offs, and apparently exposed sprinters in particular.
Ya Malak was a prime example of Nicholls’s ability to spot a bargain. The gelding was bought as a five-year-old having shown occasional glimpses of serious ability for Pip Payne and Ian Balding – and dead-heated for the Group One Nunthorpe less than a year later, making his rider the first woman to win a race at the highest level in Britain.
Nicholls saddled Bahamian Pirate to win the same race in 2004, while Continent, originally trained for Prince Khalid Abdullah’s Juddmonte operation in France, took the Ayr Gold Cup in 2001 and then two Group One events the following season after being bought by Nicholls for 40,000 guineas. Continent was eventually retired at the age of 11 with career earnings of almost £450,000.
In all, Nicholls took the Ayr Gold Cup six times, and the Stewards’ Cup on three occasions. Redford, a useful horse on a 15-race losing streak, took the Ayr handicap in impressive style barely a month after joining the Nicholls stable, while Regal Parade, a 425,000gns yearling, joined the yard for 16,000gns before winning the Ayr Gold Cup, a handicap at Royal Ascot and the Group 1 Haydock Sprint Cup.
Nicholls announced in March that he was closing his training operation due to financial problems. He was also due to stand trial in August on two charges of sexual assault, relating to incidents at his yard near Thirsk. He denied the charges.
Adrian Nicholls, the trainer’s son and former stable jockey, said on Sunday that his father “passed away in his sleep at home this morning. He’d been battling a few problems of late.
“Everybody knows in racing what he did. He was a very good jockey and an even better trainer and probably an even better dad. His record speaks for itself. There are a few other people snapping at his heels to take the ‘sprint king’ title, but they’ll be doing well to do what he did.”

Yorkshire’s Roses victory came with the minimum of fuss. On day three they clinically swept away Lancashire’s last six wickets for 68, then knocked off the required 60 for a 10-wicket win. “From start to finish we dominated” was the succinct and entirely accurate assessment of Andrew Gale, their coach. Whisper it, but this performance, which takes Yorkshire within two points of the leaders, Essex, was reminiscent of those seen when they won twin titles under Gale’s captaincy.
On a pitch full of juice – “one of the best I’ve seen at Headingley,” Gale said, before lamenting that it would probably be rated “average” under the England and Wales Cricket Board’s grading system – they had bowled relentlessly throughout, did not shell a chance (a welcome change from recent games) and in Adam Lyth’s battling century, achieved the game’s only score of more than 50. “If I could show the academy a video of how to bat at Headingley, that would be it,” Gale said of Lyth.
The bowling on the third morning was almost as excellent as it had been on the first, when they dismissed Lancashire for 123. “As good as you’ll see in county cricket,” Gale added with a grin.
Ryan Sidebottom, now 39 and who every Yorkshireman should be begging not to retire, had Dane Vilas caught at slip, then Ben Coad had Shiv Chanderpaul edging behind, all before Lancashire had a lead. Coad had dismissed their prize scalps, Haseeb Hameed and Chanderpaul, twice each and ended with eight wickets in the match.
Ryan McLaren and Jordan Clark ensured Yorkshire would bat again, putting on 48, before Tim Bresnan made his first major contribution. He took three wickets in 16 balls and Sidebottom got rid of Tom Bailey, all caught by the wicketkeeper or cordon (like 22 of the match’s 30 wickets), to ensure the target remained so low that sweat would not be broken.
Indeed it was not. With 21 runs required for victory off they went for lunch, perhaps because there was a do being thrown for former Yorkshire players – having not given them an inch all match they generously invited a few Lancastrians, too.
What remained was a formality as Lyth and Alex Lees milked Lancashire’s spinners – who were bowling to avoid the loss of points because of their poor over-rate – with any semblance of intensity gone; even Hameed served up three overs. Eventually, Lees grew bored and carted Steven Croft wide of mid-on to put Lancashire out of their misery.
They had been playing catch-up since choosing to toss, then bat. On a pitch that would have suited him down to the ground, Glen Chapple, the coach, was adamant that it was the performance, not the captain’s call, that cost them. “The quality of our bowling did not match theirs. We have to take that on the chin,” he said.
Chapple said the return from injury of Jimmy Anderson, who was bowling at about 50% before play, is coming on very well and added that he is “a fast healer”, though not fast enough to face Middlesex at Southport on Friday, alas.
Jonathan Trott was in Birmingham on Saturday, sorting out a family issue. When he returned to the Ageas Bowl on Sunday, he was confronted with another problem: Warwickshire had tumbled to 49 for six in response to Hampshire’s 515.
There remain few better at burrowing out of a crisis and, from No8, he made his 43rd first-class century but could not avert the follow-on. Thirteen balls into Warwickshire’s second innings, which they began 261 behind, he was back in. With the openers, Ian Westwood and Andrew Umeed, falling cheaply, he and his skipper, Ian Bell, put on an unbroken 66. They closed still 186 runs behind but Trott, with 17 from 58 balls, had shown his team the way.
First time round Trott shared 32 with the nightwatchman, Grant Thornton, and 104 with Keith Barker, who made 63. Finally there was the 54 across 20 overs with the last man Sunny Singh, which delayed tea and brought a second batting point. Trott eventually fell lbw to one that stayed low from Kyle Abbott, first ball after tea, but he was not gone for long.
The only team below Warwickshire, Somerset, toiled manfully against Middlesex at Lord’s but the hosts avoided the follow-on late on, ending 298 for seven with Adam Voges also having retired hurt for 86. Somerset lead by 132, and require something remarkable to earn their first win.
At Hove, Worcestershire put on 215 for the first wicket, with Daryl Mitchell making his third hundred in as many matches, only to be bowled out for 312, and forced to follow-on by Sussex. Jofra Archer took four wickets and Vernon Philander three, including his 500th in first-class cricket. Mitchell, again, held Worcestershire together, making his sixth half-century in six innings, but they closed 143 behind with six wickets in hand, having lost 14 for 221.
Nottinghamshire head into the final day against Derbyshire 179 ahead with four wickets in hand, seeking to extend their advantage at the top of Division Two. Samit Patel’s first half-century of the season carried them to 313 for six.
Cameron Steel made his maiden first-class century, brought up with a six as winless Durham made 376 against Northamptonshire, for whom Mohammad Azharullah took five for 72. That left Northants requiring 205 to win and Paul Coughlin immediately dismissed Max Holden as they closed 44 for one. If the weather allows, a thrilling final day awaits.
After six years away cricket made a welcome return to the BBC’s television schedules last week with highlights of the opening match of the Champions Trophy between England and Bangladesh. Shown on BBC2 at 11.20pm on Thursday night due to contractual restrictions that dictate the programme can only start once Sky’s coverage is off air, it attracted barely 200,000 viewers, according to early estimates, at a time when most people have already turned in for the night.
Those who wanted to catch up with the abandoned match between Australia and New Zealand on Friday had to wait even longer – 25 minutes into Saturday – in what appears to be a spectacularly bad piece of scheduling at a time when the England and Wales Cricket Board is desperate to increase participation among young people.
The ECB may point to more than 500,000 views of the replay clips available on the BBC website as evidence that interest in the game is still alive and well, although it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to convince the national broadcaster to outbid potential offers from the Discovery Channel, ITV and Channel 5 for a slice of the ECB’s five‑year rights deal for English cricket from 2020, which will be decided later on this month.
It is now almost two decades since the BBC’s 61-year exclusive coverage of home Tests came to an end with a 10-wicket victory for a Muttiah Muralitharan-inspired Sri Lanka in a one-match “series” at The Oval in August 1998. Within a year England had crashed out of their home World Cup in the group stages and sank to the bottom of the Test rankings with a series defeat against New Zealand – only the second time the Black Caps had tasted victory in a series on English soil.
While things have gradually improved for England since then, with Joe Root due to begin a new era as Test captain with the team ranked fourth-best in the world and Eoin Morgan’s side making an encouraging start to their latest attempt to win an International Cricket Council one-day tournament, participation has been in steady decline since the turn of the century. The latest statistics, released last year, showed that only 278,600 people in the UK regularly played cricket – almost half of what it was 20 years ago.
It is hard to be certain just how much of the blame for this can be pinned on the absence of the sport from terrestrial television, although it seems likely that most children these days would struggle to recognise many of England’s top-order batsmen if they walked past them on the street. That was not the case for previous generations, when even in the dire days of the 1990s players like Robin Smith and Graeme Hick were almost household names.
Meanwhile the sport faces a challenge from Major League Baseball, which will host a Baseball Battlegrounds event in Hyde Park on 4 July with a home-run derby and hopes to stage regular‑season games in Europe from 2019. “This represents an exciting statement of intent,” says MLB Europe’s managing director, Charlie Hill.
Perhaps, following on from the innovation of Twenty20, cricket’s future lies in the shorter form. The BBC’s cricket accounts on Twitter and Facebook have been heavily pushing their clips service since the start of the Champions Trophy and the figures are expected to increase as the tournament reaches its climax, especially if England progress past the group stages.
Just as with Saturday’s Champions League final between Juventus and Real Madrid, which BT Sport was obliged to stream for free on its YouTube channel despite having paid £1.2bn to renew its exclusive rights to football’s most prestigious club competition until 2021, there is a growing recognition among broadcasters that exposure is everything. In other words, what is the point of shelling out a fortune when no one is actually watching? The increasing trend for viewers to search out illegal streaming services as a way of evading constantly rising subscription fees shows the battle is already well under way.
While there appears little prospect of live Test cricket returning to terrestrial television for the time being, the divvying up of television rights for the new domestic T20 competition could be a game-changer. Sky’s deal, worth £280m, expires in 2019 and the ECB has made it clear that it would prefer to sell at least one of the five packages of rights to a terrestrial broadcaster, with another reserved exclusively for digital content on social‑media channels.
That would mean broadcasting around eight matches every season for free: enough, potentially, to attract some new fans to a competition that, it is hoped, will rival the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash. Whether the BBC is the vehicle to spearhead cricket’s brave new era is a question that will be debated ferociously in the corridors of power at Lord’s over the coming weeks.

Eden Hazard has admitted he would consider an approach from Real Madrid and that he is yet to begin negotiations with Chelsea about extending his contract at Stamford Bridge.
The Belgium international still has three years to run on his £200,000-a-week contract at the Premier League champions but has been a longstanding target for Real, who won a third Champions League title in four seasons on Saturday night with victory over Juventus in Cardiff. Five years to the day since Hazard confirmed he would be signing for “the champion’s league winners” [sic], the forward, who will miss Belgium’s internationals against Czech Republic on Monday night and a World Cup qualifier against Estonia next week with an ankle injury, hinted for the first time he could leave Stamford Bridge.
The Belgian Football Association confirmed that Hazard fractured his right ankle during a training session in Tubize on Sunday, with the forward expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks.
“Of course I would consider it if Madrid made an offer,” Hazard said. “I am keen to win trophies. It would be great to win the Champions League. But Chelsea’s goal is to win the Champions League as well. Honestly I do not know what will happen.
“I only know that I still have a contract with Chelsea for three seasons and that we just had an amazing 2016-17 campaign. We want to continue on this path and want to build on this in the Champions League. “I am feeling very well at Chelsea. But you never know what will happen. I have not met the board yet to discuss a new deal.” Denied the forthcoming internationals, he added: “I want to think about football as little as possible.”
Antonio Conte reiterated his desire to keep Hazard after he was instrumental in helping the Italian win the title in his first season in the Premier League but admitted that his future would depend on “the will of the player”.
“I think Eden is very happy to stay in Chelsea, to stay with us and work with us,” he said. “I can tell this. But the future? I haven’t a crystal ball, no. I think everything is possible. Everything is possible in football and not only for Eden but for every single player. You must understand that there are different wills to compare and then to take the decision.”
The Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has previously expressed his interest in Hazard, who scored 16 goals in the league as Chelsea won a second title in three seasons. But any move could potentially cost Real a world record fee in excess of the €100m Manchester United paid to sign Paul Pogba last summer.
Rory McIlroy has allayed fears over the rib problem which has disrupted his year by confirming he will be fit to participate in the US Open next week.
McIlroy, who will be in pursuit of a fifth major title at Erin Hills, withdrew from recent events in the United States and Europe because of the injury which has troubled him since the start of 2017. That backdrop meant the questioning of whether or not he would feature in the US Open but McIlroywho has been boosted by recuperation work during a fortnight at the five-star Quinta do Lago resort in Portugal, will return to competitive action on Thursday next week.
This marks a boost to the tournament as well as the Northern Irishman himself, especially after news that Phil Mickelson plans to skip the second major of the year to attend his daughter’s high school graduation.
“I am ready for Erin Hills and looking forward to playing there for the first time,” McIlroy, 28, said. “The last few weeks have obviously been frustrating – I never like to miss events either on the PGA Tour or European Tour – but it was important I got back to a level of fitness where I felt like I could give myself the best possible chance at the US Open.
“As I have said many times before, majors will ultimately determine my golf career but I have had the rest of this busy season to consider as well.
“Every aspect of the facilities at Quinta do Lago has been first class. I can’t thank the people there enough for the way they have looked after me. I have been able to work on fitness and golf without any distractions at all.”
This was McIlroy’s second such visit to the Algarve venue, where first‑class short‑game facilities meant he could attend to that aspect of his play even before hitting full shots this weekend. In 2015, he spent time there after the ankle injury sustained when playing football which caused him to miss the Open. Against all odds, McIlroy was back in action a matter of weeks later at the US PGA Championship.
The US Open, which McIlroy won in 2011, marks the start of a busy spell for the world No2. His charity foundation successfully hosts the Irish Open, which will be held in Portstewart before the Open and US PGA take place. McIlroy is also the defending champion of the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup, which finishes after the majors.
Injury has not proven the sole McIlroy story of 2017; he was married in late April and signed an equipment deal with TaylorMade, worth $100m, on the eve of The Players Championship the following month.
Mickelson’s surprise decision – his daughter Amanda will graduate in San Diego on the same day as the US Open’s first round – means he will have to wait at least another year to win the only major to thus far elude him. “We certainly understand and support that Phil’s family commitments are of paramount importance,” the tournament’s executive director, Mike Davis, said.
Alex Honnold has free-soloed El Capitan, completing a ropeless ascent of the legendary California cliff in just under four hours on Saturday morning, making the summit in time for breakfast.
The 31-year-old rock climber is the first to achieve the feat and indeed was regarded as the only climber capable of attempting it.
After completing the climb, Honnold tweeted: “So stoked to realize a life dream today”, including a photo of himself ascending along a wide crack near the top of the route.
“This is the ‘moon landing’ of free-soloing,” fellow climber Tommy Caldwell told National Geographic, which filmed the ascent for a documentary and first carried the news on its website.
Caldwell won fame outside the climbing world for his 2015 ascent with Kevin Jorgeson of El Capitan’s Dawn Wall route, setting a new standard of difficulty on the Yosemite valley cliff.
Free-soloing is the practice of climbing without a harness or rope, leaving zero margin for error. The route Honnold climbed, known as Freerider, is 2,900ft tall and near the top of the ratings system for difficulty, at 5.12d (6b UK).
At multiple points on the route, Honnold was obliged to make off-balance moves on widely spaced holds the width of raisins, with hundreds, and then thousands, of feet of air beneath him.
Honnold’s preparation for the exploit was the subject of rumor even as it was written off as impossibly daunting and risky. The Sacramento native, who has repeatedly shocked the climbing world with ropeless ascents of forbidding routes, had been discreetly training for the route for more than a year.
Honnold backed off of an earlier attempt at a free-solo, last November, after judging conditions to be suboptimal. He most recently climbed the route with a rope, and Caldwell as partner, on a Monday late last month.
“Alex was on fire,” Caldwell told National Geographic of the ascent. “I’ve never seen him climbing so well.”
Describing his preparations, Honnold said he had expanded his “comfort zone” until he was ready to commit to the route.
“Years ago, when I first mentally mapped out what it would mean to free-solo Freerider, there were half a dozen of pitches where I was like: ‘Oh, that’s a scary move and that’s a really scary sequence, and that little slab, and that traverse,’” Honnold told National Geographic.
“There were so many little sections where I thought ‘Ugh – cringe.’ But in the years since, I’ve pushed my comfort zone and made it bigger and bigger until these objectives that seemed totally crazy eventually fell within the realm of the possible.”
Honnold’s historic ascent began with the first hint of dawn at 5.32am on Saturday. He reached the top three hours and 56 minutes later, at 9.28am. Most roped ascents of El Capitan take hours, days, or longer.
The route was first ascended by a climber pulling only on stone – as opposed to pulling on gear drilled or cantilevered into the stone – in 1995, by the German climber Alex Huber. Huber wore a harness and was attached to ropes that would have caught him had he fallen. For much of its length, Freerider follows the Salathe Wall route, which was established in 1961 by the wall-climbing pioneer Royal Robbins, who died in March.
Honnold grew up in Sacramento and began climbing in the local training gym at age 11. He dropped out of the University of California at Berkeley, where he had been studying engineering, at age 19, to commit to his climbing career.
His previous exploits have been widely documented. One of his corporate sponsors, North Face, produced a 2014 film of his free-solo of the 2,500ft El Sendero Luminoso in Mexico. A National Geographic film crew captured Honnold’s revolutionary 2011 free-solo of the north-west face of Half Dome, in Yosemite, including a hair-raising moment of truth near the top in which Honnold struggled, uncharacteristically, to keep his cool.
As his stature in the climbing world and beyond has grown over the last decade, Honnold has maintained an itinerant lifestyle, living in a converted van and traveling the world. His training for Freerider took him to Europe, Morocco and China, according to National Geographic. The climbers who trained with him were sworn to secrecy about the project.
On his 20th Champions League night, Zinédine Zidane left with his second European Cup – as many as Pep Guardiola, José Mourinho or Sir Alex Ferguson. It was way after midnight by the time Sergio Ramos carried it out of Cardiff and Zidane had already departed, slipping away quietly, pausing only to embrace the Juventus manager, Massimiliano Allegri, as he went. As the Real Madrid players paraded the trophy around the pitch Zidane had stood aside with his wife, watching them, a fond look on his face. “The key is that they get on bloody brilliantly,” he insisted. Cristiano Ronaldo said: “He believes in us.”
Zidane had believed himself, too, quietly. Now everyone does. It has all happened so fast, history made swiftly. At the side of the pitch he was asked if he was the best manager in the world. Once that question might have been laughed at but in Cardiff it was legitimate. It will be asked again, too, even as there are those who resist, clinging to his own line that it is all about the players. “No,” Zidane said here. “Not that, no.”
Yet look what he and his team had just done, the men he had matched. His Madrid had become the first team since Arrigo Sacchi’s Milan, 27 years earlier to defend the European Cup.
No one had done it in the Champions League era. Zidane had done it in a season and a half. Ramos had called it a “date with history”, which it was, even for the biggest, most successful club of all. The next step is to mark a generation. It might sound strange to talk about this as the start of something when Madrid have won three European Cups in four years – Gareth Bale admitting “we’re getting used to this” – but that is how it felt. Perhaps because their manager is only just starting out. But what a start.
When he was presented, hastily pushed on to the stage in January 2016 as Rafa Benítez was dragged off it never to be spoken about again, Zidane was asked what constituted success. “Winning everything,” he replied. In less than two seasons he has won two European Cups, the European Super Cup, the Club World Cup and the league title – Madrid’s first in five years. They had waited 59 years to win a league and European Cup double. No one expected this, not even Zidane, the man who says he has a “star” somewhere, guiding him.
Zidane has empathised and encouraged rather than imposed
Even if the promise had been made a long time before, this was not the way he anticipated it. In the buildup to the final, the sports newspaper Marca recovered an old interview with Zidane, tagging it The Prophecy. Conducted in 2002, just after his wonderful volley in Glasgow had given Madrid their ninth European Cup, Zidane said he wanted to win their 10th, 11th and 12th as well. Eventually he has done so: it has taken 15 years, 17 months of them as manager.
A player in Glasgow, in Lisbon in 2014 he was Carlo Ancelotti’s assistant, while he led the team in Milan in 2016 and Cardiff this year. Zidane the manager has been more successful even than Zidane the player. Quietly does it. That has always been his way.
A former team-mate barely remembers him saying a word, describing him as shy, which is just one of the reasons why his success is unexpected. Even as assistant players did not see it, one member of the side who won in Lisbon admits. Yet the shyness was superficial and tranquillity has proven part of his success.
He might not say much but when Zidane does, people listen – perhaps precisely because he does not say much. It was always his personality, although get him alone and he is unexpectedly engaging, and now as a manager it is a conscious policy too: don’t complicate it, don’t overload. A member of the coaching staff says messages expressed to footballers should be limited to two clear concepts; beyond that you lose them. And as for long video sessions, forget it.
Zidane is familiar with footballers, attuned to their attitudes and concerns, especially at this elite level. He has made it about them, always; he wants them to be themselves, to feel important, but he has to guide them.
This is especially so when it comes to Ronaldo. No one has connected with him quite like this or convinced him to take a step back like this before, preparing and protecting him like this. Asked who would be the star if he had played with Ronaldo, Zidane replied: “I could play quite well but him for sure. He scores goals and that’s the hardest thing of all.” In Cardiff, Ronaldo scored two, as he has often of late. “The manager has been intelligent,” the forward said.
Zidane has empathised and encouraged rather than imposed. Benítez tried to stop Luka Modric playing those passes with the outside of the foot; Zidane offered up his admiration instead. But he has adjusted, too. Modric said after the final: “He tells us what we need to do in the defensive part and in the game to express ourselves, to keep the ball, to play for the team and to try to do our best. If he can see something that we can do on the pitch, he tells us.” He also explained how, at half-time, Zidane told his team to push higher up the pitch, demanding they be more aggressive. “[The turnaround] was definitely the mister,” Modric added.
That aggression is part of it, part of Zidane. There was always a presence about him, a quiet authority. It came with the player he was but also the man he is and the coach he wanted to be. The apparent timidity hid a toughness to which others testify, a competitiveness. A sense of honour, too – this is a man who publicly spoke out against Marine Le Pen, whom Jacques Chirac called a man of “heart and conviction”. As a footballer people said he was effortless but that was not a description he shared or welcomed. He saw himself as a competitor. “I’m not there to perform, I’m there to win,” he said.
After his retirement as a player, Zidane remained connected to Madrid. For everything he symbolised – the club’s president, Florentino Pérez, described him as the most emblematic signing he had ever made – he was useful to have around. However he was given roles that were largely empty and did not fulfil him – so he went his own way. He wanted to do something “real”. His word. He wanted to win.
Despite Saturday night’s showpiece in Cardiff, the season is not quite over yet. A round of internationals can be found tagged on almost apologetically next weekend, with England involved in a World Cup qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow on Saturday before a friendly in France takes place three days later.
A return to France will inevitably evoke memories of another tired tournament campaign coming to an even more cataclysmic end than usual with defeat by Iceland, though it might be more positive to reflect on how much has changed since then. When England take on Scotland it will be a year since Euro 2016 kicked off, with France overcoming a stubborn Romania through a late Dimitri Payet goal. Payet was still a West Ham player at the time, and when he scored his next goal a proud Slaven Bilic climbed on the desk in the ITV studio set to express his excitement.
On 10 June last year Roy Hodgson was still England manager, about to be frustrated the following day by a 1-1 draw with Russia, Wayne Rooney was still captain, Gareth Southgate was in charge of the under-21s and Sam Allardyce had last been seen dancing the night away in Marbella in celebration of Sunderland’s Premier League survival.
When it all began to unravel last summer things happened so fast it is hard to believe England are now on their second manager since the tournament ended, and even more ludicrous to consider that Allardyce has had three different employers in the same timeframe, doing as solid a job for Crystal Palace as he had done for Sunderland but crucially bungling the big opportunity in the middle. It seems odd that Allardyce is now ostensibly out of the game, his England potential untested, while a manager with a far less impressive club record is learning on the job, though at least Southgate’s enthusiasm for keynote speaking, pints of wine and making a large amount of money for just a few hours’ work is unlikely to prove his undoing.
Results might, but so far England have been making smooth progress. At the half way stage in World Cup qualifying they are four points clear at the top of Group F, the only side still unbeaten, with two of the trickier away trips – Slovakia and Slovenia– already out of the way. In theory, those games ought to prove the most difficult in what is far from the toughest of groups, though Scotland away will always be uncomfortable for England, even if Gordon Strachan’s side are in fourth place with two wins from five games. This could reasonably be regarded as Southgate’s biggest test to date and that should be borne in mind when evaluating the quiet yet determined way in which the manager has gone about his job.
Perhaps dropping Rooney was an easy decision, given his limited number of games for Manchester United and his relatively muted impact when played, though Southgate made sure he left the door open for the future. It is possible that Rooney might find some form with a run of games for a different club next season and should that happen there would be no obstacle to a return.
Southgate would simply do the sensible thing, just as he did when recalling and then keeping faith with Jermain Defoe. Despite the age of each player and the perceived closeness to retirement Defoe has been playing more games than Rooney and proving more effective on the pitch so he deserves to be in the squad.
At the other end of the age scale Southgate was right to stick to his guns over Marcus Rashford, who made it to Euro 2016 and does not need a return to the under-21s after establishing himself in United’s first team. José Mourinho did not want his player with the under-21s for a tournament in Poland anyway but, as Southgate says, the decision on internationals who could still be important parts of the England setup in 10 years’ time has to be that of the England manager. “Somebody has to protect him, somebody has to manage the development of a young player, and that has to be my call,” Southgate pointed out.
“Marcus is in the senior squad on merit, and has been for a year. His performances warrant him being in the senior squad. He could still have gone with the under-21s afterwards but that would not be right. He is a 19-year-old player who has had an exceptional season but by that point he will be close to 60 matches.”
Southgate is also correct in saying Rashford is not the only England forward in good form – Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Defoe have had strong seasons – and with Dele Alli, Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling to choose from in the support positions Scotland must be quite worried about how to contain the English attacking threat.
With few exceptions, now that the obligation to use Rooney in the starting lineup has been sidestepped, England travel to Scotland with a young yet experienced squad, full of players who have been performing consistently well for their clubs. As such times managing a national team can look simple, and perhaps it is, though there is an art to keeping things simple and not being distracted by peripheral considerations. Allarcyce could tell Southgate all about that.
Most of the previous England managers would tell him what he already knows, that he will stand or fall by tournament performances rather than results in qualifying. Yet looking back at what happened to his immediate predecessor Southgate can take heart. At least he is likely to get to a tournament.
Antoine Griezmann has pledged his immediate future to Atlético Madrid, saying it would be a “dirty move” to leave the club after their transfer ban was upheld.
The France forward, 26, had been heavily linked with a potential world-record transfer to Manchester United, but any such move is off after the court of arbitration for sport last week upheld a ban on the club registering new players in this transfer window.
Speaking on Sunday morning during the French television programme Telefoot, Griezmann said: “The ruling of the CAS has come through. Atlético cannot recruit. With my sporting adviser, Eric Olhats, we decided to stay. It’s a hard time for the club. It would be a dirty move to leave now. We talked to the leaders and we will be back for next season.”
Atlético, along with their city rivals Real Madrid, were handed two-window transfer bans in January 2016 for multiple breaches of global football’s rules on the registration of under-18s and both clubs failed in their appeals to Fifa last September.
The two Spanish giants then took their cases to the CAS but, while Real’s ban was halved to one transfer window in December, Atlético announced on Thursday that the only reduction they had been given was regarding their financial penalty – down from £720,000 to £440,000.
That leaves them unable to sign new players until the January window, ending the club’s bid to bring in the Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette, who was seen as a likely replacement for Griezmann.
Griezmann, who has a release clause in his contract set at €100m(£87m), scored 26 goals in 53 appearances for Atlético this past season.
A test opening of St Petersburg’s Zenit Arena in February treated 10,000 spectators to car racing, motorcycle tricks, dancers and a performing bear introduced as “Russia’s greatest hero”. But the patriotic ceremony failed to note that the stadium, in which Russia kick off the Confederations Cup in a fortnight in preparation for next year’s World Cup, was built mostly by immigrant workers from Asia, including from one of the world’s most repressive countries, North Korea.
A subcontractor who asked to remain anonymous said at least 190 “downtrodden” North Koreans had worked long hours with no days off between August and November last year and that one, a 47-year-old, had died on site. “These guys are afraid to speak to people. They don’t look at anyone. They’re like prisoners of war,” the subcontractor said.
An employee of a North Korean state company that brings workers to Russia told the Observer at a St Petersburg construction site that the men often worked long hours and had to give part of their pay to the regime in Pyongyang to “facilitate the country’s defence”, which includes its nuclear weapons programme.
Tens of thousands of North Korean labourers in Russia work in often “slave-like conditions”, according to Marzuki Darusman, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The companies that hire them “become complicit in an unacceptable system of forced labour”, he said.
Although a law passed in Russia in 2013 exempts employers connected with the World Cup from much of the country’s labour regulations, the North Koreans’ work at the stadium calls into question Fifa’s and Moscow’s commitment to human rights in the preparations for the tournament. In a blanket statement in response to questions about the use of North Korean labour, Fifa told the Observer it monitored conditions for migrant workers and would “continue to follow up any allegations made with regards to human rights violations”.
The St Petersburg construction committee said the authorities had conducted regular inspections to make sure conditions at the Zenit Arena site met Russian labour laws. But according to the subcontractor, North Koreans at the site worked at least 11 hours a day for $10-$15, seven days a week. They not only earned less than other migrant workers but lived in more cramped conditions, six to eight workers sharing one construction caravan.
The North Korean had died from a heart attack, the subcontractor said. He added that fatigue was a danger. “When you lose your reaction time due to fatigue, you can get hurt out of the blue, just like that.”
While Russia’s World Cup preparations have not had the same number of fatalities as those for the 2022 competition in Qatar, where hundreds of migrant workers have been killed during a huge construction boom, the Observer found in 2015 that at least five workers had died in accidents at the Zenit Arena. The subcontractor said another five had died between August and December 2016, including the North Korean.
Allegations of exploitation of North Korean workers are only the latest chapter in the spotted history of the Zenit Arena. When St Petersburg started planning a new stadium in 2006 for Zenit, the project was scheduled to finish by the end of 2008 and cost 6.7bn roubles (£92m at today’s exchange rate). As construction finally neared its end almost a decade later, the city’s vice-governor, Igor Albin, said the cost of the 68,000-seat venue had risen more than sixfold to 43bn roubles.
The actual cost is very likely to be much higher – owing to corruption, mismanagement and fluctuations in the exchange rate – making it one of the most expensive stadiums per seat in the world, according to Dmitry Sukharev, a former construction worker who heads the St Petersburg branch of the global anti-corruption NGO Transparency International. The St Petersburg construction committee did not respond to a request for comment about costs.
Despite the huge spending, Fifa reportedly found last year that the Zenit Arena’s removable pitch did not meet its shock absorption standards. Vladimir Putin is said to have told Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, that the stadium’s scandal-ridden construction was a “very sad story” and promised that all defects would be fixed. After the city fired the general contractor last July over delays and cost overruns, the vice-governor Albin managed to gather more than 4,000 workers at the site for a final push to finish it. That is when three companies brought in North Korean workers, the subcontractor said.
Pyongyang has been exporting manpower to Russia since Soviet times, including to logging camps in Russia’s far east. In testimony provided to the Observer, Choi Myong-bok, a refugee who escaped a logging camp in the Amur region in 2002, said the camp was “a living hell, it was an open-air prison, wardens watched us around the clock”. He said he lived in inhumane conditions in crowded construction caravans infested by lice and bedbugs and subsisted on melted snow, rice, salt and whatever mushrooms and berries he could gather.
Pyongyang earns up to $2.3bn (£1.8bn) a year sending workers such as Choi abroad, mostly to China and Russia. This is despite UN sanctions meant to deprive it of foreign currency for developing nuclear weapons. Moscow has recently signed agreements with Pyongyang to increase trade and employment of North Korean workers at agricultural and timber operations. According to the federal migration service, 30,000 North Koreans were estimated to be in Russia as of 2015.
Last year the two governments signed a treaty to extradite citizens who illegally enter either country, an agreement condemned by the UN as a mechanism to send North Korean workers who seek asylum back to face torture or death. But only a handful have sought asylum. “They all have families and if one runs away then it wouldn’t be good for his family, because it’s a communist order there, like we had under Stalin,” said Maria Trush, the administrator of a branch of Apart Hostel, a five-storey dormitory in an industrial zone outside St Petersburg close to where a North Korean subcontractor has an office.
Trush has been housing construction workers on and off for the past five years. She said the North Koreans typically worked “like ants”, starting at 8am and ending at 11pm. In the little free time they had, they watched North Korean state television or dubbed Soviet films.
Malsar Khuseinov, the director of Soyuz-Stroi, a construction company that employs 200 North Koreans, said workers were allowed to “extend the work day as much as they need” to meet a deadline. Pyongyang “commands and controls them” through “captains” on the ground, he said. “They have the right kind of discipline,” he said, adding that it was “out of the question” that any of them would run away.
Another construction firm, Dalpiterstroi, employed 60 North Koreans at the Zenit Arena, the company’s PR and advertising director, Anna Bochenkova, said. But they worked eight, not 11, hours a day, and she denied allegations of low pay and overcrowded construction caravans. “They work in good conditions with standard pay, like all workers on St Petersburg construction sites, at market price, and have good living conditions,” she said.
Bochenkova said she could not comment on the North Korean worker who died but denied it could have been caused by overwork. “A person can die from a heart attack just walking down the street anywhere in the world,” she said.
On a recent night in the suburb of Shushary, this reporter found a two-storey, metal-sided dormitory where North Korean workers live in a large cluster of similar housing. A man preparing food in the small, low kitchen immediately made a call on his cellphone and within minutes a well-dressed man who gave his name only as Choi arrived. He said he was a translator for the North Korean state company that brings workers to Russia.
Thirty-two men lived in the Shushary dormitory, he said, and another 100 were working in the suburb of Pargolovo. A North Korean fell to his death from a nine-storey building there in June, Choi confirmed. The men are sent to Russia for five years, work 12 hours a day with two hours for lunch, rest on weekends, and make 50,000-60,000 roubles a month (£685-£825), of which they give 5%-10% to the Pyongyang government, he said.
Nearby, a group of North Korean workers were still pouring concrete on the 22nd storey of a residential tower at 10.30pm. When asked, one of them at the base of the tower said he made 50,000 to 60,000 roubles a month. A security guard quickly ended the conversation.
The Observer also ran into Choi and another worker on a muddy track between the dormitories and the building sites. The worker said he started each day around 8.30am or 9am and carried on until 7pm or 8pm, with two hours for lunch. That day, a delayed batch of concrete had pushed work later, he said. “I came to see this city, which is beautiful and famous around the world,” he said, adding that he had worked in Russia since 2014.
Asked how much he made, he also said 50,000 to 60,000 roubles a month. The conversation was cut short by security guards who briefly detained this reporter in a construction trailer.
The Norwegian football magazine Josimar recently found another group of about 100 North Koreans who were living in construction caravans and working long hours at another Dalpiterstroi site, surrounded by barbed wire and guards with dogs.
In reality, the workers are likely to make far less than the figures they cite as the Pyongyang regime takes 30%-50% of their income, according to Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert. Nevertheless, working abroad was one of the few ways for North Koreans to improve their financial situation, he added.
While there are many exceptions to the standard 40-hour week stipulated in Russia’s labour code, working at least 10 hours a day for most of five years, like the North Koreans said they do, would violate the law, two lawyers told this newspaper.
Last week it emerged that Infantino had admitted that Fifa was aware of the issues. In a letter dated 22 May to Nordic FA presidents who had raised the issue, he said: “Fifa is aware of and firmly condemns the often appalling labour conditions under which North Korean workers are employed in various countries around the world.” He acknowledged that an inspection team for Fifa’s decent work monitoring system, set up to address concerns about human rights abuses, did find “strong evidence for the presence of North Korean workers on the construction site in St Petersburg” on a visit in November. “The issues found were subsequently raised with the respective company and with the general contractor,” Infantino wrote. Fifa said a further inspection in March found no more North Koreans working at the site.
According to Svetlana Gannushkina, a veteran migrant rights activist who helps North Korean refugees, the authorities rarely raise any questions about these workers. “The rights of people working on our territory should be respected, no matter who their overlords are, but this isn’t done,” she said. “It’s an area of complete lawlessness.”
Gianluigi Buffon stood with his hands on his hips, staring vacantly into the distance and not moving for what felt like an age. Behind him the Real Madrid supporters were raucously celebrating their third goal and their second in the space of three minutes, flooring Juventus and leaving Buffon looking like a man who knew that the dream was over long before the clock had ticked down.
This was anything but the “perfect finale” Buffon had talked about 24 hours earlier, when the 39-year-old expressed his hope that he would get his hands on the only major trophy to elude him in a distinguished career that has spanned three decades. Buffon has won eight Serie A titles, a World Cup in 2006 and represented Italy 168 times, yet there is no Champions League winners medal in his trophy cabinet and, realistically, probably never will be.
It was an evening that brought with it an uncomfortable sense of deja vu for Buffon and Juventus, who have now lost seven of their nine European Cup finals and could be forgiven for fearing the worst whenever they get to this stage of the competition. Buffon has appeared in three of those showpieces and the latest ended in humiliating fashion as Real Madrid demonstrated once again why they are the most accomplished team in Europe by a distance.
In one respect Buffon was proved right. Asked beforehand whether this would come down to a contest between himself and Cristiano Ronaldo, the Juventus goalkeeper replied: “I’m not so conceited as to say that, I would never put myself on the same pedestal as Cristiano Ronaldo. My role is to defend; we are complete opposites. He is able to determine the outcome of a game more than me.”
That was certainly the case as Ronaldo struck Madrid’s first goal and inflicted further damage with his second. Casemiro and Marco Asensio got the other Madrid goals on a night when Buffon was beaten four times, twice via deflections. It was that kind of occasion for the veteran goalkeeper and his team-mates, who totally lost their way in the second half as Luka Modric and Toni Kroos took control of midfield and Ronaldo does what he does best.
What a transformation from the opening 45 minutes, when Juventus took the game to Madrid, attacking with conviction and scoring a goal worthy of winning the Champions League, let alone merely equalising in a final.
Unfortunately for Mario Mandzukic, the spectacular overhead kick that he speared beyond Keylor Navas, the Madrid keeper, at the end of a lovely move involving Gonzalo Higuaín and Alex Sandro, brought only ephemeral joy. Juventus could not sustain that high-tempo approach after the interval.
Paulo Dybala, who scored twice in the quarter-final win over Barcelona and is so highly regarded, never imposed himself on the game and was withdrawn.
Higuaín, other than the assist for Mandzukic’s goal, carried little threat, while the influence of Sami Khedira and Miralem Pjanic, who was also substituted in the second half after picking up an injury, started to wane.
The sight of Juan Cuadrado receiving a red card in the 84th minute for a second bookable offence rather summed up the second half. It was a poor decision from the officials, with Sergio Ramos not for the first time in his career guilty of play-acting, yet by that stage everything Juventus tried to do seemed to be going wrong.
The solid defensive base on which this Champions League campaign has been built evaporated. Juventus conceded more times in 90 minutes against Madrid than they did in the previous 12 matches in the competition put together as the Old Lady’s experienced back-line started to look their age.
It was impossible not to feel some sympathy for Buffon, who trudged across with the rest of the players to applaud the Juventus supporters that had stayed behind as Sergio Ramos hoisted the European Cup into the Cardiff sky. Buffon has been an extraordinary servant to Juve, the club he joined for a world record €51m in 2001 to replace Edwin van der Sar, and it will be a strange day when someone else is wearing that No1 jersey for the club that have dominated Italian football for the past six seasons.
It feels like he has been around forever. When Buffon made his debut as a professional footballer in 1995, George Weah and Roberto Baggio were lining up for Milan against him, two legends of the game who are now in their fifties. He has clocked up more than 1,000 games since, including 108 appearances in the Champions League, and is the only player in this Juventus squad to also have featured in the defeat against Milan on penalties in the 2003 final.
Although Massimiliano Allegri left the door open to the possibility of Buffon trying again next season, with the Juventus manager refusing to accept the idea that several players in his team have reached the end of a cycle and that it is time to usher in a new era, age and history appear to be against the Italian goalkeeper. Perhaps that was going through his mind when he stood alone on his penalty area after Madrid’s third goal.
I’ve always wondered why anyone would want to race cars or motorbikes on the road. A normal, narrow country road lined with brick walls, hedges, telegraph poles and iron gates; road furniture as it’s known in racing circles. That need for speed is something I’ve experienced both on bikes and in cars, but I’ve always opted for the “soft” option of a purpose-built track with width and run-off areas.
During two decades of working in motor sport, I’ve been gripped by road racing – the countless laps of on-board footage, the absolute speed and the imminent danger. I’ve also been lucky to build great friendships with riders like John McGuinness, the legendary Isle of Man TT racer, and others who have turned their backs on the soft option to embrace the road.
But until April, I’d never actually been to a road race. So I was a novice spectator at the Cookstown 100 – a 2.1-mile circuit in County Tyrone that forms one date of a 10-race season with five tracks each side of the border.  I’d heard about three female riders – Melissa Kennedy, Veronika Hankocyova and Yvonne Montgomery – who are at the heart of this male-dominated sport and when the BBC asked me to do a fly-on-the-wall on how and why they do it, I jumped at the chance.
Set just outside Cookstown, the paddock is as grassroots as you can get. It was essentially a field of dogs, vans, tents and plenty of bikes, but you’re immediately struck by the overwhelming friendliness and family vibe that comes from this hardened bunch of riders. The place is lit by smiles and I instantly felt adopted. For the weekend I was part of the gang. They let me in, each family, each tent holding its own story.
One of the starkest aspects was seeing up close how, as amateurs, these riders have to fund everything themselves and how in many cases it takes over their lives. They all work full-time and rely on good-natured bosses to take the odd extra Friday off to go racing. Some bosses get it, some don’t, and as a result not everyone gets to race every weekend.
Pretty much all their cash goes into it. Take Yvonne. She won’t get her nails done because that equates to a can of fuel. It’s those kinds of choices that these riders are making to follow their passion. But in truth, it turned out that this was probably the least extraordinary thing about Yvonne.
When I met her, she was in her leathers waiting for the call for her class. She races both 400cc and 600cc bikes and her crew consists of one friend. Incredibly, she hadn’t turned a wheel on a bike until she was 47, only taking it up following the break-up of her marriage.  Within a year she was racing. That was 13 years ago and she celebrates her 60th birthday in August. I know she won’t mind me headlining this; she’s adamant that as you get older you should do more because you’re running out of time. It’s hard to argue with that.
Not that you could ever have a cross word with Yvonne, her soft Irish lilt is as enchanting as her personality. “I’m addicted,” she says. She’s also the happiest she has ever been.
Yvonne reminds me of someone: Valentino Rossi. The nine-times world champion who is also a racing addict. He loves winning. It’s what he lives for. He and Yvonne are leagues apart in many ways and yet identical when it comes to the force that drives them. To race any bike, in any discipline, you have to be passionate and want to do it.
That passion is evident in the paddock at Cookstown. It couldn’t be more different from the MotoGP set-up of Mugello in the rolling Tuscan hills when it comes to backdrop and facilities, but they are equally matched on desire and the love of racing. One is the sharp end, dripping in sponsor money, flashy hospitality and top-notch technology. The other is as raw as racing can be.
Veronika drives her truck from her home in Prague with her fiance, Indi, so that they can both partake. They’ve fallen in love with Northern Ireland and made it their second home. Like the rest of the field, their lives are dominated by the need to get to these races. The 32-year‑old Veronika tells me they feel most alive when they are racing and despite being together for nearly a decade, it keeps them too busy to get married.
But the dangers of road racing are ever-present and the fragility of flying down country lanes at speeds of up to 200mph is real here. Five years earlier at this same event Indi broke his back in a crash. We chat as Veronika watches him qualify and she is more terrified looking on than racing herself. I can understand from the point of it being beyond her control. I’ve seen the same nerves throughout the World Superbike and MotoGP paddock from mums, wives and girlfriends the world over.
I ask Melissa, a 25-year-old from just outside Enniskillen in the west of Northern Ireland, if it’s selfish. She nods. Her mum, Letitia, has kittens every time she goes out. I feel for Letitia when Melissa races her Moto3 bike, she is 4ft 11in and the rest of the field dwarf her in size and strength. But she is a demon when the visor comes down. I find myself wanting her to do well. This is Melissa’s MotoGP; this is her chance to do what she loves. She gets that, her family does too and that’s what matters to her.
Personally, I still can’t totally understand why they do it. I couldn’t. But I have a huge respect for these riders. They take dedication to another level. They operate under the most incredible pressures on the mind and body, making big sacrifices to ensure they can get back on the bike and do it all over again the following week.
In a world where things are becoming increasingly sanitised, I’m heartened that this freedom of choice can still happen despite the danger. Of course it’s dangerous, all motor sport is, but road racing comes with its own special danger. The roads are narrow and the walls are close, but equally this provides the thrill for those who choose to take part and those lucky enough to watch them in action.

There is no better time for an honest review than after a flawed victory. England have a win under their belts against Bangladesh and by 6pm on Thursday it was all reassuringly straightforward. But earlier there had been disconcerting moments and some of them took place before the match began.
The first ones came with the teamsheet. Might Jake Ball become the new Gary Ballance? These two are very worthy cricketers. But in the 2015 World Cup the selection of an out-of-form Ballance for England’s first match came to personify the insecure safety-first instincts that were to bedevil the side throughout that (much longer) campaign.
At the Oval the pitch was brown, true and slow. There was not much there for the pace bowlers, yet England chose five of them with Ball preferred to Adil Rashid. This hinted at a lack of self-belief, which, to be fair, has not been a characteristic of Eoin Morgan’s clear-sighted regime since that calamitous World Cup. This was a surprise since Rashid had been selected for 41 of England’s past 44 ODI matches. The conditions demanded variety rather than a battery of five right-handed pace bowlers plus Moeen Ali. For England’s most important match in 45 ODIs, they declined to pick their wrist-spinner. (Mind you, Bangladesh were equally cautious when deciding to omit their specialist spinner, Mehedi Hasan, who gave England such a roasting in two Tests in the winter)
So this suggested that England do not have absolute faith in Rashid, who, according to his self-effacing spin partner, Moeen, “has many more variations” and is therefore a more likely wicket-taker. Morgan keeps telling us that he is always chasing wickets: for the record Moeen has 47 in 55 matches, Rashid 63 in 46.
However, the preference for Ball rather than Rashid probably reflected a greater lack of faith in the fitness of some of England’s bowlers, which was subsequently justified. Ben Stokes has had all the attention and out of necessity he was compelled to propel seven overs on Thursday. But Chris Woakes, who had missed England’s last two ODIs, could manage just two before his left side was strained, the only two overs he will bowl in the Champions Trophy. Was Woakes compensating in his delivery stride because of his recent thigh problem? We will never know. Now Ball may become a legitimate selection.
Perhaps there has been an element of wish fulfilment in England’s assessment of the fitness of Stokes and Woakes. They are England’s engine room, two all-rounders near their peak; vital players long since inked into the best side. Why would you not be desperate for them to play?
This yearning stretches to Andrew Strauss, England’s cricket director, who gave this pair permission for an extended stay in the Indian Premier League. They were first choices in their teams, unlike Morgan or Jason Roy, so they were kept busy. Both are adamant that the Indian experience has enhanced them as cricketers. But both are battling with their bodies. Is that merely an unlucky coincidence? Something for Strauss to ponder.
That wish fulfilment may also extend to Roy, who has reached double figures once (when scoring 20 against Ireland at Lord’s) in six ODIs this summer. Morgan’s faith in Roy is admirable and almost absolute – he has hinted that he would keep picking the Surrey opener in this tournament come what may. However, such faith cannot last indefinitely; soon it may border on superstition.
To replace Roy with Jonny Bairstow (albeit an inexperienced opener) would not be another Ballance moment betraying a loss of faith in England’s oft-quoted positive approach. Bairstow may have a different technique to Roy but his approach is similar. To use a couple of old-fashioned adjectives, seldom used now, he is strong rather than stable.
Against better attacks than that of Bangladesh, England might need a full quota of batsmen as well as the bowlers most likely to conjure up some wickets on true tracks. In tournament cricket the short-term goals prevail; showing the faith and being consistent by backing your chosen men has to give way to picking the bloke likely to score the most runs at some point. Roy’s rope may not extend beyond the New Zealand game if he remains in his trough.
Still, England produced a rather better performance than when they last encountered Bangladesh in an ICC tournament in Adelaide (defeat by 15 runs and an early flight home in 2015). It will be trickier in Cardiff on Tuesday against the Kiwis. Surely they were the Antipodeans at Edgbaston who were denied victory by the rain on Friday.
New Zealand always seem undaunted when playing against their noisy neighbours and they are unlikely to be overawed by the prospect of facing England. Against Australia, they tossed in Luke Ronchi, a wildcard, as an opening batsman; Kane Williamson became the tournament’s second centurion after Joe Root – the cream is already coming to the surface – and in a brief period in the field their trio of pace bowlers demonstrated the benefits of bowling with genuine hostility at the start. They are not compromising their modern, aggressive approach.
The Edgbaston no result means that one more victory for England in Group A – either against the Kiwis or Australia on Saturday – will allow Morgan’s side a passage into the semi‑finals.
In the spring of 2005, the first postcards arrived. “They’ll be ready,” the cards read, “are you?” Soon after, wristbands came, sent by special delivery. They had “Power of Four” written on them, which, it turned out, was the official motto of the 2005 British & Irish Lions tour. It was all part of Clive Woodward’s grand plan. Woodward had spent 12 months scheming and made “no apologies for believing this is the best-prepared tour in the history of Lions rugby”.
The last card he sent out had “What The Fuck Is Going On?” written on the front, and “if you feel like this in any meeting, hold up the card …” overleaf. It turned out to be the most useful of the lot. Within four months, Woodward’s hard-earned reputation was shot, and the Lions had been whitewashed for the first time in five tours.
Between them, Ian McGeechan and Warren Gatland have spent a lot of time in the past 12 years unpicking the mistakes Woodward made and putting the Lions back together again. Even now, Gatland says the Lions mission in New Zealand this summer is “to go there and mend some stuff from 2005”, that he wants his squad “to engage with the community, to play some good rugby, to get the public on our side, and to be great tourists”. All things they failed to do 12 years ago.
Woodward picked 44 players and 28 support staff, including 10 coaches, a legal adviser, a former referee and, of course, Alastair Campbell as his head of media relations. “His attention to detail was remorseless,” said Gareth Thomas. The players were given iPods loaded with specially chosen songs, including the Lions’ own new anthem. Woodward expected everyone to learn the words by the time they arrived in New Zealand. McGeechan, an assistant coach, felt Woodward had overlooked one thing. “I kept asking Clive when we were going to talk rugby, when we were going to sit down to say: ‘This is how we are going to beat the All Blacks.’”
First, the Lions had to play Argentina, in a match arranged to help cover the £10m cost of the tour. The training sessions for the game were interrupted by a series of classes and seminars. “We were working on our questionable lineouts,” recalled Lewis Moody. “The session was interrupted midway through because we had to attend a meeting with Alastair Campbell, to discuss how to deal with the media. So 48 hours before taking on the Pumas an unprepared team working desperately hard to perfect their set-piece are told to attend media studies.”
There was also a team-building class, in which the squad co-operated on a painting. “There was a fair amount of grumbling,” Campbell wrote in his dairy, “but when the whole thing was done, we had painted a giant mural with the logo and a sense of what we wanted the tour to be. It was actually pretty breathtaking.” He was impressed. Donncha O’Callaghan wasn’t. “It was basically colour by numbers. It did nothing for me. I had to draw a rhino in my corner of the canvas and I stuck a cigarette in his mouth.” There are, O’Callaghan felt, two ways to bond a new group of players. Neither involved murals. “Let them kick the shit out of each other on the training field” or “let them go out on the piss for a night”.
Eddie O’Sullivan thought the tour already felt like a “three-ring circus”. McGeechan was more diplomatic. He described it as “a brave attempt to update the Lions”. Either way, everyone agreed with Moody’s verdict after the Lions had drawn with Argentina, 25-25 as Jonny Wilkinson kicked a penalty in the final minute. “I trudged off the pitch, with three Tests looming against an All Black side that were on fire,” Moody wrote. “I couldn’t help but think: ‘Fuck, this is going to be difficult’.”
The Lions won their first game of the tour, against Bay of Plenty, but lost Lawrence Dallaglio, who flew home injured. He was not the only player who felt his tour was over already. “Some guys would have a hard job playing themselves off the team, I didn’t have that luxury,” wrote Ronan O’Gara. By half-time, O’Gara was sure his tour was done. “Why? Because I missed three tackles.” O’Gara suspected Woodward had made up his mind about the team long before they got to New Zealand. His poor performance in the opening half made it easy to leave the Irish fly-half out.
Woodward had said there was “no way you can dissect a tour party into two separate groups”. But that was exactly what he did. “This has never been done before,” Brian O’Driscoll wrote in his diary. “Soon enough we’ll find out why.” The midweek team, who were being coached by McGeechan, adopted Travis’s Driftwood as their own anthem – “We’re driftwood, floating with the Lions, we only play on Tuesdays, Tuesdays”.
On 11 June, the Lions lost to the New Zealand Maori 19-13. It was Shane Williams’s first game of the tour. “I got absolutely battered,” Williams wrote. “I can remember thinking afterwards: ‘My God, I hope all the games aren’t as physical as this.’” Panic began to set in. The coaches picked “the guts of the Saturday team” to play again against Wellington the following Wednesday. “After that,” O’Callaghan wrote, “it was obvious to a lot of fellas that the XV for the first Test was already picked, probably before we’d even left home.”
In the run-up to the first Test, the midweek players found they were locked out of the video analysis room. “What did they think we were going to do? Sell our secrets to the All Blacks?” O’Callaghan asked. “There was an element of paranoia about the place that was uncomfortable.” The Lions surrounded their training ground with an 8ft tall fence. Before one session, they had their security remove a group of schoolchildren from the ground. “We came across as arrogant,” McGeechan thought, “and it made the All Blacks and the country desperate for us to get beaten.”
Meanwhile, Williams felt there were “too many chiefs”. The coaches kept “chopping and changing from one session to the next, with different people giving us different messages”. Wales had won the Grand Slam that spring, playing a very different way to the England team which had won the World Cup two years earlier, the difference epitomised in their two fly-halves, Stephen Jones and Wilkinson. “I had just won a Grand Slam with Wales and wanted to attack and play from anywhere,” Jones wrote, “while Jonny had won a World Cup with England by playing mistake-free rugby and to the strengths of a great pack.”
Unable to pick one or the other, the coaches chose both, Jones at fly-half and Wilkinson at inside centre. Which meant leaving out Gavin Henson. According to Thomas, Campbell made a hamfisted attempt to manage the fall-out. He “distributed misleading quotes” from Henson, and arranged “to have a hidden photographer take shots of Clive and Gav, without their knowledge, to give the errant impression that all was well.” Campbell, Thomas said, “had been parachuted in from a world with different parameters and principles” and “struggled with the nuances of a rugby dressing room”.
The coaches’ paranoia peaked three days before the first Test, when they convinced themselves that they should junk all the team’s lineout calls because they were worried about spies. The upshot, Matt Dawson recalled, was that “we went into the game with the most complex set of calls I have ever known, so complex that the players didn’t understand them. Two days before the first Test on supposedly the best organised of all Lions tours, no one knew where the ball was going.”
One thing the Lions had nailed down was how to handle the haka. Woodward had sought advice on it from a Maori elder. “We spread out in a half-moon shape, with me out front as the leader and the youngest member, Dwayne Peel, standing behind me,” recalled Brian O’Driscoll. “When the haka ends, I pull up some grass and throw it at them, as if pulling the ground from underneath their feet.” Dawson, a substitute that day, remembered “the All Blacks look at us with an expression that does not suggest gratitude at the respect we believe we have just paid to their heritage”.
Forty seconds into the match, O’Driscoll charged into a ruck. The All Blacks’ hooker, Keven Mealamu, grabbed his left leg and the All Blacks captain, Tana Umaga, came in from the right. Together they hoisted O’Driscoll up and tipped him over. O’Driscoll stuck out an arm to break his fall, and broke his shoulder too. Eleven minutes later, Paul O’Connell, pumped up on a specially brewed energy drink, was sent to the sin-bin, and seven minutes after that Richard Hill wrecked his anterior cruciate ligament, and was carried off to join O’Driscoll. The game soon became what Thomas called “the damage limitation exercise from hell”.
“The conditions were atrocious,” wrote Jason Robinson, “the rain was falling horizontally and it was blowing a gale.” Thomas was “as cold as I have ever been on a rugby field. My hands were numb and I had a single thought frozen in my brain: ‘Let’s get off here, and assess where we are.’” Inside, Wilkinson was desperate. “We are cannon fodder. It’s helpless. I get so frustrated and very fired up. I start looking for big hits everywhere, whether they are on or not, to try and change the game. I don’t know how else we are going to achieve anything.” It was the first time he had ever felt so helpless on a rugby field.
The Lions lost 21-3. In the aftermath, all anyone wanted to talk about was the injury to O’Driscoll. The Lions liked it that way. Campbell showed reporters video footage of the incident in slow-mo. The citing officer decided that Mealamu and Umaga had done nothing wrong, but did ban Danny Grewcock for biting Mealamu. “From this point to the end of the trip there is no other topic of conversation than how Brian was treated and how those responsible got away with it,” Dawson said. “Every day we are briefed on what we should and should not say. It becomes all encompassing and a distraction.”
McGeechan felt the Lions “seemed to lose the moral high ground in the dispute when Campbell came out with a stream of statements and interviews”.
O’Driscoll gave a press conference early the next morning. “I don’t possess the equanimity to take a pounding like that and say nothing, to put it down as part of the game. Because it isn’t,” he wrote. “I describe it as deliberate foul play, dangerous, a cheap shot.” His team-mates agreed. “It was awful, unforgiveable, and duly swept under the carpet,” Thomas wrote. “It was one of the worst home-town decisions I have ever seen.”
Thomas took over as captain. He felt the Lions were being derided “as a bunch of spineless whingers”, and that Woodward’s decision to bring along a refereeing consultant and a legal adviser had “spawned accusations of arrogance”. Campbell had put up a “war wall” of negative cuttings to motivate the players. But after three days there the wall was overflowing and was taken down. Under all the pressure, Thomas was worried “the natural cracks and fissures” were starting to show. And the fact each player had his own room was making it worse.
“Their rooms became bunkers almost,” wrote O’Sullivan. Before the tour, the joke had been that the one problem the Lions would not suffer from was loneliness. But Paul O’Connell found it to be one of the loneliest experiences of his career. He holed up on his own, and even started smoking. “Until that tour I hadn’t smoked one in years. I was brushing my teeth six or seven times a day: I wanted to brush away the smell of smoke. I wasn’t getting a whole lot out of the tour and I remember thinking there might be one benefit when it was over. At least I might have white teeth by the end of this fucking trip.”
Morale flatlined when Woodward allowed Campbell to give a team talk. “For reasons known only to Alastair, he thinks it is a good idea to compare our tour of duty with that of soldiers in Iraq,” recalled Dawson. “He suggests we lack desire and tries to use the example of a theatre of war to put our situation into perspective.” As O’Connell recalled it, Campbell “told us that in every campaign and every crisis, there comes a moment when the people in the thick of it realise they need to dig deep” but that “he didn’t get that feeling looking at us. He didn’t have the sense that we were fighting back.”
“Everyone’s expression is one of disbelief. I am getting angry inside,” Dawson wrote. “At the end we are bristling.” According to O’Sullivan: “You could have heard a pin drop. The speech was lunacy.” The next morning, O’Connell was still stewing on it. “I decided what I was going to do when the session was over: find Alastair Campbell and knock him out. There wouldn’t be any need for questions or explanations. Everyone would know what it was for.”
Thomas tried to bring the team together in his own way. They called him Captain Clean Off. As in clean off his head. “A lot of the guys from other countries,” Williams reckoned, “probably hadn’t experienced leadership like it in their lives.”
During one particularly bleak training session the day before the second Test, Thomas called everyone into a huddle. “Just got two words to sum up our situation at present: ‘Don’t fucking panic,”” he said. He waited a beat, then realised, “‘Shit, that’s three isn’t it?’” “Unfortunately,” Thomas put it, “I also lost count of the score the following day.”
He scored the first try of the second Test, and, as Williams put it, “for a couple of minutes, we felt that they were beatable”. The All Blacks won 48-18. “It didn’t feel like a collective loss,” wrote O’Callaghan. “Nobody was thinking about the giant painting back at the Vale of Glamorgan and the unity it was supposed to bring.” Thomas “went postal” and launched himself into “a post-match bender which resulted in a two-day hangover”.
The midweek team, meanwhile, won every game. But their success only seemed to make everything worse. Thomas heard the midweek players “were resentful” that they had not been rewarded with a shot in the Test series. O’Callaghan pointedly observed that there was “a feeling of unity and togetherness in our group” which “was reflected in the results”.
McGeechan felt that the Lions had “become something we were not”. Moody agreed. “Clive treated it like a business, a well-oiled machine,” he wrote, “but old school methods, at least to a degree, are essential on a Lions tour.”
Not everyone bought that. O’Sullivan, who had one eye on the top job for the 2009 tour, was sick of hearing about it. “The Midweek Massive was a myth,” reckoned O’Sullivan. “Bullshit. They were beating teams that amounted to little more than a Kathy Berry XV and trying to hold it up as some kind of higher calling than being part of the Test side. To me, this became more toxic as the tour went on. I said it to people. The Wednesday side would beat the likes of Manawatu by 103 points and celebrate it as some kind of Herculean deed.”
It was certainly nearer to it than anything the Test team managed. They lost the last game 38-19. “In the end,” Moody reckoned, “I felt as if we were a pub team getting hammered.”
Woodward gave a bizarre final press conference, in which he said “it’s actually been a successful tour, and has been great experience”. After that, the team “left New Zealand in drips and drabs, rather than as a team,” wrote Thomas. “There were no heartfelt goodbyes, or reaffirmations of faith.” But there was, Williams wrote, “a real sense of relief that the tour was over”.
Each man had his own opinion about what had gone wrong. “I don’t think we ever stood a chance,” thought Dawson. Williams wrote: “We had no answer for what they threw at us, and that was not only a shedload of skill and physicality, but a pride I had never previously encountered. There was no way they were going to allow a British & Irish Lions team to come to their territory and win.”
O’Connell was closest to the mark when he said “we came across an excellent side and we never became the team we needed to be”. The one thing everyone agreed on was that, as Thomas put it, “all the wristbands and postcards in the world couldn’t prepare us for the intensity of it”.
Predators coach Peter Laviolette heard all the questions and criticism of Pekka Rinne after the goaltender’s struggles in the Stanley Cup Final in Pittsburgh. Well, Laviolette never thought of switching goalies.
A change of scenery helped Rinne and all his Nashville teammates as they dominated once again on their own ice for the biggest piece of franchise history yet.
A victory in the Stanley Cup final.
Roman Josi and Frederick Gaudreau scored 42 seconds apart in the second period, and the Predators beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 5-1 Saturday night to pull within 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Rinne started and made 27 saves against a Pittsburgh team that continued to struggle on the power play and lacked the same zip they had in winning the first two games at home.
“There was no decision,” Laviolette said of changing goalies. “He was terrific. I said that after Game 2. He’s been the backbone for our team. He’s been excellent. His game tonight was rock solid.”
PK Subban and Sidney Crosby also exchanged words in third period. Afterwards the Predators star revealed the reasons why. “He told me my breath smelled, but I mean, I don’t know, I used Listerine before the game,” Subban told NBC’s Pierre McGuire after the game. “So I don’t know what he’s talking about.”
The Predators capped the biggest party in Nashville history with a victory that gave thousands of fans inside and outside of the arena reason to celebrate. Country star Keith Urban and wife, actress Nicole Kidman, were high-fiving inside the arena and they had plenty of company. Credit Rinne for coming through with a stingy performance and helping the Predators improve to 8-1 at home this postseason.
The 6-foot-5 Finn looked so shaky in the first two games, giving up eight goals on just 36 shots. Laviolette benched him in the third period of Game 2 when Rinne gave up three goals in the first 3:28 of a 4-1 loss.
Rinne said he changed nothing and knew he was playing all the time. Nashville fans did their best to lift his spirits by chanting his name in pre-game warm-ups.
“Collectively we came into the locker room, and we were telling each other we’ve never seen anything like that,” Rinne said.
Josi also had two assists. James Neal, Craig Smith and Mattias Ekholm also scored for Nashville as the Predators worked out some frustration against the Pens.
“Like our team has done the whole playoffs against Chicago, St. Louis, Anaheim, we showed really good composure,” said Subban, who had predicted a win in Game 3. “We’re going to take that into the next game.”
Game 4 is Monday night.
Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said he thought his Penguins gave up a couple of easy goals.
“We’re disappointed we didn’t get the result, but we also understand that this is a series,” Sullivan said. “Our guys, they’ve been through this. They can draw on their experience. We’re not going to let this certainly get us down. We’re going to learn from it, move by it and get ready for the next game.”
Crosby did not have a shot on goal, and neither did Evgeni Malkin.
“Hopefully a game like this is something that’s a hard lesson,” Crosby said. “But we’ve got to make sure we’re better.”
Jake Guentzel scored his 13th goal this postseason and fourth of this series for Pittsburgh and now is one off Dino Ciccarelli’s rookie record of 14 in 1981 for Minnesota. Guentzel, already with two game-winning goals in the series, put the Penguins up 1-0 on their second shot with a wrister off a rebound of Ian Cole that beat Rinne just 2:46 into the game.
Rinne stopped the next 26 shots for the victory and the party continued into the night.
Early on, Matt Murray extended his scoreless streak to 72:54 with the Pittsburgh goalie looking ready to notch his 21st playoff win. Then he gave up five goals in the span of 15 shots and the catfish watch was on.
The Predators got it started with a three-goal flurry in the second.
Josi scored his sixth goal off a slap shot at 5:51, tying it at 1-1 and finally giving nervous fans something to enjoy. Then Gaudreau, who scored his first career NHL goal in Game 1, scored 42 seconds later to put Nashville ahead with his wrister from the high slot, taking advantage of a screen by Penguins defenseman Ian Cole to beat Murray glove-side.
Just after that go-ahead goal, the Penguins had a rush on Rinne, and the three-time Vezina Trophy finalist made back-to-back big saves. First, he stopped Phil Kessel’s wrister from the right circle. The rebound bounced back into the slot, and Rinne made a save on Chris Kunitz with an assist from Subban sliding over to help.
Neal made it 3-1 with 22.6 seconds left in the second, banking the puck off Murray’s left arm for his first goal in the series and sixth of the playoffs. Smith’s goal on a breakaway at 4:54 was his first of the playoffs, and Ekholm padded the lead with a power-play goal with 6:50 left.
“We played some good hockey in those first two games, just a couple little breakdowns and they jumped all over us and it was in the back of the net,” Neal said. “It was a good job of limiting that tonight.”
As for Rinne, Neal added: “We felt we left him out to dry a few times in the last game. I thought we did a better job tonight.”
Smith is the 18th different Nashville player to score a goal this postseason, and Ekholm became the 19th. ... The Penguins went 0 of 3 on the power play and now are 1 of 13 in this series. ... With an assist, Crosby now has 160 career playoff points (56 goals, 104 assists) and tied Mike Bossy, Gordie Howe, Bobby Smith and Al MacInnis for 20th all-time. ... Laviolette sat veterans Cody McLeod and Vern Fiddler to get more speed with Harry Zolnierczyk and P.A. Parenteau. ... Pittsburgh forward Carl Hagelin played for the first time with center Nick Bonino out after taking a Subban slap shot off his left foot in Game 2 that left him on crutches and in a walking boot.
Christian Pulisic scored early in the second half, defender John Brooks limped off with a leg injury and the United States struggled at the start of a 1-1 exhibition tie against Venezuela on Saturday night, a warmup for a pair of World Cup qualifiers next week.
Jose Manuel Velazquez put Venezuela ahead in the 29th minute, but the 18-year-old Pulisic tied it in the 61st with his fifth goal in 15 international appearances.
Brooks, who missed a pair of March qualifiers because of injuries, hobbled off in the 51st minute, rubbing the side of his right leg, and was replaced six minutes later by Matt Hedges.
The US plays Trinidad and Tobago on Thursday at Commerce City, Colorado, then is at Mexico three days later. The US is fourth in the final round of qualifying in North and Central America and the Caribbean with four points, ahead of Honduras on goal difference. Mexico leads with 10, followed by Costa Rica with seven and Panama with five. Trinidad is last with three.
The top three nations qualify for next year’s World Cup in Russia, and the No. 4 nation advances to a playoff against Asia’s fifth-place team.
Rio Tinto Stadium is about 4,500 feet above sea level, preparation for matches in Colorado, at about 5,200 feet altitude, and Azteca at 7,820 feet.
The US started close to a first-choice lineup, missing only forward Jozy Altidore, who reported late to training camp because of a family commitment. But the center back pairing of Brooks and Geoff Cameron, starting together for the first time since October, was not sharp.
Velazquez scored his third international goal after Junior Moreno’s corner kick was headed by Pulisic. The ball stayed in the penalty area. Clint Dempsey headed the ball again in a clearance attempt, but it went wide to Moreno.
Moreno headed the ball back into the penalty area to Velazquez, who moved between Brooks and Fabian Johnson, stuck out his right foot at the top of the 6-yard box and stabbed the ball past goalkeeper Tim Howard.
Venezuela nearly doubled the lead five minutes later. Moreno sent a corner kick across the penalty area and Rubert Quijada had an open diving header at the 6. Howard dived to push the ball off a post, and the ball bounced across the goalmouth, where it was cleared by Michael Bradley.
Pulisic tied the score after taking a pass from Johnson at the top of the penalty area. He took two touches with his right foot to create space from Christian Santos and beat goalkeeper Jose Contreras with a 16-yard left-footed shot.
DeAndre Yedlin was at right back and Jorge Villafana at left back. Bradley was in defensive midfield and Pulisic in central midfield, flanked by Johnson on the right and Darlington Nagbe on the left. Dempsey and Bobby Wood headed the attack.
The US had rainbow numbers on its red jerseys as part of an initiative with You Can Play Project, which promotes equality without regard for sexual orientation and/or gender identity. The jerseys will be auctioned online for charity.
Venezuela is last in South American qualifying with six points in 14 games and has been eliminated. About two hours after the end of the friendly, the US and Venezuela met in the quarterfinals of the Under-20 World Cup at Jeonju, South Korea.
More than 1,500 people are thought to have been injured – three of them seriously – after Juventus fans watching the Champions League final stampeded in a Turin square after mistaking firecrackers for an explosion or gunshots.
Thousands of people had gathered in Piazza San Carlo on Saturday night to watch Juventus play Real Madrid on giant TV screens. During the second half of the match loud bangs led to a sudden rush in the middle of the crowd, causing a surge that flung people against barriers.
Many were trampled as people began to run out of the centre of the square, screaming in fear. The stampede may been started by the explosion of a loud firecracker that was mistaken for a bomb, some witnesses suggested.
“I heard an explosion, which must have been a huge firecracker,” a witness told La Stampa, one of Italy’s daily newspapers. However, another suggested it may have been the result of a security barrier falling over.
“They shouted, there’s a bomb, evacuate the square,” a member of the audience told the paper. “So we ran away. There were people on the ground, and blood and glass everywhere.”
One of the fans, who was caught next to the barriers, said: “I felt I was being lifted up. It was terrible.”
Although initially police said 200 people needed hospital treatment, the Italian news agency Ansa later put the figure at 1,527, using hospital tallies.
Most of the injured were treated for cuts and light contusions, but three people, including a seven-year-old boy, were reportedly in a serious condition.
“The root cause of this was panic,” said the local official Renato Saccone. “We’ll have to wait a while to understand what triggered it.”
In a statement, local authorities said the crowd “was seized by panic and by the psychosis of a terror attack” fearing that the loud noise was caused by attackers.
Shoes and bags littered the ground in the aftermath of the stampede, and people were seen limping and searching desperately for friends and relatives. Police have set up an information point to help people find their loved ones, and are now investigating what caused the panic.
“I saw the entire piazza went in the direction next to the screen to escape, all in a panic,” Brian Hendrie, an Associated Press reporter, said. “They ran, fell on the ground on the glass.” He said some reported having heard a small explosion, others a shot. “I heard five or six different versions. It sparked a panic.”
Within minutes, dazed fans in Juve’s black-and-white jerseys returned and milled about the piazza amid the broken bottles and rubbish littering the cobblestones, with the match largely forgotten.
Verletzte in Turin! - Panik beim Public Viewing https://t.co/IS7rZC7qGy
Some injuries occurred after a railing around the entrance to the underground parking beneath the square gave way under the weight of the crush.
Local media cited older Juventus fans saying the panic had evoked painful memories of the 1985 Heysel disaster in which 39 mostly Italian fans died when fans were crushed by a collapsing wall before the start of that year’s European Cup final, against Liverpool.
The mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, who had returned from watching the Champions League legends match in Cardiff, held a meeting with police on Sunday morning.
She was then due to visit the local hospital where the seven-year-old boy was being treated. His condition, which includes injuries to his head and torso, was described as serious but stable.
Following the stampede, Appendino tweeted: “I’m shocked at what happened in Piazza San Carlo in Turin. We’re monitoring the situation minute by minute.”
Zinedine Zidane hailed an historic day for Real Madrid as the Spanish champions became the first club to retain the Champions League with an emphatic 4-1 victory over Juventus, on a night when Cristiano Ronaldo wrote his name into the record books with another two goals.
Ronaldo became the first player to score in three Champions League finals and took his tally of career goals to 600 with a man-of-the-match performance against a Juventus side that started brightly but badly lost their way in the second half. Mario Mandzukic equalised for the Italian side with a spectacular overhead kick after Ronaldo had put Madrid ahead but the complexion of the game changed after the interval.
Madrid scored twice in three minutes through Casemiro and Ronaldo, with Marco Asensio adding a fourth in the 90th minute after Juventus had been reduced to 10 men following Juan Cuadrado’s harsh dismissal. Zidane described Madrid’s second-half performance as “spectacular” and was thrilled that the club won the Spanish title and the European Cup in the same season for the first time since 1958. Incredibly, it is Madrid’s 12th European Cup in total.
“You can say today is an historic day for all Madrid fans, for the players and for myself,” Zidane said. “I feel extremely happy because the truth is it’s been a special year, you couldn’t dream of anything better. We won the league on the last day and we know it’s very difficult to win a Champions League final for the second year running – we’ve managed to do it.”
Ronaldo, who was given his man-of-the-match award by Sir Alex Ferguson, pointed to his list of staggering career statistics when reminded that some people have criticised him in the recent past and also suggested that, at the age of 32, he feels as good as he has ever done.
“What is important is that I did again, an amazing season, me and my team-mates won the double,” said Ronaldo, who has now scored 108 goals in the Champions League. “I think the people don’t have words to criticise because the numbers don’t lie. I’m very happy, it’s one of the best moments in my career – I seem to say that every year. My head is just a number. I feel like a young boy.”
Zidane, who has presided over those back-to-back Champions League successes, admitted that Madrid struggled in the first half, when Juventus played with no shortage of belief. “We started with difficulties but I think in the second half we were clearly superior,” the Madrid coach said.
“We kept the ball, pressured higher up and physically I think we won the game there as well because of the determination we showed.”
It turned into a chastening night for Juventus, who have now lost seven of their nine European Cup finals and five in succession. Massimiliano Allegri, the Juventus manager, admitted his players were unable to respond mentally when Madrid regained the lead and also recognised the difference that Ronaldo made on the big occasion once again.
“In the first half we played beautifully,” Allegri said. “In the second half Real Madrid pushed the accelerator and we remained too static and sat back too long. We knew we were playing against a very strong team. It’s obvious that if somebody wins the Ballon d’Or and scores so many goals it’s a big advantage for Real Madrid. The only criticism I can make of my players is that after conceding the second goal we should have stayed in the game mentally to try to find solutions and equalise but we couldn’t do that.”
Asked whether this was the end of an era for some of the Juventus players, Allegri replied: “No, I don’t think that Juventus has reached the end of a cycle. [Gianluigi] Buffon will still be the Juventus goalkeeper next year, Andrea Barzagli will still be with us. These players still have a lot to give.”
Australian grand slam tennis great Margaret Court says that the “US gay lobby” is conspiring to strip her name from an Australian Open stadium. Court, 74, and now a Christian pastor, has been criticised for her condemnation of same-sex marriage and for saying that “tennis is full of lesbians”.
Another grand slam champion, Martina Navratilova, says that Court has revealed herself to be a homophobe and that the stadium should be renamed in Evonne Goolagong’s honour.
Navratilova, a lesbian herself, has a point – there’s no disputing that Court has been making bizarre remarks, even making reference to Nazis. Nor does Court seem to realise that if “gay lobby” means people who refuse to tolerate homophobia, then that’s going to include heterosexuals, too.
The comment about tennis being “full of lesbians” says it all – do you ever hear anyone complaining that a sport is full of heterosexuals? How are young sporty girls, whatever their sexuality, supposed to deal with this? It’s said that the Wimbledon tournament may have faced calls to ban Court had she been attending this year (she isn’t). In the light of these events, perhaps something needs to be done anyway.
Just when you thought it might be all about the man it’s never about, it was about the man it’s always about. In the buildup to this final, Casemiro had insisted that he’s there to “plug holes”, claiming that it is robbing the ball, not scoring goals, that brings him pleasure, and yet he had just reached a higher plane, thumping in the shot that put Real Madrid back into the lead and looked set to bring the night in Cardiff to a close. Three minutes later, though, another man stepped centre-stage. Him, again. Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro.
Never write him off, never say it’s over. Don’t even laugh when he says he wants to play beyond 40; listen instead. He decides when it ends. This season, more than any other season, well past 30, he has decided how it ends too. In Cardiff, it ended in a way it has not for 59 years: with Real Madrid champions of Spain and Europe. Although Marco Asensio added a late fourth, Ronaldo’s second was the moment Madrid knew they were the first team to defend the Champions League.
As Luka Modric went up the right just after the hour, Ronaldo dashed towards the near post and, when the ball came to him, he steered it first time past Gianluigi Buffon. Ronaldo kept running, heading towards the same corner Casemiro had occupied just moments before, with the fans chanting: “This is how Real Madrid win.” Recently, it has been too, more than ever before. Ronaldo had opened the scoring; now he had the second, taking him to 12, one for each European Cup Madrid have won, and making him the first player to score in three finals. It also made him the competition’s top scorer for the sixth time.
That was appropriate, and yet for so long it had appeared impossible. Some even wondered if it would ever be possible again. How foolish we were. Unknown to most, something had already happened to seek continuity. In August, Zinedine Zidane spoke to Ronaldo. The moment was perfect, two elements contributing: Ronaldo had just become a European champion with Portugal and he was injured. For each of the last three seasons, he had struggled towards the finish line, which was something that his coach wanted to avoid. Zidane had devised a plan; now he presented it. Here at the Millennium Stadium, that plan came together.
Zidane convinced Ronaldo that there had to be more rest, more rotation, protecting him so that he could peak in the most important games. It would also allow the 32-year-old to prolong his career. Ronaldo had to take a step back occasionally and as the months passed the process was accelerated. Of Madrid’s final seven away games in the league, Ronaldo sat out four. It worked. At full time here, he was named man of the match, a European Cup winner for the third time with Madrid. He had been the image of the last two finals, sure, but not in truth decisive, as he was here.
“We’ve been intelligent,” Ronaldo would say. “I have been saving myself: it is these games when titles are decided.” When he played, he decided. He had just two goals in the competition, none since the autumn, when Madrid headed into the quarter-final against Bayern Munich. By the time he arrived here, he was on 10. He left with two more and another trophy. Two hat-tricks and eight goals were scored across four games against the Germans and then Atlético, two more against Juventus. He also scored the goal that clinched Madrid’s first league title in five years, with his sixth in the final four games.
Ronaldo has evolved, becoming more of a No9, a striker whose movement is more honed. With every passing year, the stats confirm the sensations: he is dribbling less, covering less distance. But he is astute and deadly: this season he has taken fewer shots for each goal than ever before. The opener here was an example: once, the striker might have slipped the ball wide for him to burst into the area; this time, he was the striker, slipping it wide and showing for the return. Carvajal’s cutback was hit, like so many of Ronaldo’s goals, first time.
He leapt and drew down his arms, as he does – a celebration seen often, copied by five-year-olds everywhere. One that was destined to be repeated when he got his second. Like the first, it was turned in first time. Another night, another final, another goal. More astonishing, more impressive, even than those previous nights. His best of all at the end of a career that was already barely believable. More records falling: the first player to reach 100 goals in the Champions League was the competition’s top scorer for a record sixth time.
This was different, though. Different and better. This is Ronaldo’s worst goalscoring season in seven years. The thing is, his worst is pretty much everyone else’s best – over the last six seasons he scored 51, 61, 51, 55, 60 and 53 goals, while this was only his 41st – and then there’s the fact that his year has quality over quantity. It is not simply how many goals Ronaldo scores that matters, although there are many of them, it is which goals. Bayern, Atlético, Juventus. Quarters, semis, final. It might have felt like his moment had gone but when the moment arrived so did he. Him again.
6 Gianluigi Buffon Unlucky with deflections for two of the goals and had similarly scant chance for the others. Champions League success remains elusive.
6 Andrea Barzagli The veteran looked comfortable before the break but became stretched later on and was replaced by Cuadrado as Juve chased the game.
7 Leonardo Bonucci Supreme 60-yard ball to Sandro began the move for Mandzukic’s goal, but his tiny deflection had already helped Ronaldo beat Buffon.
6 Giorgio Chiellini Uncompromising as ever but it was not enough and, as Juve lost control of the game, he and his defensive colleagues became flustered.
7 Dani Alves Ageless performance for the most part, with one superb tackle on Ronaldo, but could not match his semi-final influence going forward.
6 Miralem Pjanic Tested Navas with a crisp low drive early on and helped run the midfield during the opening period but his influence faded as Real improved. Booked.
7 Sami Khedira Cruel deflection took Casemiro’s blast beyond Buffon and changed the game’s dynamic. Consummate and authoritative until then.
7 Alex Sandro Pinpoint volleyed cross from the byline brought the equaliser. Dangerous down the left throughout and almost pulled a late goal back. Booked.
6 Paulo Dybala Twinkling feet caused problems in the space between midfield and defence at times but he rarely got into areas that could really hurt Real. Booked.
8 Mario Mandzukic His overhead volley was one of the great Champions League final goals and will be replayed for years; it will, though, be scant consolation.
6 Gonzalo Higuaín Astute set-up for Mandzukic, having threatened earlier on, but was subdued after a good start and his hex in major finals continues.
Substitutes
Juan Cuadrado 3 (for Barzagli, 66): Even if Ramos made the most of their contact it was some achievement to be booked twice having been brought on to make an impact.
Claudio Marchisio 5 (for Pjanic, 71): Juve had long since lost the midfield when he arrived and there was little change thereafter

6 Keylor Navas Three early saves included a fine one-handed stop from Pjanic. Could do little about Mandzukic’s goal and was rarely troubled after that.
7 Dani Carvajal Laid on the opener and, despite being up against the impressive Sandro, generally stood solid defensively. Suspect hamstring held up well. Booked
7 Sergio Ramos Involved, not very tastefully, in Cuadrado’s red card and was booked himself earlier on. But if you lose the edge, you lose the winner that he is. Booked
7 Raphaël Varane Had a more comfortable night than seemed likely at the start, with a lot of the play in front of him. One good first-half block from Higuaín.
8 Marcelo Much more involved after the break and enjoyed himself as space began to open up. Excellent run and centre to assist Asensio’s goal.
7 Luka Modric Came out for the second half looking a different player and, having warmed Buffon’s hands, crossed superbly for Ronaldo to make it 3-1.
7 Casemiro Looked off the pace in the early stages and was lucky to go unpunished, but that will be forgotten after his decisive bolt from the blue.
8 Toni Kroos Opened up the pitch with the driving run that ultimately brought Ronaldo’s first goal. Helped Real gain firm control of the midfield after half-time. Booked
7 Isco Began to knit moves together for Real after an anonymous opening spell. Kept possession intelligently and carried the ball forward well.
7 Karim Benzema The striker was given little change around the penalty area but was involved in the move for the opener and worked tirelessly before going off.
9 Cristiano Ronaldo His first real involvement saw the ball end up in the net; his second finished similarly and capped a remarkable tournament from the 32-year-old.
Substitutes
Gareth Bale 6 (for Benzema, 77): Denied a fairytale goal in Cardiff by Bonucci’s fine block shortly after coming on
Marco Asensio 8 (for Isco, 82): Thrilling young talent who wasted little time in making an impact with a clinical finish
Álvaro Morata 6 (for Kroos, 89): Too little time to make a real impact
A rugby tour to New Zealand is a bittersweet pleasure for every player. There is nowhere better to test yourself but no more painful place on earth to lose. This applies every bit as much to the provincial matches as the looming Test series. Woe betide any naive Lions anticipating a low-key midweek hit-out against uninterested Kiwi opposition before the serious stuff begins.
Even a cursory glance at the 2017 itinerary induces a shiver down the spine. Starting with Wednesday’s game against the Blues in Auckland, the Lions face perhaps the toughest midweek schedule ever compiled. The Highlanders in Dunedin, the Chiefs in Hamilton and the Hurricanes in Wellington on successive Tuesday nights directly after Saturday fixtures against the Crusaders, the Maori All Blacks and New Zealand? Brutal does not even begin to describe it.
When Warren Gatland’s midweek Wales side played the Chiefs last year the home team romped to a 40-7 victory. Gatland himself was a key member of the Waikato team that thumped the 1993 Lions by 38-10. Small wonder those set to feature against the Blues at Eden Park sense a difference in intensity compared with the early stages of the 2013 tour to Australia. “You just sense it from the whole organisation,” says Conor Murray, the outstanding Irish scrum-half preparing to form a new half-back partnership with his current room-mate Dan Biggar. “There is an air around the place that there’s something bigger coming than four years ago. That’s the way it needs to be because the All Blacks are better than Australia were. I think the coaches, players and staff are all aware it’s going to be a lot tougher … it’s going to be a hell of a few weeks.”
If there is an upside it will not be long in coming: the selectors will swiftly find out who can cut it. Murray, who started the 2013 tour behind Mike Phillips in the pecking order, suspects competition for Test places will be fiercer than normal as a result. “Last time round you had a feeling of the Test team after a couple of weeks whereas I don’t think that will be the case this time. I think we’re going to push each other right to the week of the announcement of the first Test team.
“Maybe Warren and the lads have a few ideas in their heads of combinations and people they may want to play but it’s just so tight it will probably come down to who goes better in the midweek games and the weekend games leading up to the Test. There’s an air of red-hot competition which is great.”
The impressive Munster No9 is still a slim-priced favourite to make the first-choice XV, having been Ireland’s guiding light in last autumn’s victory over the All Blacks in Chicago. Strong yet dextrous, confident yet approachable, the 28-year-old has all the hallmarks of a key Test Lion but is presuming nothing: “I think it’s OK to say you want to be the Test starter, that you want to play in the Tests, because they’re the games that are remembered. But it’s going to be really tough to get into that team. I think this squad is massively talented ... the Test team you could pick could be incredible.”
Jonathan Sexton will be prominent among those hoping the fit-again Murray comes steaming out of the blocks; an all-Irish half-back pairing in the opening Test would also help save Gatland and co precious training ground time. If Owen Farrell or Biggar end up at 10 instead, an instant connection will have to be established in the most demanding of circumstances. “It’s not necessarily about looking at videos,” Murray says. “It’s just about spending time chatting with these guys, getting to understand them and how they see the game of rugby.” Sporting telepathy tends not to be plucked out of thin air.
Knowing Sexton as he does, Murray also expects plenty of straight talking on the training pitch as the tour progresses. “I was talking to Dan about it. All three fly-halves are pretty fiery and really competitive. You’ve three guys there that want to win all the time and if standards aren’t upheld they will let it be known they’re not happy. It will be interesting to see what happens. I am sure there will be a few barking orders over the next six weeks.”
There is certainly no time for Murray and his Munster team-mates Peter O’Mahony and CJ Stander to dwell on their disappointing Pro12 final defeat to Scarlets. If there were suspicions that a long, uniquely emotional season might just have caught up with them, all those unavailable for the pre-tour training camps in Wales and Ireland have been urged to set the recent past aside. “We’ve spoken about the harsh nature of this tour,” Murray says.
“For the 11 of us guys who were involved in finals it’s just been about catching up. You’re straight into looking at another goal with a group of players who hadn’t lost a final so you can’t afford to feel sorry for yourself.” For midweek dirt-trackers and Test contenders alike, there will be no respite from this Wednesday onwards.
If he had a cap for every week he has been banned, Dylan Hartley would still be a veteran, on 60. As it is, the England captain – barring injury, Lions call-up or, perish the thought, suspension – is about to win caps 85 and 86. Had he been a good boy, he would be on 100-plus by now. And he would be a Lion, certainly in 2013, possibly even now.
Regrets? “No,” he says, quietly but firmly. “It doesn’t define me. I’m OK with it.”
It’s hard to square any notion of a serial offender with the thoughtful and amusing interviewee Hartley has always been. But for his reputation, he could, maybe should, have been England captain for most of his career. He is relishing the chance to play that role to England’s young squad on their two-Test tour of Argentina and there won’t be a thought about the Lions.
“There’s no point dreaming or thinking about it. All my focus is towards that first game [next Saturday]. I don’t want to get sidetracked by maybes. I have had that many setbacks. You just learn to say OK and move on. I drew a line under [the Lions] straight away.”
His record as England captain is enviable and interwoven with that remarkable unbeaten run with which Eddie Jones opened his term as coach. Jones and Hartley seem to enjoy a certain chemistry, both of them hookers, both feisty, unconventional and intelligent. That relationship has earned Hartley an opportunity to play his way into form that is rarely extended to players at this level. The irony is that he was finally awarded the captaincy just as his status as England’s best hooker came under threat, just as injuries started to bite.
If the length of the season is a cause for concern, Hartley is relatively fresh and in form after a disrupted campaign. He even played 80 minutes the other week, most unusual for a front-row forward. “I can do it,” he says with a grin. “Just give me the chance.”
He is set to continue his captaincy for the foreseeable future, subject to the usual provisos. “There’ll only be changes if I don’t get better. It’s in my hands, and Eddie’s made that very clear to me.”
Next are these two Tests, in San Juan and Santa Fe, against Argentina, the side he made his first England start against – during the Lions tour of 2009. As ever, Argentina will challenge in Hartley’s department, the front row, but these days they are just as adept at the running game. Regular wins remain elusive for their Super Rugby side, the Jaguares, but they will benefit from a familiarity with each other that England, just like the Lions, are frantically trying to engineer.
England will build around a core of experience, led by Hartley with Chris Robshaw, Danny Care and Mike Brown, but beyond that some very young players are being introduced. Nevertheless, Jones has insisted that some of their recent training has eclipsed what they did in the Six Nations.
“It’s the youngsters,” says Hartley. “They’re driving it. Before they came into camp they knew the expectation and they are certainly delivering. I rang all of them. I got a lot of ‘yes sir’ and ‘thank you sir’ from the Curry boys. I worked out how old they were afterwards.”
The twins from Sale turn 19 between the two Tests. Ben was picked on the bench for the Barbarians game last Sunday but had to pull out, so Tom stepped up, came on early and was man of the match. No one knows which twin is which, but then no one knows a lot of these players.
It is certainly a new dynamic and Hartley appears to love being the grown-up in the middle of it all.
It ended, as it so often does, with that familiar smile. Cristiano Ronaldo – gelled hair, dazzling teeth, magic in his boots – will never forget the night he scored the 600th goal of an almost implausible career.
It was the moment everyone knew the Champions League trophy was on its way back to the Bernabéu and, once again, that the four-times Ballon d’Or winner had left his imprint on another final.
Ronaldo had scored twice on another exultant night when he also leapfrogged Lionel Messi to announce himself as the competition’s leading scorer for the fifth season running. He will enjoy that, too, but the real prize here was to be part of a side that have now lifted European football’s most coveted silverware three times in four seasons. Cardiff 2017 will fit neatly with Milan 2016 and Lisbon 2014 whereas, for Juventus, this was a familiar story of regret and hurt.
This was their seventh defeat out of nine finals, including five in a row, and the second half was a chastening experience for the Serie A champions, culminating in them sieving more goals in one match than in the rest of the competition put together. It was a full-on collapse and, by the end, the players in black and white stripes looked in need of smelling salts.
It was certainly rare to see a Juventus team lose their way so badly bearing in mind it was 1-1 at the break and, if anything, Massimiliano Allegri’s players had looked the more rounded side. Yet the second half was a dreadful ordeal for the team from Turin and all those supporters who had held up thousands of black and white cards before kick-off to spell: “The Time is Now.” Yes, Juve were unfortunate, in the extreme, with the deflected goal from Casemiro that gave Madrid a 2-1 lead just after the hour. From that point onwards, however, it was staggering to see a team renowned for defensive structure crumple this way.
Juve’s indignities in that period also featured a sending-off for Juan Cuadrado, one of their substitutes, and a late goal from Marco Asensio when the thousands of Madridistas were already going through their victory songs. Gareth Bale, deemed too short of fitness to start, had joined the party by that stage and no one from Zinedine Zidane’s team should really care that the game’s outstanding moment was conjured up by one of the losing players.
Mario Mandzukic’s goal was the paradox of the night. Indeed, has there ever been a better goal in a European final? Zidane himself is on the all-time list for his spearing volley against Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park in 2002. Yet it is a legitimate debate and Mandzukic’s 27th-minute effort here might even edge it given that it involved the ball going between four different players without touching the floor.
Leonardo Bonucci was first with a long, diagonal pass out to Alex Sandro on the left and, after that, it was a blur of exhilarating speed, colour and movement. Sandro’s cross to pick out Gonzalo Higuaín was a beauty: a cushioned, left-footed volley on the run. Higuaín controlled the ball on his chest and flicked it towards Mandzukic. And then, finally, it was the big man’s turn, teeing himself up and then twisting his body to launch himself at the ball. Volley, chest-volley, chest-volley: five touches in total, mid-air; left, right, left and right again. It was like something from a computer game and, at the end of it, Mandzukic’s improvisational shot was dipping and swerving into the top corner of Keylor Navas’s goal.
Ultimately, though, the more prosaic goals carried the greater significance in this contest. Madrid have managed only one clean sheet on their way to winning this competition. Yet there is another statistic about Zidane’s team and the player, more than anyone, who carries the team’s dreams. They arrived in Cardiff with the best goals record of any side in the competition – 32 from 12 ties – and Ronaldo, being Ronaldo, rarely lets a big game pass him by without making some kind of contribution.
To begin with, he had found it difficult to get too much of the ball in and around the Juve penalty area. But he also had periods in the other finals when he drifted to the edges. Then this one reached its 20th minute and he came alive, exchanging passes with the overlapping Dani Carvajal before pulling back his right boot to take aim. His shot was low, directed towards the bottom corner, and skimmed off Bonucci to elude Gianluigi Buffon.
If we were to be kind about the losing side, Madrid’s first two goals both came from deflections and, in Casemiro’s case, the trajectory of his shot completely changed once the ball had struck Sami Khedira. The truth, however, is that Juve, having conceded only three goals en route to this final, chose a bad night to lose their defensive organisation and never recovered from that moment.
Three minutes later, Luka Modric scampered down the right, clipped a cross to the near post and Ronaldo’s clipped finish gave the remainder of the match an air of inevitability. “The people who always criticise Cristiano are going to have put their guitar back in its case,” he said afterwards, modest as ever.
There was still time for Sergio Ramos, as devious as a bag of weasels, to help engineer Cuadrado’s second yellow card with a bout of pretend agony but Madrid’s second-half performance had a lot more good than bad. Marcelo set up Asensio to sweep in their fourth goal in the last minute and Zidane joined Brian Clough, Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola and José Mourinho among others on the list of managers who have won the European Cup twice.
Phil Mickelson’s wait to complete a clean sweep of major championships will go on for at least another year, after it emerged the 46-year-old has withdrawn from the upcoming US Open so that he can attend his daughter’s high school graduation. Given Mickelson’s reputation in the United States, this marks a serious blow to the event.
Mickelson, who has endured a series of near-misses at his home open, was scheduled to join the field at Erin Hills from Thursday week. However, speaking at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio – where he is playing this weekend – Mickelson said he will put family before professional goals.
Mickelson’s daughter Amanda will graduate on 15 June, the day of the US Open’s first round. “As I look back on life, this is a moment I’ll always cherish and be glad I was present,” Mickelson told the New York Times. “There’s no greater joy as a parent.”
Mickelson is believed to have already informed the United States Golf Association of his decision, out of respect for the number of final qualifying places they can make available on Monday. As one of the finest golfers in the history of the game, Mickelsonneeds only the US Open to become the sixth player in history to achieve a grand slam of majors.
Sceptics might sense an undertone either of Mickelson feeling he is unable to compete at what is a new host venue – Mickelson has not won at all since the Open Championship of 2013 – or holding a dim view of the USGA. Recent US Opens have been overshadowed by bad publicity, including the rules furore which provided a backdrop to Dustin Johnson’s success last year. When asked last month whether a successful US Open was necessary to improve the reputation of the USGA, Mickelson replied: “I don’t know if one thing right is going to fix that.”
Steven Finn will be drafted into England’s squad for the remainder of their Champions Trophy campaign on Sunday, replacing the injured Chris Woakes in what is a show of rigid consistency by the selectors and the captain, Eoin Morgan.
Finn’s international career has been mercurial over the last four years but, having opened the bowling on England’s one-day tour of the Caribbean this winter and played in their third one-dayer against South Africa last Monday, he retained his place as next in line following the side-strain suffered by Woakes during their opening win against Bangladesh on Thursday.
England were waiting for official sign-off for Finn’s inclusion from the ICC’s event technical committee on Saturday evening, having submitted the relevant forms after watching the 28-year-old pick up two for 49 as their Lions team beat South Africa A in Northampton.
The call-up means Finn, who has 102 wickets from 69 one-day caps and reached the heights of No2 in the world rankings back in 2012, has seen off the challenge of his Middlesex team-mate Toby Roland Jones and Surrey’s Tom Curran and could come straight into the side to face New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday – where victory would seal a semi-final place.
Adil Rashid, the leg-spinner who was dropped for the Bangladesh match, and the left-armer David Willey represent England’s other bowling options but whoever gets the nod in the final XI, Woakes will certainly be missed as a go-to man for Morgan at the end of an innings.
Having closed out England’s pre-tournament series win over South Africa last Saturday by nervelessly defending seven off the final over at Southampton, Mark Wood has joined Liam Plunkett – the man entrusted at the end of the first innings on Thursday – in sticking his hand up for further death over duties.
“I’m comfortable doing it and we have got a number of people that can also,” said Wood, who bowled with good pace against Bangladesh and was unfortunate to go wicketless. “Liam Plunkett did it at the Oval, Ben Stokes has done it in India and in Twenty20 cricket, and done it really well. We have options.”
On his own mentality at the death, Wood added: “At times you can almost rush through it, so sometimes it’s nice if the captain comes up to you and you have a little chat. I know my run-up is very short and stop-start, but if you can have that little break, take a breather, that helps.
“The manic behaviour of the one-day game at the minute – especially at the end – means the ball is flying here, there and everywhere, so you’ve just got to be so clear with your plans. I wouldn’t be too disappointed if I disappeared around the field if I stuck to my plan and executed it.”
New Zealand, whose opener with Australia was ruined by rain meaning both sides picked up one point, represent the first of two chances England have to qualify for the semi-finals. Their attack leader, Trent Boult, played with Woakes at Kolkata during the recent Indian Premier League and knows first hand the quality of bowler that has been lost.
“I think he’s a massive payer for them,” said Boult. “He’s played extremely well for them over the past few seasons but I’m sure they have the depth to replace him. We’re preparing to face a quality England side.
“Home conditions do fall into their favour but they are all quality sides in this tournament. Anything can happen and the rankings don’t mean anything – it’s who’s on it on the day.”
New Zealand were certainly on it against Australia, having emerged from the washout in Birmingham the more upbeat of the two sides and with their captain, Kane Williamson, up and running following a typically classy 100 that epitomised his level-headed, almost Zen-like approach to the sport.
Asked if he has ever seen Williamson gets worked up, Boult replied: “Not on the cricket field, no. He gets more flustered on what to wear on a dinner date with his missus. I think he gets it right but I’m no fashionista. He’s arguably the calmest man alive.”
Chelsea Ladies have been crowned champions of the inaugural Spring Series after a 2-0 win at Birmingham. Four teams headed into a nail-biting final round of matches with a chance of clinching the title but Chelsea got their hands on the trophy, ahead of Manchester City on goal difference, following goals from Karen Carney, against her old club, and Fran Kirby.
“I thought that overall it was a very professional performance by us and it showed that we’re winners, a team that just wants to go out there and win,” Kirby said. “Manchester City have been winning titles so this was an important one for us, this is our trophy and we’re going to take the impetus into next season.
“On a personal note I’ve had a long journey on the road back from injury, I’ve had to push myself to the limits to get myself fit again. But I’ve kept myself positive and I’ve had tremendous support from the girls, who have been absolutely brilliant with their support.”
It will have been sweet revenge for Chelsea following April’s SSE Women’s FA Cup semi-final defeat to their hosts.
Manchester City were runners-up and they concluded their campaign with a 3-1 win against Liverpool. Goals from Jill Scott, Melissa Lawley and Megan Campbell put City in control before Caroline Weir pulled one back late on.
Arsenal finished as the only unbeaten side after a 5-0 victory at Bristol City. Louise Quinn, Jordan Nobbs, Chloe Kelly, Danielle van de Donk and Beth Mead were on the score sheet but it was not enough to win the title as they finished third.
Mel Fletcher and Beverly Leon were on target as Sunderland and Reading shared the points in a 1-1 draw.
The value of Adam Lyth’s century, surely the hardest-fought of his 22 in first-class cricket, was seen in its celebration; having spent 41 balls across 16 overs and 71 minutes hanging in the nineties, he involuntarily leaped into the air while completing a single. The next ball he faced, drained by his 234-ball stay, produced his first truly loose shot, and he was caught behind driving.
But Lyth, whose next highest score this season is 30, had chiselled Yorkshire towards Roses dominance: a first innings lead of 150, which their potent seam attack then capitalised on, dismissing Lancashire’s top four cheaply. In their way stand Shiv Chanderpaul and Dane Vilas, who shared a sprightly 60 late in the day. Still, Lancashire are nine behind and face a battle to save the game, although they will be heartened by Monday’s rotten forecast.
A measure of Lyth’s innings’s quality is that the only other batsman to pass 40 is Chanderpaul. Lyth played totally against type for a man normally stylish and gallivanting. With Lancashire’s bowling – all 82 overs were delivered by seamers – never easy to get away due to a defensive line and the favourable conditions, care was required and Lyth obliged. Lancashire badly missed Jimmy Anderson, but he emerged at stumps to do some sprints, and England are increasingly optimistic he will be fit for the summer’s first Test.
Yorkshire lost Gary Ballance, his 600th run of the season ticked off, to Ryan McLaren in a funereal morning but, with lunch approaching, Saqib Mahmood, the pick of the bowlers, found two wickets in two balls – Jack Leaning caught brilliantly at second slip and Tim Bresnan nicking to first. Lancashire’s bowling improved and with Lyth rightly watchful, Andy Hodd, Azeem Rafiq and Jack Brooks provided some lower order roister. Jordan Clark, who dismissed Lyth, ended with three wickets, like Mahmood.
And so Lancashire embarked on a 48-over final session deep in arrears, with the ball talking, against an attack tailor-made for the conditions. To Brooks they lost the punchy Alex Davies, then to Ben Coad went Haseeb Hameed; both made 10, both were lbw. Hameed’s was perhaps high, but he has 26 runs in six innings. Three of them are ducks, and his 10 here is the highest score in that torrid sequence. Runs are badly needed against Middlesex next week.
At this stage Lancashire would have rather liked the services of Liam Livingstone, who spent his day smashing South Africa A around Northampton, for an 83-ball 129. Instead, Luke Procter flashed at Brooks and was caught at first slip, then Steven Croft nudged half-forward and edged to second. Lancashire’s hopes lie with Chanderpaul.
Somerset may be winless and bottom but, as Dean Elgar and Lewis Gregory showed against the champions, Middlesex, they are not lying down. With a stand of 249, they each scored centuries, Gregory’s 137 his first in first-class cricket, to lead them from the wreckage of 80 for five to a position where a declaration was possible – on 443 for nine. Middlesex’s opening Nicks, Compton and Gubbins, made it through 22 overs to stumps.
An even more extraordinary stand gave Hampshire total control against Warwickshire. Having come together at 31 for three, Sean Ervine (203) and Jimmy Adams (166, his first ton since 2015) put on 367, breaking a host of records, including the largest ever fourth-wicket stand for Hampshire, and against Warwickshire. Sunny Singh, the 21-year-old left-arm spinner, dismissed both on his way to six for 144, a maiden five-wicket haul in just his third match, as Hampshire racked up 515.
Warwickshire closed looking doomed: they had lost their top six for just 49. Jonathan Trott, absent fielding a family issue but returning on Sunday, has a frightful job on his hands.
Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire face a mighty battle to save their unbeaten record. They head into the third day against Derbyshire two down in their second innings (having lost Jake Libby and Che Pujara), but still 67 behind after Billy Godleman’s 121, his third century in the season, guided the hosts to 363, a lead of 144. Life without James Pattinson and Stuart Broad was a little tougher, learned Nottinghamshire.
An enthralling day at Chester-le-Street, brimful of dropped catches, saw Durham fight back against Northamptonshire, yet they remain 94 behind for the loss of Keaton Jennings, stumped sweeping Rob Keogh, in their second innings. Earlier, Max Holden, on loan from Middlesex and not 20 until December, scored his maiden first-class century and Josh Cobb made 96 as Northants posted 338. With the end of their stand of 162 for the sixth wicket came a burst of wickets for Paul Coughlin, who picked up his maiden five-wicket haul, and Northants lost five for 11.
And in a run-fest at Hove, Worcestershire closed 139 without loss (with the in-form Daryl Mitchell on 86), a fine response to Sussex’s monstrous 579 for eight declared. Luke Wells, who has 413 runs in two innings at Hove this year, laid the foundations with 155, but the contributions continued all the way down. Luke Wright, freed from captaincy’s shackles, made 87 (20 of them coming in four balls before his dismissal), while David Wiese contributed 66, and his dismissal brought the declaration.
It is undoubtedly an exaggeration to suggest Wigan’s season is in crisis just yet, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the reigning Super League champions are running out of excuses and, more importantly, fixtures.
The Warriors have now gone six games without a win after this latest defeat, and while there are still the Super 8s to follow later this summer, the fact Shaun Wane’s side are closer to the bottom four makes their remaining six fixtures before the split essential to remain in touch with the leading pack.
Wigan certainly have injury problems aplenty, and the fact they lost their captain, Sean O’Loughlin, pre-match certainly did not help – but their recent performances have been so concerning that such mitigation is unconvincing.
Hull too came into this fixture with problems, without key personnel and on a run of three consecutive defeats; yet they were still far too good for the Warriors here, moving back into the top four after completing their first double against Wigan in Super League.
To their credit, the Warriors improved immensely after half-time but by then they were 26-4 down and the damage had been done, a point not lost on Wane afterwards.
“We just left ourselves with too much to do in the second half,” he said. “We played poorly. It was six tries apiece but they were the better team. It’s a big game against Leigh next week.”
There were four Hull tries in the first half, including two to the winger Steve Michaels, who on both occasions brutally exposed Wigan’s deficiencies in defence.
Wigan’s opening half was perhaps summed up by a moment of madness from the forward Willie Isa, who tripped Mark Minichiello to concede a penalty that Jake Connor kicked with ease to open up that 22-point lead at the interval.
Perhaps the one crumb of comfort for Wigan in that half was that they survived a 10-minute period without Liam Farrell relatively unscathed, after the England international was sent to the sin-bin for dissent. After half-time they were much improved, and by the hour they had reduced the gap to 12 courtesy of tries from Liam Marshall and Lewis Tierney.
With Wigan on top, it would need something special to quell any hope of a comeback, and the Hull full-back Jamie Shaul provided it with an instinctive chip, chase and regather to end Wigan’s revival before Albert Kelly secured victory with a long-range effort. Late tries from Marshall, Tom Davies and Joe Burgess were mere consolations for a side already well beaten.
Against all the odds last year, Wane produced the best from his players to not only get an injury-hit Wigan side to Old Trafford, but win the title full-stop. If he can do so again this season, it would rank as an even greater achievement given where his side currently find themselves.
The troubled passage endured through the Derby by Wings Of Eagles is mirrored in the previously troubled career of his journeyman jockey, Padraig Beggy, who must have feared his days in the saddle could be over when he was banned for a year in Australia at the end of 2014. Entertaining company, as well as a manifestly talented rider, Beggy talked his way into additional trouble after a positive test for cocaine, providing not one but two false explanations before accepting that he had deliberately taken the drug.
For a jockey who had been kicking around for a decade or so without making much of an impact, there is no guarantee of being able to come back from that kind of self-inflicted disaster. That Beggy has been able to do so is testament to his own determination but also to the willingness of the winning trainer, Aidan O’Brien, to give a man a second chance.
After dismounting from his 40-1 winner, Beggy was relating how he packed his bags and quit Australia soon after an appeal hearing failed, returning to Ireland, where he had grown up in Dunboyne and acquired a love of horse racing during childhood visits to Fairyhouse. Two friends, working at O’Brien’s Ballydoyle stable, introduced him to the trainer and he was given a job riding out the next month.
“I got into a bit of trouble in Australia, a bad mistake and something that I’ve put behind me,” the 31-year-old said. “I was knocked down then, I had to pick myself up and I’ve come back out fighting and today I think I’ve proved that.
“Aidan had a chat with me and said, ‘Padraig, you keep working, some day we’ll repay you.’ I don’t think he meant the Derby. So I got into Ballydoyle and I worked hard. He was good to me. I owe him a lot.”
Beggy started in Ireland in 2003, rode for eight seasons with some level of success but never achieved more than 22 winners in a year in a country that has never been short of riding talent. He came to Britain in 2011, basing himself with John Quinn one year and David Evans the next, adding another eight wins before deciding to try his luck in Australia.
“I’ve never rode big winners,” he said, “and I thought riding big winners or Classic winners had gone by me, till Aidan started giving me the rides in them races. It means the world to me.”
Another Derby winner doubtless means plenty to O’Brien, though he seemed genuinely stunned at the quarter from which it came. But he rallied to tell Beggy he had given his horse “a peach of a ride” and added: “Padraig is a world-class rider, always has been and he’s been with us a good while now. We really appreciate his work, day in, day out, every morning.”
In his two and a half years at Ballydoyle, Beggy has now ridden a total of four winners, so there is no disguising that he is not at the top of the pecking order, for all that O’Brien is happy to use him. The trainer ran six in the race and Wings Of Eagles was his fifth string according to the betting odds. O’Brien’s shock suggests he saw it that way as well.
But the cheerful Beggy radiated knowledge of his enormous good fortune as he spoke of the belief he had in his unfancied mount during the buildup. “Cliffs Of Moher was what we thought was probably the best of all our horses, but we were talking on the plane on the way over, saying there’s barely 1lb between them. And every one of them horses is trained by Aidan O’Brien for the Derby. So it doesn’t matter if one is 4-1 or one is 33-1, he’s trained them to come here to run the race of their lives.
“You could run the race tomorrow and maybe one of our others would win it.
“I’d never get a leg-up on the likes of that big, strong, three-year-old colt, without having been at Ballydoyle. I’ve won the Derby, so. I can’t say much more.”
On a sunlit, boisterous afternoon at the home of the unceasing beer tap supply system, South Africa eased to a 96-run victory over Sri Lanka in their Champions Trophy Group B opener. South Africa always looked ahead of the game. Batting first they posted a solid-looking 299, driven on by an effortlessly fine hundred from Hashim Amla, his 25th in one-day internationals, another high-class batsman showing the value of reading a pitch and accumulating with care.
“It was an amazing innings,” AB de Villiers, his captain, said. “He did really well to assess the conditions, there was quite a lot in that wicket early on.”
In reply Sri Lanka were hauled in mid-chase by a fine, aggressive spell of leg-spin from the ever-exuberant Imran Tahir, a bowler who greets every wicket, even a dragged-down mishit to deep cover, with a wildly joyful sprint, like a man fleeing a burning building while simultaneously hearing news of a million-pound jackpot win.
Tahir took four for 27 and bowled with accuracy and aggressive variation. If South Africa’s batting did not really fire, the bowling looks to have plenty of edge and they also fielded with vim. De Villiers spoke at length about the need for calmness and intensity. Tahir only qualifies for one of these, but De Villiers rated his performance “close to a 10 out of 10”.
To make things worse for Sri Lanka a dawdling over rate was punished with an uncontested two-match ban for the stand-in captain, Upul Tharanga, whose team were four overs short of where they should have been towards the end of South Africa’s innings. All the players lose 60% of their match fees, too.
The regular captain, Angelo Mathews, had one too many debilitating twangs and strains. Tharanga won the toss and bowled, fearful perhaps of some nibble in the air on a sunny south London morning with dark clouds still skudding overhead after the end-of-the-world thunderstorms of the previous day.
His bowlers were tight early on. Lasith Malinga was back for the first time in a year and a half and he mixed tight lines with wides and full tosses, still able to dip the odd full ball on to the batsman’s toes. The feisty Quinton de Kock was becalmed, eventually nicking Nuwan Pradeep fiddling outside off stump.
Faf du Plessis was dropped in slapstick fashion by Malinga, dithering under a top-edged pull. After which he ran hard to reach his 50 off 52 balls, facing some ordinary change bowers. In this team the entire Sri Lanka top-six moonlight as wicketkeepers, depriving Tharanga of the usual strong hand of fill-ins and part-time dart merchants.
Amla eased along, lifting Asela Gunaratne over mid-off, cuffing and slapping anything short square on both sides. He is often a little obscured by De Villiers and the Virat-Kane-Joe rat pack but Amla’s record bears comparison with any of these. Only Virat Kohli has more ODI hundreds while averaging more than 50.
De Villiers appeared briefly before spooning a catch to midwicket via a wild, splay-footed pull off something flat and short from Seekkuge Prasanna. Chris Morris biffed usefully. JP Duminy spanked the last ball of the innings into the groundsman’s shed. But South Africa still looked a little short.
Sri Lanka have a fine lineage of spiky little wicketkeeper-batsmen and Niroshan Dickwella set off at a decent lick in their reply, walloping Wayne Parnell through cover and then punting Kagiso Rabada high over midwicket.
For a while Sri Lanka attacked the chase with some hunger before Dickwella was winkled out by Morne Morkel for 41. At which point three moments of brilliance in the field killed the game.
First De Villiers took a standing jump to catch Kusal Mendis at midwicket with one hand just as the ball seemed to have cleared him. This soon became an AB double, the captain hurling down the stumps to run out Dinesh Chandimal. Three balls later Chamara Kapugedera was lbw first ball to Tahir’s excellent googly, never the greatest fate for an international batsman.
At the halfway point Sri Lanka were 154 for four and still on target. At which point Tahir turned the screw. Tharanga, who will only play again in the tournament if his side reach the semi-finals, had completed a fluent half-century but he was caught, playing a pointless lofted drive to David Miller at deep cover, sparking further excitement from the bowler who could probably produce a competitive time at the world indoor 60m heats if the starter’s gun could be synchronised with a successful lbw appeal.
With him went Sri Lanka’s best hopes and the match ended in a rush.
It used to be said that a trainer who felt there were several potential Derby winners in the stable did not in truth have even one. But not any more. Aidan O’Brien once sent eight horses to the Classic and left Epsom empty-handed but his six-strong team on Saturday produced a 40-1 winner in Wings Of Eagles, a colt with just a handful of backers among the countless thousands crammed on to the Downs.
The victory of Wings Of Eagles was the biggest surprise in the Derby since Snow Knight’s success at 50-1 in 1974, and the first for a horse at a double-figure price since High-Rise at 20-1 in 1998. On the day, however, there was no fluke about it, and while Wings Of Eagles and Padraig Beggy hit the front only a few strides from the line, they won a shade cosily in the end.
There were echoes of Pour Moi’s charge through the field to victory in 2011 as his son Wings Of Eagles passed horse after horse in the Epsom straight, building momentum all the time and closing steadily on the leaders. Two furlongs out, though, most eyes were glued to his stable companion, Cliffs Of Moher, and O’Brien’s principal jockey Ryan Moore, as they glided past market rival Cracksman and into a useful lead.
The stage was set for Cliffs Of Moher to stride clear but he simply stayed on without quickening as the race reached its climax, as Wings Of Eagles and Beggy chased them down and claimed victory by three-quarters of a length.
Before the race, some might have questioned O’Brien’s apparent wish to run almost every three-year-old colt with a pulse in Saturday’s Classic. A few minutes later, the wisdom of covering every possible base was unarguable, as Wings Of Eagles fulfilled the promise in his pedigree, which has the family of the 1995 Derby winner Lammtarra on his dam’s side to complement Pour Moi.
This was O’Brien’s fourth Derby success in the last six years and his sixth in all, one more than Sir Michael Stoute’s (current) total of five between 1981 and 2010, and just one behind the all-time record of seven wins in the Classic. All three of the trainers to saddle seven winners – Robert Robson, John Porter and Fred Darling – were active in a much less competitive era, and sent out their final Derby winners in 1823, 1899 and 1941 respectively. O’Brien, though, is closing in and seems sure to catch and pass them all before too many more seasons are out.
The trainer made it clear that Wings Of Eagles had been seen as a possible winner beforehand, despite his starting price and a defeat at the hands of Venice Beach, who finished 12th, on his previous start at Chester. That said, he may still suspect that Cliffs Of Moher will prove to be a better horse in the long term.
“He was working very well and we were delighted with him at Chester,” O’Brien said. “Padraig was always going to take his time on him and produce him and he gave him a marvellous ride.”
He added of Cliffs Of Moher: “I was delighted with the second horse. All those really well-bred, good-looking horses, they can make dramatic improvement from race to race, and we knew that they had all improved [from their trial runs].
“I didn’t really know what was going to happen. I thought Ryan’s horse was open to the most improvement, which he was and he did, but Ryan said he got there and he just got tired in his hands. I was half-afraid that that could happen, but we’d just about made the race. If he hadn’t run at Chester, he wouldn’t have made it here. He came with his long, sustained run and in the last 100 yards it just told, the lack of preparation.”
Michael Tabor, a former bookmaker and one of the co-owners of Wings Of Eagles in John Magnier’s Coolmore Stud syndicate, said that he had felt before the race that any one of their six runners could make the step up to win. “We knew Wings Of Eagles was in the mix, but no more than that,” Tabor said. “He’s proved to be a very, very good horse for the future but I’m afraid I didn’t back him and I didn’t have a bet in the race.”
The betting suggested beforehand that this was one of the most open Derbys for years but the fact that a 40-1 chance crossed the line in front does not necessarily mean that it was a sub-par renewal. That will become apparent only in his remaining starts, but however his career plays out, Wings Of Eagles and Beggy are Derby winners, and nothing will ever change that.
Virat Kohli moved to quell the growing talk of a rift between his India players and the head coach, Anil Kumble, on the eve of their hugely anticipated Champions Trophy opener with Pakistan at Edgbaston, insisting there are “no problems whatsoever”.
Kumble, the former wrist-spinner and national team captain, has been told he must re-apply for the position after his current one-year term expires at the end of the tournament and, despite 19 wins and four defeats across all formats during his time, change may be afoot.
The team, according to reports in India, have told the administrators running their country’s embattled cricket board that Kumble’s style is “overbearing” and now former players Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, who comprise the three-man panel overseeing the appointment, must sort the truth from conjecture.
Kohli, the India captain, has previously said the process is no different to what has occurred in the past but before his side’s meeting with Pakistan – a rare encounter given bilateral ties are currently on hold – much of the focus remained on Kumble.
“There are no problems whatsoever,” said Kohli. “As I mentioned before, if something is put in place as a process, I don’t see why people are creating so many speculations about it. The team is totally focused on the Champions Trophy.”
Asked about his own relationship with the head coach, Kohli said: “It’s been really good. The whole journey has been good.”
The situation was not helped this week when Ramachandra Guha, who was part of the Committee of Administrators that runs Indian cricket, resigned and in the letter explaining his reasons – published by ESPNCricinfo – raised the issue of problems in the current set-up.
Guha criticised the way Kumble’s future had been “left hanging” by his contract not being renewed automatically and questioned whether it would give players the belief of their having a veto on the subject in “another example of superstar culture gone berserk”.
The state of affairs adds an extra layer of intrigue to the start of India’s title defence that begins against their neighbours – against whom they have won their past six encounters in global tournaments – and was something the Pakistan head coach, Mickey Arthur, looked to sidestep.
“That’s India’s problem,” said Arthur, whose captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, was sitting next to him. “All I know is that the captain/coach relationship is almost like a marriage. You’ve got to be on the same page all the time. And if you’re on the same page you get correct decisions and you give clarity to your team.
“I’ve had the privilege of working with so many good captains in my time and Saffy is right up there as one I’m really going to enjoy working with, in terms of our relationship going forward.”
Andy Murray enjoys few experiences more than proving people wrong and so the most stubborn man in tennis goes into the second week of the French Open for the eighth time in 10 visits with a ringing endorsement from the rival he beat to get there, Juan Martín del Potro.
There were plenty of people at the start of the week who feared the Scot’s form and fitness were at such a low ebb he had no chance of reaching the final for a second year in a row, and diminished prospects of getting past the quarter-finals. He is not quite there yet, but he is in the fourth round again, and deservedly so after beating the occasionally inspired Argentinian by the misleading score of 7-6 (10-8), 7-5, 6-0 in just under three hours on a mild and pleasant afternoon on Court Philippe Chatrier, not long before the rain arrived.
Del Potro, making his first appearance here in five years after the most wretched time with injury, said of their 10th encounter, and only the second to finish in straight sets: “It was another good battle. The first two sets [took] two hours and a half, really long sets.
“Andy, he’s very smart on court. He has all the shots, but also is great mentally. That’s why he’s No1 in the world and I know how important this tournament is for him. I wish him all the best and, hopefully, he can go far.”
A few players on the Tour would not bother with such compliments. But Del Potro is a man apart, encouraging genuine warmth in the crowd as he fought with tigerish intent to bring the best out of Murray. Del Potro should have won the first set but a blistering forehand in the tie-break was out by so tiny a margin that the chair umpire conferred with the line judge before awarding the point and set to Murray.
The second frame was just as intense but Murray gradually got the upper hand over Del Potro, who had to take painkillers for a groin strain he picked up in his match against Nicolás Almagro two days before. He did not use that as an excuse and said he played pain free, but it was clear he was not moving as well as he might have wished.
Partly that was down to what he identified as Murray’s court intelligence. There were so many artful exchanges between these two wonderful players that it was difficult to pick when the winning shot would arrive. Murray concentrated on keeping as many balls away from his opponent’s lethal forehand as he could, then, having peppered him on the other flank, used the open court to tease him with drop shots.
Del Potro was hardly surprised by the strategy and, when not slicing backhand returns to keep the point going, ran around those shots to unleash his forehand. He struck 16 clean winners with the shot, but only one in the final set, which came and went in 28 minutes. Fighting to the end, however, he made Murray save three break points before completing the bagel.
Murray was in understandably good spirits – although little has unsettled his mood for some time, win or lose. The self-absorption of his youth is long gone, even if there is the odd on-court explosion still. He said after a couple of such outbursts in his second match, against Martin Klizan on Thursday, that he sometimes struggles to contain those emotions.
Perhaps it is no bad thing, though. If he were to go totally against his true nature he might create confusion that would further undermine the state of his game head. He had it on here, with just a fleeting curse or admonishment for his box, where Ivan Lendl sat in his customary state of expressionless concentration.
By the standards of a year ago, when he launched the most extraordinary assault on Novak Djokovic’s No 1 world ranking around this time, he has under-performed. He arrived here having lost early in tournaments to excellent but lower-rated opponents in Dominic Thiem (Barcelona), Albert Ramos Viñolas (Monte Carlo), Borna Coric (Madrid) and the dangerous and unpredictable Fabio Fognini (Rome).
But Murray’s clay game is improving by the match. He agreed that this might have been his best 2017 showing. “I played some good matches beginning of the year,” he said, “but definitely, in the clay court season, those second and third sets were the best I have played, for sure.”
He might have paid scant attention to the pessimists, but his mood is lifted. He is ready to raise his level another notch, as all the really good players do when it matters. He expects to get better, because he has done it so many times before.
Last year here, he reached the final after coming close to losing in his first two matches, each of which went to five sets. This time, he took four sets to overcome Andrey Kuznetsov and Klizan before hitting an ominous beat against Del Potro.
“To be playing him this early on in the slam is not easy, but it can be a very positive thing,” Murray said. “You play someone that good, maybe you’re a little bit more switched on. Your focus is maybe a little bit higher.”
There was one moment of minor irritation when he was asked why he was “shushing himself”.
He arched his eyebrows and replied, “I don’t know why I was doing it. Why does it matter? What’s the big deal? I don’t get it. If I say something and you guys ask me what I was saying, if I say nothing, you ask me why I don’t say anything. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to say? It’s irrelevant. What’s relevant is what happens during the points.”
He’s not wrong.
The last time two British players made it to the fourth round of the French Open, the Beatles were No1 in the charts and Harold Macmillan was serving out his closing months in 10 Downing Street. Kyle Edmund, 22, might not have listened to From Me to You or know who Supermac was, but the 22-year-old with the booming forehand would dearly have loved to match that 1963 achievement alongside Andy Murray at this tournament.
For long stretches of his third-round match against Kevin Anderson, Edmund looked like being part of a little bit of tennis history, but he found the resilience of the tall, powerful South African too much after nearly four hours of grinding tennis on the compact Court 2.
Anderson, seven places behind Edmund in the world rankings at 56, outlasted him to win 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 and book a place in the last 16 against the former US Open champion Marin Cilic, who made short work of the Spaniard Feliciano López, to win 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.
Edmund was simultaneously disappointed and satisfied, pointing out that another five-setter was a useful part of his tennis education, especially as he held up well physically. Now, he says, he is looking forward to Wimbledon, with preparation at Queen’s and Eastbourne – challenging the suggestion that it was a surface on which he did not feel comfortable.
“I don’t quite remember me ever saying that I don’t like grass,” he said in his ultra-polite way. “I just enjoy playing on clay and hard a lot more. Well, I play on them a lot more. So I have more time on them.”
There was little in this match for nearly three hours, as they traded big shots from behind or near the baseline. Each of them loaded up with full-force groundstrokes, averaging only three shots a rally until near the end of the match. As Edmund said after his quick-fire win over Renzo Olivo in the second round: “There’s not much point having weapons if you don’t use them.”
Jim Courier said after that performance that Edmund has the potential to be a top-10 player. Apart from a dip during the fourth set on Saturday, he looked worthy of the assessment.
Anderson came to life down the stretch to put the pressure back on Britain’s No2, although breaks were hard to come by for each of them. Edmund held from love-40 for 3-3 in the fifth but could not sustain his level all the way to the end.
“No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, you know being black in America is tough.”
LeBron James sat in front of dozens of news cameras to discuss racist graffiti that was spray-painted on the front gate of his house. By the time the majority of news reporters arrived at the home, the offensive language had already been painted over.
Some casual observers of all the media coverage might have thought that all the hoopla over a word painted on the gate of a rich and powerful man’s $21m home was a bit overdramatic. How tough is it really, for a multimillionaire to endure a single racial slur for the short amount of time that it appeared before staffers painted over it?
But when James said “being black in America is tough”, he was speaking to a fundamental truth of blackness in America. It is tough, and we are never allowed to think otherwise.
When I discuss issues of racial oppression – particularly racial oppression of black people, I’m often countered with examples of rich and famous black Americans. “What about Beyoncé?” “What about Serena Williams?” “What about Obama?” The implication is – how can things be as bad as you claim when these black people are able to amass so much wealth and power?
But Beyoncé was inundated with racist hate for daring to perform at the CMA awards, Serena Williams is regularly mocked for her black features and compared to an animal, and Obama was for eight years branded a radical Muslim. There is no amount of fame or fortune that can fully protect black Americans from racist hate.
One of the most painful ways to kill someone is to continuously rob them of their peace of mind. That is the aim of these racist attacks like the graffiti painted on James’ front gate, or the noose found at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC.
These are not imminent threats of physical bodily harm. These are reminders that at any time, the horrors of this nation’s murderous racist past can be revisited upon you. These are reminders that you are never safe, and you should never get comfortable. These hateful actions aim to keep us afraid, unbalanced and distracted.
I myself receive with some disturbing regularity, similar reminders of how unsafe I am as a black woman. I receive emails with images of lynched black bodies, I receive tweets stating that a van is coming to collect me for “re-education”, I receive promises that I will pay for the work I do writing about race in America. People have created fake online accounts for the sole purpose of reminding black people in hundreds of messages a day that they are never really safe.
How powerful it must make someone feel to know that by sending an image, they can invoke 300 years of racial terror. How powerful it must feel to know that with a can of spray-paint they can make a rich and famous professional athlete feel unsafe?
These messages work because they are true. We, as black Americans, are not safe. We are 2.8 times more likely to be killed in encounters with police than white Americans, black mothers are three to four times more likely to be killed in childbirth than white mothers, black Americans are five times more likely to be incarcerated than white Americans, black Americans are seven times more likely to be wrongly convicted of murder than white Americans, black kids are four times more likely to be suspended from school than white kids, black Americans are almost three times more likely to live in poverty and more likely to live in areas of highly concentrated poverty.
We are not safe. We are not safe when driving down the street, in our schools, in our doctors’ offices. We are not safe and as black Americans there is not much we can do about it. This is why the messaging of these hate crimes are so effective. They are a reminder of the reality that we as black Americans live with every day.
These messages should be taken seriously as the hate crimes that they are. They are weapons of psychological torture aimed at making black Americans feel unsafe. And as violent racists have been further empowered in the wake of our last presidential election, it is more important than ever that we stop these terror campaigns that not only lead to psychological harm against black Americans and other people of color, but also help inspire physical attacks against people of color. But if we really want to reduce the impact of these hateful acts, we need to address the systemic issues of racial inequality that make these acts so impactful.
We must work to address the real life barriers to health and safety that are impacting black Americans every day. We must look not only at the hateful message, but at the reality that the message is representing.
When we address the ways in which black Americans are threatened every day by the realities of life in a racially oppressive society, these messages will still be hateful and criminal reminders of horrors of the past – but they will no longer be a promise of horrors to come.
The rustiness of the Lions was evident from the first whistle, when they failed to gather the kick-off and proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes camped in their own half. It must be remembered, however, that they were up against a scratch side, with even less time to prepare. More pertinent to the Lions’ torpor, then, is the fact that they only arrived in New Zealand on Wednesday and were clearly sluggish – in thought perhaps more than body – as a result. Assuming the Lions are acclimatised by Wednesday, there should be a far faster start against the Blues but there was still a concerning lack of intensity, particularly up front from a forward pack that is supposed to be the tourists’ biggest advantage. Stuart Hogg fumbling with his first touch was an inauspicious start and he then butchered an overlap with Anthony Watson outside him and looking to go over. It was not Johnny Sexton’s day at all. His kicking was poor, which is only asking for trouble in New Zealand, and the Irish standoff fired out a few rank passes.
Bryn Gatland has just a handful of Super Rugby appearances to his name but what would his old man have given for a fly‑half displaying such composure? Gatland Jr approached the contest determined to enjoy himself and intent on showcasing the full extent of his kicking repertoire. He was not the only Barbarian to impress: Sevu Reece caught the eye on the wing, as did Luteru Laulala at full-back, as well as the replacement back-row Matt Matich. Many of the Barbarians are part‑timers and their ranks included shop owners, sheep farmers and nurses. How comfortable they were on the ball, however, showed an inbuilt skill set that simply does not exist in the northern hemisphere.
While they are not in abundance, one of the main plus points for the Lions was the impact of their replacements. George Kruis made his presence felt at the lineout and Owen Farrell upped the tempo, even if he missed a routine penalty. Mako Vunipola, too, made a telling turnover – there is a Saracens theme developing here – and Justin Tipuric was ferocious in defence. The Lions had a bit of difficulty in getting all their replacements on when they wanted – if that was poor administration on their part they cannot afford it to happen later down the line – but once they were on the field, there was a bit more direction and verve to the tourists’ play.
There is no doubting that coach Gatland was accentuating the positives when, straight after the match, he was pointing to the Lions being held up over the line four times. True, but their failure to convert their chances should be far more worrying. Anthony Watson might have had a hat‑trick had heads stayed a little cooler and there was a concerning moment in the first half when Greig Laidlaw, admittedly not known for his sniping, missed a huge gap that one of the Barbarians’ props was practically ushering him through. Laidlaw was already committed to the pass and it is worrying because it was clear evidence of the Lions’ muddled thinking. If they cannot learn to play what is in front of them before the Tests they are in trouble.
Without wishing to take any pleasure in the misfortune of others, it has not been a perfect weekend for the All Blacks either and Steve Hansen will be anxious about the injuries sustained by Ryan Crotty and Ben Smith (left) in the Crusaders’ victory over the Highlanders. Crotty suffered a rib injury and, as the Crusaders coach, Scott Robertson, put it: “I think that Steve Hansen will be tucking into his notebook and thinking who’s next.” Smith, meanwhile, suffered concussion and would be a big miss for the All Blacks. Add in the fact that Kieran Read is doubtful for the first Test and Dane Coles’s concussion problems are continuing and Hansen will be relieved indeed that Super Rugby goes on hold after this weekend.

Two French outsiders who have frustrated their admirers with their serial inconsistency, Alizé Cornet and Caroline Garcia, will meet in the fourth round of their home slam after wins of contrasting style on a day when rain ripped through the schedule at Roland Garros.
The unseeded Cornet’s was the bigger, quicker win – 6-2, 6-1 in an hour and 19 minutes over the world No10 Agnieszka Radwanska.
Garcia, the No28 seed, had a significantly lesser opponent in the world No109 Hsieh Su-wei – who was good enough to put out Johanna Konta in the first round and the talented American Taylor Townsend in the second – but struggled over two hours and 39 minutes before winning 6-4, 4-6, 9-7. That might be scant consolation for Konta, the world No8, who had expected to be here at least until the end of the first week.
The ever-smiling Cornet said later: “I was feeling just very happy. It’s a lot of emotion to qualify for the second week of your home slam – big relief, also, because I beat Aga just once in maybe nine matches that we played.”
This was, in fact, her second success against the elegant Pole in eight attempts, but she got the numbers that mattered right. As she told French reporters later: “Whether I play against a top 10 or top 100 opponent, anything can happen, so I don’t focus on numbers.”
Radwanska’s collapse was a major shock but she had no answer to Cornet’s fierce determination. “I enjoyed my time on court a lot, but I was very stressed before the match,” the French player said. “Even during the match, because I felt like I could beat her. When you have this feeling, you have to be focused from the first to the last point. That’s what I did.”
She will be just as wired up for Monday’s match against Garcia. “The crowd is going to be excited to see Caro and me play, to see two French women playing for a place in the quarter-final. I think they will not [favour] one or the other, but we will try to give them a good show.”
Garcia said of her trial against the Taiwanese star: “So many games were very tight at the end. Even when I was down, I kept fighting, tried to be more aggressive. The last week for me was very difficult. It’s good sometimes when you have this period to learn about yourself, about your team, about the people around you.”
She will know plenty about Cornet, of course, and will start as the underdog given that she is No43 in the world – although this has been an unpredictable tournament from day one. Also, she won their only previous match: 7-5, 5-7, 6-3 on the clay of Marseille seven years ago.
“I don’t need to prove anything to anyone,” Garcia said. “I’ve played tennis a long time. I already have done well, but I want to do better, for sure.”
Garcia is a fiery individual and has bounced back with resolve from a suspension handed down by the French Tennis Federation last year, along with her doubles partner, Kristina Mladenovic, for what they considered was “unprofessionalism” at the Rio Olympics. Their ‘crime‘ was to contravene Olympic regulations by turning up for their match in outfits that did not match. They were favourites and lost.
Mladenovic, meanwhile, is already through to the next round, after her rousing comeback against the American Shelby Rogers on Friday, and plays the defending champion, Garbiñe Muguruza, on Sunday in what could be the match of the day.
Elsewhere in the weather-wrecked round on Saturday, Carla Suárez Navarro, the 21st seed, beat the Russian 14th seed Elena Vesnina 6-4, 6-4 without fuss, and the world No4, Simona Halep – who doubted before the tournament started if she would be fit enough to compete at all – beat 26th seed Daria Kasatkina, of Russia, 6-0, 7-5.
Warren Gatland insists there is no huge reason to panic despite the British & Irish Lions’ lacklustre start to their tour of New Zealand. The head coach cited jetlag as the main explanation for the Lions’ unimpressive 13-7 win over a NZ Provincial Barbarians XV composed largely of part-time players and believes it will be a different story when his squad have spent more time in their new surroundings.
The touring team have been in New Zealand since Wednesday and it emerged many are finding it difficult to acclimatise. “These guys are still recovering from the travel,” Gatland said. “A number of players in the squad still haven’t got into regular sleep patterns. Andy Farrell also went to the doctor last night to get a sleeping pill. He went to bed at 11 or 12 o’clock and was up at four o’clock this morning in the team room because he couldn’t get to sleep.
“We’ve just got to try and recover and adjust as quickly as possible. So hopefully in the next two days we’re going to get into a cycle where we’re feeling fresh.”
Gatland and the team’s manager, John Spencer, have made it no secret they would have loved more time to prepare the squad. “We would have preferred to have had a week in the UK with the full squad and a week in New Zealand before the first game,” said Gatland. “Perhaps the schedulers need to look at that for future tours.”
None of the Lions are looking to make unnecessary excuses but their preparation for the opening fixture has clearly been hopelessly inadequate. In addition to their late arrival in New Zealand, a quarter of the squad were involved in domestic finals last weekend and they have also been doing community visits that have necessitated long car journeys. Two players, Ross Moriarty and Kyle Sinckler, required treatment for back spasms that Gatland felt was largely down to being wedged into the back of a 4x4 vehicle so soon after flying in. The squad is due to attend an official Maori welcome at the Waitangi Treaty grounds tomorrow before relocating more than two hours south back to Auckland.
Gatland, however, was encouraged by the efforts of Ben Te’o, Taulupe Faletau and several of his replacements as the Lions fought back from 7-3 down at half-time. “We’ve learned a lot in terms of how tough it is to come to New Zealand and how motivated the teams are going to be against us. That game is going to put us in good stead.
“When I look back four years ago we played the Barbarians in Hong Kong and had a comfortable victory that didn’t test us. Tonight tested us. It was a good first game to have. You’d much rather that than a 50-point win. In 2009, the first game in South Africa was against a Royal XV in Rustenburg and we struggled a bit in that opening game as well.”
Gatland also said it had been special to come up against his son, Bryn, who impressed at fly-half for the Provincial Barbarians. “He played pretty well,” said Gatland Sr. “He caused us a few problems, particularly with his kicking game. That definitely put us under some pressure in that first half.”
The Lions were ultimately grateful to Owen Farrell, who came on to replace an out-of-sorts Jonathan Sexton, and the influential Te’o. “I’ve said all along that we didn’t pick Ben Te’o just to bash up over the gainline,” Gatland said. “His footwork and some of the subtleties in his game were impressive and he had a really strong performance carrying. It was a good start for him: he was accurate, played well and caused a lot of problems.”
Asked if Sexton’s difficult night leaves him trailing the Saracens man for the No10 Test jersey, Gatland said: “That’s pretty unfair in making an assessment like that. Owen Farrell has a big match temperament, there’s no doubt. I would have been happier if he’d knocked over that one he put against the post, that might have given us an easier last 10 minutes. But he’s played some pretty good rugby in the last 18 months and he’s one of the standout performers in northern hemisphere rugby.”
Gatland will stick to his plan of fielding an entirely different starting side at Eden Park. Asked how many changes he will make on Wednesday, Gatland said: “Fifteen. The plan is everyone gets a start in the first three games.”
The All Blacks, meanwhile, are sweating over fresh injury doubts to two key backs with the first Test against the Lions just three weeks away. Ryan Crotty (ribs) and Ben Smith (concussion) both had to leave the field in the second half of the Crusaders’ 25-22 Super Rugby win over the Highlands in Christchurch. Smith has now been concussed five times in the past five years and hooker Dane Coles is also still suffering from recurring concussion symptoms. Crotty is now certain sure to miss the Crusaders’ match against the Lions next Saturday with the All Blacks’ captain Kieran Read also sitting out the game.
Next season, assuming Liverpool can negotiate the play-off round, there will be five English clubs in the Champions League. That is a large number, though it does not necessarily follow that a greater representation will lead to a better chance of English success. Premier League sides have been struggling to impose themselves in Europe in recent years. From a position a decade ago when finals were being reached on a regular basis and Uefa had genuine concerns when two English clubs faced each other in Moscow in 2008, the strength of the Premier League now seems to be an obstacle to progress in Europe rather than the money and attention grabber that once threatened domination.
Chelsea were the last English team to appear in a final, when they won the event on penalties in Munich in 2012, though the reality of the past five years has been that English clubs have rarely been around to contest the later stages of the knockout rounds. Leicester City did surprisingly well to reach the quarter-finals this year, which was better than more experienced teams such as Arsenal and Manchester City managed.
City had reached the semi-final stage a year earlier, though in Manuel Pellegrini’s final season there was no real expectation that they could summon the self-belief or strength of character to see off Real Madrid and they duly went out without scoring a goal over two legs. The year before that, none of the four English teams managed to reach the last eight, and Liverpool did not even survive the group stage.
Various theories have been advanced as to why English clubs have fallen off the pace in Europe. Some say the Premier League is too difficult and unforgiving, leaving little spare energy for extra commitments in midweek. Others believe the English competition is vastly overrated and its crash-bang-wallop players are quickly found out when confronted by continental levels of technique and organisation.
Leaving that argument for another day, the fact is that English clubs have ground to make up on their European counterparts, particularly Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Short of signing up three-quarters of the Monaco team, a good idea but probably not a practical one, what can English clubs do to put themselves back into contention for Champions League finals? Is there any hope of significant improvement next season, or will we simply end up with five disappointing campaigns instead of four? Everyone is promising a busy summer, even Arsenal, who are only in the Europa League, but here is a quick look at what each of the Champions League contenders might need to boost their chances.
By far the most robust team in England last season, with a simple system that not only works but suits all the players at Antonio Conte’s disposal, there were nevertheless signs towards the end that the champions could be stopped. Though N’Golo Kanté and Nemanja Matic are good at the destructive duties required of defensive midfielders there could be a little more creativity in that area, otherwise too much of the burden falls on Eden Hazard.
Chelsea will also have to resolve the Diego Costa situation, either by keeping him or by bringing in a striker of similar quality. There are not too many of those and even Romelu Lukaku would strike some as an inferior replacement. Chelsea have been linked with the unsettled Real Madrid forward Álvaro Morata, though the Spain international reportedly favours a move back to Italy.
Spurs were great at home last season but out of Europe by Christmas, partly down to playing their Champions League games at Wembley. They will be playing all their games there this season so they had better get used to it, though it is still reasonable to pose the question of what Mauricio Pochettino considers his priority. Spurs would not mind a good run in Europe but they probably do not see themselves as potential finalists just yet whereas, with a favourable wind and a couple of tweaks to the team, they ought to have a very good chance of winning the Premier League.
Tottenham have not won the title since 1961 but first things first. Some of the Spurs players are already attracting interest from other clubs, so a concerted effort to finish on top in England next year would be a logical and desirable next step.
A defensive rethink is needed at the Etihad, beginning with the goalkeeper. News that City are signing Benfica’s Ederson at least means Pep Guardiola has recognised the mistake he made with Claudio Bravo, after being in denial for most of the season. City are fine at the front, they boast the Brazil and Argentina No9s in Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Agüero and have plenty of quality in the support positions but they need a couple of full-backs and, as ever, cover at centre-half for Vincent Kompany.
Keeping both Agüero and Jesus happy might be a problem but City mostly need to tighten their defence to stop conceding stupid goals, an observation made by Pellegrini at least three years ago.
Like Tottenham, Liverpool might be more tempted to put most of their energy into a title challenge rather than an extended run in Europe, though extended runs in Europe will never be disdained at Anfield. Most feel Liverpool need a reliable goalscorer, having failed to end up with anyone in the Premier League’s top 10 last season, though Jürgen Klopp may continue to trust Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané to contribute enough between them. Apart from that a commanding goalkeeper and centre-half would not go amiss, and perhaps a driving presence in midfield. Klopp also needs to evaluate his tactics. Even without European involvement last season, Liverpool looked tired at the end. This does not yet look like a side capable of terrorising Europe as of old.
United could do with Uefa relaxing Atlético Madrid’s transfer ban, if that is what is preventing Antoine Griezmann coming to Old Trafford. The Frenchman has the class and imagination to be a crowd-pleaser at United and, if his long-predicted move must wait to January at the earliest, it could be too late to galvanise the European campaign. United must keep hold of David de Gea, whatever the cost, and bring in a striker to take over from Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Even before the Swede’s injury United were not scoring enough goals and, working on the theory that José Mourinho likes a big chap up front – Didier Drogba, Costa, Ibrahimovic, etc – Lukaku has been mentioned. It has yet to be established whether Mourinho rates the Belgian any higher than he did when letting him leave Stamford Bridge, and United may end up trying to outbid Chelsea for Morata.
The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, has given his backing to the 2030 World Cup being held in England – or a combined British bid.
The Slovenian said earlier in the week that it will be “Europe’s turn” to host the tournament, following 2022 in Qatar and a 2026 event tipped to take place in North America. Ceferin has now gone further by backing a return to Britain for the first time since England hosted and won the 1966 World Cup.
“For me, they are absolutely capable of organising it from an organisational point of view, from an infrastructure point of view,” he told the BBC. “But of course it’s a decision not just for the FA, probably the government and all the others too. But you know everything about English or British football, so they deserve to have a World Cup in the near future.
“I don’t know how much encouragement they need, but they are capable of organising the World Cup, I’m sure. That’s the decision of the Football Association and if they decide to go, we will strongly support them. They will have all our political support. I just hope we will not have two European bidders, because that would not be good. I think the ideal situation would be to have one European bidder, and then all of Europe stands together and we can achieve it.”
Ceferin also addressed the corruption scandal which saw his predecessor Michel Platini and the former Fifa president Sepp Blatter suspended from football for four and six years respectively. The pair each had their bans cut from an initial eight years after appealing against sanctions relating to an illicit payment from Blatter to Platini in 2011.
“With those … let’s call them ‘Fifa matters’, even Uefa’s image was damaged,” he said. “And it was not our fault. OK, we also had some problems, but it was not to such an extent. But I still think that Fifa is improving. Things are changing. I’m sure it’s not easy, there are many internal interests, there are many, many people that were involved in Fifa and want to stay there. But at the end, Fifa will have to change completely, or … it will hurt all the football organisations around the world.”
Britain gets a taste of hosting a major event on Saturday evening with the Champions League final, between Juventus and Real Madrid, taking place in Cardiff. It brings Real’s Gareth Bale back to Wales after he helped his country memorably reach the semi-finals of Euro 2016, and Ceferin feels the occasion will help further Wales’s development.
“It’s quite different if you bring the Champions League final to a city like Cardiff compared to a city like London,” he said. “London will not change if the Champions League final comes to town. For Cardiff it’s a fantastic experience. It’s a bit of a challenge for us because of the lack of infrastructure – hotels and things like that – but I’m sure that they will never forget it. It’s very important also for the development of football. They had some fantastic results last year, especially at the Euro, and they have one of the best players in the world. For a small country like that, it’s a fantastic result.”
An underwhelming first night does not always mean a major production is in trouble. Even the most gushing West End impresario, however, would struggle to claim the 2017 British & Irish Lions launched their tour of New Zealand in emphatic style. Having been in the country just three days, they played like a team whose minds and bodies were still somewhere north of the equator.
Jetlag was clearly a factor, along with the ludicrously short amount of time the entire squad have spent together. Then again, everyone knew that would be the case 12 months ago, once it became obvious the domestic finals would again be played a week before the first Lions game. On this occasion it is less the players who should be blamed for underperformance and more the administrators who keep permitting these conflicts of interest to arise. Add it all together and what should have been a gentle loosener against scratch opposition developed into something altogether less comfortable.
For a while it looked as though the unthinkable might happen against a bunch of part-timers whose ranks included a sheep farmer, a shopkeeper, a nurse and a fruit picker. The Lions have lost their opening tour game three times – in 1903 and 1924 in South Africa and in 1971 against Queensland – and they will be suitably grateful for the small mercy of victory, undistinguished or not. Aside from the pre-match fireworks, the evening’s brightest sparks were probably Ben Te’o, Kyle Sinckler and Taulupe Faletau who all showed up well. Sadly, at least half a dozen others did their chances of making the Test team no good at all, for all Warren Gatland’s insistence this performance was no big deal. Jonathan Sexton’s form urgently needs rebooting and not many New Zealanders went away overly impressed.
Little went right from the outset, with the home side looking much the brighter team and deservedly leading 7-3 at half-time. Only after Owen Farrell replaced the out-of-sorts Sexton on 48 minutes, and his fellow Saracens Mako Vunipola, George Kruis and Jamie George were thrown into the fray, did the Lions edge ahead through a face-saving try in the 52nd minute from Anthony Watson. The last quarter, with Rhys Webb also making a difference at scrum-half, proved marginally less uncomfortable.
With a desperately tough schedule ahead, Gatland will be particularly concerned at the lack of penetration up front and the failure of his backs to outshine a team composed of players from below the top tier of New Zealand provincial rugby. His only real consolation was the excellent performance of his talented son, Bryn, at fly-half for the Barbarians. Otherwise, he has a raft of issues to address before Wednesday’s first midweek game against Auckland at Eden Park, with the unbeaten Super Rugby leaders, the Crusaders, to follow in Christchurch next Saturday.
Then again, it could always have been the craftiest of double bluffs. If it was, it worked spectacularly. There are no shortage of harsh judges in New Zealand and some were already dismissing these Lions before the game had reached the half-hour mark. “Hogg, you’re the worst full-back ever seen in New Zealand, you muppet,” yelled one wag. “Why isn’t Susan Boyle playing?” It is going to be an extremely long six weeks if the Lions do not improve very, very quickly but, equally, credit should be given to the sprightly Barbarians.
Drawn from lower-ranked New Zealand provincial sides, they have been waiting a long time to show these Lions what they can do and were a credit to the coaching of, among others, the former Bath and Saracens winger Joe Maddock. Their captain and hooker, Sam Anderson-Heather, scored a good first-half try and the full-back, Luteru Laulala, may now find himself fielding inquiries from interested suitors. By comparison, the Lions looked as leaden as the skies around Whangarei in the buildup to the game.
Looking at the pristine surface it was hard to believe the biblical pre-match weather had been the primary topic of conversation. A lack of moisture is rarely a problem in this part of the world but even by local standards the 24 pre-game hours of torrential rain were extreme. Had the fixture been played on Friday evening, both sides would have needed snorkels. History, instead, will record a Lions victory in front of a sell-out crowd, with both sides failing to take decent chances close to the line.
The Northland public would have liked to have seen their one-time local favourite Jared Payne, only for injury to intervene and deprive him of a return to the so-called “House of Payne”. In the event they saw Te’o, who spent part of his youth playing north of Auckland in Silverdale, lay down a challenge to the other No12s on the trip with a smoothly composed performance that supported Gatland’s assertion there is much more to the centre than running straight and hard.
Overall, it was yet another iffy opening game to set alongside the broiling 2013 affair in Hong Kong and the rusty 2009 fixture against a Royal XV in Rustenberg. On both occasions the Lions went on to either win or threaten to win the series, while even the illustrious boys of 1971 lost their opening fixture en route to New Zealand. Not necessarily the end of the world, then, but absolutely nothing to be enthused about either.
The former Bundesliga team 1860 Munich face demotion to Germany’s fourth or fifth tier after failing to meet a deadline for a third-division licence.
1860 were due to make a payment of reportedly €5m to €10m to the German football federation for the licence by Friday afternoon, but their financial backer Hasan Ismaik said through his company HAM that he was not prepared to pay it because 1860 “refuses to make necessary changes to solve the many issues facing the club”. Ismaik, a Jordanian billionaire who owns 60% of 1860, was the club’s only hope of meeting the payment deadline.
1860 were relegated from Germany’s second division on Tuesday after a play-off defeat to Jahn Regensburg, a team who were playing fourth-tier football the season before.
Despite missing the payment, Ismaik said he will continue to support the club at the fourth or fifth level “and push forward necessary changes”. The statement added: “His emotional ties to 1860 and his loyalty to the fans remains strong. The financial commitment to the beneficial work of TSV 1860 is also not affected by the aforementioned business decision.”
Ismaik is at loggerheads with those remaining at the club over changes he wants pushed through that 1860 said on Thursday “the club cannot fulfill for legal and organisational reasons”. The Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that Ismaik, who only has 49% voting rights at 1860 in line with the Bundesliga’s 50-plus-1 regulation, has made his financial support dependent on conditions that would have given him more power. The 50-plus-1 rule seeks to limit the influence of external backers.
Ismaik, who did not attend Tuesday’s play-off defeat, has denied any responsibility for the club’s plight and accused management of “unscrupulous power struggles”. President Peter Cassalette and chief executive Ian Ayre resigned on Tuesday, leaving vice-presidents Heinz Schmidt and Hans Sitzberger in charge.
The play-off loss at home was marred by violence from angry fans. Around 1,000 riot police lined up to prevent the situation escalating as the game was held up for 15 minutes.
1860 had the third most expensive squad in the second division after Stuttgart and Hannover, who both secured their return to the Bundesliga. 1860 finished third from bottom, leading to the play-off against the third division’s third-place finisher.
1860, who won the Bundesliga in 1966 and played in the top flight as recently as 2004, returned to the third level for the first time in 24 years, but Friday’s missed deadline means they will drop even further. 1860’s under-21, under-19, under-17 and under-16 teams were also relegated this season.
Scoring goals is not something Real Madrid usually have a problem with. They have scored in every game this season and have not failed to score since Manchester City stopped them in the Champions League semi-final last year, a run of 64 games in a row in which they have found the net. If any team can stop them, though, it is Juventus, who have let in only three goals in 12 European games this season and only 27 in 38 in Serie A, and are equally comfortable in either a back three or a back four. So how do you score against Max Allegri’s side?
The first question, perhaps, is what shape Juve will use. Juve began the season with a back three but seemed to struggle to accommodate two of their new signings, Gonzalo Higuaín and Miralem Pjanic. From the beginning of December, the 4-2-3-1 became more prominent and, after a 2-1 defeat at Fiorentina with a back three in January, it became the default, producing Juve’s best football of the season.
But the back three returned for the semi-final against Monaco, for two reasons. Monaco play a 4-4-2 with the midfield very narrow and attacking full‑backs. Using three central defenders meant both that Juve were competing three v two at the back, four v four in the middle (albeit in differing alignments) and that their wing-backs could then engage the Monaco full-backs high up the pitch, something that worked so well Dani Alves set up three and scored one of their four goals.
What shape Juve use in the Champions League final probably depends how they expect Madrid to line up. If Gareth Bale starts then it will probably be a 4-3-3; if Isco plays, as seems more probable, Madrid will be in more of a 4-3-1-2. Then the challenge for Juve becomes more similar to the one Monaco posed: two central forwards, a midfield that plays narrow and attacking full-backs, which may encourage the use of a the 3-4-2-1 again.
That presents Madrid with a number of problems. Cristiano Ronaldo remains a wonderful footballer and his finishing is remarkable, as his eight goals over the last two rounds have proved, but he is not as mobile as he once was. He will not, as he might have done in the past, move into the area behind Dani Alves, isolate and beat Andrea Barzagli. Against Atlético Madrid in the semi-final, in fact, it was noticeable that it was Karim Benzema pulling into those wide areas behind the full-backs that led to Isco’s goal in the second leg.
Perhaps that is an avenue for Madrid to exploit but forwards have been looking for the space behind Dani Alves for years without a huge amount of success (even if Monaco’s goal in the semi-final did come down his flank). Besides, this is not the back four of Atlético, it is a back three and there is probably no side that has been as comfortable in that shape defensively as Juve over the past few seasons. The match-up between Dani Alves and Marcelo on that flank will be key, and while it’s probably true that the younger man has improved over the past couple of seasons, it’s not insignificant that, in 19 previous meetings between the Brazilians, Marcelo has lost 13 times and won just three.
Both Benzema and Ronaldo, of course, are capable of a moment of brilliance that could turn any game, but Juve will be confident enough in the capacity of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Barzagli to handle them. Besides which, the ball has to get to the Madrid front two. Isco looks like having the playmaking role but he will probably be up against Pjanic and either Sami Khedira or Claudio Marchisio. Given Pjanic will push forwards, Juve have in effect four and a half central players deep against three.
That makes two factors vitally important if Madrid are to break Juve down. One is that their midfield three of Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos can dominate with their slight numerical advantage against Mario Mandzukic, Paulo Dybala and half of Pjanic. And the second is that their full‑back pairing of Danilo and Marcelo can make some inroads against Dani Alves and Alex Sandro.
There is, of course, always the possibility of Sergio Ramos scoring from a set play in a third final – and Madrid will note that six of the 27 goals Juve conceded in Serie A this season were from corners – but Juventus, if they go with the back three, look as well equipped as anybody, both in terms of shape and personnel, to thwart Madrid.
That may be a case for Madrid to start Bale despite his lack of match fitness, or perhaps Marco Asensio, and operate a 4-3-3 – or play Isco wide in that system. Either way, Zinedine Zidane cannot let the game become too channelled down the centre, and in this case, he probably cannot rely on his full-backs, who have been excellent this season, to provide width.
It is customary when India play Pakistan at cricket to dwell on the astonishing scale and sweep of the spectacle. The usual starting figure of half a billion global television viewers is expected for both teams’ opening Champions Trophy game on Sunday at Edgbaston. There will, of course, be the usual fascination beyond the sports pages, too, at a group-stage game of a moderately sized competition in a glitzed-up old colonial sport that can still feed out into a wider geopolitical obsession. Perhaps the notion of cricket diplomacy will once again be raised, the idea that playing one another at cricket might somehow act as a balm to an irreconcilably raw neighbourly partition.
In which case everyone involved had better get a shift on. The Kashmir border between these two nations remains one of the most dangerous places in the world, stage for a constant “dirty war”, with the shadow of scattered short-range nuclear weapons always lurking. For all the hands-across-the-boundary-rope noises around Edgbaston, India’s sports minister, Vijay Goel, announced only this week that there would be no return to bilateral relations, declaring that “cricket and terrorism can’t go hand in hand”.
With this in mind, it is easy to forget just how profoundly Pakistan and India have grown apart on a sporting level, too, with a decade of debilitating isolationism on one hand and a hothoused cricketing boom on the other. The English summer will see the 10-year anniversary of the jumping-off point for this, the 2007 World T20 final in Johannesburg, first in a series of events, sporting and otherwise, that have seen the cricket war swing irreversibly one way.
To an extent India’s players have even outgrown the current occasion. The spectaculars tend to come thick and fast in the year-round riches of franchise cricket. A billion sets of eyeballs also tuned in for this season’s IPL, a World Cup that India win every year, and from which Pakistani players and coaches have been excluded since 2008.
Twenty-five years ago Pakistan were one-day world champions and one half of what was then the most lucrative summer staged in England, that febrile 1992 tour that left Imran Khan declaring that no Pakistan team would ever visit England again. A quarter of a century on, Edgbaston will see a meeting between cricket’s new financial power and a shrunken, scattered Pakistan, nomadic, broke and eating off its knees in the scullery.
At which point the screen freezes, wind chimes tinkle and we’re back in September 2007 at The Wanderers. India had come into the first World T20 with little expectation but sailed into the final on an updraft of thrilling off-the-cuff cricket. Still Pakistan seemed to be in charge at the death, nine wickets down but with Misbah ul-Haq leading the chase and needing six runs from the last four balls. At which point Misbah ambled across his stumps and ballooned a horrible standing sweep into the hands of Sreesanth at short fine leg. India erupted. India hasn’t really stopped erupting since. And the rest is (Indian) history.
Cue instant ignition as board, government and corporate sponsors piled in. The India players were given an instant $3m cash bonus (Yuvraj got a quarter of a million dollars for hitting Stuart Broad for six sixes). Joginder Sharma, the bowler as Misbah cranked out that sweep, received $50,000 cash from a local government department. The civil aviation authority handed out years of free flights for all involved. Within four months the first IPL auction had been held. History was falling into place, that gleaming future lining itself up.
From that moment of playing parity in Johannesburg, Pakistan began to head off the other way almost instantly. Bruised by various gambling scandals, cast in shadow by the car bomb outside the New Zealand team hotel in 2002, it was the attack on Sri Lanka’s bus in Lahore in 2009 that signalled the start of Pakistani isolation. The spot-fixing affair of 2010 capped a sense of drift and debauchery within the team itself.
As the captain, Misbah offered stability and grace in the lost years. Pakistan were, briefly, Test cricket’s No1 team last year. The old, mad, damaging individualism has been reined in. But it is hard to avoid the obvious sense of drift. Despite a culture of vibrant, aggressive cricket apparently suited to the new white-ball world, Pakistan instead have been left behind, a skeleton team stuck on the wrong side of history.
There has been brilliance in Younis Khan’s batting and Yasir Shah’s Test-match bowling. But this is, out of necessity, a more pious, mannered, careful Pakistan, without the exoticism, the wildness, the urbane qualities of the years before the domestic ban. They are eighth in the official one-day international rankings and only just made the cut-off for this Champions Trophy. Fielding has been a problem for some time. The batsmen’s strike rates are noticeably down on modern trends, a startling development in itself for the heirs of Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar and the great all-rounders.
And yet – as ever in a nation that sweats cricket out of every pore – there is still hope. The departure of Misbah and Younis was rightly mourned. Both had moved on from white-ball cricket but the old lions’ passing coincides with a wider sense of pruning back. Only two members of the team that lost to India at the 2015 World Cup are likely to play in Birmingham. Ties with the dreaded Akmals appear to have been severed, Umar Akmal failing a fitness test in Birmingham this month, having previously passed one under the aegis of the renowned fitness fanatic Inzamam-ul-Haq. Shahid Afridi really does seem to have suffered his final silver-bullet retirement, nailed down at last inside his casket.
New talent is emerging. Sadly the bullish Sharjeel Khan is missing, touched by the Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal. But Sarfraz Ahmed is both a fine attacking bat and an interesting captain in this format. Shadab Khan is a prodigious leg-spinner who rips the ball and is exactly half as old as his team-mate, the enduring Mohammad Hafeez. In the warm-up against Bangladesh Faheem Ashraf, a seam-bowling all-rounder, spanked 60 from 34 balls to win the game.
Best of all Mohammad Amir, the superstar that might have been, shows signs of rediscovering his swing after working with Azhar Mahmood during the tour of the West Indies. Amir is a walking, breathing metaphor for Pakistan’s state of suspended animation, the most prodigious talent in cricket in 2010, brought low by his own weakness, but a bowler who has still played only 32 ODIs, eight years after his debut.
There could be no better time to rediscover not just Amir’s own world-class nip but that wider sense of Pakistan-issue aggression, the verve and skill that is so suited to modern white-ball cricket, but which has for the last decade been left to wither a little in the shadow of an all-conquering neighbour.
Oh my goodness, me? Run? You are joking, aren’t you? No, honestly, I’m so unfit, look at the state of me, practically expired getting here from the car park, no, I think I’ll sit this one out, thanks very much. God, look at her doing stretches in her leggings and everything, anyone would think it actually mattered. The last competitive sport I did was the egg and spoon when I was about six, put me off for life. You know, I’m not even sure mothers’ races actually set a good example for the kids, all the coming first and body shaming that goes on. No, darling, Mummy is absolutely not running – well I know I did last year, got talked into it, came first, amazingly, didn’t I, darling, but I’m sure I’ve gained a couple of pounds since then.
Are you sure all the other mothers are? Well, if you absolutely insist, and you don’t mind me coming last, I suppose it looks a bit mean not to. Go on then. Where’s my basket, it’s got my trainers in it – you’re lucky I was at the gym this morning, still have my sports stuff under my dress, actually, there we go – and my sweatband? I’m sorry, I know it looks completely ridiculous, if I’d planned to race, I’d just be in jeans and Birkenstocks like anyone else, and run barefoot, but since I’ve got the trainers and everything, seems silly not to.
OK, just a few stretches, ouch, I’m so stiff these days, God knows why I’m doing this. OK, wish Mummy luck – oh, sorry, was that your foot, ouch, no need to push, it’s all in fun … YAY! God knows how I did that, seriously thought I was going to trip when Rose collapsed in front of me. I don’t know what Tricia thought she was doing at the end, excuse me, it was her who shoved me, yes, she totally did, I’m going to be bruised for weeks, still, no harm done – well, I’m sure she can’t be seriously hurt, no, I was definitely ahead all the way, look, does it matter anyway, it’s just a bit of fun, for heaven’s sake. God I hate competitive sport.
Jack O’Neill, the eye patch-wearing surfing pioneer who helped invent the wetsuit and created one of the world’s best-known surf brands, has died at the age of 94.
O’Neill – who went on in later life to champion marine environmental causes – died of natural causes on Friday at his oceanfront home in Santa Cruz, California, his family said in a statement. He was 94.
The ocean lover wanted to be able to surf longer in the frigid northern California ocean and experimented with various materials to create a lining that made the first neoprene wetsuit wearable.
His death comes a week after California lost another of its treasures: Surfer magazine founder John Severson at age 83. His magazine, which started out as simply a promotional pamphlet for his surf films, became required reading for surfers in the 1960s and carried spellbinding images and tales to an audience starved of such rich media.
O’Neill’s wetsuit discovery came about after he moved with his wife to San Francisco’s Ocean Beach neighbourhood in the early 1950s.
O’Neill said that at the time his friends didn’t have much faith in his invention. “All my friends said, ‘O’Neill, you will sell to five friends on the beach and then you will be out of business,’” he would remark, according to his family.
In San Francisco he opened one of the area’s first surf shops but in 1959 moved his growing family 75 miles (120km) south to Santa Cruz, where he opened his second shop to cater to the city’s growing surf scene. The surfing accident in which he lost an eye came about in the 1970s.
By the 1980s, O’Neill had become the world’s largest recreation wetsuit designer and manufacturer and the O’Neill surf brand had reached Australia, Europe, Japan and other corners of the globe.
He considered O’Neill Sea Odyssey, a marine and environmental education program for children, his proudest achievement. Founded in 1996, it has taken nearly 100,000 school-aged children in his personal Team O’Neill catamaran to the Monterey bay national marine sanctuary to learn about the ocean.
“The ocean is alive and we’ve got to take care of it,” O’Neill said about the program. “There is no doubt in my mind that the O’Neil Sea Odyssey is the best thing I’ve ever done.”

Samantha Stosur believes she is peaking beautifully for another second-week tilt at the French Open.
Australia’s lone singles survivor headed into the fourth round for the sixth time in Paris with a 6-2 6-2 dispatch of American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands.
Stosur blew Mattek-Sands off the court in barely an hour to set up a last-16 meeting on Sunday with Latvian Jelena Ostapenko.
A quarter-final against former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova or Caroline Wozniacki looks imminent as Stosur showcased her title credentials with four aces, seven service breaks and some of the fastest deliveries of the championships.
Yet to drop a set all tournament, the victory in Stosur’s milestone 50th match at Roland Garros was her eighth in a row on European clay and thrust the 33-year-old firmly in the frame for overdue glory after a series of shattering near-misses.
“I’m really pleased that I’ve been able to continue this form and get another straight-sets win,” Stosur said.
“I feel like I probably played a bit better again today and, yeah, I’m just really, really happy.
“Bethanie can be a really dangerous player. She obviously likes to play really aggressive and coming to net, kind of play big, and do all these things, and if you’re not on and doing the right things against her, then she could make life very difficult.
“But I felt like every time she maybe had a bit of an opportunity or something like that, I was able to play a bit better and, yeah, kind of squash that and then get myself ahead again.
“So just really pleased that I was able to play as well as I did.”
Mattek-Sands trudged onto Court 3 with her left thigh heavily strapped and made a horrible start.
The six-time grand slam doubles champion was flabbergasted when foot-faulted on the second point of the match.
“No way,” Mattek-Sands repeatedly protested to the chair umpire.
“I never foot fault.”
Rattled, she dropped her opening two service games as Stosur steamed to a 3-0 lead for the loss of only three points.
Mattek-Sands finally got on the board in the fourth game but Stosur broke straight back before clinching the first set in 31 minutes.
The pair traded early breaks in the second set as Australia’s former finalist sloppily dropped serve from 40-15 up in the fourth game.
But as hovering storm clouds threatened to stall Stosur’s progression, the 23rd seed wrestled back control with some piercing backhand return passes and her trademark forehand power.
Clapping thunder almost forced the pair off court with Stosur five points from victory.
But after consulting officials, the umpire allowed the combatants to play on, with Stosur eventually wrapping up the match in one hour and 10 minutes.
Luck in running may play a significant part in today’s Derby, for which the 19-runner field is the biggest in more than a decade. Anything that misses the kick as the stalls open will probably be trapped in the back half of the field for the first mile and will need things to fall right if they are to catch the front-runners in time.
That must be a concern for fans of the two market leaders, Cliffs Of Moher and Cracksman, neither of which bounced from the stalls with much alacrity when last seen. It may be a particular issue for the inexperienced Cracksman, who was helped by a steady pace and a small field when taking a prominent early position despite his slowish start here in April.
The Epsom surface still seemed to be riding quick despite the rain on Oaks day, so the percentage call must be to find something that can take a reasonably handy early position before staying on strongly, a formula that turned up Harzand last year. Venice Beach (4.30) could be the one this time at odds of 14-1.
It has been slightly surprising to see this one allowed to remain at such big odds despite winning the Chester Vase last month. Aidan O’Brien generally runs a strong Derby contender in that race, did the double with Ruler Of The World and has also been second in the Derby with two other Vase winners.
Venice Beach has taken time to show ability but that is hardly surprising for quite a stoutly bred sort, being by Galileo out of the mare who produced Danedream. That pedigree suggests he should be on a strong upward curve at this stage of his career.
On jockey bookings he is only O’Brien’s third string but the race may pan out well for him and his pilot, Donnacha O’Brien, son of the trainer. They may have most to fear from Best Solution and Permian, who appear well suited to this test, judging by their recent efforts.
2.00 Epsom The only course winner in the field, Emenem has won four of his last six races and has more to offer, judging by the way he beat 13 rivals here last time.
2.35 Epsom A half-sister to an Arlington Million winner who also won at this track, Laugh Aloud is nicely bred and exciting, after two Listed wins from her last three starts. John Gosden’s runner should prove better than these.
3.10 Epsom There is unfinished business with this race for Sovereign Debt, who was an unlucky fourth last year. He seems in the form of his life for his new trainer, Ruth Carr, landing a Group Two last time.
3.45 Epsom High draws do not always dominate but, from stall 18, Boom The Groom is the type who could take advantage of a good starting position, having done best of those drawn low a year ago and been third the year before.

It is at such moments, in the final game of a demanding period which involves playing three times in eight days, that one may learn most about a side. However, in a week which has featured criticism aplenty from coaches and players alike, the most obvious lesson of all was how it is perhaps more important to seek out quality, rather than quantity, if the sport is indeed to undergo a restructuring this winter.
For those arguing that the sport’s stars are playing too often, this was the ideal night to press home their case. If any of the Rugby Football League came along to watch a game which featured almost as many penalties as points, they would have surely found it hard to disagree. One double-header weekend over Easter is congestion enough but another – squeezed in to allow an England pre-season training camp in Dubai which never actually happened – is clearly too much of a strain.
“I’m pleased we won and it’s obvious some things in offence weren’t right but what do you expect? It’s three games in eight days,” said the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott. “Where we are now is crazy. It just doesn’t work. Rugby league is one of the hardest sports in the world.”
Whether schedules with two such weekends in six weeks continue into 2018 is unconfirmed but on this evidence a sport which prides itself on the quality and entertainment it so often provides is being cruelly let down by congestion in the calendar.
There were some positives for both sides. For Leeds there was the response from Monday’s defeat by Widnes with two hard-earned points strengthening their place in the top four as the final rounds of the regular season approach. An eight-day break before their next fixture will feel like a pre-season now.
Leigh arrived buoyed by their first Super League victory in more than two months last weekend and with quiet confidence that they could become only the second team to win at Headingley this year. Amid the conjecture they produced a heartening display which will give their fans hope they can yet avoid the Qualifiers and a battle against relegation this summer.
Both sides played their part in the first half but inevitably fatigue took its toll after the break. That there were 26 penalties did little to improve the occasion, with James Child’s whistle contributing to a lacklustre second half.
The sin-binning of Antoni Maria two minutes after half-time allowed Leeds to improve their four-point half-time lead to 16-10 and after a sustained period of pressure on the Centurions’ line, the hosts further increased their advantage when Danny McGuire kicked through for Adam Cuthbertson to touch down.
Leeds had further opportunities to kill the game but their attack had the look of a side who had been pushed through the rigours of three games in a week. Fortunately for the hosts, Cory Paterson’s late try was no more than consolation for the Centurions, who had fought valiantly throughout.

Andy Murray believes he and Juan Martín del Potro left an equal number of psychological bruises on each other in two epic five-set matches last year but he discounts the notion he is not playing well enough to beat the Argentinian in the third round of the French Open on Saturday.
“The Davis Cup [which Del Potro won] was physically tough for me because it came off the back of a long summer,” Murray said after a four-set struggle to get past the world No50 Martin Klizan on Thursday. “The Olympics [which went Murray’s way] was physically and mentally hard – and psychologically but I had also come off a period of rest and trained and prepared for it. When we got to the Davis Cup, I’d played the Olympics, gone to Cincinnati and then New York. That was tough. After that I didn’t feel great for the next couple of days, [playing] the doubles and singles.
“But he also will remember those matches. They weren’t easy for him, either, they were tough. I will try to make it the same for him again on Saturday.”
For insight from close to the Murray camp but sufficiently detached to lend perspective, his brother Jamie was the go-to source on Friday, after his own doubles success with Bruno Soares: 6-1, 7-6 (7-2) in an hour and 21 minutes over the Russians Mikhail Elgin and Karen Khachanov.
“He has had a rough year from a results point of view, but also because his health has not been good at all,” the elder Murray brother said. “He has been really unlucky. He had shingles, then he had his elbow stuff and then he has been ill in Miami and ill again here. He has been ill in between that. So it has not been easy – he has not had a clear run at anything. I think that has been frustrating for him.
“He has been unfortunate but things can turn around fast. If he has a great tournament here, he can feel great going on to grass and have a great Wimbledon. In six weeks’ time, you guys will be writing that he is great again. Things can change fast.”
Nor did he share the downbeat assessment of his brother’s chances at Roland Garros. Greg Rusedski, the former British No1, said if Murray played as poorly as he did against Klizan he would struggle to beat Del Potro – which is a fair enough view – but Jamie sees an upside.
“If he keeps winning, his tournament can change quickly. He has not played amazingly in the first two matches but he is winning – that is what matters at the start of a tournament. You can see in the doubles here, all the seeds are losing so all you can do is keep trying to win and take advantage of that if you get the chance.
“But that stuff happens in grand slams. If he can hang around long enough and he finds himself in the quarters or semi-finals, he knows what it takes to win those matches.”
That is true. Last year, Murray survived two five-set matches at the start and reached the final against Novak Djokovic. The players at the very top of the game have gears the others do not. If Murray gets into the second week of the tournament and has shaken off the last dregs of the cold that laid him low at the start of this week, he will be as dangerous as a world No1 should be.
Murray Sr said Kyle Edmund’s excellent run into the third round will be mutually beneficial to them, as well. Edmund looked superb on Thursday beating Renzo Olivo in three sets, after the Argentinian’s heroic performance to put Jo-Wilfried Tsonga out of the tournament. Edmund will play the hard-serving South African Kevin Anderson on Saturday.
“From my point of view, if he is doing well in a tournament and Kyle or Dan [Evans] or the girls are doing well, it is cool. You can kind of feed off that a bit. It is a nice atmosphere to have somebody else to root for in the tournament. I am sure everybody else likes that as well.”
Nevertheless, Murray might find it tougher beating Del Potro than Edmund will against Anderson. The British pair can only meet in the semi-finals … but that is a dream for later.
Twelve thousand miles away from Downing Street there is another race for No10 going on. The British & Irish Lions management have their own big decision to make this week and it is not as clear-cut as it looked a couple of months ago either. Once the Lions have finished their third fixture of the tour against the Crusaders next Saturday, they will have little option but to nominate their preferred fly-half to face the All Blacks.
The opening tour match against a New Zealand Provincial Barbarians XV in a rain-lashed Northland on Saturday is unlikely to supply all the answers. Barring something remarkable, a comfortable Lions win is anticipated and the fixture will not solely determine whether Ireland’s Johnny Sexton retains the shirt he filled with such distinction on the 2013 tour to Australia. The respective body language of Sexton and his main rival, Owen Farrell, nevertheless, will tell the coaches plenty.
With Wales’s Dan Biggar also in the mix, the Lions could hardly have named a more competitive trio of fly-halves. Sexton is theoretically the man in possession but he is four years older now. Farrell, an apprentice last time, is snapping at the boots of his one-time master and has just steered his club to consecutive European triumphs. Biggar has long been one of Warren Gatland’s key lieutenants. Those who assume Farrell, as he does with England, will shift to the No12 jersey alongside Sexton for the big games are getting slightly ahead of themselves.
Sexton’s selection at Whangarei’s Toll Stadium underlined the sense of uncertainty. The Leinster pivot endured such a grim evening in the Pro12 final defeat to Scarlets last month he needed to get back on the first available horse. Picking Farrell on the bench also offers Gatland and his coaches the chance – potentially at least – of giving the Sexton-Farrell 10-12 axis a brief whirl. With preparation time so limited, they need to know as soon as possible if that idea is a runner on grass as well as paper.
Hence why the body language matters. Sometimes a combination clicks immediately; other pairings can resemble two unrelated fish. On the 2009 Lions tour to South Africa the instant midfield rapport between Jamie Roberts and Brian O’Driscoll was a gloriously snug fit from the outset. Should Sexton and Farrell be half as comfortable in each other’s company, Gatland will be hugely encouraged.
The alternative scenario is rather more awkward. The chances are Sexton and Farrell will start together against the Crusaders in Christchurch; if the touring team are picked apart by Super Rugby’s team of the moment, Gatland may well opt to go with a stronger-running 12 such as Ben Te’o or Robbie Henshaw and consider Farrell primarily as a 10. Any hint of a sluggish start to the tour by Sexton and the possible ramifications scarcely need spelling out.
Nor does the necessity, for the Lions, of picking a fly-half who can shape the entire series. This is not any old job: whoever wears the red Lions No10 jersey in New Zealand will inevitably hear plenty about Barry John’s brilliance in 1971.
Last time around in 2005, Dan Carter delivered a classic fly-half performance in the second Test in Wellington. If the modern All Blacks are to be outwitted, the Lions’ chief playmaker will have to relegate the gifted Beauden Barrett to a supporting role.
Sexton would not be human if some, or all, of the above have not flashed across his mind in recent weeks. As recently as March he was orchestrating Ireland’s Six Nations win over England in Dublin but he has endured a stop-start season and his pale features do not currently exude total confidence. Gatland is certainly giving him no guarantees. “We want to see how those players go at 10 in the first three games,” the coach said. “That’s our first instinct at the moment: we’re considering them as 10s.”
Regarding Sexton specifically, there was also a revealing pause when the Irishman’s prospects were mentioned. “He knows he needs to get some games under his belt,” murmured Gatland, choosing his words carefully. “He knows the competition is pretty fierce in that position but he’s a competitor and that’s what has made him one of the best 10s in world rugby.”
There is certainly no sense from Sexton that Farrell will be playing at 12. “Honestly, you’d have to ask the coaches,” the 31-year-old said. “They haven’t given any hints that Owen will play there. He’s had some great success with England at 12 but also he’s had great success with Saracens at 10. Maybe they’ll try him there, maybe they won’t. He’s obviously coming in as favourite to start somewhere. I’ve got to concentrate on bringing the best performances out of myself and see where that gets me. If it’s not good enough, well I can live with that. Hopefully it will be.”
The 27-year-old Biggar will have something to say about that, particularly if he gives an authoritative performance against the Blues on Wednesday. All three contenders also know this tour will be physically draining, with injuries certain to play some part. “It’s the hardest place to tour because of how attritional the games will be,” Sexton said. “You’re playing against the best in the world and this tour will be different from the last one because the pre-Test games will be really tough. That will be good for us; if we can perform well and get some confidence we’ll be match-hardened come the Tests.”
The first few games will be particularly instructive; if the Lions are still undefeated by next Saturday night they will be highly encouraged. Downing New Zealand takes some doing but Ireland managed it last autumn.
“You can’t sit back against them, that’s the one thing I think the Irish guys might tell the other guys,” Sexton added. “You’ve got to keep attacking no matter what the scoreline. You saw that in Chicago. When we sat back we conceded two or three tries. It’s not just attacking with ball in hand, it can be an attacking kicking game and defence as well.” Sexton knows how to win this Lions series but first he has to get himself re-elected.
Matt Mullan is relishing the chance to lock horns with Argentina’s scrum on England’s forthcoming two-Test tour and believes a strong showing against the Pumas may enhance his claim to hold on to the No1 jersey.
With Joe Marler and Mako Vunipola away with the Lions, the Wasps loosehead prop is vying with Ellis Genge for a starting berth against Argentina, traditional heavyweights at the scrum. Of the 30 players unavailable to Eddie Jones 10 are front-rows but the head coach has challenged his current squad to keep those injured or away out of the side when they return.
“If you get a chance when you are out there, then you want to try and play as well as you can,” said Mullan. “If you are the last person in that shirt in Eddie’s eyes, then that could stand you in good stead next time he selects a group. Against Argentina there is a combination of technique and size and they pride themselves on that area – it is traditionally a strength of theirs and we know it is going to be a challenge. We will have to do our homework but that scrum battle is going to be important out there.”
In an effort to build camaraderie and encourage competition Jones arranged a quiz night for his 32-man squad – split into four teams of eight – on Wednesday. The referee Wayne Barnes wrote it, England’s defence coach, Paul Gustard, was quizmaster and Dylan Hartley’s side won. This competitive element has continued in the gym and around the training camp.
“It’s a bit of a challenge and it picks up each team. Having not met some of the boys before you get the chance to sit and talk to them,” added Mullan. “It is just a really nice way to interact and get to know each other a bit quicker.”
Chris Robshaw trained alone at a public session at Twickenham on Friday because of a sore ankle but Gustard is confident he will be fit to take part in the first Test, a week on Saturday. Marland Yarde, who joined up with the squad at the start of the week and went on stand-by in case Denny Solomona failed to recover from his ankle injury, will travel to Argentina.
The fact Northern Ireland took on this friendly at all, sandwiched between training camps in England and Turkey, is testament to a level of diligence which continues to bear fruit.
The key aspiration was not to beat New Zealand – albeit that will maintain confidence in a squad which now punches well above its weight as standard – but to build towards next Saturday’s crucial World Cup qualifier in Azerbaijan. Back-to-back tournament appearances is a legitimate aim for a team consigned to international football’s wilderness for years.
Northern Ireland’s manager, Michael O’Neill, also has a selection dilemma he may well have predicted. Ross County’s Liam Boyce notched his first goal for his country in an excellent 45-minute display. Boyce’s claim to start in Baku before more established players is now a serious one.For New Zealand this was a low-key opening to their Confederations Cup preparations. Northern Ireland’s tempo was always vastly superior.
Boyce’s career path has hardly been orthodox. After a successful spell in the Irish League with Cliftonville, the Belfast boy was recruited by Werder Bremen. If there was no shame in Boyce failing to make the grade in Germany, it was a surprise that he ended up back with his first club. Another prolific period followed before joining Ross County.
The faith shown by the Scottish top flight club has been well founded, with Boyce returning 48 league goals in 80 starts. In the campaign just ended, the 26-year-old was the top scorer in his domestic league. Boyce’s next task is to carry this record into internationals, easing the burden on Kyle Lafferty.
Lafferty, whose future is unclear after an unhappy spell at Norwich City, was left among O’Neill’s substitutes here. Boyce took full advantage of the faith bestowed on him by confidently cutting inside and lashing a left-foot shot beyond Stefan Marinovic after six minutes. Only a fine Marinovic save prevented Boyce’s strike partner, Josh Magennis, from doubling the hosts’ lead in their next attack.
That flow of pressure remained until half-time with the Leeds United striker Chris Wood barely afforded a touch. Conor McLaughlin had the ball in the visitors’ net, with an earlier foul denying the full-back proper credit for a stunning half-volley.
With his work done, Boyce remained inside at the interval. Lafferty’s impact was almost instant, the 29-year-old turning a Magennis cross from the right just wide.
Magennis was the next to try his luck, his header skimming the crossbar. New Zealand’s best opportunity of the match came with 25 minutes to play, with substitute Kosta Barbarouses thwarted by the inside of the post.
Sergio Ramos described it as a “date with history”, and it is one they have waited a long time for. The last time Real Madrid were in this position, Alfredo Di Stéfano played his final game for the club, departing bitterly after defeat by Helenio Herrera’s Internazionale. Two years before, Ferenc Puskas scored three, but Eusebio’s goal denied them in Amsterdam; and the time before that, the last time they achieved what they seek to emulate on Saturday, Paco Gento’s extra-time winner defeated Milan 3-2 at the Heysel Stadium.
That was 59 years ago now, victory securing Madrid’s players 50,000 pesetas each, 25,000 per trophy: the bachelors earned £20 a month, married players £29, but all of them left Belgium £148 better off. They had earned it: Madrid had just completed a league and European Cup double.
It had happened before, in each of the two previous years, but it never happened again. Until now? Madrid have won 27 league titles since and eight European Cups, but not in the same season. Like in 1964 and 1962, they are 90 minutes away. Inter and Benfica denied them then; Juventus stand before them and history now – and “history”, as Ramos said, really is the word, even for the biggest, most successful club there is. Madrid have won 11 European Cups, but the last eight have come alone, stretching back to Brussels. These players could achieve what Puskas, Amancio, Sánchez, Butragueno, Zidane, and the original Ronaldo never did.
“Throughout our history, Madrid are the team that has won the most. We can’t live off the past, but that badge imposes upon you and we know our obligations,” Ramos said. “Our history is not coincidence. For us this is an opportunity that this wonderful sport gives us.”
It is an opportunity to eclipse some of their most successful generations. To do what Di Stéfano, [Héctor] Rial and Gento did. Much has changed since then, a long time has passed, a lot of players. These are different days. Pepe Santamaría recalled that the bonus “didn’t go far”. Yesterday, Juventus’s Dani Alves grinned that cheeky grin and said: “the president promised us a red horse [a Ferrari] if we win – let’s see if he delivers.” Madrid’s bonus is reportedly 1.5m euros each. The enormity of the achievement warrants it, even for them. After all, it is not just 1958, not just a wait of over half a century for this double; it is that another record stands before them: 25 years have passed since a team defended the European title.
“This is a chance to win it for a second year in a row,” Ramos said. Back then, Carlo Ancelotti, the man who led Madrid to the décima, their 10th European Cup three years ago, was on the pitch for Milan. So were Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten. In the Champions League era, no team has emulated that Milan team, not even those that have defined epochs like Arrigo Sacchi’s side did. Juventus have been in consecutive finals but, having won it in 1996, in 1997 and 1998 they were defeated – as they would be again in 2003 and 2015.
“Real Madrid have a feeling with finals; they are used to winning them,” Gigi Buffon said, smiling slightly. “We, on the other hand, have lost a lot of finals.” For Madrid, it is 11 wins from 13, and three finals in four years, something Ramos described as “barbaric”. For Juventus, it is two from eight. “We are going try to change our history,” Buffon added. At 39, it could be his last opportunity: this is the only trophy he has not won. The last time he tried, Juve were beaten by Barcelona. That night in Berlin, Dani Alves played for the other side, collecting his third European Cup; now of course he is a team-mate. “I’d like to see him win it; I took one off them, I’d like to give one back,” Alves said. Buffon meanwhile admitted: “I asked Dani to teach us how to win this competition.”
“There is a thorn in Juventus’s side,” Alves said. “Whether that’s because they lost that final two years ago, or that it is twenty years since they won this competition, or that they lost the 1998 final to an offside goal …”
The “offside” goal, cheekily referenced, was scored by Pedja Mijatovic, to finally end Madrid’s 32-year wait for the trophy that despite those barren years had come to define them. Alves was enjoying this, a moment for fun, not for fear. “We are not scared of Madrid’s history,” he added. “We’ll play with ambition and desire. We’re hungry, and there’s a plate in front of us. We have to get there, pick up the cup and get out of there with it.” Told Alves’s words, Ramos replied: “we’ll be there at quarter to nine.”
If so, they will be an hour late. It’s a date, anyway. And it would be historic for Juventus too, completing their first ever treble, and making it eight clubs in European history. Alves alone is on for his third, making him unique.
It is that kind of occasion. A Champions League final is big anyway, but this feels even more significant; The plot is simple – win the European Cup – but there are subplots everywhere, waiting to be fleshed out. From Alves’s third treble, and against his former rivals, the team he has faced 42 times complete with international team-mate Marcelo, to Buffon’s last chance. “It wouldn’t change his whole career to have it, but it would be another golden history,” Alves said. Juventus’s captain, Buffon would be the oldest player to lift the trophy and he described potential victory as the “perfect finale”.
It is the perfect final for all of them; the strongest sides in Europe, Italian and Spanish champions. The competition’s best defence against its best attack. Different styles, different identities, yet much that is shared.
So much of this feels symbolic. The stories are many. Like the last time they met in a final, 1998 still the single most anxiously-awaited game in Madrid’s history, and one that Mijatovic described as being like “going from back-and-white to colour”. The European Cup’s most successful team finally won in the modern era, with Zidane on the other side. He had to leave Turin to win the European Cup: first as a player, then assistant coach, then coach. Here he is again, 18 months into his top flight managerial career, already seeking a second. And there’s more. There’s Gonzalo Higuaín against his former club, where the many he scored are less well remembered than the few he missed, a sense of bitterness accompanying his departure. “I’m trying not to think about it,” he admitted.
Sami Khedira, a Champions League winner with Madrid in 2014, too. “Lads it’s been a pleasure,” he said when he left. This week, he said something rather different, admitting: “As soon as I had a less good game, criticism started and people asked if I was good enough. It got on my nerves. At Juventus they see you differently. After five years there, I had to leave.” And Álvaro Morata, against those he credits with making him a man.
Then there’s Gareth Bale in Cardiff, forced to take pills to get him through training and matches as he fights to make it. Because he probably won’t, there’s Isco, centre-stage at last. And Cristiano Ronaldo’s bid to become the first player to score in three Champions League finals – if Ramos doesn’t get there first. Asked who would be the star if he and Ronaldo played together, Zidane said: “Him, for sure. I could play quite well, but he scores goals.” “Too much humility is not a good thing either,” Ronaldo said. “We’re better.”
Alves agreed. Indeed, he embraced the underdog role. But he was determined to enjoy this. He had started almost with a sales pitch, like a presenter getting everyone going, and he would end with one too. “Good afternoon,” he had begun, “it’s very special to be able to live this day. To be alongside so many great players, playing another final, is lovely. Everyone will stop to watch this game. We’re lucky to be here and we have to enjoy this moment. What we have to do is try to make the night even more special, sweat every last drop; this is the coronation of our season.” He ended by calling it: “very, very, very, very beautiful.” Whatever happens, there is a date set, history to be made and stories to be told.
The question is which ones.
Margaret Court was the most glittering example of Australia’s domination of world tennis in the 1960s and 70s – a prolonged period of supremacy in which a murderer’s row of superstar players with iconic, instructive nicknames like Rocket, Muscles and Newk took all before them.
It was a time when Australia’s sun-blessed climate, abundance of tennis facilities and lack of the stifling class systems that held the sport back in other countries, seemed destined to ensure world-beating talent would flourish forever. Even then, in the fattest of times, it was beyond comprehension that the country would ever produce a female champion to rival Court. She was a living legend among mere champions.
At times like this past week, as Court determinedly administered upper cut after crushing right cross to her own reputation, it pays to note her more noble achievements before they’re forgotten entirely, for Court’s record 24 grand slam singles titles (and 64 including doubles) are for generations of Australians little more than fading facts from dusty almanacs.
From her late teens to her mid-30s, through marriage, multiple retirements and the birth of children, Court acquired a trophy collection of staggering proportions: 11 Australian Open singles crowns, five US Open titles and as many at Roland Garros, three on the lawns of Wimbledon.
Though fame and celebrity never rested easily on her shoulders, in the throes of competition she was always a picture of quiet determination – scrupulously fair, dignified and modest, the embodiment of Australia’s outdoorsy, can-do image of her times.
If Billie Jean King – Court’s on- and off-court sparring partner since the 1960s – was the reformist whose relentless pursuit of a better deal for women brought true equality to the sport, it was Court who paved the way for women to embrace power and physicality long before the likes of Amelie Mauresmo and Serena Williams, not just beating but dominating opponents.
The bedrock of Court’s remarkable success was a compelling mix of single-mindedness and those imposing physical gifts. Height, reach (it was often said Court’s arms were three inches longer than the average woman of her size, which earned her the nickname The Arm) and power did for most opponents. “A superbly athletic animal,” is how Sports Illustrated’s Gwilym Brown termed it, calling Court “the physical equal of a great many men”.
Between 1960 and 1973 she triumphed in 929 of 1,003 matches, racking up 61 major titles and her remarkable grand slam of 1970.
Yet for all that, even before this week’s detour into tabloid ignominy, or the near-identical imbroglio of 2012, Court was, in her own words, “an anonymous champion” and a little-loved one. “I don’t think the younger people today really know what I have done,” she told Steve Flink in 2012. “Personally it doesn’t affect me. It is probably a bit sad for the history of the game.”
To provide context for Court’s most lurid and provocative statements in the past three decades generally, and the last week particularly, one might start by perusing any of her three colourful autobiographies, published in 1965, 1975 and 2016, or Barbara Oldfield’s 1993 effort A Winning Faith: the Margaret Court Story – unique in the realm of Australian sports biographies for being written by an individual who claimed to have experienced religious salvation at the healing hands of her subject.
If there is a common theme within the Court literary oeuvre, it’s the stubborn immovability of her opinions. Another is how acutely aware she has always been of the impact of her words.
In Court’s latest book, during a passage in which she outlines her strident opposition to same-sex marriage, she also makes clear how well she understands the interplay between the interests of journalists eager for a contentious, click-baiting quote, and her own in promoting her ministry. “It is undeniable I was – am – good copy,” Court writes.
And then this, on the calculated provocations of 2011, which led to the first calls for Margaret Court Arena to be renamed: “My statement was akin to pulling the pin on a hand grenade and throwing it into a crowded room.”
One of the most astute observations made in the wake of Court’s most recent dive-bomb into public debate was by the cricket writer and high profile transgender Australian Cate McGregor, when the latter pointed to Court’s flair for publicity. “The pile-on last week strategically helped her,” McGregor told the ABC’s The Drum, “It gave prominence to her views and it rendered her a victim. You can kick us (the LGBTI community) to death to the applause of the mainstream media and ramp up solicitations for money, as I saw her acolytes doing on Christian radio the other day, and it’s frankly sick-making.”
Right now, smack bang in the middle of the website for Court’s Victory Life Centre, above even Court’s photo and biography, is a link to donate. In her latest book, Court claims a member of her congregation once handed her a cheque for $237,000. In another anecdote, a visiting American pastor promises a $50,000 donation in order to solicit smaller $1,000 donations from members of the congregation, enough in that instance for the deposit on a new property. No one knows the precise size of the market for Court’s wares, but it certainly exists.
Court’s overt displays of faith shaped her enduring post-1970s status as an unloved champion of Australian sport, always a determinedly secular field.
Standing out in newspaper and magazine profiles of Court in the latter stages of her playing career are colourful accounts of her spiritual awakening – all arched gates, Jesuit monasteries and electric shocks through the fingertips (“I knew I had the gift of healing”). An Australian world champion who speaks in tongues? “Only a strong minded-woman would risk the jibes that these declarations are likely to attract,” was the verdict of Tennis magazine in 1976. The same year, Kooyong tennis club removed Court’s framed picture from its gallery of world stars. The die was set: even standing in the winner’s circle, Margaret Court was an outsider.
It was in 1979 – in the scripture of 2 Timothy 1:7 – that Court found the personal salvation she says she had ached for, and a cure to the physical and emotional ailments that made a misery of her post-playing life. “For God hath not given me the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love and of a sound mind...” For a time, those were the only words Court could commit to memory. As born-again Christian tales go, it was almost too great a cliche.
A central tenet of Court’s particular brand of faith is living by a quite literal interpretation of, in her words, “the Word of God”. “I believe implicitly in what the Bible tells me,” Court said in 2016. “I do not cherry pick to be popular. God has made his feelings clear, and they are my feelings, too.”
Overlooked during her current evisceration in the court of public opinion, and in Court’s cries of injustice and persecution, is the fact that for a purveyor of such divisive opinions she has actually had a charmed run. In 1970, Court kicked things off by praising South Africa’s apartheid policy (“South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America,” she said. “I love South Africa. I’ll go back there any time.”), for which she received very little lasting scrutiny.
Her 1990 comments about Martina Navratilova (“a great player but I’d like someone at the top who the younger players can look up to. It’s very sad for children to be exposed to homosexuality. Martina is a nice person. Her life has just gone astray”), and her suggestion that lesbians were ruining tennis, drew international attention, but never went close to defining her image in Australia.
Court’s most fascinating battles on and off court have been with King, disparaged in 1975’s Court on Court as a bad sport whose outspoken feminism and public revelations about an abortion diminished her greatly in Court’s estimation. Yet when Melbourne Park’s centre court was renamed the Rod Laver Arena in 2002, it was King who argued that it should have been Court’s name on the rafters instead.
It was also King who stepped in to defend Court during the 2012 imbroglio, again amid calls to rename the arena. “Get rid of her for that?” King said. “Because you don’t agree with her? Are you kidding? Please. She deserves it. She’s a great player.”
A great player, yes, but for better or worse, Court is now the principal architect of her own image. “All my life I’ve believed you must tell the truth,” Court said last year. “Hold on to your beliefs, no matter how unpopular, no matter if saying your piece is going to get you in trouble.”
The preening Portuguese meets the immovable Italian. Cristiano Ronaldo will lead Real Madrid’s breathtaking attacking force in their attempt to crack Juventus’s sublime defensive unit marshalled by Gianluigi Buffon. Massimiliano Allegri will see Madrid’s defence as inferior to his own and Paulo Dybala as the man to exploit any frailty. Zinedine Zidane’s side can become the first to win back-to-back Champions League titles while Juventus can complete a historic Serie A, Coppa Italia and European treble. An enthralling encounter beckons. Graham Searles

Beer sales were just a little brisker than typical on the 7.43 out of Euston on Friday morning, but then it wasn’t carrying your usual commuter crowd. There were a few hundred expat cricket fans on board, making the early run up to Birmingham for the Trans-Tasman derby between Australia and New Zealand at Edgbaston. As the train left Coventry the announcer reassured them all that, if they were quick, they had time for one more round before they reached New Street. Which set the day up perfectly. Because in between all the longueurs while the showers blew over, carrying fat cold raindrops, everything in the match happened in a hurry. It was all about time, who had it, and how they used it. With so many quick bowlers playing, there was precious little of it to go around.
It’s a hard road, Edgbaston, for Australia’s fast bowlers. It’s been 16 years since the team last won a game here, back in the 2001 Ashes. Since then, a lot of quick men have taken a lot of hard knocks at the ground. In the 2004 Champions Trophy, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee were rattled by Marcus Trescothick and Michael Vaughan, the first little inkling that the 2005 Ashes was going to be a very different sort of series to the ones just before it.
In 2010 Australia played a couple of T20s against Pakistan, and Dirk Nannes, Mitchell Johnson, and Shaun Tait were thrashed around by Umar Akmal. And then, in 2013, Mitchell Starc had one of the worst days of his career here, giving up 75 runs in 10 overs against Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott.
Starc is the only member of that particular attack who is back again this time – senior man, now, in a gang of four, along with James Pattinson, Pat Cummins, and Josh Hazlewood. In theory, the finest, fastest, and most exciting bowling attack in the sport at the moment. Though like their predecessors, they struggled here.
Australia haven’t actually managed to get them all into the same team, largely because Cummins and Pattinson have both had so many injuries over the years. And we’re still waiting for them to make their debut as a supergroup now, since Pattinson was left out against New Zealand, to make room for burly, bald John Hastings, the Pete Best of the band.
Not that Pattinson’s omission was all that reassuring for the rest of us. He has taken 20 wickets at 11 runs each in the county championship so far this season, another 11 at 28 in the Royal London Cup, and he still cannot get in the team. All cricket is improved by quick bowling. But, fun as the spectacle was for the neutrals at the ground, they wouldn’t have had to think too far ahead to start fretting about what those four fast bowlers might do to England if they stay fit, in their group match here next Saturday, and, of course, in the Ashes series beyond it, looming into view at the far end of the year.
“You can prepare for the storm by latching the windows and sandbagging the doors,” Jacques Kallis once said when he was talking about what it was like to face Mitchell Johnson, “but when the rain comes, it’s still a surprise.” New Zealand weren’t looking to lay down defences. Their openers, Luke Ronchi and Martin Guptill, decided the best thing to do was counterattack. Starc started fast, and full and straight, while Hazlewood opened at the other end. Only, the white ball just wouldn’t swing for either of them. Guptill went straight into business, hit five glorious fours before he misjudged a shot, and was too early on a delivery from Hazlewood and hit a leading edge to point.
Ronchi decided to heave his bat at everything in reach. He would hit an exquisite shot one minute, and a ridiculous one the next. He took a shine to Cummings, who came on as first change in the seventh over.
A six over cover, struck with what seemed to be the slightest tap of the bat, was the shot of the day. One moment he was stepping back to leg to uppercut a six over point, the next coming across inside the line to steer four over the keeper’s head. When he was dropped at mid-on off Starc, he followed up by hitting the same shot again, only this time a little harder and higher, for a four. Cummins gave up 52 runs in his first five overs.
Meanwhile, Kane Williamson was easing into a masterly innings, one which would end, two hours later, with a score of exactly 100. Guptill and Ronchi were in a rush, playing at the limit of their capabilities. But Williamson, like all great batsmen, all great athletes, simply seemed to have more time to play with than everyone else, as if he experienced everything in slower motion than his team-mates, and had, somehow, a different perception of time, one that allowed him to wait ever-so-late to play his cuts, or stride forward to pull off his front foot. When he went, everything snapped back into real time again, and you were reminded just how quick these Australians are. Hazlewood swept through the New Zealand team, and finished with six for 52.
A full list of 2020 Tokyo Olympics medal events will be finalized by the IOC executive board next week, one month ahead of schedule.
Among more than 60 proposals, 3-on-3 basketball is an expected favorite after all were analyzed by an International Olympic Committee advisory panel.
The decision is due on Friday at a board meeting in Lausanne called at short notice to discuss awarding the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games hosting rights to Los Angeles and Paris at the same time later this year.
“Now that we have an (executive board) meeting on June 9 it makes sense to use this opportunity,” the IOC said on Friday. “In addition, an early decision is clearly beneficial to all the parties involved.”
The half-court basketball format – close in spirit to neighborhood park pick-up games – once seemed set for the 2016 Olympics. Its bid for inclusion was curbed when organizers in Rio de Janeiro were stretched preparing for just the regular program.
Now, FIBA believes men’s and women’s tournaments in 3-on-3 are even better suited after skateboarding and sport climbing joined the Tokyo lineup last year.
“Now there is an urban cluster that has been created,” Fiba secretary general Patrick Baumann told the Associated Press. “The best urban team sport is 3-on-3 street basketball. It would certainly be a perfect fit.”
Still, don’t expect two-time Olympic gold medalist LeBron James to seek a third title in the three-a-side game which already has a global tournament circuit.
“That’s probably a nice dream to have,” Baumann said in a recent interview, adding: “Our objective is to have similar and fantastic stars that come out of 3-on-3.”
Baumann singled out the famed Rucker Park street court in Harlem, New York, when expressing hope “to see them in the Olympic Games two years down the road.”
Adjusting from the NBA game would also be tough, he said: “It’s a different skill set. It’s really a 10-minute sprint, no coach, so you need to take the right decisions.”
Adding 3-on-3 tournaments should add 96 athletes to basketball’s quota for the 2020 Olympics, a key test for the proposals next week.
The IOC wants to better appeal to young audiences and promote gender equality, but also stay within the limits of around 310 medal events and 11,000 athletes who must have housing and training venues.
Some proposals are for mixed gender team events and relays – an IOC favorite – using the existing pool of athletes.
Canoeing, rowing, and shooting federations would drop some men’s events to add more for women.
Cycling wants to bolster its track program which was moved to a velodrome in Izu, about 130km (80 miles) outside Tokyo.
By setting the Tokyo lineup earlier, the IOC also clears a long-scheduled 9-10 July board meeting in Lausanne to focus more on the expected dual hosting award.
Paris seems favored to get the 2024 Olympics, with Los Angeles striking a deal to wait until 2028.
Steve Smith did not mince his words after Australia’s Champions Trophy opener with New Zealand ended in a rain-ruined no result, tearing into his bowlers for an “ordinary” display and admitting the weather in Birmingham had seen his side “get away with one”.
Smith’s world champions were certainly wobbling when a third spell of rain at 5.55pm saw this Group A encounter finally ended, with their pursuit of an adjusted target of 235 from 33 overs sitting at 53 for three by the end of the ninth after Trent Boult’s removal of David Warner was followed up by a two-wicket burst from the pacy Adam Milne.
Kane Williamson’s classical 100 from 97 balls had earlier steered New Zealand to 291 all out in 45 overs after winning the toss. It was a total the Australian captain put down to an errant start from his seamers and one that could have been worse were it not for Josh Hazelwood’s career-best six for 52 – a haul that owed much to his opponents swinging late on.
“That was one our worst bowling displays for a long time,” said Smith. “We bowled both sides of the wicket and it was pretty ordinary. Let’s hope it’s rust and it’s gone. Kane timed his innings beautifully but the bowling is something we need to look at.”
Asked for his feelings when, with eight to his name the players left the field for the final time, Smith replied: “We still had some batters in the shed but I would have preferred to have been in New Zealand’s position at the end. We had work to do and a quality bowling attack against us, so we perhaps got away with one there.”
The point apiece plays into the hands of England, who after the eight-wicket win over Bangladesh at The Oval now need just one victory from their remaining two fixtures against the pair to seal a semi-final spot, starting against New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday.
It perhaps was a sign of the times that when New Zealand’s innings ended with a record total against their trans-Tasman rivals in a global tournament, it still felt an underwhelming one, ending in a cascade of wickets and an over unused of their allotted 46 as they lost six for 37 runs in 35 balls of picking out men in the deep.
Luke Ronchi’s happy-go-lucky 65 from just 33 balls – including two audacious lifted sixes in an assault on Pat Cummins – and a ninth one-day hundred from Williamson had given the lower order the license to swing. But with New Zealand sitting pretty on 254 for three at the start of the 40th over, something far grander had looked possible.
Australia bounded into the interval feeling better themselves, following what had been a shabby display in the field at times and one that delighted the Edgbaston crowd.
While Glenn Maxwell shone with four catches, Ronchi earned lives on 24 and 54 thanks to a bungled run out by Matthew Wade behind the stumps and a dropped catch by Mitchell Starc.
Starc, who saw the ball after his error at mid on fly over his head for four, was one of the bowlers that Smith had referred to as rusty – a fitting description for the left-armer’s nine overs, none for 52 in which the white ball did not swing and New Zealand’s batsmen went untroubled.
Starc’s lack of edge can be put down to his near three-month break following a stress fracture to the foot and his decision to miss the Indian Premier League. Australia still chose to hold back their most well-tuned seamer, James Pattinson, after his explosive spell at Nottinghamshire, preferring the worthy but less hostile John Hastings instead.
Hastings picked up two wickets but was the bowler Williamson tucked into the most, with the 25 balls he sent down to the right-armer taken for 42 runs in a blitz of crisp cuts and mown slog sweeps on his way to three-figures. Having put on 77 with Ronchi and 99 with Ross Taylor (46), Williamson perished the ball after his century when run out after a steer to point.
From there it all went the way of Hazlewood who, having earlier removed Martin Guptill for 16 by going cross-seam early, profited from New Zealand’s lower order trying to swing for the hills without giving themselves a sighter first. Boult at No11 was his one classical wicket – caught behind to make it three in four balls at the end – as he became just the second bowler in the history of the Champions Trophy to take six.
Boult began New Zealand’s surge with the ball after a rain-extended interval, as Warner feathered behind attempting an uppercut on 18 in the fifth over. The pace of Milne then saw Aaron Finch chip to short mid-wicket and Moises Henriques offer a simple caught and bowled. Australia were suddenly up against it. But no sooner had that last wicket fallen, the rain came again and with it, ended what was set to be a compelling contest.
James Whitaker, the England chairman of selectors, came here hoping Haseeb Hameed could arrest his concerning slump in form. Instead, he was treated to a wonderful display from the Yorkshire seamer Ben Coad, whose second ball had Hameed caught behind for nine. Coad ended up with a career-best six for 25, his fourth five-wicket haul of a remarkable season, as Lancashire were bundled out for 123.
Yorkshire had a dreamy day overall. They lost the toss and were (curiously) invited to field, lost the entire first session to rain and now trail by only 30 at 93 for two after a day that lost 24 overs. Until Peter Handscomb slashed at a wide one from Luke Procter, he had shared 64 with Adam Lyth against a rather thrown together Lancashire attack (there is optimism, though, over the fitness of James Anderson). Alex Lees had played an ugly innings brimming with heaves, but his falling to Tom Bailey – and the accompanying send-off, from bowler and crowd – proved a mere footnote. It is worth wondering how the impending arrival of Tom Kohler-Cadmore will impact Lees.
Coad should play for England Lions this summer and is a bowler with Test potential. He gets movement both ways and has a smooth, strong action – he believes he has put on pace – which has delivered more first-class wickets than anyone else this summer, and the joint most in Division One – 29 (at 13.8), with Kyle Abbott. It is greatly encouraging that even now he has been relegated from the new ball, with Ryan Sidebottom – who took three wickets of his own – and Jack Brooks reunited, trees are still being pulled up. There were plenty more wickets than bad balls.
By the time Coad came on, Sidebottom had taken two wickets in two balls. Alex Davies fenced to gully, then Luke Procter was caught behind leaving. He found a beauty to do for Hameed, but it is concerning that, for the first time, the locality of his off-stump appears to be vexing him. Coad began his third over by trapping Steven Croft in front and ended it having Shiv Chanderpaul caught at fourth slip; his next saw Dane Vilas caught behind.
Ryan McLaren counterattacked but, after Brooks returned to pin Jordan Clark in front, Sidebottom took him lbw. Lancashire were eight down at tea and Coad did for the tail afterwards, with Bailey poking to midwicket and Stephen Parry to second slip.
“We were a bit surprised that they batted and it was very helpful for seamers with it swinging around and seaming. It’s been a great day” said Coad, who rated this his best performance of the season. “We couldn’t have asked for anything more.”
Just 48.4 overs were possible because of light and rain at Lord’s, where Middlesex reduced Somerset to 80 for five only for Dean Elgar (77) and Lewis Gregory to double the score with an unbroken stand of 81. At the Ageas Bowl, Warwickshire enjoyed early success, reducing Hampshire to 31 for three, with two wickets for Keith Barker and one for the returning Boyd Rankin. Hampshire fought back through two old stagers, Jimmy Adams and Sean Ervine, reaching stumps at 294 without further loss, with both men making hundreds.
In Division Two the leaders, Nottinghamshire, were bowled out for 229 by winless Derbyshire with Steven Mullaney making 76. Without any of Stuart Broad, James Pattinson or Jake Ball for the first time this season, Notts must bowl smartly to pull off a win. At Hove, Sussex (captained by Chris Nash, who replaced Luke Wright) enjoyed a very strong day against Worcestershire, who left out Kohler-Cadmore, posting 339 for three with Luke Wells unbeaten on 139. At Chester-le-Street, Durham had Northamptonshire 59 for three at stumps after being bowled out for 166. Nathan Buck took six for 34.
The match between the defending champion, Garbiñe Muguruza, and the home favourite, Kristina Mladenovic, on Sunday will surely put a light under the women’s draw in the absence of the game’s biggest names, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, as well as the recently defeated world No1, Angelique Kerber.
If Mladenovic were to beat Muguruza, Roland Garros could hardly rise to greet her more enthusiastically than they did after two hours and 48 minutes of drama on Court Suzanne Lenglen on Friday, when Mladenovic recovered from 2-5 down in the third set to beat the American Shelby Rogers, 7-5, 4-6, 8-6.
The world No14 said: “That was epic. I still don’t know how I won. Shelby was playing great tennis. She played quarter-finals here last year and has a great game for clay. She really pushed me to the last breath I had.”
Muguruza, who has not hit the form she showed here a year ago, had a lesser struggle against the 27th seed Yulia Putintseva, taking an hour and 40 minutes to win 7-5, 6-2.
“The more matches I play and the tougher victories, I think they give you self-confidence,” Muguruza said. “The three matches I have played have not been easy at all. I’m happy I went out there without fear.”
She has a little more to be wary of against Mladenovic in the fourth round, as she realises. “Mladenovic is having a good year. She’s won a lot of matches. She’s at home,” she said.
The tall, powerful Spaniard admitted she struggles to keep thoughts of last year’s triumph at bay. “I remember last year when I was in the semi-finals I was thinking, like, I’m 25% [towards] lifting the trophy. That’s when I started to think about it. This year, I’m just focusing on my next opponent.”
Her next opponent will no doubt be similarly attentive to her homework and keen to avoid the sort of energy-draining angst that flooded on to her racket before a quite stirring fightback.
“I think it’s going to be also tough for her,” Mladenovic said. “It’s such a nice head to head coming up for everybody: for the tournament, for the crowd, for us. She’s obviously playing great tennis. I’m looking forward to this one.”
Acknowledging she enjoyed the excitement generated by the crowd, she said, “It’s true that, emotionally, it is all quite high at the moment but it’s something I like. It’s something I’m prepared for. It’s not my first time having so many high emotions, big wins, big moments.”
Novak Djokovic’s partnership with Andre Agassi has come under serious early pressure in the first week of the French Open. It might not see out the summer.
The defending champion remains on track for a semi-final against the tournament’s perennial prince, Rafael Nadal, but there are cracks showing in his fledgling coaching relationship with Agassi, who missed the first hour of his gruelling five-set struggle against the tough Argentinian Diego Schwartzman in the third round because of commitments with French television.
Asked what he thought of Agassi arriving in his box at 3-4 in the second set, Djokovic said: “He was not supposed to be here today, because we finished yesterday with our in-person collaboration here in Paris. He had many different things that he was supposed to do. He’s doing that. He managed to reschedule certain things and show up today, which was not planned. I appreciate that.”
Further asked about Agassi’s earlier statement on Eurosport that he was doing the gig for nothing, Djokovic said: “I’m not going to get into that but everything he said is completely true, so it’s completely his decision. I hope that’s going to stay for a long time that we can create something that is going to go long term. We don’t have anything set in stone. We had a great chat after the match. He’s going to try his best to be in the biggest tournaments with me as much as his family time allows and all the commitments that he has.”
Agassi had already told Djokovic that, after he is done here, he must leave to fulfil earlier commitments, possibly after his next match, against Albert Ramos-Viñolas, who beat Lucas Pouille, 6-2, 3-6, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 in fading light.
In an interview on Eurosport with Boris Becker, who guided the Serb to six of his 12 major victories before they ended their three-year relationship last December, Agassi revealed he was working at Roland Garros “on my own time, on my own dime, my own money”. No doubt his link with the tournament sponsors, Longines, will ease the financial burden of spending a week in Paris.
“I don’t want anything, I don’t need anything, I want to help him,” he said. Djokovic needed all the help he could get quelling Schwartzman’s determined challenge over three hours and 19 minutes.
There is something awry with the world No2’s tennis again, after a few encouraging weeks lately. There were some rough moments, none more awkward than at break point on his own serve, 4-0 up in the fourth. Djokovic received a time warning, then a code violation. He was not putting a lot of love the umpire’s way during a 5-7, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 win.
Agassi revealed a little of his tennis philosophy and how he might persuade Djokovic to switch from lights-out attack to more thoughtful ways of breaking opponents down.
“For me it’s simple. His game is built on controlling the baseline and executing to big targets. He’s not a guy that plays precisely to the lines. Occasionally if he’s on the defence he surprises you with this. He’s a guy that throws body blow after body blow after body blow and he’s just never thought a lot about the other side of the court. So I think there’s ways he can take his game at 30 years old – and older because hopefully he’s going to still want to play for a while – and he can start to make it easier for himself by knowing what to do across the net.”
He sounded equivocal about working with Djokovic at Wimbledon. “If he wants me there, I will come and figure it out. It is a lot of responsibility. Whatever is practical and achievable, 100% I will make the effort. I committed to him that, as long as he feels like I can help him, I will. Does he really need me somewhere in particular, does he need me in a week off, does he need me in a grand slam? We will figure this out as we go. A 100% I am committed to seeing him achieve what his dream is.”
Nadal spent probably as much time arranging his courtside water bottles as he did constructing 27 clear winners among 82 points to beat Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-0, 6-1, 6-0. The Georgian, who last year lost to Kyle Edmund in the first round, went downhill faster than Franz Klammer.
At the end patrons were treated to the rare spectacle of Nadal abandoning his hair-tugging, ball-bouncing rituals as he served out the match like a man with his pants on fire just as the first of the intermittent rain dumped on Court Philippe Chatrier. “Today was one of the best matches I have ever played, without a doubt,” Nadal said later.
If he and Djokovic do clash for a place in the final, the odds would be with the Spaniard, who has won 20 of 21 matches on clay this season. This was his 100th best-of-five match on his favourite surface. Only Robin Soderling here in 2009 and Djokovic two years ago have prevailed against him, a phenomenal record.
Before the quarter-finals Nadal will celebrate his 31st birthday on Saturday then, if all goes well, follow it with a win over his compatriot, Roberto Bautista Agut, who beat Jiri Vesely 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.
Portsmouth have appointed Kenny Jackett as their new manager. The 55-year-old has signed a two-year deal with the newly promoted Sky Bet League One club, two days after Paul Cook quit to take charge of Wigan.
“This is a fantastic opportunity for me and I’m looking forward to getting started. It’s an exciting challenge,” Jackett told Pompey’s official website.
“This club has a passionate fanbase and they can be a 12th man for us. Hopefully we can build on the momentum of last season and continue to progress.
“I can promise that I’ll work as hard as I possibly can to make sure that we can bring success to Portsmouth.”
The club said they were “in advanced talks” with Joe Gallen about him becoming assistant manager.
Jackett, who has won promotion from League One with both Millwall and Wolves, had been out of work since resigning as Rotherham manager in November.
Cook left Fratton Park on Wednesday after guiding Pompey to the League Two title with victory over Cheltenham on the final day.
“We’re delighted to announce Kenny as our new manager. He ticks so many boxes for us,” Pompey’s chief executive, Mark Catlin, said. “He’s managed big clubs with big expectations in the past and has plenty of experience of getting sides out of League One.”

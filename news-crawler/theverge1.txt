Dear Silicon Valley,
I need your expertise. Can you find my refrigerator?
Maybe it’s you, Amazon, with your visionary fleet of robotic drones? Or perhaps Uber, will you begin to operate as a problem solver rather than a problem child? Or Apple, maybe you can build a find-my-fridge app. New York City — and maybe all cities — needs a smart delivery service to help save local businesses from themselves.
The refrigerator I ordered is somewhere in a delivery truck in the tri-state area. Don’t ask me where because there’s no way to track it. I spent an entire work day waiting in vain for my appliances, including a medium-grade 30-inch Whirlpool bottom-freezer fridge with accu-chill that never came. And when I called the third online customer service rep at PC Richard, the local seller that advertises “honesty, integrity, and reliability” to determine why I received no call, no text, no knock on the door between the hours from 7:45AM and 11:45AM (my original delivery window), I was told they had tried to reach me on my phone before running off with the refrigerator.
My refrigerator is running — this is not a crank call.
I was assured that the PC Richard’s delivery man would return in two hours to install my fridge. I left a series of additional contact numbers with the “online” customer representative, but was told that I would have no direct access to the delivery driver. Expecting the worst, I called the toll-free number again an hour later to confirm his whereabouts and was placed on a lengthy hold for 30 minutes, until I was finally told that PC Richard delivery was done with deliveries for the day. It was only 1:30PM.
I have been told that the future will be lived in cities. But navigating logistics in the city where I live, New York City, can break you. Its imperfections remind me that we’re still not living in the future. It begins at the gateway, the notoriously inefficient Laguardia Airport, the choked-up trail of cars at the Holland Tunnel, and the delayed subway trains. It continues to the long lines at Trader Joe’s on a random Monday night. This place is like Level 3 autonomous driving in a blender: a giant ball of double-parked, semi-automatic customer disservice.
In the old days of mom and pop stores, I could have gone into the store and talked to Joe, the refrigerator salesman, whose nephew was probably also the delivery guy. Or if I had purchased from Amazon, like I do for more and more of my shopping these days, I’d have a clear path of escalation and could have at least tracked my refrigerator’s whereabouts. But here I found myself in the awkward middle ground, caught between an online service department and outsourced delivery service united only by their ability to disappoint me. I was a faceless voice on a phone with no clear course of escalation.
We are in a surreal moment of semi-automation. A local company can appear to be modern by selling goods on its website, but is unable to meet the baseline expectations of modern order fulfillment set by the internet giants. My only recourse was to call, call, call, again, and hold, hold, hold.
I explained my frustration to the fourth online customer service soldier whose job is to field calls from indignant customers like me. “How about we knock that refrigerator price down?” he said. “The only thing that’s going to make you happy is we deliver today, and that’s not going to happen.”
Is this rant nothing more than a one-star review? No it’s a real plea: help me find the proverbial refrigerator, along with a way for companies to better organize their automated procedures. I could have ordered my appliances from Amazon Prime, but I want local businesses to thrive. But to do so, they require modern logistical support. Otherwise New York City, like much of America, will just become another Walmart, USA.
Sincerely,
Tamara

Microsoft unveiled a radical redesign for Skype earlier this month, with a new look that has Snapchat-like features. While the company has overhauled its Skype apps, there’s also a new Skype logo that ditches the fluffy cloud aspects of the past. Brand New has a closer look at the new logo, and a comparison to the old one that everyone knows.
Skype has been using part of this logo for a while, but it appears the broader word mark is now moving to Microsoft’s corporate typeface. It’s much more consistent with Microsoft’s other software and services like Office, and likely reflects the company’s move to position Skype as business communications software.
Microsoft's latest Skype update includes a new Highlights feature that lets users share daily stories to a news feed. It also includes emoji responses for video calls, and a much bigger focus on text-based conversations. The new Skype design is available on Android immediately, and Microsoft is planning to refresh its Windows and iOS apps soon.
Smartphones have fast become the new frontier of artificial intelligence. Algorithms that used to run in the cloud, beaming results down to our devices via the internet, are now being replaced by software that runs directly on phones and tablets. Facebook is doing it, Apple is doing it, and Google is (perhaps) doing it slightly more than anyone else.
The latest example of mobile AI from the Silicon Valley search giant is the release of MobileNets, a set of machine vision neural networks designed to run directly on mobile devices. The networks come in a variety of sizes to fit all sort of devices (bigger neural nets for more powerful processors) and can be trained to tackle a number of tasks.
MobileNets can be used to analyze faces, detect common objects, geolocate photos, and perform fine-grained recognition tasks, like identifying different species of dogs. These tools are extremely adaptable, and could be put to a number of different uses, including powering augmented reality features, or creating apps to help the disabled. Google says the performance of each neural net differs from task to task, but overall, its networks either meet or approach recent state-of-the-art standards.
For consumers, this is going to mean more mobile apps with AI functions as developers start incorporating these tools. Running these sort of tasks directly on-device has a number of benefits for everyday users, including faster performance, greater convenience (you don’t have to connect to the internet), and better privacy (your data isn’t being sent off-device).
Apple pushed the latter angle particular when it released a set of machine learning APIs for developers (named CoreML) earlier this month, and both Facebook and Google have created their own frameworks for building mobile-first. Even Snapchat is working on putting image recognition on your phone, releasing its first academic paper on the subject this week. The next step for mobile AI? Specially designed mobile processors. Both Google and Apple have dropped hints they might be crafting such silicon, and ARM has already released a first early batch.
Microsoft is finally bringing its full version of Office to the Windows Store today. To coincide with the release of the new Surface Laptop running Windows 10 S, Microsoft Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, and Publisher will all be available in the Store. While Microsoft previously listed Office in the Store, this is the first time the company will let you download it and update the apps directly from the Windows Store.
The addition of Office is all part of Microsoft’s new push to convince developers to migrate their desktop apps to the Windows Store. After failing to convince developers to build new universal apps for Windows 8 and Windows 8, Microsoft now hopes its Centennial Desktop Bridge tool will help developers move traditional apps to the Windows Store. Surface Laptop owners and anyone with a new machine running Windows 10 S will have to download this version of Office, as 10 S is restricted to apps from the Windows Store.
In a support article, spotted by Twitter user WalkingCat, Microsoft notes there are some limitations on this Office version for the Windows Store. You’ll only be able to install 32-bit versions of Office, and COM add-ins are not supported. Microsoft isn’t including a OneNote desktop app in the Windows Store, but the existing UWP app will be installed instead. Windows 10 S users can still use the existing Office mobile apps, and Microsoft is placing its install and update process for Office in the Windows Store in preview until it’s fully tested.
If AI and robots are going to take our jobs, at least they can do it in the most relaxing way possible. Just like Shimon here — a four-armed marimba-playing robot designed by George Tech’s music technology center. Sure, Shimon is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to AI making music, but just listen to those jazz-fusion vibes.
Like many AI music experiments, the music Shimon is playing is generated by a method called deep learning. This essentially means mining a large amount of information (in this case, a dataset of some 5,000 songs) and looking for common patterns in the music. For example, if you have a sequence of notes F, G, A, what note will follow next? Deep learning will give you a good answer.
Shimon the robot has been around for a while now, playing alongside human musicians using preprogrammed songs. But now, it’s being used to play original compositions. The video above shows the first melody Shimon ever created, while the one below is melody number two — a slightly faster number:
As we’ve seen with previous experiments, the actual musical output is a bit avant-garde. Researchers working in this field say this is because the deep learning systems we use to analyze music tend not to be so good at thinking about long-term structure. They analyze the music in short bursts, and the resulting melodies sound quite abstract. It is possible to program in artificial constraints so the programs will produce songs with traditional verse-chorus structures, but at that point it’s not really AI-created music, but AI-human collaboration.
So, although the marimba is a particularly non-threatening instrument, the melody itself is proof that machines have a way to go. For more information on Shimon, check out this interview with its teachers, Gil Weinberg and Mason Bretan, over at IEEE Spectrum.
Hori is a well-respected Japanese video game accessory maker that’s been pumping out solid fighting sticks, gamepads, and screen protectors for pretty much as long as such things have existed. But I’m sorry, Hori, your new officially licensed Nintendo Switch keyboard is a deeply pointless product, and I’m here to suggest some improvements.
To be clear, a Nintendo Switch keyboard isn’t altogether a bad idea — at least not in Japan, where popular MMO Dragon Quest X is coming out soon. It’s just that this one has some... issues.
It’s not like no Japanese accessory maker has ever created an incredible keyboard for a Nintendo console before. This useless Hori effort made me think of ASCII’s awesome Gamecube controller keyboard, designed for Phantasy Star Online:
Just look at it! Now that’s a Nintendo keyboard. And with the Switch’s detachable Joy-Cons, you wouldn’t even have to make a full controller — just a keyboard with the rails for the Joy-Cons to slot into.
Like so:
Isn’t that better? I’m sure Hori could work with Nintendo to allow wireless input, or just include a wireless USB-A adapter for the dock. Throw a USB-C port on the keyboard itself and you could even get rid of the need for Nintendo’s really-should’ve-been-in-the-box Joy-Con Charging Grip, too.
But why stop there? This solution would still only work with the Switch in TV mode, robbing the system of its biggest selling point: versatility. What about those who want to play Dragon Quest X at Starbucks?
I think I have the answer. Lots of people use split keyboards for ergonomic reasons, and there are even gaming-focused models like this one from Kinesis. Inspired by that, and a suggestion from my colleague Rich, I’ve come up with the ultimate Switch peripheral:
Who wouldn’t want such a thing?
“Everyone in the world except like 17 people,” you say?
Okay, well, maybe. But dare to dream a little. It’d certainly bring more happiness to society than Hori’s actual Switch keyboard.
Which is coming out in Japan this September, in case you’re interested.
Amazon has released the Dash Wand, a new Alexa-enabled device that can help you scan grocery barcodes, convert measurements, and order household essentials from Amazon just by using your voice. The Wi-Fi-enabled Dash Wand is magnetic, so you can stick it on your fridge, and also offers some of the features of its bigger Echo sibling, allowing you to find recipes and restaurants without using your hands.
At a few inches long, and made out of white and black plastic, the Dash Wand looks like a refreshed version of the company’s original Dash devices. First released in 2014, those Dash also let you scan item barcodes or use voice controls to add products to your shopping cart, but forced you to check out via Amazon’s site. They also had no Alexa access — Amazon’s assistant wasn’t available to the public then — and were only available to a limited number of existing AmazonFresh users. A second-generation version cost $49.99 and could add anything on Amazon to a shopping cart, but users still had to check out manually.
The Dash Wand, on the other hand, lets you buy items directly, and is now available to all Amazon Prime subscribers in the United States. It’s priced at $20, but Amazon Prime subscribers who do pick one up will receive $20 back in their Amazon accounts, making the Dash Wand essentially a free purchase. Customers will theoretically then use that returned cash to buy things using their new Dash Wand, picking up paper towels, soap, and other household essentials by asking the device to order each one, rather than needing a more expensive Echo or an individual Dash button for each product. Buyers will also get a free 90-day trial of the AmazonFresh home grocery service.
Happy birthday to the GIF! The venerable file format turns 30 today, and Facebook is taking the opportunity to add a few GIF-related features to its service. Users could already post GIFs in status updates, but from June 15th, you’ll now be able to add GIFs in Facebook comments, allowing you to search through and select from a list of relevant files right there in the social network’s interface.
Facebook is also using the day to salute the surprisingly resilient format, throwing what it calls a “GIF party,” and offering statistics on its existing GIF usage. More than 13 billion GIFs were sent last year via Facebook Messenger, it says, after the company made the format usable on the chat service. The busiest day for GIFs was apparently January 1st this year, with more than 400 million sent, as hungover people across the globe let a short moving image do the legwork of expressing their friendship and love for them.
More worryingly, Facebook is also using the day to re-open the fractious debate about GIF pronunciation — hard or soft G — with a poll for US-based users. It’s a decision that may turn friend against friend and tarnish what should otherwise be a happy day, but we may finally work out what the people want, no matter what the format’s creator says.
A couple of weeks ago, District 9 and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp unveiled Oats Studios, his new project focusing on experimental short films. At the time, Blomkamp described the studio as an attempt to remain creative in a film industry that rewards endless sequels and franchises. Through Oats, he’ll be developing a range of potential projects, from serious science fiction to wackier concepts, with the hope that some of them may eventually make the leap to full-length feature films.
The first film from Oats Studios, Rakka, is now available for streaming on YouTube and Steam, and it depicts the aftermath of an alien invasion. The year is 2020, and aliens have enslaved humanity, and altering the Earth’s atmosphere. But Rakka isn’t a conventional short film. Instead, it’s a series of scenes depicting various points of view. Some scenes show what the aliens are doing to humanity; others track a resistance movement led by Sigourney Weaver, and an escaped prisoner named Amir. Later, in a climactic battle, resistance fighters shoot down an alien aircraft and track down its pilot.
On the eve of its release, I spoke with Blomkamp about his new film, the real-world inspirations, and the key to success for Oats Studios.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
This is the one of three projects Oats will be releasing in this initial volume of projects. Where did the story come from?
The original idea was to make make a science fiction piece that was about an occupying force in a foreign country, and it kind of grew around that. I always wanted to do a science fiction invasion piece that had direct parallels with an occupying force in a country, like the Germans in France, or Americans in Iraq. There's these levels of armed troops that are walking through neighborhoods, and well-built buildings, and local politicians have been turned or manipulated. There is a lot of stuff in there that I felt was really interesting, and to look at it from a different point of view is really cool. That's where the seed was from.
The narrator in the film says that in this environment, people have to do things that in peacetime would be really abhorrent, such as using a human being to bait a trap for the aliens. Is there another political parallel there that you were looking at?
No. There's a point at which I feel like you just start getting into character or pure sci-fi ideas. The same thing happened with District 9, where you started off with allegory, but there’s a certain point [when] it branches off, and as long as you’re not damaging the metaphor, then it's fine.
Some of that is just story or plot or character, and I think Nosh, [who proposes the bait idea], is so completely insane and nihilistic that what he's offering may tactically actually makes sense. But then in other times, it wouldn’t. That isn't necessarily a direct parallel with something related to war.
Tell me a little about the design in Rakka, because it feels quite a bit different from the other films that you've done.
The main idea that I like is that [the alien creatures] have this nanotech ferrofluid that changes shape. The aliens would have essentially come to earth in a lake. It forms whenever they need, and when they arrive at Earth, it probably split up into several pieces, with the different ships that formed out of it going to different continents and building the towers that they live in. They breathe a different atmosphere. If you look at the creature itself, it has this black hood on that also runs down the bridge of its nose. It's almost like a gas mask, but hooked directly into their nostrils. It just does whatever they need it to: it processes Earth's air into a mixture that they can breathe, it forms weapons, it forms the structures that they live in, it forms their vehicles. I just like the idea that [the fluid’s] always active, and it’s intelligent.
The aliens that we see in this piece, which we have dubbed the “Klum” aliens (rhymes with ‘plume’), are actually a sort of genetically cloned drone. They're not entirely sentient, and they're sent out by a far more intelligent species who we haven’t really seen yet.
There's a scene where a soldier sees something after his truck is blown up. Was that the superior alien species?
Yeah. They're floating around in the peripheral edges of our solar system, and they're visualizing what's happening on the Earth by proxy. They live inside some kind of quantum state back in their ship. They’re gathering any organism that they find that can help them think about how to survive the end of the universe. They know it's coming, and they don't want to die.
The Klum treat this species like a god. However, this intelligent species turned their back on them, but they didn’t do that to humans.
The character of Amir is an escaped prisoner. He's obviously been experimented on by the Klum. Can you tell me a little about him?
[The Gone World author] Thomas Sweterlitsch came up with this idea. The experimentation we see on Amir is the Klum trying to find out what this top-tier species sees in humanity: why are humans worthy of attention, but not the Klum? Amir wasn’t killed, and the experimentation gives him an eye into how the Klum see the world. I have ideas where his character goes, but we just have to see if the audience gets behind us in order for us to tell more of these stories.
So you see this as one small episode in a much larger story.
Yes. We don't know what form that story will take. Rakka feels like it could almost be more of an episodic thing, because there's a lot of avenues to explore. The footage is too unconventional and weird [for a mainstream feature], and the audience has to think of the footage as a snapshot into the window of this world.
It’s the same for the film we’re going to release in a couple of weeks. When the audience understands that this isn't the complete, final story, and they choose to get behind us financially, we can then figure out if this is an episodic thing, or if it’s one big feature film. There are other ideas that we have in Volume 1, and some that will be in Volume 2, that are explicitly feature films.
These stories aren’t pre-determined: they don't have to be HBO-style, 60-minute episodes. They can be multiple 20-minute pieces, you can have a five-minute window into a character with just one scene, or you can have a two-hour piece somewhere else.
It felt to me like you have the right amount of material for a future film with Rakka. You have the big set pieces that could then be connected with a much more complete story.
I've always thought of Rakka as much more in the camp of Star Trek or something, where you have a lot of interesting things to explore, rather than a movie. You could make a feature, but I think it's more interesting for it to be more of a long term, episodic format.
But if you had someone like 20th Century Fox come up and say that they wanted to do business, is that something you would be receptive to?
We would be receptive if our main goal failed. If you feel like you want to get behind it, go to Steam, buy the film instead of watching it for free. If you like what you see, the only way for us to make more is for you to give us cash to fuel the next round of stuff.
If that fails — which it probably stands a greater chance of failing than working — than a traditional approach to realizing some of the ideas is very much on the table. But it's not a goal. I could have just written Rakka, and went to Hollywood. I don't want to do that. I want to test this model and see if anyone in the world will get behind us.
Beyond Good & Evil 2 is dramatically different from the original — and that’s about all I can confidently say about the ambitious new game. First announced in 2008, Beyond Good & Evil 2 roared back to life this week at E3 with an explosive cinematic trailer that reintroduced players to Michel Ancel’s distinct and vibrant sci-fi universe. What the trailer didn’t show, however, was anything about how the game might play.
Not long after the reveal, Ancel and his team took me through a very early technical demonstration of the game. Where the original Beyond Good & Evil was a fairly straightforward third-person action adventure, its follow-up is something much larger and more complex. It combines elements of online worlds, early-access releases, role-playing games, and procedural generation. It’s also, admittedly, still pretty rough around the edges. Many of the game’s key elements — from graphics to combat to narrative — are still being implemented.
“There’s still a lot of work to do,” Ancel says, “but we now really believe that we’re going to make this game.”
But first, some clarification: while they bear the same name, this Beyond Good & Evil 2 and the one originally unveiled a decade ago are different games. Initially, the game was planned as a sequel, continuing the intrigue-laden story that turned the first Beyond Good & Evil into a beloved cult classic. Eventually, Ancel and his team at Ubisoft’s Montpellier studio decided to switch directions and create a prequel. The idea was to build an experience that could be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of whether or not they played the first game.
Three years ago they started working on the technology that would power the experience — it started out as a kind of solar system simulation tool — and only recently have they started actually building the game. “When you don’t have this technology, you can’t really start the game,” Ancel explains. “It’s too difficult. But now we can say for sure that we will make this game, we’ll finish it. Because we have the technology for it.” He describes the game’s current status as “day zero of development.”
Just what kind of game Beyond Good & Evil 2 will be is hard to pin down. It takes place in the same universe as the original, and is set a few generations before the events of that game. (Ancel insists “it’s not a reboot.”) Players will be able to create their own distinct in-game avatar, who will start on the bottom rung of society, before working their way up to become captain of a spaceship, complete with a crew. “Whatever character you choose, you will start at the very bottom of the social system,” Ancel says. “Maybe you’re delivering pizza. But one day you will have this gigantic spaceship.”
In a big shift from the first game, the prequel is structured like an RPG. You and your crew will develop new skills over time, and how you grow and change will reportedly depend on what you do and where you go. “You explore, you discover new cultures, those cultures are adapted to the planet, and then you can customize your ship based on what you discover on the planet,” Ancel explains.
Beyond Good & Evil 2 will be both a single-player experience and a co-operative online game, as Ancel says you’ll be able to play either by yourself or with friends. There’s also a shared world component, as certain in-universe events will happen for all players in the game. The worlds you’ll be exploring, Ancel explains, are a combination of hand-designed and procedurally generated. He describes it as “like a SimCity simulation.” Essentially, the developers have built all of the individual parts, as well as a logic system that puts them together in ways that make sense. This system allows them do things like fast-forward in time and instantaneously see how cities and planets will change over that span.
Similarly, the story itself appears to be something of a hybrid. Ancel explains that there is a specific narrative that will be told in the game, but that it will also include systemic events that happen based on what you do, the places you explore, and potentially the other players you interact with. “As developers, we can imagine that we will release other stories, other parts of the world,” he says. “We can expand it. But at the same time, we want to have that feeling of completion. ‘I’m going through a story and there’s a start, there’s an end.’ But you know how it is when you have online play — the real stories are going to come from people playing with each other.”
It all sounds incredibly ambitious, especially when you consider that Ancel also wants to treat Beyond Good & Evil 2 as something of an early access title, with a community of players offering feedback and testing early prototypes. The version of the game I saw, meanwhile, was still in a very early state. The graphics were mostly placeholder (Ancel says that “two weeks ago there were no graphics”) while aspects like combat and any kind of narrative aspect had yet to be implemented.
Instead, I was able to watch Ancel pilot a large ship that looked a bit like a flying submarine, around a rough version of the same city featured in the new trailer. According to Ancel, one of the pillars of the game is its sense of scale; the idea that you can explore places both huge and small. To demonstrate this, he flew his ship near a giant Ganesha statue that towered over the city, hopped out of his ship, and started walking around on the statue. Later on, he piloted his ship out of the atmosphere and into space; it reminded me a lot of the feeling in No Man’s Sky where you can see a planet on the horizon, and then actually fly there.
The big question, of course, is how all of these various elements and systems will fit together. And right now it’s just too early to tell. So much of the game right now consists of concepts and ideas, and it’ll be quite some time before we see them put into practice. Ancel says that 2018 is too early to expect the game’s release, though he hopes to have a new version of Beyond Good & Evil 2 ready for E3 next year, which will be “as close as possible to the trailer.”
That trailer ignited hope in the game’s vocal fanbase, who have been waiting years to learn just what’s happening with the game. It seems that Ancel has finally decided just what kind of game he wants to make — and next comes the hard part. “Now we are really building the game,” he says.
Dentists and patients alike want to know how to make dental work less traumatic — and one possible solution may be to combine it with virtual reality. That’s why researchers in the UK enlisted 80 people who needed a cavity filled or a tooth pulled, and separated them into three groups. They gave the first two groups VR headsets, but not the unlucky third control group.
The VR groups either got to explore a beach or navigate a city. The people in the control group just stared at the ceiling while the dentist yanked on their teeth. (Everyone in the study got pain meds or sedation if they needed it.) Patients were surveyed both immediately after their appointments, and a week later. The people immersed in the coastal VR reported less stress and pain than both the patients navigating through the virtual cityscape and the ones with no distraction — according to a study published today in Environment and Behavior.
Much bigger studies will need to be done to see if this holds up. But both the beach scene and the city do sound like reasonably pleasant virtual alternatives to watching the dentist’s tools at work (although two patients had to stop the city VR because they felt hot and dizzy).
Still, both locales are pretty unimaginative when you think about the virtual reality possibilities you could pair with the unique experience of a having a shrieking dental drill digging into your jaw. So, to help the researchers out, we came up with a menu of options for the full VR dental experience:
North Korea increasingly appears to have been behind the ransomware attack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers last month and shut down hospitals, businesses, and other systems in the process.
The Washington Post is now reporting that the US National Security Agency believes with “moderate confidence” that the ransomware, called WannaCry, came from hackers sponsored by North Korea’s spy agency. The report isn’t public, but the Post says the assessment has been distributed within the agency.
North Korea was first linked to WannaCry last month. Several cybersecurity researchers, including some at Symantec and Kaspersky Lab, saw code similarities between WannaCry and other malware previously traced back to North Korea.
At the time, the researchers said they only had a “weak” connection between WannaCry and the country, because there were other ways the code overlap could have occurred. But the NSA has now traced the ransomware back to IP addresses associated with North Korea’s spy agency, according to the Post.
Combined, the information builds a stronger case for North Korea being behind the attack. Specifically, the Post says a state-funded team known as the Lazarus Group appears to be responsible.
One very odd aspect about all of this is the fact that North Korea, a country, seems to have on some level been using WannaCry as a way to raise funds. When the malware infected a computer, it would lock down all files with encryption and demand that a $300 ransom be paid in bitcoin to restore them. Files would be deleted within seven days, the ransomware said, if the fee wasn’t paid.
According to the Post, that attempted payday hasn’t really worked. The bitcoin trail is apparently very easy to track, so it won’t be simple to cash out.
The WannaCry malware relied on leaked NSA code, so it doesn’t entirely prove North Korea’s hacking acumen either. But the country has repeatedly been involved in major hacking incidents over the past few years. In the US, most notably, it was said to be responsible for the 2014 breach of Sony Pictures. And the Post says it was linked last year to several thefts from banks throughout Asia.
In an attempt to even the playing field with competitors, Mozilla Firefox stepped up its game Tuesday by releasing an update that will increase browser speeds and cut down on memory usage.
Firefox 54 has opened up its upper limit of processes from one to four, although users can customize it to be more by entering “about:config” in the address bar and adjusting the settings themselves.
This new version of Firefox feels faster and it scores higher on an online browser speed test than Chrome or Safari, even after opening 20 tabs, although it still gives the old loading sign on all of the pages. Firefox product vice president Nick Nguyen calls this upgrade “the largest change to Firefox code in our history,” according to his blog post detailing the changes.
Have you used Firefox and wondered why it was so sluggishly slow? In the tech equivalent of finding out that someone has been manually inputting thousands of accounting entries into Excel, it turns out Firefox has been relying on a single operating system process to load multiple 2.5-megabyte-sized tabs at once.
In comparison, Google Chrome runs a process for every tab and then some. Right now, I’ve got 22 tabs open while typing this in Chrome yet 330 processes running on 1640 threads. In contrast to Chrome, the upgrade from single process to four processes may feel quite minimal. So why only four?
Even this slight increase in the number of processes comes with a trade-off for memory space, according to Mozilla software developers, reiterating Firefox’s reluctance to sacrifice RAM. Four is the optimal number the developers arrived at for computers with 8GB of RAM.
In order to adapt Firefox to run in multiple processes, Mozilla developers had to break Firefox Add-Ons that depend on a single-process architecture, Ryan Pollock, Firefox’s senior marketing manager, writes on Medium. Mozilla’s Project Quantum, created to optimize the browser engine running within a content process, remains in the works.
This latest software update seems to be building on aspirations that Firefox senior VP Mark Mayo expressed in January in an interview with The Verge. Mayo made it clear that Mozilla didn’t want the web to turn into a monopoly controlled by a few huge companies.
The improvements to Firefox come after a trying time for the company. In February, the company laid off about 50 employees after Firefox OS tanked, and Firefox employees have acknowledged how far the browser has fallen from its brighter days. But if Firefox can use less memory than Chrome and run slightly faster than it used to, it may present itself as a decent browser alternative. Nguyen is imploring former users to give the company another shot: “If you stopped using Firefox, try it again.”
Correction: June 14th, 8PM ET: This story has been updated to correct Ryan Pollock’s title. He is the senior product marketing manager for Firefox, not Mozilla’s head of product marketing.
The Nativ Vita music player looks like a tablet, except all you can do with it is play and control music. The 11.6-inch, 1920 x 1080 touchscreen device has onboard storage to host your digital music collection and can also access various streaming platforms, like Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and Tidal. The thing looks nice and has an impressive spec sheet.
Because it doesn’t include built-in speakers, it instead plays music through either USB, SPDIF, HDMI, and AES/EBU ports, or a Bluetooth, gigabit Ethernet, or 802.11ac Wi-Fi connection. You have options. It also includes a Cortex-A9 processor with 4GB of RAM, and up to two HDDs that support a max of 2TB of storage each. It’s also voice-controlled, has companion iOS, Android, and smartwatch apps, and includes an infrared remote. You can also stream over Google Cast or Apple Airplay. This thing does a lot and really seems like a legitimate option for someone who loves music and wants flexibility for their speaker setup.
Do I need a dedicated touchscreen solely for music when I can stream from my phone to my Bluetooth- or Wi-Fi-connected speakers? Probably not, especially when the Vita starts at $1,599, but at least it looks better than a PC and can be the music interface for a home. It’s now available and shipping through Nativ’s website.
Oftentimes, the best way to describe directions to someone is to explain using street view technology, so you can use notable landmarks as cues for turns and stops. While Google Maps has been pretty good at covering a large part of the world, it’s certainly missing one useful component: a helpful guide dog who photobombs every shot along the way.
At least that’s one competitive advantage for Daum, a Kakao-owned web portal, for its coverage in Ulleung-gun, Gyeongbuk, South Korea. Map services often employ human photographers to capture off-road images, and it appears this very good dog has decided to accompany just about every shot along the trail on this little South Korean island.
Need help finding that lookout point over the beautiful blue ocean? Sure, follow doggo up the stairs and hang when you’ve found the area with the wooden benches.
He / she even waits for you when you’re running behind.
Sometimes doggo is a little shy.
But never fear, we all just need a little break.
The photos appear to have been captured since July 2010, but I will happily take outdated directions with a side of fluffy virtual assistant. Explore on your own here.
Your move, Google Maps.
If you paid close attention to the 9-minute Spider-Man demo at Sony’s E3 2017 event, you might have noticed the superhero knocking a goon off a skyscraper — only to sling him safely back onto the building. Bryan Intihar, creative director of Insomniac Games, explained that the game won’t allow players to use Spidey’s abilities to kill villains, or anybody else for that matter.
“We wouldn’t not allow that,” said Intihar. “Marvel would not allow that, the world would not allow that.”
Intihar didn’t provide specifics about how the game prevents Spider-Man from committing first-degree murder, or you know, accidentally bumpy somebody a little too hard near a very high ledge. Though it appears, in the GIF above, the game’s AI may automatically perform the safety maneuver.
Like most mainstream superheroes, Spider-Man is largely known for pulverizing enemies within an inch of their life, while maintaining an acute moral high ground. Though in the past, Spider-Man has, despite what you might have assumed, killed his enemies a number of times.

Fantastic Four and X-Men: The Last Stand screenwriter Simon Kinberg has been tapped to direct the upcoming X-Men: Dark Phoenix movie for 20th Century Fox. Entertainment Weekly reports that it’s Kinberg’s directorial debut after producing several films in the X-Men universe, including Deadpool and Logan. Joining him are returning core cast members from X-Men: Apocalypse: James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, Sophie Turner, and others.
Dark Phoenix is another attempt on Fox’s part to tell the classic “Dark Phoenix” storyline from the comics. Taking place in the ‘90s, Dark Phoenix will reportedly see the X-Men take on Lilandra, the leader of the interstellar Shi’ar Empire played by newcomer Jessica Chastain, and the otherworldly Phoenix Force. The last time the X-Men were up against that Force was in The Last Stand, a movie so poorly received the franchise went out of its way to erase it from the series timeline.
With Kinberg and the cast signed on, it’s now full steam ahead for the movie as the X-Men franchise. The series, despite the middling reviews for X-Men: Apocalypse, is on an upswing after the successes of Deadpool, Logan, and FX’s Legion. And Kinberg, despite being a new director, has worked as an architect on the franchise for years, though the X-movies have seen more duds than successes on his watch. We’ll have to wait and see on this one.
At long last, the perfect score for arcade classic Ms. Pac-Man has been achieved, though not by a human. Maluuba — a deep learning team acquired by Microsoft in January — has created an AI system that’s learned how to reach the game’s maximum point value of 999,900 on Atari 2600, using a unique combination of reinforcement learning with a divide-and-conquer method.
AI researchers have a documented penchant for using video games to test machine learning; they better mimic real-world chaos in a controlled environment versus more static games like chess. In 2015, Google’s DeepMind AI was able to learn how to master 49 Atari games using reinforcement learning, which provides positive or negative feedback each time the AI attempts to solve a problem.
Though AI has conquered a wealth of retro games, Ms. Pac-Man has remained elusive for years, due to the game’s intentional lack of predictability. Turns out it’s a toughie for humans as well. Many have tried to reach Ms. Pac-Man’s top score, only coming as close as 266,330 on the Atari 2600 version. The game’s elusive 999,900 number though, has so far only been achieved by mortals via cheats.
Maluuba was able to use AI to beat the game by tasking out responsibilities, breaking it up into bite-sized jobs assigned to over 150 agents. The team then taught the AI using what they call Hybrid Reward Architecture — a combination of reinforcement learning with a divide-and-conquer method. Individual agents were assigned piecemeal tasks — like finding a specific pellet — which worked in tandem with other agents to achieve greater goals. Maluuba then designated a top agent (Microsoft likens this to a senior manager at a company) that took suggestions from all the agents in order to inform decisions on where to move Ms. Pac-Man.
The best results came when individual agents “acted very egotistically” and the top agent focused on what was best for the overall team, taking into account not only how many agents wanted to go in a particular direction, but the importance of that direction. (Example: fewer agents wanting to avoid a ghost took priority over a higher amount of agents wanting to pursue a pellet.) “There’s this nice interplay,” says Harm Van Seijen, a researcher with Maluuba, “between how they have to, on the one hand, cooperate based on the preferences of all the agents, but at the same time each agent cares only about one particular problem. It benefits the whole.”
Maluuba says this Hybrid Reward Architecture version of AI learning has expansive, practical applications, like helping to predict a company’s sales leads, or making advances in natural language processing. Watch Microsoft explain its methods, above.
Plugging things in is no fun, especially when a certain company refuses to embrace industry-standard plugs. Wireless charging is an obvious solution, which has been embraced by many Android manufacturers but has remained conspicuously absent from the iPhone. That might be about to change.
Wistron is a manufacturer in India, which Apple recently added to its roster to increase market share in the country and bring prices down. On Wednesday, Wistron's CEO Robert Hwang told reporters that the next generation of iPhones will include "new features like waterproof and wireless charging."
Hwang was talking about the increased complexity of manufacturing over previous iPhone generations, and since right now Wistron only makes the iPhone SE, it's probable that the waterproofing he's referring to is the same level of water resistance that the iPhone 7 has. But the mention of wireless charging is a big slip-up and a nice ray of hope for anyone who has been begging for this feature.
Other signs and rumors have pointed to wireless charging for the next iPhone, not least of which was a note from Ming-Chi Kuo, a typically reliable analyst at KGI Securities, back in February predicting that exact feature. Then a schematic leaked in April of unknown provenance and legitimacy, which showed a large pad the exact shape of a wireless charging antenna:
This is a tipped leak what means I can't confirm if legit or not but there you have it... #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/6OgASNUDNb
And a Reddit post a couple of days ago showed a purported font and back panel. The back panel is glass, which is another important factor for wireless charging:
This is more evidence than we usually have at this time about an upcoming iPhone, but it's still far enough away from launch that things could change between now and then. (Apple usually announces its iPhones in September, and the next iPhone has been rumored to be delayed.) But hopefully all our dreams come true and iPhone users can finally enter the wireless charging era.
Alto’s Odyssey, the sequel to the runaway mobile hit Alto’s Adventure, is set for release this summer, and amid all the hype and noise of E3, developer Snowman quietly showed off our first good look at gameplay for the upcoming endless snowboarding game.
As teased in the initial trailer, Alto’s Odyssey moves the action from the snow-capped peaks of the first one to “a variety of desert locales.” Rails are attached to moving balloons instead of stationary buildings, which characters will be able to bounce off of to reach greater heights. Dust devils dance at the edge of jumps, ready to propel players upward. And in addition to the jumping, flipping, and rail-grinding mechanics from the first game, Odyssey is adding the ability to wall ride, allowing characters to scale up the side of cliffs with a single tap.
It’s still too early to judge, but so far Alto’s Odyssey looks like a great sequel to the original game, keeping the fluid gameplay and stunning scenery that made the first Alto title so good, while expanding mechanics in some interesting ways.
Alto’s Odyssey is set to release sometime this summer.
Hollywood properties have been getting VR tie-ins frequently over the past few years, but now The Walking Dead is stepping things up with an entire series of virtual reality games. Skybound Entertainment, the production company co-founded by Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman, announced this morning that it is partnering with Skydance Interactive to produce the titles.
While audiences are most familiar with the story of Rick Grimes, featured in both the comic series and the AMC television show, the first VR game will actually focus on a entirely different set of characters. It’s not clear if later games will bring in more familiar faces, but according to Skybound Interactive president Dan Murray, Kirkman’s comic will be the primary inspiration. There’s no projected release date or other specifics for any of the projects just yet, but the press release issued by both companies does state that the first game will let players experience the world of The Walking Dead “through an innovative contextual interaction system.”
If that sounds vague and needlessly jargon-y, that’s because it is. But Skybound has been relentlessly forward-thinking when it comes to exploring digital platforms. The company produced the YouTube Red series Scare PewDiePie (before PewDiePie self-immolated, that is), and it is also working on a virtual reality adaptation of the interactive horror play Delusion. Most recently, Skybound showed off a film called Captured at the Overlook Film Festival, which used a mobile app to deliver additional content to audiences while they were watching the movie in real time. Of course, The Walking Dead itself has had a particularly strong run with its interactive Telltale game series.
Skydance Interactive has already been working in virtual reality as well, showing off its upcoming title Archangel as part of the offerings at IMAX’s new virtual reality arcades. (The title will be coming to consoles in July.) It’s not clear yet whether the new Walking Dead games will be brought to IMAX locations under Skydance’s existing partnership, but these kind of high-profile, IP-based titles could be a perfect fit for the location-based VR installations IMAX is working on. Of course, the benefit of something as widely popular as The Walking Dead is that it could potentially encourage headset adoption among consumers as well, making it a particularly intriguing option for gaming console VR.
Updated, June 15th, 1:15PM: Clarified language about Skydance’s existing partnership with IMAX.
Late last year, Netflix enabled downloads for offline playback, which was great news for subscribers who take planes, ride the subway, or own a phone. The function came with some minor caveats, like expiration dates for downloads and limited support for microSD storage on Android devices. Now, another limitation with offline playback is causing grumbles: some content can only be downloaded a finite number of times a year.
As pointed out by Android Police, the notification appears without advanced warning, popping up only when you’re about to hit the download threshold. If you try to download after reaching the limit, you’ll receive an error.
Android Police doesn’t have an exact figure on what this limit is, placing an estimate at four to five downloads a year. It’s also not Netflix’s fault the limit exists, as it doesn’t own the vast majority of the content it offers, and so, it is beholden to rights holders.
What is incredibly annoying, though, is that there are multiple scenarios where these limits could kick in before you ever watch something offline. Some offline content expires in as little as 48 hours, for example, leaving a short viewing window that can be interrupted by things like, you know, life. And what about offline content deleted to free up storage that then can’t be re-downloaded?
It’s worth noting that Netflix does state on a help page regarding downloads: “Due to studio limits, you may not be able to renew all titles. If you are unable to renew a title but would still like to watch it, you’ll need to connect to the internet to stream.” So, this info isn’t new and Netflix sort of puts it out there, but even the help page suggests you might find this out after your initial download(s), not before. PSA — if you didn’t know before, now you do. Wee.
During Game of Thrones’ second season, Arya Stark famously tells Tywin Lannister, “Anyone can be killed.” No line better encapsulates the show. Over the course of six seasons, fans have seen kings and peasants killed so often that it’s a wonder that we’re not desensitized to it all. YouTube channel Leon Andrew Razon Compilations stitched together the show’s on-screen deaths and attempted to count them all, and even though it’s only an estimate, it’s a staggering number.
Including rough estimations of who died during large-scale battles and city sieges, the final tally comes out to 150,966 deaths. That’s a ludicrous number for a TV show, even though the editor is inflating the numbers a little by counting the unsettling number of bird, horse, sheep, and dire wolf deaths, too.
Watching all this bloodletting can be thrilling and / or depressing, depending whether, like me, you’re still sad about the deaths of a few favorite characters. (Margaery!) Just don’t take this as a complete death toll for the entire series, because there’s no way it’s even close. Elio Garcia, a research assistant for author George R.R. Martin, once estimated that Westeros’ entire population is approximately 40 million. The War of the Five Kings (the war where everyone wants to rule the kingdoms for occasionally justifiable reasons) pulled armies from across the continent into a multi-theater conflict, killing thousands over the course of several years. Imagine all the murders and beheadings we don’t see on the show. Like that time Gregor Clegane went reaving through the countryside before the war even started:
It isn’t crazy to think millions died over the years. The show just has to leave some things offscreen.
Season 7 starts in a month, and the so-called Great War is about to begin. It won’t just be kings and queens. It’ll be dragons and ice zombies. The death toll is only going to get higher. Just don’t try to keep count.
When it arrived in 2014, Warner Bros.’ Shadow of Mordor delivered a masterful action role playing game set in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth. But the game offered just a hint of the developer’s actual vision, says Bob Roberts, the game’s design director. Shadow of Mordor told only about half of the story they originally envisioned, and its most novel design feature — the “nemesis system” that generates new stories for everyone who plays — was also pared back.
Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the sequel to be released this fall, offered an opportunity for Monolith Productions to fill in those blanks. Both the scope of the storytelling and the nemesis system have been greatly expanded, and they come together in the game’s fortress sieges — a series of epic, chaotic encounters that have been a highlight of this year’s E3.
Shadow of War picks up where Mordor left off, with the widowed ranger Talion still fused to the ghostly presence of Celebrimbor — an elf tricked by Sauron into forging the Rings of Power. (The story takes place between The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, but stands alone.)
As you fight your way through Middle-earth, you encounter nasty orcs known as Uruks who are hell-bent on killing you. If they succeed, they are promoted and gain new powers, making them more difficult to kill when you are reborn. Moreover, they’ll taunt you when you return, often in crudely hilarious terms. If you succeed, you can kill them — or you can take control of their minds and press them into your service.
In Mordor, you could use these dominated Uruks to trigger infighting within orc ranks. But in War, they become your army — and with the orcs at your side, you can storm entire fortresses and claim them for the Bright Lord.
At the suggestion of a Monolith employee, I started my time with War by attempting to seize a fortress. If Mordor was primarily a hack-and-slash affair, War demands a more tactical approach. First, I used some skill points to bolster Talion’s combat abilities. Next, I assigned four dominated Uruks to join me in battle, with each one leading dozens of orc soldiers. I could also designate one Uruk as my personal bodyguard, who I could call for assistance in battle with the press of a button.
Before the siege, War will show you the fortress’s defenses — its strengths, its weaknesses, and what sort of terrors are lurking inside. You can also spend in-game currency on items that will help you win — poisonous spiders who will eat away at your enemies’ health, for example, or a dragon who will roast everything in its path. When you’re ready, you tap a button and lead your army into battle.
Taking a fortress is a four-step process. First, you must capture three “victory points” scattered around the fortress. You do this by clearing out enemies with the help of your army. It’s tricky, though, because victory points are guarded by war chiefs — heavily armored Uruks who can take you out with just a few swings of their swords. Only after dispatching the chiefs can you challenge the fortress’s overlord to a fight, and you capture it by defeating him.
A more patient player might attempt to attack war chiefs when they’re away from their fortresses — though they will themselves be surrounded by well armed bodyguards. I was on a tighter time frame, and charged directly into battle — and quickly paid the iron price. War chiefs slaughtered me on each of two attempts to capture a fortress, and after a pair of defeats I waved a white flag and asked if I could play one of more manageable story missions. (It was delightful.)
But I’m eager to get back to the sieges, particularly during a proper playthrough when I’ve re-mastered the game’s controls and can take a more thoughtful approach to battle. Roberts tells me that most players will attempt their first siege only after several hours of gameplay — it’s meant to be a culmination, not an introduction. In a separate demonstration, I watched a Monolith employee successfully claim a fortress over about 20 minutes of gameplay, and it was thrilling to watch. Her team of Uruks stood up to their enemies with ease, and her clever attacks reduced the overlord to a pile of cinders.
Roberts tells me War’s best attribute is in the way its various systems collide — combat, role play, open-world questing, and the nemesis system, all working together to create a unique path for every player. It’s unpredictable in the best way, he says, before telling me a story about a recent moment in which a nearly-dead orc tried to retreat from Talion. “You haven’t seen the last of me,” the orc taunted — and as he was saying it, a giant beast known as a graug suddenly appeared, picked him up and ate him. The team at Monolith didn’t even know that could happen, Roberts says. “That may never happen again,” he adds. “But it happened for us. And it made our day.”


In summer 2014, an intern at the ACLU found a memo from a public meeting in which the San Jose Police Department asked to be reimbursed for a “UAV,” which he immediately recognized as a type of drone.
“It was tucked in the back of an agenda item,” says Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties policy for the ACLU of California. The City Council approved the purchase of the $8,000 drone as part of a million-dollar federal grant, but there had been no public debate over the merits of acquiring such a controversial piece of equipment.
Ozer asked community members if they knew about the drone purchase. “We thought maybe we just missed it but everyone else knew about it,” Ozer says. But no one they reached out to had any idea.
The incident confirmed a fear shared by civil liberties advocates: police departments around the country were buying surveillance equipment with FEMA homeland security grants with little oversight. Each year, over $1 billion of these grants are funneled to municipalities across the country, bypassing local budget processes and leaving community members in the dark about the acquisition of advanced surveillance arsenals. Cities in California have purchased or attempted to acquire drones, cellphone tower simulators, and other tools previously reserved for the federal government.
“We found, across the board, that even basic public conversation and debate was absent,” Ozer says.
The drone discovery was one of the events that led California’s Santa Clara County to become, in June 2016, the first in the country to pass an ordinance requiring transparency for police surveillance technology based on a recent ACLU model. The law requires public input, an impact report, and a use policy with details about data sharing before equipment is purchased. (Seattle passed a similar law in 2013, also with ACLU involvement, but its scope was limited to video surveillance.)
Last fall, the ACLU announced a nationwide strategy in partnership with over a dozen other civil liberties groups to promote similar bills in cities across the country. Called Community Control Over Police Surveillance, or CCOPS, the ACLU says there are bills with sponsors in 19 cities nationwide and one public transit system, the Bay Area’s BART. Chad Marlow, who is overseeing the nationwide strategy for CCOPS at the ACLU, says that organizing is underway in an additional 46 cities and one state, though he doesn’t expect them all to find sponsors.
In California, bills are up for debate in Oakland, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Palo Alto. Similar initiatives are underway in New York City, which will hold a hearing on June 14th, as well as smaller cities nationwide such as Somerville, Massachusetts; Madison, Wisconsin; and Richmond, Virginia.
Nicole Ozer says that over and over again she has seen communities fight back against the creep of surveillance technology. She believes ordinances like the one the ACLU is pushing are a first step to accomplish this.
“When communities know what’s happening, they are in a much better position to fight against it,” Ozer says. “You can’t fight what you don’t know.”
In Santa Clara County, where the law has been enforced since June 2016, community members say it’s working as intended, though the quality of use policies vary. After the law was introduced, 16 use policies were submitted at once for new and existing equipment. Some policies passed quickly with little scrutiny, while others were rejected; at least one policy passed despite public criticism.
When the Sheriff’s Department sought to fit officers with body-worn cameras, the ordinance required them to publicize a surveillance-impact statement and use policy before a scheduled public hearing. A draft use policy was deemed too broad by critics at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, ACLU, and CAIR, who voiced their objections in a letter to the Board of Supervisors. They took issue with the policy’s year-long data retention period, the ability of officers to view footage before giving testimony in certain situations, and lack of protections against biometric analysis like facial recognition.
Following an update on the use policy, the body-worn cameras were approved by the board of supervisors on January 24th, 2017. The new requirements prohibit the use of data for biometrics, requiring future approval from the county.
But when questions arose over a purchase enabling aerial infrared surveillance, the input of civil liberties advocates through the CCOPS process was brushed aside. In 2016, the Santa Clara Sheriff’s Department proposed a $620,000 purchase of an integrated helicopter mapping system that included a Forward Looking Infrared Imaging System, or FLIR, a type of thermal camera. The technology has been controversial since the early ‘90s, when the Supreme Court ruled that thermal imaging constituted a search requiring a warrant.
The use policy of the Sheriff’s Department and an early impact report approved a broad range of uses for the mapping system and thermal camera, and dismissed concerns about privacy as misinformed. Approved uses in the draft policy include “tracking suspects,” “evidence collection,” and, most vaguely, “other law enforcement or first responder uses not prohibited by law.”
That triggered a critical letter from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that called into question the necessity of the mapping system, arguing that aerial recordings of civilians created significant civil liberties problems. The letter was not enough to sway Santa Clara’s Board of Supervisors, and the Sheriff’s Department’s use policy stayed as is.
Adam Schwartz, a lead counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who authored the letter to the board, says that both the body cam and the FLIR case are evidence that CCOPS is effective.
“We would never have known this was happening if it wasn’t for the ordinance,” Schwartz says. “In both instances, we think the system worked the way it’s supposed to work. We don’t just wake up as civilians and all of a sudden there’s a new mapping system on a helicopter, or a new body-worn camera on the officers. Rather there’s a notice to the public beforehand, and an opportunity for public discussion.”
Other community members reiterated that merely being able to ask questions about surveillance technology and have them answered is reassuring.
Sameena Usman is a coordinator at the Council of American-Islamic Relations’ Bay Area office, one of the groups that advocated for the ordinance in Santa Clara. Usman attended the hearing when the FLIR was discussed. To Usman, the value of the ordinance is that it mandates transparency.
“That transparency has built trust,” Usman says.
The ACLU’s Marlow says that support for CCOPS-modeled legislation has largely been bipartisan. “We face neither resistance from the left or right,” Marlow says. “The only place we face resistance is from the police.”
In Pensacola, Florida, a version of the ordinance is being sponsored by City Council member Jewel Cannada-Wynn, and it is backed the state’s NAACP chapter, as well as libertarian and Republican groups.
“How often do people from both parties agree on anything?” says Sara Latshaw, regional organizer for the ACLU in Northwest Florida, who is overseeing CCOPS in Florida.
Bill Fetke is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a conservative grassroots group, and a supporter of the ordinance in Pensacola. He says he has confidence in local law enforcement, but opposes what he views as overreach by the state.
“There’s a camera watching you every five feet,” Fetke says. “I don’t do anything wrong, but I don’t want a camera staring at me every five seconds.”
Reaction from some conservatives he knows has been mixed, Fetke says.
“Most people kind of think I’m wearing a tinfoil hat,” he says. “They don’t think it applies to them. Even the libertarians who are in the middle aisle.” But he believes conservatives who don’t support the ordinance are thinking short-term.
“We need to force our government to follow rules,” Fetke says. “If we don’t stop them here, they’re going to trample all over our Fourth, Ninth, 10th Amendments.”
The spread in the use of body cameras by police departments across the country, often implemented with poor use policies, is another reason the surveillance bill is finding support. Promoted as accountability tools, departments also view body cameras as tools for gathering incriminating evidence, and most use policies make it difficult for family members of a victim in an officer-involved shooting to acquire footage.
In Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where a CCOPS ordinance is being sponsored, a police spokesman told the press that officers would use body cameras to gather evidence. “A lot of times we may not catch everything, but we can go back and look at it later,” the spokesman told the Hattiesburg American. A use policy for Hattiesburg’s body-worn cameras has never been made public. CCOPS legislation would force the department to release that policy.
Zaki Manian, of Restore The Fourth, a Bay Area-based civil liberties group, says organizations like his have a complicated relationship with body cameras. Manian believes they can be a tool for accountability, but mounting evidence suggests they could be used as just another surveillance technology.
“The only way you can ethically sort of balance these concerns is with consent of people in the community,” Manian says.
But even supporters of CCOPS admit the legislation has its limits. One fear is that the law would merely legitimize surveillance technologies that now exist in legal gray zones.
“When you pass a law, you create legality where there wasn’t,” says Malkia Cyril of the Center for Media Justice, a Bay Area nonprofit. “We create the legal framework where they can be legally abused.”
Cyril is opposed to police body cameras, and is skeptical that use policies, such as those arbitrated through CCOPS legislation, will be enough to rein in the abuse of surveillance in over-policed communities.
“Whether or not you have a use policy, does not mean there’s a way to enforce a use policy,” Cyril says.
“I can’t reiterate enough how dangerous it would be to me to if we rested on the laurels of a municipal policy. It’s insufficient. It’s important and insufficient,” Cyril says.
The limit of the ordinance is particularly visible in NYC, where the state’s constitution does not allow the City Council to veto NYPD purchases, and where pressure from a powerful police union has caused Mayor de Blasio, who campaigned on police reform, to bow to pressure more than once.
NYC’s CCOPS ordinance, dubbed the POST Act, is sponsored by 15 council members and is set for a City Council hearing on June 14th.
Like the ordinance in Santa Clara and bills elsewhere, it requires a use policy and public comment for the purchase of any surveillance equipment. But while the police commissioner would need to submit a use policy informed by public comments to the City Council, no city entity would need to approve a purchase. The only oversight would come from the NYPD Inspector General, an independent agency that audits the NYPD, which would be tasked with making sure the NYPD’s surveillance deployments are consistent with its own use policies. The process is similar to the public consultation that the NYPD undertook prior to rolling out a pilot body camera program in April. But that use policy came under criticism for not fully taking citizens’ opinions into account.
Nevertheless, proponents argue the legislation will promote transparency and force police departments to think critically about surveillance.
“It’s really about getting them to change the way they think,” says Brian Hofer of Oakland Privacy. He says in the months since the Santa Clara ordinance was put in place, he’s seen the use policies submitted by the police improve. It’s a sign, he suggests, that the law is working.
But the uncertainty as to whether the NYPD, or any police department across the country, will adhere to strengthened guidelines for their surveillance gear may be why advocates like Center for Media Justice’s Malkia Cyril are skeptical about an over-reliance on policy, while also acknowledging it as a necessary first step.
“Policy is one thing,” Cyril says. “Power is another.”

Call of Duty: WWII is supposed to be the Activision franchise’s back-to-basics moment: an opportunity to shed recent COD installments’ future-obsessed trappings and craft a “serious” shooter game against the backdrop of the world’s most horrific war. Developer Sledgehammer Games said as much here at E3 in Los Angeles. “Coming off of Advanced Warfare, it felt right for us,” says Aaron Halon, the game’s multiplayer lead, in an interview with The Verge. “We really want Call of Duty to get back to the grittiness, the brutality of war. That’s really what WWII did for our game.”
But judging from one recorded video of a campaign mission and some time with the game’s multiplayer mode this week at E3, COD: WWII comes across as just another shooter from the aging franchise. It doesn’t appear to have much to say about one of history’s most devastating conflicts — at least, nothing that hasn’t already been said by countless films, books, and television shows before it. And if WWII as a concept is supposed to revive COD as a game series, Sledgehammer doesn’t seem equipped to take the risks necessary to pull it off. Striking a balance between artful war commentary and mass-market pulp is hard enough. It becomes a daunting, perhaps impossible, task for a major game studio to do so with the expectation that it sell as many copies as Activision demands.
On one hand, sure: this is a shooter franchise, and COD’s primary mission has been to generate video game combat with ever-increasing technical sophistication. The kinds of personal and affecting stories that have defined the genre in other media have always taken a backseat to adrenalized thrill rides. (Sledgehammer made 2014’s Advanced Warfare, which featured exoskeletons and jetpacks, while developer Infinity Ward took the series to space in last year’s Infinite Warfare.) No one is expecting COD to outdo Saving Private Ryan in narrative ambition.
At the same time, Activision and Sledgehammer have sold this installment of COD as a kind of meditation on the costs of violence. “This global conflict was rooted in some true atrocities,” Sledgehammer co-founder Michael Condrey told Polygon in an interview earlier this year. “The story is anchored in some iconic moments in the war. The D-Day invasion in Normandy was one of those. There are also other things that make the war so powerful. The historical context of the atrocities of World War II is something that we want to tell the players.”
"We absolutely show atrocities," Bret Robbins, the game’s senior creative director, told Mashable back in April. "It's an unfortunate part of the history, but you can't tell an authentic, truthful story without going there. So we went there." But Sledgehammer has yet to disclose to what extent the game will acknowledge or feature, for example, any aspect of the Holocaust, one aspect WWII games have historically omitted.
So at first blush, Sledgehammer appears to have crafted something that feels less Spielberg and more Michael Bay. Big, explosive set pieces pause to showcase gruesome, dismemberment-heavy deaths. The stakes feel high in the way imminent death always does, and the action is compelling. But it’s not yet clear the game has the heart to hold it all together. You’re still basically just mowing down virtual human beings in ever-more-elaborate ways — throwing grenades over barricades, lighting men on fire, sniping heads from a bell tower — as you head from one objective marker to the next on a quest to save the world from bad guys.
The protagonist, a young Texan named Robert “Red” Daniels, is a fresh face for a COD game, even if he feels like a derivative Hollywood trope. Daniels is not a super soldier or a superhero, nor is he a grizzled war veteran. He’s just an everyday kid who gets tossed into the madness of WWII. Yet the game doesn’t give him, or you as the player, a directive other than to survive, kill, and advance. The primary perspective on view is that of the American soldier — a viewpoint that’s been explored time and again. (You will also get to play as a member of the French Resistance and a British officer, but it’s not apparent they serve a broader purpose other than to switch it up now and again.)
Contrast that with Electronic Arts’ Battlefield 1. That game, while mired by some of the same pitfalls that make mowing down armies of men a comically absurd chore, successfully strove to be a smarter breed of shooter. It balanced the genre’s intrinsic glorification of violence with a sense of disorientation that leaves you reeling and shell-shocked. Both in its single-player campaign and on the multiplayer front, BF1’s aesthetic and narrative choices made clear how the conflicts of the 20th century devalued human life. It was, at times, an anti-war message trapped in a best-selling FPS.
This is not to say that COD: WWII is not fun or entertaining. The game’s new multiplayer war mode, which has one team fighting to hold its ground while another advances, is exhilarating. The combat feels smooth, and the new class and weapons systems feel distinctive. COD still manages to be just fast-paced and intense enough to get your adrenaline pumping.
COD as a franchise made its mark on the first-person shooter genre — before it rose to record-breaking heights with 2007’s Modern Warfare — with three full games set during WWII. That it has returned again smacks of creative exhaustion.
Returning to its roots and “putting boots back on the ground,” as company representatives like to say, may be a convenient way to court back disaffected fans. But it’s not clear those fans will be returning to something drastically different. COD: WWII may feature all the old battlefields and weapons you see on the History Channel. But it feels, for now, like a shooter game in desperate need of a soul.

For the first time ever, Grammy voters for the 2018 awards show will cast their votes online, instead of with paper ballots. The Recording Academy hopes the swap will increase voter turnout and encourage younger members to vote, the LA Times reports.
The new online ballots will also give eligible voters the option to listen to the songs that have been nominated, as a way of encouraging voters to actually listen to the artists they’re voting for, BuzzFeed News reports.
One of the most common criticisms of the music awards show — from both artists and fans — is that it’s out-of-touch. The night’s biggest awards often seem to go to the most popular or recognizable artists, frequently snubbing critic- and fan-favorites. In 2014, Mackelmore’s The Heist won Best Rap Album over Kendrick Lamar’s Good Kid M.A.A.D. City — a snub that even Mack saw fit to publicly and dramatically apologize for. Last year, after Adele’s 25 won Album of the Year, she said, “My album of the year is Lemonade,” referring to Beyoncé’s critically adored visual album. Frank Ocean chose not to submit his album Blonde for Grammy nomination last year, telling The New York Times, “I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated.”
According to BuzzFeed News, the Recording Academy hopes that if its younger members turn out to vote online, the awards might more accurately reflect the listening habits of younger generations.
"There may be certain genres within our awards categories where the demographic that tends to participate in making that particular music might be more tech savvy in general, or might have more of a mobile lifestyle than certain other genres, and we think this might appeal to those folks,” Recording Academy VP Bill Freimuth told BuzzFeed News.
The internet has been proven to appeal to a lot of folks. The 60th Grammy Awards are scheduled to take place on January 28th, 2018 in New York City.
Marissa Mayer is no longer the CEO of Yahoo, following the company’s acquisition by Verizon. And as such, Mayer is not only a job-free woman, she is also no longer bound to Yahoo’s product portfolio. That’s right, she can use Gmail, and she’s psyched about it. At a conference in London today, Mayer reportedly said she is “looking forward to going back to Gmail” because she’s “always faster when using a tool I designed myself.”
"I'm looking forward to going back to Gmail"; @marissamayer on life post-Yahoo #fflondon
Marissa Mayer at accelerateHER forum: "I look forward to using Gmail again. Am always faster when using a tool I designed myself"#FFLondon
Dang! Shade! Remember, Mayer spent 13 years at Google managing multiple products, including search and Google Doodles. She was employee #20 at the company when she was hired in 1999, right out of Stanford. We’re all happy for you, Marissa. Enjoy Gmail’s suggested responses and labels and stay far, far away from sad Yahoo Mail.
Update 12:34 PM ET: Mayer tweeted that she plans to keep her Yahoo Mail account and credited its team for improving it.
I will continue to use the excellent Yahoo Mail too.  The team's hard work paid off with a dramatically better product. https://t.co/ZQyTvjULlW
It isn’t clear how she’ll use her email, although we do all need a burner account for random list servs and newsletter sign-ups.
There have been a lot of ultrawide monitors hitting the market recently, but Dell has been the king of the space (followed closely by LG) since the standard was introduced. Now the company is back with a massive, 38-inch curved ultrawide monitor, and I need one very badly.
The Dell UltraSharp 38 Curved Monitor (U3818DW) ticks nearly every box you want checked in a monitor this size if you’re looking for a productivity display. It features a 3440 x 1440 resolution, a 100w USB-C connection that can charge your laptop while transmitting data, and integrated dual 9w speakers.
The only downside here is the price, as the U3818DW comes in at a hefty $1,499. You can purchase the Dell UltraSharp 38 Curved Monitor on Dell.com beginning on June 23rd.
As NASA works toward sending people into deep space, the agency is looking for new types of space habitats that astronauts can live in far from Earth. One company, Nanoracks, has a design idea in mind — but rather than build something completely new, the company has a bold plan to recycle space hardware to create living quarters. Their plan: turn used rocket tanks into suitable places for deep-space explorers to live.
And now, Nanoracks has signed a contract with NASA to start turning this habitat concept into reality. Last summer, the company was one of six picked to be part of the second round of NASA’s NextSTEP program, an initiative to create concepts and ground prototypes of novel deep-space habitats. Now with a finalized contract, Nanoracks can get to work on developing its concept, called Ixion, and eventually turning a spent rocket tank into a habitat that can then be tested out in space.
Basically, the company just wants to utilize hardware that would otherwise go to waste. When a satellite launches on top of a rocket, the probe is typically delivered into its final orbit by the vehicle’s upper stage — the top section of the rocket that contains its own separate engine(s) and fuel. That means the upper stage usually orbits along with the satellite after it’s been deployed from the rocket. By the time it’s in orbit, most of propellant in the stage’s tank has been depleted, which creates a whole lot of empty space that is going unused.
If these stages go to a low enough orbit, they’re usually deorbited on purpose; any remaining propellant is used to redirect the stage toward Earth and have it burn up in the atmosphere. That way they don’t add to the growing amount of space debris already around Earth. But instead of getting rid of these stages, Nanoracks wants to keep them in orbit and then refurbish them, turning them into something completely new. “We’re augmenting what already exists,” Mike Johnson, chief designer at NanoRacks, tells The Verge. “You kind of double down for your money.”
The plan would be to vent the rest of the propellant out into space, making the tank completely empty. Or if the rocket uses cryogenic propellants, as many modern vehicles do, then the materials will boil off after a few days as the stage orbits Earth and is heated up by the Sun. Once the tank is completely empty, Nanoracks will fill it with pressurized air from smaller vessels attached to the outside. In fact, each of these tanks-turned-habitats will have smaller modules attached to the outside, containing vital supplies like life support systems and cargo that can be used to make the tank a viable place to live. The modules can also be used to attach the stage to other habitats already in space.
After the tank is pressurized, then it’s time to send in a crew — either humans or robots — to outfit the inside. Most propellant tanks are equipped with small hatches, and the company plans to add docking tunnels to these hatches to allow crews to get inside the tanks. They’ll then bring in foldable fabrics to make the interior a little more astronaut-friendly and comfier than just an empty metal structure. “The outfitting equipment is pretty lightweight; it’s made out of fabric and built in wiring,” says Johnson. “Compared to other ways of creating habitable space, it’s really a cheap way to do it — in terms of cheap in mass, cheap in cost, and cheap volume.”
It’ll be a while before such habitats are open for new tenants though. For now, Nanoracks is focused on developing the concept further and creating a prototype on the ground. After that, the team will try to refurbish a tank within one of the upper stages made by the United Launch Alliance, called Centaur. This stage is currently used on the Atlas V rocket and will soon be used on the company’s next vehicle called Vulcan. They then hope to attach this refurbished tank to the International Space Station for testing. And if all goes well, the tank may just stay there. “A secondary objective is that we could leave it there and potentially create a commercial space station module on the ISS,” says Johnson.
Nanoracks is aiming to get the tank habitat to the ISS in the next four years or so, says Johnson. But for now, the company is focused on this first contract with NASA, which involves doing a study on the concept’s feasibility. Out of all the other companies in the NextSTEP program, Nanoracks is the only company that plans to outfit used tanks, and Johnson hopes that will give them a lot of flexibility moving forward. “Anything that uses an upper stage could use this concept,” he says. “It really fits in everywhere.”






Patreon, the subscription-based funding platform that supports creators like Amanda Palmer and the Kinda Funny team, is getting a major update that includes live-streaming capabilities and a new visual design. Patreon co-founder Jack Conte says the features are intended to give creators more ways to engage directly with their patrons, while also giving them more ways to analyze and keep track of their subscriber base. They’ve been tested with a limited number of people on the platform, but will now be rolling out on a large scale.
One of the additions is a new app called “Lens,” which Conte describes as something like Snapchat or Instagram Stories, but limited to Patreon subscribers. The app “makes it really easy for creators to give patrons a window into their life and share videos and photos,” says Conte. It’s currently in beta, and will be released slowly over the next six months.
In addition to the Lens app, Patreon is partnering with a streaming company called Crowdcast to enable patron-only live videos. And creators will now be able to give subscribers early access to Patreon posts before they go live more widely. On the purely internal side, Patreon will offer creators access to a “patron relationship manager” — basically, a database with detailed information about subscribers. “You can just look at all the patrons who joined in the last two weeks and send them a gift, or look at all your patrons who recently hit their six-month anniversary and invite them to a live stream,” says Conte.
Creators could do all the things above before the update, and many already do. Crowdcast has advertised its services on the Patreon blog, and more generally, patrons pay to get closer access to creators, as well as a look at early or unfinished work. The point of this update, says Conte, is to make the process much easier. The early-access system, for example, will let them create one post and automatically open it after a certain period of time, instead of posting multiple updates or manually changing the access settings. Similarly, the patron relationship manager will replace the process of downloading and sorting through spreadsheets with subscriber info.
Things like the live-streaming system aren’t meant to substitute for a service like Twitch, and Conte says that Patreon isn’t meant to become a place where creators will host their main artistic output. But the company is trying to handle all the interactions between artists and fans, not just the money that passes between them.
Along with the updates, Patreon is announcing several new high-profile creators joining the platform, including McSweeney’s Internet Tendency and comedian Bill Burr. According to recently released statistics, the platform hosts 50,000 active creators and recently passed one million active patrons, who pay an average of $12 monthly. It’s currently on track to deliver creators $150 million in 2017, compared to $100 million total between its launch in mid-2013 and the end of 2016, and Conte says the site revamp is meant to provide a more professional feel. “It feels much more like, you know, a place to run a business — a place to actually make money and get paid and run a membership platform,” he says.
There's a peculiar dynamic going on in Los Angeles this week, as E3 — the biggest gaming showcase of them all — is taking place and, once again, paying little attention to the hugely profitable mobile games market. By most estimates, mobile gaming is generating in excess of $30 billion per year, and it's projected to eclipse consoles and the PC as the single most lucrative platform for games. And yet, cast your eye across the vast gaming landscape of E3 and you'll see mobile as only a space filler in between the traditional AAA blockbusters and barnburners. Why, I wondered, does the form of gaming we're increasingly spending the majority of our time and money on get so little hype and attention?
I realize that, on one interpretation, this question is tantamount to asking why there are no Oscars for YouTubers. And I want to encourage that interpretation! Because, seriously, why are there no Academy Awards for the work people publish on YouTube? Some of the cinematography and performances I've seen inside Google's bottomless pit of user-uploaded content now rival the best Hollywood has to offer. And, moreover, YouTubers are rarely as inane and uncreative as the latest Tom Cruise summer flick or yet another shakedown of the Pirates of the Caribbean money tree. My instinctive answer with regard to both E3 and the Oscars is that it's simply a matter of inertia. That's the way we've always done things.
Others will tell you that it's more complicated than that. The economics of mobile games are vastly different to those of flagship PC and console titles. Free-to-play games, even hugely successful ones like Dota 2 and League of Legends on PC, have never garnered much stage time at E3. And the big moneymakers on the mobile front are almost all free-to-play, with in-app purchases and upgrades making up the bulk of their income. It's tricky to figure out a sizzle reel for hot new IAPs. Tricky, I would argue, but not impossible.
2016's biggest gaming sensation was undoubtedly Pokémon Go. It was a massive global success, estimated to have produced nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2016 alone, and it was socially transformative, too, dragging many of us out of the house and giving us a reason to talk to strangers with a shared interest. At E3 that year, Nintendo wasn't afraid to give Pokémon Go its due time in the spotlight. Now, of course, Pokémon hype is a whole thing unto itself, but I think more companies should embrace the model set by Nintendo and commit to promoting their mobile games on an equal footing to their desktop and console titles. Hell, I'd at least like to see Nintendo keep it up, but the company's reverted to spending all its E3 time talking about its Switch console.
There's honestly little to lose by communicating to your players in the language they understand and giving them the game experiences they actually want.
I recall an old Malcolm Gladwell talk where he recounted some unintuitive statistical findings by researchers. If you ask people what type of coffee they favor, he pointed out, they all say something along the lines of a dark, rich, hearty roast. When you look at what they actually buy and prefer, however, it turns out the answer is a weak and milky coffee. Without wishing to offend mobile game makers, that's where we are today: with mobile games being the mild and milky coffee we actually consume but don't feel exceedingly proud to admit to liking. E3 still thinks all we're after is the glitz and violence of AAA console titles, and the real world is instead tapping away in Clash of Clans.
E3 doesn't need to be entirely transformed, but I do think it can make some changes to better reflect the way that most of us game nowadays. To do otherwise would be to accept an increasingly niche role in the wider gaming landscape. I've got a huge water-cooled gaming tower of doom at home, but I also have a stupidly powerful smartphone in my pocket — and it's the latter that now garners more of my time and attention. So if the established gaming companies are not going to try and capitalize on that new opportunity, odds are that I'll end up spending more time in the realms created by small-scale developers like the people behind Egg Inc. and Tap Tap Fish.
Alas, E3 is a show tailored to the long lead times and slow-burning buildup of $60 titles that are months away from release. The resources committed to the promotion of those games still dwarf anything invested in hyping up mobile games, and the reality is that my dream scenario of E3 as the all-inclusive gaming extravaganza is unlikely to ever happen.
I'd love to one day attend E3 with the assignment of covering only mobile games and to feel as overwhelmed with new stuff as my colleagues covering console and PC launches. But at E3 2017, we had very little of that: just the announcement of a new South Park game, a trailer for a new Alto game, Alto's Odyssey, and the utterly inexcusable travesty that is Garfield Go. Compare that against the glories of Anthem or that gorgeous Beyond Good & Evil 2 trailer, which showed zero gameplay, but was still thrilling to watch and appreciate. All I'm asking is a little bit of that extra love for the mobile gamers out there, for we are legion and we like to be flattered with beautiful imagery and hype-building showpieces just as much as our console-playing brethren.
Here’s a good meme to start your day with: it’s the “the floor is [fill in the blank]” meme, which is a spinoff of the very imaginative childhood game every person on Earth individually came up with, the “the floor is lava game.”
According to Know Your Meme, “the floor is” originated with this April 2016 tweet:
Me: I'm gonna go to sleep early this weekMe Tuesday @ 3am: pic.twitter.com/qL2K2yWZX3
The photos in this tweet are the most commonly used, with some Photoshop variations. But the meme didn’t really take off until the addition of other images last week. This is the first one I saw, and it seems to have spread the farthest:
the floor is men pic.twitter.com/BTRsthaqIl
Here are some more good ones.
The floor is a normal sleeping schedule, clear skin, nice body, and money in my bank account pic.twitter.com/KB5ddw3SD9
the floor is replying to texts days, even weeks late with "just now seeing this" pic.twitter.com/2K2JDGFQ5y
THE FLOOR IS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE  pic.twitter.com/1NQ1oyP2bJ
the floor is 8 hours of sleep pic.twitter.com/ydCfLHJO1t
Do you get the joke yet? The floor can be anything. If you like the thing that’s on the floor, you dive toward it, or in the case of this kind of gross example, you whack the floor with your pelvis. If you don’t like the thing, or you think the thing is impossible, you stay as far away from the floor as possible! The joke is limited only by the number of nouns in the universe, and by how long it takes us to get bored with it.

According to our pals over at the MemeEconomy subreddit, there’s still time to enjoy this meme before it’s ruined by the mainstream media. (I’m sorry!) In their words: “‘The floor is’ memes on the rise! BUY! BUY! BUY!” So if you’ve got a good idea for “the floor is,” maybe do it now before the moment passes.
the floor is having to voice an opinion on literally any social issue because youre a full grown adult with a massive audience pic.twitter.com/vVHQYYQKpl
Anyway, you get it. But before you run off to scale a wall and go viral, I’d like you to hear me out as I apologize to former One Direction member Liam Payne — not for referring to the video for his debut solo song “Strip That Down” as “four Old Navy commercials from 2007 smashed together,” but for making fun of an Instagram video that he captioned “the floor is lava” last week.
okay why are you jumping INTO lava liam??? how are you pushing off of a liquid to jump into the air/??? pic.twitter.com/P9LsTTtz0w
The video still doesn’t make any sense, but at least now I know he was trying to participate in a viral internet trend, likely at the behest of whoever’s in charge of his weird career these days. He’s a dad now, and I can’t really expect him to execute memes perfectly.
To clarify: “The floor is” meme is different than the #TheFloorIsLavaChallenge, which started on YouTube and isn’t that funny to me. YouTubers who encourage their young viewers to do elaborate pranks that require athleticism and rule-breaking worry me a lot. And, as a new father, I think Liam would feel the same.
Instagram is adding a new label to better differentiate paid-for posts from regular content. The label — which features the words “Paid partnership with...” — will appear above sponsored posts and stories created by celebrities and other users promoting brands or products over the coming weeks.
The addition comes in the same week that a report claimed that 93 percent of paid-for posts made by Instagram’s most popular users were not labeled according to FTC guidelines. The report, put together by marketing firm Mediakix, looked at Instagram’s 50 most-followed accounts and found that 61 percent of sponsored posts were related to the fashion industry. BuzzFeed’s Katie Notopoulos broke this data down further, splitting the posts into four categories: posts that failed to disclose a long-term sponsorship (49 percent of posts), the receipt of an expensive one-off gift (16 percent), a cheaper gift (12 percent), or single pay-to-post ads (12 percent).
FTC guidelines state that sponsored posts must have clear reference to the fact they serve as paid advertising, either with words like “sponsored by” in the accompanying text, or by using hashtags like #ad. Prolific Instagram users have previously found ways around this system, however, using vaguer hashtags like #sp or #partner.
The FTC sent notices to 90 Instagram users in April this year, to remind them to clearly disclose any “material connection” they may have with a brand or company. Some of the letters referenced these vague hashtags, saying that consumers aren’t likely to understand inclusions like “#sp” as indication of a paid sponsorship. They also noted that consumers are likely to skip over sponsorship hashtags when they were included in a group of more standard tags.
By putting the notification above the image or story, rather than in the description below, Instagram’s new system should make it clearer for followers to pick out paid-for posts. Of course, users will still have to choose to include the label when making their posts — potentially leaving the door open for more surreptitious advertising — but the service has a solid reason for businesses to want to clearly state their connections.
Metrics for posts with the “Paid partnership with...” label will be available to both user and advertiser, allowing them to see just how wide a reach they get for their marketing money. The creator of a post will be able to see metrics inside of Instagram itself, while business partners will be able to view it through the Facebook Page Insights apps.
Update June 14th, 10:31AM ET: Instagram has clarified where users and businesses will be able to view metrics on sponsored posts.
Razer has been making great laptops for a while with its Blade line. But whether you’re looking at the more portable Razer Blade Stealth or hefty Razer Blade Pro, Razer’s computers all share a similar flaw: the neon green accents, rainbow LED lights, and giant glowing snake logo. While the hardware may match up to other high-end laptops, the Blade line tends to look like a toy compared to offerings from Apple, Microsoft, or Dell.
But at E3 this year, Razer is announcing an updated version of the Blade Stealth that not only fixes the problem of presentability, but also almost every other issue that plagued Razer’s smallest laptop.
The most obvious change to the new Blade Stealth is both the least and most important: Razer is giving the range a new, more professional look. The gunmetal gray variant ditches the glowing Razer logo for a more subtle two-tone one, and swaps the rainbow backlight keys for regular white ones. Razer says that the gunmetal version is specifically designed for customers who want a more professional look from their computers, and, having been able to see a pre-production model of the new color in person, it certainly looks more suited to a work setting than Razer’s original version.
But Razer is also upgrading the Blade Stealth on the hardware front, too. The Blade Stealth now comes in two screen configurations: a full 4K 12-inch panel, which Razer had previously offered, and a new 3200 x 1800, 13.3-inch display that cuts the large bezels in half while keeping the rest of the body of the laptop the same size. The trackpad, which was a particular pain point on the earlier models, has finally been replaced with a Windows Precision Trackpad, which should make the experience of using it better. And Razer is boosting the RAM as well — the Blade Stealth now offers 16GB as standard, instead of only on the top configuration.
The 13.3-inch model starts at $1,399 for a 256GB model and tops out at $1,999 for a 1TB version, while the 12-inch, 4K version offers a choice between a $1,599 computer with 512GB of storage and a 1TB version at $1,999. All models of the updated Stealth offer a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 7500U processor clocked at 2.7GHz, and feature integrated Intel HD Graphics 620.
Between the new hardware that addresses most, if not all of the pain points of the previous model, and a new design that acknowledges that people may want to use Razer’s laptops in a professional setting, the updated Blade Stealth is a good sign from Razer that it’s finally growing up.
The updated Razer Blade Stealth will be available in the standard black color scheme in both the 12-inch and 13.3-inch models on June 14th, with the gunmetal variants  arriving later this summer.

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his intent to nominate Jessica Rosenworcel to fill the open Democratic slot at the Federal Communications Commission.
The selection — revealed quietly, late Tuesday night — marks a return to battle for Rosenworcel at the telecom agency: She served in that same role at the FCC from 2012 to 2016, only departing the commission because Senate lawmakers could not extend her term before the clock ran out at the end of the year.
In her previous stint at the agency, Rosenworcel had been a vocal, ardent supporter of net neutrality, and she voted for rules — drafted by then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler — to subject internet providers to utility-like regulation. This time, however, the agency’s new leader, Republican Chairman Ajit Pai, is looking to scrap those open internet protections.
Otherwise, Rosenworcel has been a forceful, public advocate for FCC policies and programs that seek to close the “homework gap,” as she calls it — the broad disparities in broadband internet service that make it difficult for students, particularly in rural areas, to do their schoolwork.
In the weeks before Trump’s official announcement, Rosenworcel had been widely viewed as the front-runner for her party’s open slot at the FCC, sources previously told Recode. She had the public backing of many congressional Democrats, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who formally recommended her to Trump for the open FCC post.
Sources also had expected Trump to announce Rosenworcel along with a nominee for the FCC’s other open slot — a Republican seat — and it had been widely believed that Brendan Carr, the general counsel at the FCC, would win that position.
Typically, such nominees are paired up in order to improve their chances of a swift confirmation by an ever-partisan U.S. Senate. But Trump opted not to announce his Democratic and Republican nominees together on Tuesday night. That could stoke speculation that Trump actually sees Rosenworcel as a replacement for sitting Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, whose term expires at the end of June.
The White House, for its part, previously has not indicated if it would renominate Clyburn to her post — and a spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday. Without Clyburn or some other Democrat, the FCC would not meet its three-member quorum, preventing it from acting on certain policy issues — including, perhaps, net neutrality.

When Google curtailed its Nexus program last year in favor of the Pixel, many commentators dismissed that as merely a rebranding exercise to make the latest thing feel fresh. I was in the minority that bought into Google's promise of a fundamentally different approach that would signal a direct challenge to Apple's iPhone, but the Pixel was still just the beginning. What we're seeing in recent times, in the ever-swirling rumor mill and through Google's hiring of new engineers, indicates the depth of Google's commitment to taking on Apple at its own game.
I wrote about this at length back in October: the big difference for Apple isn't just software, hardware, or customer service, it's all of those combined. Apple's unmatched strength is in the integration of all the important aspects that go toward building up a satisfying user experience, and it's long been true that the only company that could hope to match Apple was Google, owing to its dominance on the software front with the Android OS. The Pixel showed that Google was willing and able to produce a premium, uniquely differentiated phone (the Pixel camera remains unmatched, many months later), but it obviously wasn't the finished product of Google's grander project.
Apple's hardware lead is built atop a tight control, often monopolization, of its component supply chain. That's exactly where Google looks to be headed, with recent rumors and leaks indicating that the Mountain View company is working hard to secure a reliable source of OLED displays for a presumed Pixel successor with minimal screen bezels in the same vein as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6. That's why indications of an LG-produced Google phone for later this year make so much sense: it's not impossible for Google to still use HTC as its manufacturing partner and source panels from LG Display (which is nominally independent from LG Electronics), but it's more complicated than just going all-in with the Korean supplier.
Just like Apple, Google commands vast reserves of cash that it can deploy to help smooth out its supply deals, and that's exactly what its reported investment in LG Display is building toward. If the original Pixel was a trial run to test out what it's like to source and assemble all your own components, Google's big lesson from it was that demand for its phones will be high — and disappointment in the event of shortages would be even higher. Unlike Apple, Google doesn't yet have the promise of enormous unit sales to dangle as a carrot in front of potential suppliers, but that is liable to change dramatically with this year's Pixel, which would presumably enjoy much wider distribution and marketing than the original.
Two things were revealed yesterday: one is that Google is designing its own system on a chip (SoC) for future mobile devices, and the other is that the lead architect for that project is a man named Manu Gulati, who, until very recently, had been a senior engineer at Apple. Both of these are massive developments, showing that Google won't be content until it has maximum control over every aspect of its smartphone — exactly the same goal that Apple pursues with every new generation of iPhone — and furthermore underlining the level of ambition by poaching away someone who would surely have needed a lot of incentive to leave a job at Apple.
The SoC is the processing heart that powers the vast majority of functions of any modern smartphone, tablet, or smart speaker. Qualcomm's Snapdragon is the most famous and widely used example, Samsung's Exynos is a comparable competitor, and Apple's A series of SoCs are the current gold standard, delivering unmatched performance and efficiency. If Google is determined to not be dependent on another company's whims or fortunes, having its own SoC is an essential part of its future business as a mobile hardware vendor.
The current Pixel is built around the Snapdragon 821 chip — its speed and feature-rich architecture contribute to the excellent Pixel camera — but the instructive example for Google to beware is the Snapdragon 810. Qualcomm had a ton of overheating issues with that piece of silicon, sufficient for Samsung to skip using that chip at all in its Galaxy S6, and Google can't afford to find itself in a similar situation with the Snapdragon 845 or whatever there is down the line. So Google is now building its own SoC, as fully evidenced by its litany of job listings attesting to that ambition.
Beside freeing itself of the unpredictability of relying on other companies for critical components, Google's effort to control all the hardware inside its future devices will help it create more tailored, custom solutions. For instance, look at the way that notifications on the Samsung Galaxy S8 are signaled with a pulse of blue light tracing its way around the edges of its almost bezel-less display — that's nowhere near as impressive on a phone without the S8's sleek design. The coherence and synergy that can be drawn from hardware and software designers working in concert is best demonstrated by Apple, naturally, but I can envision future Google devices that have custom processing modules specifically to power Google's magical camera algorithms. How much better and faster would the Pixel be if its internal components were each designed for specific tasks instead of built to fulfill a generic set of requirements?
We don't know what difference a Google SoC would make to future Pixel phones, but it's obvious that Google is determined to find out. It's probably safe to presume Google is doing similar work to lock down its supply chain for less glamorous parts, like batteries and vibration engines and so on, and not all of it will be ready to debut by this year's end when the Pixel successor comes out. In fact, it's a practical certainty that Google's mobile processor is years away from making its debut in a consumer product, but that just goes to underline that Google is in this for the long haul. The Android maker has decided that building its own version of the iPhone is the best way to compete with the iPhone.
After years of neglect, Metroid is back: yesterday Nintendo revealed two new entries in the iconic sci-fi exploration series. One, Metroid Prime 4 on Switch, isn’t due for some time. But the Nintendo 3DS title Samus Returns is launching on September 15th, and it’s not just the first proper Metroid game since 2010 — it’s also a return to the series’s roots. Samus Returns is a remake of Metroid II on the original Game Boy, and it’s the first traditional 2D Metroid release in over a decade. The announcement may have come as a surprise to many, but it’s far from a new idea for series co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto. “I’ve been wanting to create a 2D Metroid for a while,” he says.
I had a chance to play through a 20-minute demo that represented the opening sequence of the game. Just like in the original Metroid II, Samus Returns opens with the titular bounty landing on the desolate planet SR388, and then exploring hostile caves home to angry aliens, including energy-sucking metroids. As in most Metroid games, you start pretty powerless; you need to seek out abilities like the morph ball and charge shot, which in turn help you open up new areas to explore. Samus Returns is a 2D game that features three-dimensional graphics, but the more detailed visuals don’t slow down the pace at all. In fact, Samus Returns is a much tighter action experience compared to the now-ancient Metroid II. Samus can now aim in any direction, and chain together attacks; if you time it right you can bat away an enemy and then immediately blast it with a critical laser shot. It feels fast and fluid, with a sense of immediacy that fits well with the series.
Outside of its tighter action and more detailed visuals, Samus Returns also includes a number of enhancements based around the 3DS hardware. For one thing, it’s the rare game that actually makes great use of the handheld’s glasses-free 3D effect, lending a sense of depth to the world. I found myself stopping to catch details in the background, like the corpses of unlucky cave explorers, and — unlike almost every other 3DS game I’ve played — I didn’t want to turn the 3D effect off. Meanwhile, the second screen is also put to use by displaying the in-game map at all times, making exploration a little easier. You can even place pins on the map, just like in Breath of the Wild, to remember areas you might want to explore later. (Sakamoto says he “wasn’t actually aware” of that feature being in the latest Legend of Zelda game.)
Sakamoto served as the designer on the original Metroid, and he directed its successor, Super Metroid. But he didn’t actually work on Metroid II. That said, he believes the portable game has an important place within the series — which is one of the main reasons he wanted to remake it. “In terms of Metroid II, that was a Game Boy game. It was quite a while back, and it hadn’t been revisited,” he explains. “Metroid II I feel has a really important place in the Metroid franchise’s history. It introduces us to baby metroid for the first time, and there are a lot of important elements in that title.” While Sakamoto is helming the production, the game is actually being developed as a collaboration between Nintendo and Spanish studio Mercury Steam, whose best-known work is arguably the Castlevania reboot Lords of Shadow in 2010. “It’s this really nice meld of each company’s experience and ideas, and the flavors that we bring to the series,” Sakamoto says of the collaborative process between the two developers.
Of course, as with any reimagining, there’s always the potential that any new features in Samus Returns could dilute the essence of the original experience. Metroid is known for its challenging gameplay and moody atmosphere, and with better aiming, faster action, and a more useful map, it’s possible that some of that feeling will be lost in Samus Returns. It’s a question the development team struggled with when they started working on the game two years ago. “What do we do to preserve some of that originality yet add to it?” asks Sakamoto. “I think the key is that you’re only adding things that improve upon that core concept. You’re not changing things just to change things. It’s really not that different from creating a game from scratch — you’re just looking to build something fun and enjoyable.”
Metroid: Samus Returns is a game that fans have been asking for for quite some time. And for Sakamoto, announcing the title yesterday provided a profound sense of relief — it’s both a game fans were clamoring for and a game he yearned to make. “I’ve had this sense of anticipation,” he says of the E3 reveal. “I wanted to talk about it, I wanted to tell people that we’re doing this.”
Everyone loves a good supercar: gorgeous, aerodynamic, laughably out of reach for almost everyone on the planet. We love to drool over photos of these cars, fully aware that we’ll probably never drive one. McLaren wants to change that perception with the release of the 2018 570S Spider, calling it the “most attainable” sports car ever.
This model is the third body type in McLaren’s Sport series portfolio, which includes the 570S Coupe and the 570GT. (We last saw the 570S Coupe at the 2015 New York Auto Show, and were appropriately bowled over by it.) The 570S Spider will make its global debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, which will be held in the UK June 29th–July 2nd.
The 570S Spider is motivated by a 562-horsepower, 3.8-liter twin-turbo V8 engine. The 0–60 mph comes in 3.1 seconds with a top speed of 204 mph. Those acceleration specs are a fraction slower than the 675LT Spider, but identical to the 570S Coupe. One of the neatest features is the 570S Spider’s retractable, hardtop roof that takes 15 seconds to open or close and can be engaged at vehicle speeds of up 25 mph. Top speed with the top down is 196 mph, so hang on to your hat.
McLaren says the first 400 units of the 570S Spider will be “launch edition models,” and will be priced at $208,000 each. That’s almost $200,000 less than the 675LT Spider and $120,000 less than the 650S Spider. So attainable! The convertible comes in two colors: “Sicilian Yellow” and “Vega Blue.”
Up until the official start of E3 on Tuesday, Nintendo’s presence has been limited to appearing on the stages of other companies. Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, confirmed with an appearance from Shigeru Miyamoto himself at Ubisoft’s press conference, is being produced by that publisher. Downloadable Zelda-themed Skyrim items appeared during the Bethesda event. And a giant Switch showed up in Microsoft’s presentation on Minecraft.
No wonder Nintendo didn’t bother with a big stage show at E3. Once again, the company opted for a prerecorded 30-minute Nintendo Direct stream, filled with announcements and gameplay footage.
The idea that E3 can be “won” grows more dubious every year, and comparing Nintendo with the likes of Sony or Microsoft is a fool’s errand. Those two companies go toe-to-toe over 4K, console exclusives, and who has the most teraflops of processing power in their latest machines. Nintendo’s announcements often feel more like the company is in competition with itself. Which announcement features the cutest stuff? Is it the amiibo? An old franchise reimagined with clay or yarn? Mario’s personified hat?
Nintendo doesn’t care about having the most powerful console ever; it just wants to rekindle childlike glee.
And, it works. Sometimes.
Nintendo’s presence on the E3 show floor is impossible to miss. Following in the footsteps of last year’s Breath of the Wild-themed exhibit, Nintendo has opted for a re-creation of New Donk City — the New York knockoff featured in Super Mario Odyssey.
By opening its doors to the public for the first time ever, E3 is on its way to becoming more of a show about fan service than ever before. The event now seems to be competing with fan conventions like Comic-Con or PAX. Lavish installations are not new to E3, but they’re increasingly extravagant. And Nintendo might just have the most impressive one at the show this year. It helps to have a strong new franchise like Mario preparing for another launch; it’s even better if fans consider your decked-out booth a must-see.
Nintendo was tight-lipped about its two most exciting announcements ahead of the show. Now we know Gamefreak is working on a “core” Pokémon RPG for the console. Nintendo also announced a new Metroid game — Metroid 4 — the first game in the Prime series in a decade. And it showed a remake of Metroid 2 for 3DS.
The first two games appear to be early in development, and Nintendo gave no clues as to when either would be released.
Nintendo will finish out the second half of 2017 with the launch of Arms, Splatoon 2, Pokken Tournament, and Super Mario Odyssey. Today, we learned that we’ll also get Metroid: Samus Returns on 3DS in September, while Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Rocket League launch this holiday. DLC for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will launch at the end of this month.
In 2018, fans can expect new Kirby and Yoshi games for the Switch. That leaves a lot of question marks for the future of the console after the holiday season. Though we expect Nintendo to reveal more in the coming months.
Pre-E3, it was believable that Nintendo would boost the Switch’s lineup with a new — or at least ported — version of Smash Bros. But, no such luck. Nintendo is trying to push into the competitive gaming scenes with Splatoon and Arms. No Smash Bros. on Switch feels like a missed opportunity.
And, while we’re on the subject of MIA games: where is the new Animal Crossing?
Nintendo has had little to say about its third-party support. Sure, we’ve got the Rabbids gaming coming and some Zelda-themed gear in Skyrim when the game launches for Switch, but the company has yet to reveal a killer exclusive beyond its own properties.



Like most days that end in tragedy, I woke up filled with anticipation. The weather forecast was excellent: 80 degrees, sunny, and very little wind — a rarity for the unpredictable Dutch coast, especially for a Sunday. Perfect conditions for my friend, a gregarious Frenchman, to bring his new Mavic Pro drone to the beach.
The first gin and tonic was served at noon.
My friend, let's call him Clouseau, had flown his drone just a few times prior because it's illegal to fly drones in the city center of Amsterdam where he lives. This would be his second visit to the unrestricted airspace of the coastline.
I had mixed emotions about him bringing the drone to the beach where I own what amounts to a glorified shipping container stuffed with mattresses and a fridge. Clouseau was a nuisance to my neighbors on his first visit. Often he'd leave the drone and its 4K video camera noisily hovering over the heads of scantily clad adults and sand-baked children. He’d do this for minutes at a time as he acquainted himself with the controller. Clouseau had absolute trust in the drone's ability to stay safely aloft while he learned to pilot the craft, literally, on the fly.
If you've ever flown a modern-day drone then it's easy to understand his confidence. The jump in intelligence from those Christmas-morning quadcopters to what DJI now produces is staggering in its progress. The way the diminutive Mavic Pro hovers in the air, glued to a spot in three dimensions as if tethered by invisible guylines is stupefying to a novice. The Mavic Pro’s impressively long list of autonomous skills are enough to give anyone an infallible sense of security.
The day went by without incident. Clouseau heeded my request to fly high and far, and as a result, my neighbors this time greeted us with curiosity instead of annoyance. By sunset we were alone: me, Clouseau, his Mavic Pro, and a dozen or so empty soldiers of tonic.
Ten minutes later the $999 drone would die in the sea, still three miles from shore.
Clouseau knew that the Mavic Pro's maximum range was seven kilometers. But he had become so dazzled by the Mavic Pro's ability to avoid all matters of trouble that he decided to explore the wind farm, barely visible on the horizon. And despite my pleading, and numerous warnings from the controller itself, he sent the drone past the point of no return — convinced that it would override his control and return automatically if there was any real risk. It was too late by the time he turned around.
Heading back fast yet still five kilometers from shore, Clouseau received a final warning that the battery was critically low and that the drone would make an emergency landing.
Beep.
Beep.
Beep.
The Mavic Pro had flatlined, yet the controller continued to send out a signal to come home. We listened to that goddamn bleeping for a nauseating 10 minutes while Clouseau hoped against hope that his expensive drone would somehow return. It never did, lost to the unforgiving North Sea forever.
It was then that I understood those stories of people driving off cliffs while blithely following the instructions of their GPS navigators. I'm also reminded of Arthur C. Clarke's adage that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
I watched an intelligent man do something incredibly moronic after becoming awestruck by an advanced technology. He was drunk; impaired by the gin but intoxicated by a magic he didn't understand, yet trusted beyond reason.
It’s a fatal elixir of blind faith in technology that will only become more potent, I fear, with the advances still to come.
Microsoft is preparing to launch a big overhaul of its Xbox Live Avatars system. Originally released as an Xbox 360 feature in 2008, Xbox Live Avatars have been slowly tweaked to include more props and customizability ever since. Microsoft is now introducing a new avatar system that’s designed to make these Xbox avatars a lot more customizable, with a huge focus on diversity.
The new avatars will let you fully customize your online character with new body type options, clothing, and props. During the Xbox daily briefing at E3 yesterday, Microsoft demonstrated the new avatar system with a trailer (above) and some behind-the-scenes footage of how the company is building the new Xbox Live Avatars. Microsoft’s trailer shows an amputee, playful costumes, wheelchairs, skateboards, and even motorbikes to demonstrate the wide array of props and customization. There’s even a new pregnancy option, and the ability to control the colors of an avatar with a picker system.

“We built these from the ground-up, they’re being built in Unity which is a whole new engine,” explains Bryan Saftler, a lead product manager at Xbox. “Avatars are meant for whatever you want your digital self to represent. We don’t want to put you in a box, there are no more checkboxes, no matter what you think you look like or what you want to present online.”
Microsoft’s focus on diversity also means that if you want to wear a dress on your avatar you can thanks to gender-neutral clothing and props. “If you can see it in the store you can wear it, we’re not holding you to any type of checkboxes,” says Kathryn Storm, interaction designer at Xbox.
It looks like Microsoft has done a really good job with these new avatars. The software maker is now planning to release what it calls its “Avatar 2.0” system to Windows 10 users first later this year, with the Xbox family of devices to follow.
AI isn’t going to be a threat to humanity because it’s evil or cruel, AI will be a threat to humanity because we haven’t properly explained what it is we want it to do. Consider the classic “paperclip maximizer” thought experiment, in which an all-powerful AI is told, simply, “make paperclips.” The AI, not constrained by any human morality or reason, does so, eventually transforming all resources on Earth into paperclips, and wiping out our species in the process. As with any relationship, when talking to our computers, communication is key.
That’s why a new piece of research published yesterday by Google’s DeepMind and the Elon Musk-funded OpenAI institute is so interesting. It offers a simple way for humans to give feedback to AI systems — crucially, without the instructor needing to know anything about programming or artificial intelligence.
The method is a variation of what’s known as “reinforcement learning” or RL. With RL systems, a computer learns by trial-and-error, repeating the same task over and over, while programmers direct its actions by setting certain reward criteria. For example, if you want a computer to learn how to play Atari games (something DeepMind has done in the past) you might make the game’s point system the reward criteria. Over time, the algorithm will learn to play in a way that best accrues points, often leading to super-human performance.
What DeepMind and OpenAI’s researchers have done is replace this predefined reward criteria with a much simpler feedback system. Humans are shown an AI performing two versions of the same task and simply tell it which is better. This happens again and again, and eventually the systems learns what is expected of it. Think of it like getting an eye test, when you’re looking through different lenses, and being asked over and over: better... or worse? Here’s what that looks like when teaching a computer to play the classic Atari game Q*bert:
This method of feedback is surprisingly effective, and researchers were able to use it to train an AI to play a number of Atari video games, as well perform simulated robot tasks (like picking telling an arm to pick up a ball). This better / worse reward function could even be used to program trickier behavior, like teaching a very basic virtual robot how to backflip. That’s how we get to the GIF at the top of the page. The behavior you see has been created by watching the “Hopper” bot jump up and down, and telling it “well done” when it gets a bit closer to doing a backflip. Over time, it learns how.
Of course, no one is suggesting this method is a cure-all for teaching AI. There are a number of big downsides and limitations in using this sort of feedback. The first being that although it doesn’t take much skill on behalf of the human operator, it does take time. For example, in teaching the “Hopper” bot to backflip, a human was asked to judge its behavior some 900 times — a process that took about an hour. The bot itself had to work through 70 hours of simulated training time, which was sped up artificially.
For some simple tasks, says Oxford Robotics researcher Markus Wulfmeier (who was not involved in this research), it would be quicker for a programmer to simply define what it is they wanted. But, says Wulfmeier, it’s “increasingly important to render human supervision more effective” for AI systems, and this paper “represents a small step in the right direction.”
DeepMind and OpenAI say pretty much the same — it’s a small step, but a promising one, and in the future, they’re looking to apply it to more and more complex scenarios. Speaking to The Verge over email, DeepMind researcher Jan Leike said: “The setup described in [our paper] already scales from robotic simulations to more complex Atari games, which suggests that the system will scale further.” Leike suggests the next step is to test it in more varied 3D environments. You can read the full paper describing the work here.
The Uber board member who made a sexist remark during today’s meeting about the prevalence of sexism within the company has resigned from his position. David Bonderman’s resignation from Uber’s board was first announced by The New York Times, and confirmed in a statement by Bonderman himself, in which he said his comment was “careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable.”
Bonderman was recorded making the remark in reply to to fellow board member Arianna Huffington, who was speaking about the need for more female representation on Uber’s board. When “there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,” Huffington said, to which Bonderman shot back “what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking.”

Bonderman — who helped found TPG, a private equity firm — said that the comment “came across in a way that was the opposite of what I intended,” but that he understood “the destructive effect it had,” and that he took full responsibility for it.
Uber is currently considering the findings of the so-called Holder Report: an internal investigation into claims of sexual harassment and a toxic sexist attitude within the company. Bonderman noted the report in his statement, saying that he had been working with the company for six months on the report, and recognized “the importance of implementing [its] requirements” for the future of the company.
His resignation will come into effect from tomorrow morning, and comes as Uber continues to hemorrhage executives and major figures. Earlier in the day, CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed that he was also taking a leave of absence from the company.
Smart speakers are the hottest new category in gadgets, and if Qualcomm has its way, there’s going to be a ton more of them starting next year.
Qualcomm is about to make it really easy for hardware companies to start building their own speakers. It’s introducing a reference design — basically, a preset configuration of chips, microphone tech, and audio systems — that companies can buy to base their products off of.
This isn’t something you’ll see a company like Amazon use. But smaller companies that want to create their own take on an Echo will be able to pick it up to quickly turn around a new product. It saves a bunch of time on testing, since Qualcomm guarantees everything will work together, which lets products get to market faster.
Qualcomm’s Smart Audio Platform includes most of the core tech needed in a smart speaker (aside from the actual speaker). It has far-field microphone systems, with support for beamforming, echo cancellation, and wake words. It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (including aptX HD for hi-res audio streaming), as well as support for Qualcomm’s AllPlay speaker speaker syncing system. And it’s generally designed to support the integration of voice assistants, like Alexa.
AllPlay isn’t a widely used system, which somewhat tempers the excitement here. Qualcomm advertises its new platform as being able to support synchronized playback between speakers, setting up zones, and even handling multi-channel surround sound, but that all relies on someone owning a bunch of AllPlay speakers. That might be more likely if a bunch of speakers roll out in the coming years with Qualcomm inside. But until then, these are mostly just going to be standard Bluetooth speakers.
Qualcomm says the first products based on its system should arrive by the end of the year, but it expects the pace to pick up in 2018.
Dave McCarthy is the Head of Xbox Operations and General Manager of Xbox Services, meaning he’s been deeply involved in the lead up to the reveal of Xbox One X. We had a chance to sit down with McCarthy at Microsoft’s E3 event space in downtown Los Angeles and talk about a range of topics, from how the company plans to explain native 4K to potential customers, how Minecraft has influenced Sea of Thieves, and why the company’s press event had fewer big budget first-party games and timed downloadable content (DLC) exclusives.
Let’s start with the DLC.
We saw “Console Launch Exclusive” through the Xbox E3 presentation, but we didn't see what had become really common in the last five years: timed downloadable content exclusives. Is Microsoft is still pursuing these partnerships with third-party developer or did any of those games show have DLC partnerships?
So the launch exclusive terminology that we use basically means, in simple terms, it's either going to appear first on Xbox or only on Xbox. And we can provide the breakdown of that afterwards, if you want to see that title breakdown. All of the AAA blockbusters are going to be across the Xbox One family of devices. They're going to play great on One, they're going to play spectacularly on Xbox One S. And they'll play even better on Xbox One X overall.
To clarify, it sounds like you're saying you're not focusing on third-party exclusives with DLC and that it's more about the best place a game’s going to run is on the Xbox One X?
We firmly believe that the best place to play these titles, all these titles, would be on the Xbox One X.
And no third-party exclusives for DLC?
The only exclusives were the ones we shared onstage yesterday.
You just got the first taste yesterday of what we're doing with original Xbox compatibility. We'll have a lot more titles obviously to announce. I was saying to somebody, the audaciousness of supporting three generations across the Xbox One family of devices. The first couple of times that Phil [Spencer] brought it up in the leadership team, you got kind of the nervous chuckles around the table, like oh, he's probably not serious when he says, hey, wouldn't it be cool if. He stuck with it, and when he sticks with everything in the leadership team discussion, they're like okay, I guess we're going to make this happen. So it was really cool to see us release the news on Crimson Skies yesterday as the first one, but there will be more to come! It's the same team that actually worked on the Xbox 360 backward compatibility overall. So these are our best and brightest compatibility minds looking at things. So watch this space!
Seeing is believing, obviously, with a lot of this stuff, right? You see the difference with the weather effects and the heat coming off the car and the details [in Forza 7]. You know, if Anthem looked great from Bioware on the amazing 4K screen in The Galen Center yesterday. So a little bit of it is seeing is believing. But I get back to more of this: you're going to notice a difference on your existing games, you're going to notice a difference where developers in both first-party and third-party do these free 4K upgrades that we noticed yesterday, across a large number of titles overall. And then when somebody's taking advantage of the frame buffer and you know, Dolby Atmos, and the wide color gamut, and all of the bells and whistles, it's going to be hard not to notice the difference.
Are you concerned that, right now, a lot of people don’t have 4K TVs? Even if they do, things don't probably stream in 4K from their cable box. Maybe they aren't even watching 4K on YouTube because of their wireless connection. What steps are you taking to put people in these environments where they're going to see what you’re describing?
Sure, right. There will be obviously some retail partnerships that we look at. Demo experiences that we'll do. I wouldn't say from a 1080p TV perspective you're going to be all that disappointed either, right? I mean you have automatic super sampling from the Xbox One X to your 1080p TV. It's still going to look pretty damn amazing. In fact, at home, I've been running this setup. We've had the kits for a couple of months now, and it's remarkable how I literally took the Xbox One X home, I put it on top of my Xbox One S. I pulled the HDMI cable out of the S, pulled it into the S. I literally re-synced my controller, using the one button touch. I had all my games on my external hard drive, plugged it in [to the X]. There was no install time. It was all running.
And I was sitting with my son and I didn't even tell him what the box was. He turns to me within five minutes and he's like, "Dad, what's happening with this box? Why is it running faster? Why does my game look different and better overall? And I said, "Well, I can't tell you right now, son. But--"

Can you explain how a game made by a third-party developer that doesn’t have Xbox One X will be improved? What type of differences specifically can we expect to see on the Xbox One X?
So you'll definitely see faster load times, because you've got a faster hard drive than Xbox One S.  Most titles are doing some notion of dynamic frame rate and their titles and if they will, you will see, unless they're locking at a certain number, because certain developers make the choice to do that, you're going to see a smoother frame rate. You're going to see better texture filtering, with them doing nothing overall, and then you're going to see most of them make use of dynamic resolution in their design right now. So you should see the highest possible resolution of textures in the game as well, without them touching a thing. All of those things will be true without them touching a thing.
So on older games, if the frame rate isn't capped, we’ll see frame rate improvements?
Yeah and consistency, for sure. Yeah, exactly.

Is Microsoft working on mobile game projects anymore, or is that on the back burner? Will we see Play Anywhere games on smartphones?
I mean in addition to Minecraft, some people kind of laugh at this, but Solitaire is one of our huge Live drivers on Windows 10 right now. I think it's moving into other interesting areas as well. You know, Mixer had a huge presence in the show yesterday, right? We talk about this split between the hour spent watching and playing games overall. The mobile client for Mixer's huge for us overall, in terms of consumption. Again, Live links that altogether overall. So I think you'll see more of us doing stuff across devices with Live at the center of all that we do and Mixer is the next big push as part of that.

Dave McCarthy: Franchises like Halo and Gears of War are still hugely important in our ecosystem. We made a really conscious decision with [the E3 event] and we were linked in arms throughout the leadership team on this: that we wanted to show every type of game for every type of gamer. And that was different from what we've done before, but it was a really conscious decision about where gamers are right now in the landscape. There are some that value 4K showcases. For some, community games really speak to them. [Showing] PlayerUnkown’s Battlegrounds was a big deal, right. I think console users — there's a lot of them out there that don't understand how big Battlegrounds is going to be. And it is, it is a huge deal, it's such an innovative format that really sucks you in when you try it.
We needed to create space in our briefing for that. We needed to create space for games around the world. We consciously chose to go around the globe a bit. And we wanted to showcase indie developers with titles like Cuphead and Artful Escape.
It's just a really conscious decision for us to go across the board and show the variation in the gaming landscape right now, which I think Xbox is well-positioned for because we do have the strong service for devices — because we do have Windows 10 in the same company — and we work closely with the team to make stuff happen there.
So it's a matter of consciously saying, hey there's a story we want to tell, that we're offering a ton of choice, regardless of what kind of gameplay type that you gravitate to.

The Verge: A couple of years ago, a number of Xbox employees spoke with me about Minecraft as a template the company could learn from, and build upon. Moving forward to the present, are there any examples of Microsoft is building off the Minecraft template with a new project?
Dave McCarthy: I would say some of the learning from Minecraft has even made its way into Sea of Thieves. So when we take a premiere studio like Rare “offline” for the past couple of years, there's been a lot of good learning from the team back and forth, especially around things involving the community in design. So what I really like about what the Rare team has done, they've really embraced this using our insider program to bring the community onboard. They're regularly giving feedback across both PC and our Xbox One panel of devices on how to design the game, what those sort of multi-screen considerations are. They're both going to be doing some interesting and innovative things with Mixer, both from an interactivity standpoint and things like co-streaming that have come out out there. So I do see it filtering into some of the studios, I think we'll see more around the idea of in-game marketplaces, I think Minecraft is really leading the way there overall. So it really has been a good education piece for us, but I think it's really interesting to see how it affects new IP development and I've seen some really neat interactions between the teams there.

E3 2017 has officially kicked off, and thousands of journalists, gaming industry people, and, for the first time ever, members of the public have flooded the Los Angeles Convention Center for the largest gaming show in the world. And virtually everyone seemed to be packing Nintendo’s massive E3 booth for a chance to get their hands on Super Mario Odyssey, the upcoming Mario adventure for the Nintendo Switch.
So it’s fitting that the booth is decked out as New Donk City — one of the levels in Odyssey — from top to bottom. Times Square-esque billboards line the walls, Donkey Kong-themed street signs pop out over the crowd, and crosswalk indicators are actually with Mario “?” blocks. On one side, you can find a Crazy Cap store (as seen in the trailer) handing out Cappy visors, while New Donk City flags proudly fly on the opposite walls. But until Nintendo decides to come up with some sort of virtual reality solution, the booth is probably the closest you’ll ever get to being in New Donk City. Aside from visiting the real New York City it’s based off, anyway.
At the front of the booth is a massive, life-sized re-creation of Mario, Cappy, and the new airship he’ll be piloting in Super Mario Odyssey, while scattered around the booth are statues of the various enemies that Mario will be able to transform into through the new “Capture” mechanic in Odyssey, also all built to proper scale. (On a related note, Goombas are much larger in real life than you’d necessarily think.)
Nintendo is also taking advantage of the Switch’s portable nature with the booth, with demo stations scattered everywhere, from rows of flat screens to smaller tables. There are even some park benches, where you can try out Super Mario Odyssey while being guided by a besuited denizen of New Donk City, just like in the game. (Although unlike in the game, it does not seem that the demo staff will have have to worry about being possessed by a magic hat.) Lines stretched out in all directions for a chance for the 10-minute demo, and the booth was completely packed from wall to wall with fans eagerly waiting their turn.
Of course, Nintendo has a few other games at E3 that aren’t Super Mario Odyssey. There were demo stations set up for Splatoon 2, ARMS, Fire Emblem Warriors, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, FIFA 18, Sonic Forces, and Pokkén Tournament DX toward the back of the booth. There was also a full fledged e-sports arena for some of the tournaments Nintendo will be holding over the course of the conference.
There is something inherently insect-like about the New York City commute: swarms of people crammed together into subway cars, piling into elevators, buzzing around the streets. To make the metaphor literal, 20,000 European honeybees joined the commute this morning, blocking the entrance to Vox Media's headquarters in downtown Manhattan.
Passersby stopped to marvel at the scene, phones in hand, snapping pictures. “Oh my gosh!” a woman shrieked. “New York City!” someone else yelled. “Yeah! Save the bees!” shouted a young woman with short, blond hair and colorful tights.
Hovering around the scene was beekeeper Katherine Morris, wearing a white hazmat suit and army green All Stars. She was waiting for another beekeeper to arrive — Andrew Coté, an independent beekeeper who works for Andrew’s Honey and sometimes helps out the city — so that the swarming bees could be scooped up in a bucket and carried to another beehive.
But why were the bees commuting, and why here?
Swarming is common when the temperatures rise, Morris explained. In fact, there have been dozens of swarming incidents already this season in New York City, according to Coté. “This is as natural as a kitten up a tree,” he says.
A bee colony generally hosts about 30,000 to 50,000 bees at one time, but when it gets warm, the queens produce a lot of new bees. This makes the colony huge, Morris says. When the colony is too large, the queen will take a third of it and fly to find another spot, says Morris. Or, if another queen was born in the beehive, she’ll leave with some followers. A beehive, after all, can have only one queen.
The honeybees grappling on the side of the Vox Media building were just waiting. Search parties — hundreds of scouts — had already been sent out to scour the area for a place to build a new hive. The building wasn’t ideal for that; bees like wood.
No one is sure where the bees started their commute, though. There are several beehives in Battery Park, at the southern tip of Manhattan, Morris says, as well as on the rooftops of several downtown buildings. (New York City legalized beekeeping in 2010, and bees are used for making honey or pollinating city gardens.) Today’s swarming bees likely came from one of those hives, but it’s impossible to pin down the exact origin.
Of course, when it comes to bees, there’s the question of the sting, which can be dangerous to people with allergies. These bees, however, were unlikely to sting — likely only if they were poked or prodded. “They don’t want to leave the queen because they’re the workers,” Morris says. “They’re there to protect her.” Besides, they had no hive to protect, a usual source of human-bee conflict.
A little after noon, Coté arrived in a white pickup truck. “Where is it?” he asked Morris as he stepped beyond the yellow tape. He turned, saw the swarm, and smiled. He was wearing a beige “I [bee] NY” jacket, which included a net to protect his face from stings. Then Coté, Morris, and a few other beekeepers got to work.
The first plan was to vacuum up the bees into a bucket, but the vacuum’s power cord didn’t work. So Coté gathered several cardboard boxes and brushed the bees off the wall using a thin, long brush with yellow bristles. As some of the bees were scooped into the box, hundreds of bees pushed off from the wall, forming a big cloud. Over the city noise, it was possible to hear a light buzzing. After the bees calmed down a bit, they were scooped again from the cardboard box into a larger wooden box filled with beehive frames. The whole thing was then placed inside a larger cardboard box of Bella dinner napkins and taped, so that the bees couldn’t get out.
“That’s not closed! Look at it!” Coté shouted as the other beekeepers used duct tape to close up the box. “It’s not closed!” The duct taping continued.
Coté says he isn’t sure where the honeybees will be transported. He will likely add them to existing beehives, especially ones that are struggling because they don’t have enough bees. After over an hour, the vacuum was finally put to work, and about a thousand bees were sucked up.
The box was finally loaded onto Coté’s pickup truck. Dozens of bees were still scattered around the street — without the rest of the colony, they will get lost and die, Coté says. But so it goes.
Once the insects were safely removed, the people on the streets swarmed forth again, buzzing in and out of their offices. The cloud of bees was gone, and so was the crowd of humans.

Oh, Uber. You’d think you’d be able to get through your very important meeting today about fixing your problems with pervasive sexism and harassment without someone making a really dumb, misogynistic joke. But alas, it was not to be.
Based on leaked audio from today’s all-hands meeting obtained by Yahoo Finance, Uber board member David Bonderman, founder of TPG Capital, made the crack after a remark by his fellow board member Arianna Huffington regarding the need for more female representation on Uber’s board.
Huffington said that when “there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board.” Bonderman’s response — “what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking” — would have been inappropriate in any context, let alone in the middle of a high-profile meeting about your company’s harassment and marginalization of female employees.
So... This just happened at @Uber's all-hands meeting. @YahooFinance's @JPManga got some leaked audio. 6:40 min https://t.co/QHXOp7TU0h pic.twitter.com/bqBLonNp49
Reactions to Bonderman’s dumb joke were quick and unapologetic.
Insane. An Uber director's casual jokey misogyny during a presentation explaining how he and the rest of the board are fixing its culture https://t.co/6qhWD8Ukml
Well, this a good way to undercut the whole 'zero tolerance for sexism' policy six minutes into Uber 2.0 https://t.co/6pL3Q2pNDO
Incredible. Within first 10 minutes of Uber all-hands meeting today, a board member makes a sexist joke. https://t.co/iurWrXTOXw pic.twitter.com/ngQW6uS5J3
Soon after the news of Bonderman’s tone-deaf remark, he sent an apology to Uber’s employees via the head of the company’s human resources department. “I want to apologize to my fellow board member for a disrespectful comment that was directed at her during today's discussion,” he said, in a statement provided by his investment firm. “It was inappropriate. I also want to apologize to all Uber employees who were offended by the remark. I deeply regret it.” A short time later, he resigned from the board, saying that he didn’t want to be a “distraction” while the company dealt with the Holder Report.
Update June 13th, 10:00PM ET: David Bonderman has submitted his resignation from Uber’s board after his sexist remark was reported.
Today, Google announced an expansion to its Play Store with its new Android Excellence program. Curated by Google’s editorial team, Android Excellence features rotating collections of apps that deliver a superb Android user experience, utilize many of Google’s “best practices,” and “have great design, technical performance, localization, and device optimization.” Broken down into two categories of apps and games, Android Excellence appears in Google’s newly revamped Editor’s Choice section.
The announcement comes after Apple’s recent WWDC debut of its overhauled App Store, with a new interface and shifted focus on discovery and how-tos. It also has a new way to highlight apps — the App Store’s upgraded landing page will feature one new app a day, opening possibilities for up-and-coming developers and encouraging daily visits.
While Google’s Android Excellence program is more extensive, the lists will only be updated quarterly, a move that might not serve users as much as it does developers (who can reap exposure for months). Also a bummer  — there are no descriptions to explain why editors select apps for Android Excellence, the way they do for other Google Play categories, like “5 Travel Apps for Your Next Adventure.”
Regardless, if you want to see what Google deems the best of the best, Android Excellence kicks off today in the Google Play Store. Below, their first round of selects.

If all the small enhancements to the iPad Pro 10.5 aren't speaking to you, good deals on the original 9.7-inch Pro have arrived. As spotted by 9to5Toys, Best Buy is offering a one-day-only deal on the 32GB 9.7-inch Pro right now: $449.99, which is $150 off the typical $599.99 asking price.
The main reason to grab a Pro model over the recently released $329 iPad model is Pencil support, but, of course, the Pencil isn't included with the Pro models, it's an extra $99. Also, Apple's Smart Keyboard covers for the 9.7-inch Pro aren't compatible with the 10.5-inch Pro, so that's something else to watch out for. Basically this isn't the greatest deal in tablets, but it is a good tablet that's about to get a lot more interesting with iOS 11. And $450, or $400 if you want to dig around for a refurbished model, is certainly more accessible than the $650 Apple wants for the 10.5-inch new stuff.
For years, experts have warned of vulnerabilities in the network that routes phone calls and cellular service — but those attacks may be more widespread than anyone realized. For more than a year, a Tor Hidden Service has been offering ongoing access to telecom’s private SS7 network for as little as $500 a month. Combined with known vulnerabilities, that access could be used to intercept texts, track the location of an individual phone, or cut off cellular service entirely.
Accessible on Tor at zkkc7e5rwvs4bpxm.onion, the “Interconnector” service offers a variety of services charged as monthly fees, including $250 to intercept calls or texts, $500 for full access, or $150 for cellphone reports (including location data and IMSI numbers). Well-heeled users can even pay $5,500 for direct access to the SS7 port, billed as “everything you need to start your own service.”
One customer wrote to The Verge with complaints about the service, claiming to have paid the site’s fee only to be ignored by the site’s manager, never receiving access to the SS7 dashboard. Others have gone as far as labeling it a scam. The site responded to the concerns earlier today, promising a free page to test the service next week, although access to the site will be heavily limited.
Still, the offering is consistent with what we know about SS7 hacking. Unlike the internet, the SS7 network is a closed network, only meant to be accessed by a handful of telecom companies. As a result, there are few authentication systems in place once a user is on the network. In the past, researchers have raised concerns about SS7 attacks that hacked into telecom company systems remotely, or directly reprogrammed leased equipment like a femtocell.
The site’s manager, who goes by the name Interconnect0r, declined to say how she was able to maintain access, but said it did not present significant technical difficulties, despite regular intervention from phone companies. She also said many others were maintaining access to the SS7 network using similar methods.
“It’s easier than you would think,” she told The Verge. “It’s difficult to wrap your mind around how [easy], unless you've got the right guidance, or stumble upon the right information.”
Most of the vulnerabilities in the SS7 have been known for years, although little has been done to fix them. In 2014, Karsten Nohl first demonstrated how the SS7 system could be used to track a user’s physical location, and subsequent work showed how bad actors on the network could intercept texts and redirect calls. Those attacks could break two-factor authentication, intercepting an SMS or audio call sent through the compromised network.
In 2016, Nohl used the vulnerabilities to track the location of an iPhone belonging to Congressman Ted Lieu as part of a demonstration for CBS’s 60 Minutes. The following March, Rep. Lieu and Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly raising concerns about the issue, hoping to spur more aggressive fixes from telecom carriers.
“We are deeply concerned that the security of America’s telecommunications infrastructure is not getting the attention it deserves,” the letter reads. “Most americans simply have no idea how easy it is for a relatively sophisticated adversary to track their movements, tap their calls, and hack their smartphones.”
Update 4:12PM ET: Updated with the complaints about the service.
Manfrotto is most well-known for its tripods and other camera accessories, but today it’s further expanding beyond that market with the launch of four new camera-oriented backpacks and messenger bags. All the Bumblebee-line bags are fabricated out of a rain-proof material that reflects sunlight. They also include a stretchable band specifically designed to hold a gimbal, but it can be used to hold a lens, too. The backpacks cost more than the messenger bags and start at $229.99. The cheapest messenger bag costs $129.99.
The most expensive and impressive bag, the Bumblee-230 PL, can hold a DSLR with a 70-200/2.8 lens attached and 10 additional lenses, or an attached 400/2.8 lens with five additional lenses. It can be rearranged to hold a video camera and features a 17-inch laptop compartment as well. The bag is pictured above and certainly looks like it can hold a bunch of stuff. It costs $279.99.
The messenger bags aren’t as large but do have something called a “silent quick-access flap” with a “NoiseFree Velcro silencer.” All of this is to say you can open your bag quietly. The most expensive messenger bag, the Bumblebee M-30, costs $149.99. It can hold a DSLR with a 70-200mm/2.8 lens attached and three additional lenses, a handheld gimbal, and a 15-inch laptop in its own padded compartment. This is what it looks like:
Bags! Who doesn’t love bags, honestly?
The latest cinematic iteration of The Mummy takes off when antiquities thief Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) unearths an ancient Egyptian tomb — in Iraq. Ignoring the portents of impending doom (and the fact that stealing antiquities is illegal and also wrong), Morton and his Army buddies unearth a sarcophagus. Inside lies the mummy Ahmanet, an undead pharaoh’s daughter who was mummified alive and is royally pissed off about it. She comes back to life, psychically imprints on Morton, and wreaks havoc on London.
Unlike werewolves or vampires, mummies are creature-feature mainstays that actually do have real-world counterparts. That’s why archaeologist David Hurst Thomas, co-curator of the Mummies exhibit on display at the American Museum of Natural History, has been getting a lot of movie-inspired questions lately. “It really opens the door to talk about this stuff,” Thomas says.
The number one question he’s getting isn’t about whether a mummy could remain undead and entombed for millennia, or even whether any ancient Egyptian tombs have been found in modern-day Iraq. “The question is — as if authenticity is going to be an issue in a Tom Cruise movie — ‘How realistic is that, to have a female mummy?’” Thomas says. “None of the classic mummy movies are about women.” The truth is, that’s one of the more realistic parts of the movie. More than half the mummies in Thomas’ Mummies exhibit are female. In ancient Egypt, mummification wasn’t limited to men. (Lead roles in Hollywood blockbusters are an entirely different story.)
But were ancient Egyptian princesses ever mummified alive? “I don’t know of any case like that,” Thomas says. Still, he adds, there are a lot of ways to mummify a body — and that body doesn’t always have to be dead when the process starts. “Mummies are known from every continent of the world except Antarctica,” he says. “And they have really very different roles in different belief systems.” So we rounded up a few highlights:
Mummification in ancient Egypt started by accident. The heat and dry climate sucked the moisture out of corpses, making them much less appealing to the microbes that typically drive decay. It’s why beef jerky doesn’t spoil as quickly as a juicy steak.
Around 3000 BCE, the ancient Egyptians became much more intentional about preserving their dead — kicking off the early days of mummification. By 1550 BCE, anyone who could pay for a better body in the afterlife shelled out to become a mummy after they died.
The embalming process went something like this: first, embalmers removed the deceased’s brain with a hooked instrument inserted through the nose. They also removed the internal organs — except the heart — through a small incision in the body’s left side. These were preserved separately and stored in ornate jars. Then, the body was washed with water and probably wine, and packed inside and out with a kind of salt called natron. The salt sucked the water out of the body for about 40 days, leaving the skin shriveled like a raisin. Oils were rubbed on the body to revitalize it before it was covered with a kind of tree sap, wrapped in linen and magical amulets, and buried.
“In Egypt, it’s all about looking good for the afterlife,” Thomas says. “And from the top to the bottom of Egyptian society, that becomes the goal.”
Thousands of years before the ancient Egyptians were wrapping corpses in linen, people in South America were mummifying their dead in an altogether different way. Between 7020 BCE and 1110 BCE, fishing communities collectively known as the Chinchorro people lived and died along the coast from southern Peru to northern Chile.
The Chinchorro people had a couple of different ways to preserve a cadaver — possibly as part of a belief system that used mummification to stay connected with the dead. But the Black Mummies — which get their name from the black manganese paint that covered the cadaver — were the standouts, physical anthropologist Bernardo T. Arriaza wrote.
The person preparing a Black Mummy first had to dismember and decapitate the body, and remove its internal organs. The skin, which was preserved separately, “was peeled away from the body and reattached later, like taking off and putting on a sock,” Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato wrote for National Geographic. To dry out the torso, the mortician stuffed the abdomen with hot ashes or coals.
Once the abdomen was dry and the bones were clean, the whole body had to be put back together again, as if it were lying down on its back. Cords tied the bones together, and sticks threaded up through the hips and rib cage, before passing into the skull like body-length splints. The hollow insides were stuffed with grass, ashes, dirt, and animal hair. Then the body was coated with ash, and the skin was carefully stretched back over the top. The last step was to paint the body with a black paste made out of the mineral manganese, which also gave shape to the deceased’s facial features.
Another question Thomas gets from museumgoers is: can you mummify yourself? “And the answer is, you sure can!” he says. Monks in especially ascetic sects of buddhism attempted self-mummification for different ideological reasons, but the end goal was to die of starvation and remain preserved for eternity.
There weren’t many who managed it. There are different numbers floating around, but according to researcher Kiyohiko Sakurai writing in a 1998 textbook, only 15 self-mummified bodies still remain in Japan. The earliest dates to the 14th century, and the latest to the turn of the 20th. The reason there are so few is probably in part because Japan’s humid climate was much less conducive to mummification than the dry and salty deserts of Egypt, or the west coast of South America.
The process was also, no surprise, unpleasant, and deadly. “It starts out with this really nasty 1,000-day diet where you’re just basically starving yourself and getting rid all of the fat in your body,” Thomas explains. The trick to self-mummification was to go low-carb. Monks cut rice, barley, corn, millet, and beans from their diet, and substituted pine bark, grass roots, and nuts for three years or more. The starvation diet altered the body’s composition “to one that was strongly resistant to decomposition,” Sakurai wrote.
When he was close to death, the monk would enter an underground tomb to be buried alive. Three years later, other monks would exhume the body and dry it over candle flames. If the mummification was successful, the mummy was re-dressed in monk’s robes, and arranged in a seated position to be worshipped.
As the ancient Egyptians learned, mummies can be made by accident, too. “The whole thing is just to somehow interrupt the natural biological process of decay, which means stopping bacteria,” Thomas says. That can happen in extremely arid, frozen, or soggy places.
Desert mummies span the globe, from caves in Nevada to ancient Egypt to the Taklamakan desert in China. Famous ice mummies include Otzi the iceman, the freeze-dried mummy of a Copper Age man who was murdered in the Alps and frozen in a glacier 5,300 years ago. There’s also the Llullaillaco Maiden, a 13-year-old girl who died of exposure as an Incan child sacrifice on an icy peak in the Andes.
Drying and freezing make some intuitive sense as preservation techniques — after all, it’s how we preserve our food. But it’s also possible to preserve a body in water, like the bog bodies discovered in Northern Europe. The low-oxygen, swampy, acidic environs of certain bogs essentially pickle the bodies — sometimes dissolving the bones, but leaving the skin and hair intact.
“So there are mummy stories all over the world,” Thomas says. Still, “It's the Egyptian ones that really rule the stage.” Here’s hoping that the next Mummy movie casts a bog body for the starring role — and yes, women could become bog bodies, too.
Expectations were high for Sony’s E3 showcase this week. Last year, Sony arguably stole the show with games like Detroit: Become Human, Days Gone, God of War, Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, a new Call of Duty, The Last Guardian, and a VR thing for Final Fantasy XV, to name a few.
So what did Sony show as the future of PlayStation this year? Detroit: Become Human, Days Gone, God of War, Spider-Man, a new Call of Duty (this time in World War II), a remaster of The Last Guardian predecessor Shadow of the Colossus, and another VR thing for Final Fantasy XV.
Yeah.
That isn’t to say Sony had a bad event — far from it, in fact. E3 is designed to generate excitement not just for this year, but for the years to come. Sony wants to sell the idea that you’re investing in a platform for the long term. That big projects should appear one, two, or even three years in a row, isn’t unprecedented. But with so many repeats this year — and so few surprises — it’s hard not to see this year as a rare miss for a company that’s been pretty dominant at the show for some time.
Sony is far from the only company with repeat performances. Every major company with an E3 event has a game or two that never seems to graduate. The Xbox exclusive Crackdown 3, for example, was first shown off in 2014. As for Ubisoft’s Beyond Good & Evil 2, hell, that project was first announced in 2008. It’s nine years old and still has no release date.
And all those games that Sony repeated have seen major improvements from last year. Detroit’s gameplay was demoed last year, and this year Sony unveiled more of its main storyline. Father-and-son parable God of War, meanwhile, showed more of the frenetic combat and some massive-scale monsters. Spider-Man, the capstone of the night, now looks playable.

To be fair, there were plenty of games that weren’t reruns. Sony announced a number of VR titles in quick succession, including Skyrim VR, a virtual reality port of a game that is legally required to be mentioned at least three times every E3. There was also a new Uncharted chapter and some Destiny 2 teasers.
But even those games, exciting though they may be, are familiar in their own right — sequels and remakes. They looked good, sure, but the big piece that Sony lacked — and one of the big reasons people have loved their past E3 showcases — was surprise. There were no new IP, big or small. Indie games had little to no presence onstage this year — a stark contrast from years past. Monster Hunter World, a new entry in the massively successful Japanese franchise, stands out as an impressive showing, but it’s also a game coming to Xbox One or PC.
The biggest surprise, in fact, might’ve been what Sony didn’t show. Standouts like Hideo Kojima’s I-don’t-even-know-how-to-describe-this Death Stranding (first seen last year) and The Last of Us Part II (unveiled at PlayStation Experience last December) were completely MIA. And after Microsoft spent over an hour trying to convince the world we’re ready for a 4K Xbox, Sony said nary a word about the PlayStation 4 Pro, its own 4K console that’ll be (at least) $100 cheaper by the time Xbox One X comes out. A big question has been how developers will use the hardware to enhance the visuals of its games, and after this week, we still don’t have a good answer.
Then again, it’s not as if Sony needs to “win” every E3. In this generation of gaming, the PlayStation 4 is clearly ahead of the competition, with Xbox One still playing catch-up in sales and Nintendo doing its own thing entirely with the Switch. And with events like December’s PlayStation Experience, the company has been creating other stages to showcase its offerings. But E3 is still the big one. Sony can afford a risk-averse year to refine, to say, “We wowed you last year with a lot of surprises, now give us a moment to clean these up a bit.” But that’s a rarity.
There’s been a lot of hype around the solar eclipse on August 21st. Thousands are traveling to the locations, like Tennessee or Wyoming, to see the Sun go completely dark for the first time since 1918. For those of us staying put, there’s the Eclipse Megamovie Simulator, which will let you see how the eclipse will appear in your area.
Enter your zip code and see an animation of what you can expect, as well as the best time to take a loop. It’s part of the larger Eclipse Megamovie Project, which will collect thousands of photos of the natural phenomenon from volunteers.
If the simulator isn’t enough, there is also the Solar Eclipse Timer, an app that talks you through the location of the eclipse as it happens so you know exactly where the Sun is during the event. With the simulator and the app, you have a pretty good shot of making the most of wherever you are when the eclipse happens. This is much better than paying for a cheesy cruise that lets you view an eclipse you can see from land.
Far Cry 5’s announcement rode in on a wave of controversy. Where past games took players to far-off lands where the player murdered the locals, Far Cry 5 is set in a small Montana county. The enemy is a group of largely white Americans. Its heroes are a ragtag group of resistance fighters, fighting against a cult — a group whose imagery is drenched in patriotic Americana and Christian symbols.
But its first demo, for all of the conversations around the change to the game, felt largely like the Far Cry games that preceded it — its Montana location serving less as a statement than as a playground.
A great deal of buzz around the game has been given to its politics, though Far Cry 5’s development reaches back much further than the election of President Donald Trump and the rise of the alt-right.
"I get that question a fair amount,” Far Cry 5 executive producer and creative director Dan Hay tells The Verge. “Our intention was not to make a specific political statement. Our intention was to build an environment and build a situation that felt real.”
Hay describes the game’s design and the political climate as a “chicken and egg” situation.
“It has been eerie, is the word I would use,” Hay says. “Usually when you're making a game, you take a break, you walk outside, you go have lunch, and the conversations that take place at lunch that you're listening to are vastly different from the conversations that are happening in the game. That is not the case in this game. And it's been strange.”
At E3, Far Cry 5 is present in the form of a short demo mainly showcasing the game’s different AI-controlled partners. Grace Armstrong is a sniper; Nick Rye is a pilot with access to a very tough to fly plane; Boomer is a dog. All three have different capabilities, with a character like Grace providing backup from afar, while Boomer is there to rip through nearby enemies and fetch a gun. My experience with the game provided little insight about the cult the group is fighting against, aside from some bloody run-ins. And I never got the chance to meet the Father, the cult’s leader.
Hay describes the Father as a man who believes the means — in other words, murder and mayhem — justify the end. In building the game’s antagonistic cult, Hay says it’s easy to look at them from a scholastic standpoint. Or, even an anecdotal one.
“When people think about cults, they have an idea in their mind,” he says. Ubisoft worked with a team of “cult experts”on the game, though Hay declines to say what kind of research they did. "I'll be super specific about making sure that folks understand that we did a bunch of research with cult experts, and that's why we built our own cult,” he says. “We wanted to make sure that people understood we weren't specifically targeting a group. We wanted it to be ours.”
But Far Cry 5 needed a magnetic villain — a leader who could convince you that they have answers you don’t. “What I want to know is that I'm sitting down with somebody who's intelligent enough, who's magnetic enough, that even though I have the preconceived notion that I would never be turned or never think of myself as joining a cult,” Hay says. “That this person after a while could talk to me and I would begin to believe that perhaps under the right circumstances they could win me over.”
At the very least, Far Cry 5 still feels very much in-line with its past. In 20 minutes, I’d managed to tangle with wolves and locals (with deadly results); joyride through the country (with deadly results); and man a plane long enough to bomb a stretch of farmland (much to my dismay, with no deadly results).
For those that want to sidestep the messy conversation about what the game may or may not say, Far Cry 5’s E3 demonstration was happy to oblige.




Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will take a leave of absence from the ride-hail company to grieve for his mother who just died in a boating accident, according to a company-wide email that just went out. Kalanick’s decision comes as the investigation in a pervasive culture of sexism and harassment at Uber has reached its conclusion.
“For the last eight years my life has always been about Uber,” Kalanick wrote. “Recent events have brought home for me that people are more important than work, and that I need to take some time off of the day-to-day to grieve my mother, whom I buried on Friday, to reflect, to work on myself, and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team.”
Kalanick wouldn’t say how long he intended to step away from Uber — “it may be shorter or longer than we might expect,” he wrote — but that the move was necessary for the company to effectively improve its battered image. “For Uber 2.0 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team,” Kalanick said. “But if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve.”
Kalanick had been weighing a leave of absence in the week since Uber’s board received the report from the law firm Covington & Burling into its toxic workplace. The investigation was prompted by Susan Fowler, an ex-Uber engineer, whose disturbing account of pervasive sexism, harassment, and managerial incompetency at the ride-hail company came to light last February. After Fowler’s story went viral, Kalanick said the company would “conduct an urgent investigation” into the allegations, and promised to fire anyone who “behaves this way or thinks this is OK.”
Since then, it’s been scandal after scandal at Uber, from high-level executives running for the exit to revelations about legally questionable practices. Every time Uber’s employees thought they were climbing out of the hole they were in, a new controversy would surface and the hole would get deeper. Just last week, it was revealed that two of the company’s top executives, Kalanick and senior vice president of business Emil Michael, had obtained the medical records of a woman in India who was raped by an Uber driver. After the news broke, Michael was fired from the company, while Kalanick weighing stepping away from the company he helped found eight years ago.
The probe was led by former US Attorney General Eric Holder and his colleague Tammy Albarrán. During the course of the investigation, Holder and Albarrán reported on a weekly basis to a subcommittee of Uber’s board of directors, consisting of Arianna Huffington, Bill Gurley, and David Bonderman.
At the time, the news drew criticism because of Holder’s ties to the company. Uber retained Covington & Burling for advice on safety issues. Holder even advocated for Uber last summer by sending letters to officials to drop policies mandating fingerprint-based background checks for drivers. Holder’s former chief of staff and Covington employee, Margaret Richardson, also sits on Uber’s safety advisory board. Early Uber investors Mitch and Freada Kapor Klein called the move “disappointing.”
Uber also retained the law firm Perkins Coie to specifically look into Fowler’s allegations. As a result of that firm’s investigation, 20 employees were fired and 215 claims of harassment, bullying, retaliation and other inappropriate behavior were investigated. Of those claims, 100 were dismissed with no action taken, while 31 employees were referred to training or counseling sessions, and seven were handed written warnings. Fifty-seven cases are still being investigated.
In its review, Covington says it conducted “200 interviews with current and former employees who shared a broad range of perspectives,” including employees with direct knowledge of Fowler’s allegations.

So what does Holder and Albarrán recommend Uber do to fix what’s broken? The report lands on 10 major recommendations, including “changes to senior leadership,” “enhance board oversight,” and “reforumulate Uber’s 14 cultural values.”
You’ll recall that Uber’s cultural values, created by Kalanick and chief product officer Jeff Holden, include such memorable turns-of-phrase as “Let Builders Build,” “Always Be Hustlin’,” “Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping,” and “Principled Confrontation.” The firm recommends that any value that has been used to “justify poor behavior” should be eliminated. At Uber’s all-hands meeting today, Huffington went further on the values, asserting that some of them have been “weaponized,” according to New York Times scribe Mike Isaac.
"A lot of people have told us that the 14 cultural value have been "weaponized" -- not all of them but a few of them." --Huffington
The firm also recommends that Uber create a “diversity advisory board” to ensure the company’s efforts to promote diversity through its hiring process is properly implemented. Uber should regularly publish its diversity numbers too, Covington suggests. The company published its diversity numbers for the first time back in March, showing that Uber was overwhelming white and male.
Covington recommends Uber update its discrimination and harassment policies to make them easier to understand, and to ensure that no reported instance of inappropriate behavior goes unreported. The company should also develop specific guidance on appropriate workplace relationships, including the types of relationships that are explicitly banned such as “individuals in a reporting relationship.” (Recode recently got a hold of a letter from Kalanick outlining Uber’s rules for sexual relationships, which came off as very trashy and tone-deaf.)
With Kalanick stepping aside, and many of the company’s top executives fired or resigned, the question remains: what comes next for Uber? Many of the company’s critics will no doubt be disappointed that Kalanick’s departure won’t be permanent. The argument is that with Kalanick’s leave only temporary, any attempt to start with a clean slate would be meaningless. But Uber’s defenders still see this as an opportunity for the company to hit the reset button.
Bradley Tusk, an outside advisor to the company, told The Verge that he came away with three main takeaways. The first was that Uber should report on a quarterly basis on the status of the implementation of each of the report’s recommendations. This would demonstrate that Uber cares about accountability and transparency. “They won’t want to do it because it’ll be a pain,” but the company should still consider making these quarterly reports, he said.
Second, Tusk said that when Kalanick returns to the company, his focus should be “innovation, growth, and scale,” and he should leave the drudgery of running a massive bureaucracy to his lieutenants. “He’s not a guy who gets excited about reading the minutes from the last board meeting or performance evaluations,” Tusk said, adding that since Kalanick wants to change the future, Uber needs to let him be “the future-changer.”
And lastly, Tusk noted that any tech startup that wants to avoid the many scandals that have befallen Uber over the last few months would be advised to read the Holder report and take it to heart. “You can upend the status quo while still being respectful and accountable to your employees,” he said. “It would behoove startups to think about how this applies to them.”




Freelance writer and academic Anthony Oliveira, known by the Twitter handle @meakoopa, has been suspended from Twitter, prompting a backlash from followers who contrast the decision with what they see as Twitter’s continued failure to combat the rise of the violent alt-right and the prevalence of anti-LGTBQ hate speech on its platform.
The suspension appears to have occurred no more than a few hours ago, and was brought to wider attention by the popular account @skullmandible. His first tweet about the suspension has more than 200 retweets as of this writing, and a hashtag, #freemeakoopa, shows the issue bubbling up throughout Twitter’s LGBTQ and literary communities.
important queer voice and academic anthony olivera banned by twitter the morning after pride weekend. are you serious @twitter #freemeakoopa pic.twitter.com/bZ48evHNeZ
Update: Oliveira told The Verge in an email, “I have no idea what the ban is for... Twitter has provided no explanation whatsoever; I awoke to the account locked. No emails or DMs have been sent. I can see people replying to my @, however, and am very appreciative of their remarks.”
One of Oliveira’s supporters, who did not wish to be quoted by name, explained the situation that followers believe led to the @meakoopa suspension. They posit a theory that Oliveira was suspended for doxxing someone who was trolling him.
The supporter recalls a college student tweeting a photo of himself and his girlfriend with the hashtag #PrideMonth and a caption along the lines of “celebrating my heterosexuality.” That tweet was followed with taunts about how straight people don’t feel the need to “flaunt” their sexuality. Oliveira reportedly responded by quote-tweeting this post with “Many congratulations to you and your sister.” That led to an argument with the original poster, with Oliveira eventually using the real names of the poster and his girlfriend. The poster, according to the anonymous @meakoopa follower, deleted the original tweet and locked his account.
Hey, unsuspend @meakoopa's account. It's a travesty that homophobes constantly abuse us and tell us to kill ourselves. and nothing happens
Silicon Valley ghouls like @jack aren't your friends and are silencing queer voices on Twitter while letting white supremacists roam free pic.twitter.com/iA6I2cWUsL
hey @twitter bring back @meakoopa immediately. you let nazis run roughshod over your site but you ban a queer academic? are you KIDDING ME
A second follower of @meakoopa told The Verge via Twitter DM that the original poster had included an Instagram link in his Twitter profile, which contained his real name: “The rumor with [@]meakoopa is that he used the real names of a straight couple he was making jokes about… And because it's technically against [Twitter’s terms of service] and [@]meakoopa has plenty of enemies on the right / alt-right, they could mass report and get him suspended.” Others have tweeted the same theory, but it’s important to emphasize that Twitter has not confirmed this as the inciting incident for the suspension.
Technically, this would be the same type of behavior that resulted in some of Twitter’s most public prior suspensions — a user with a large following identifying another user by name can be seen as encouraging harassment and abuse. Supporters have argued the intent is different, and that Oliveira is a vital voice on the platform.
Hey @Support and @jack thousands of LGBT look to @meakoopa as a leader & voice for the marginalized; what you did is horrifically tone deaf.
According to Siddhant Adlakha, a critic at the film site Birth. Movies. Death, which recently published an essay on The Babadook Pride Month meme written by Oliveira, Twitter hasn’t provided Oliveira with any information about why he was suspended. (Oliveira confirmed when reached for comment.)
@TwitterOpen, an official Twitter account dedicated to the platform’s LGBTQ community, tweeted “Looking into it!” in response to one of the complaints.
This is outrageous. #freemeakoopa https://t.co/z0FUidr0Hq
Twitter cited, as it has historically, “privacy and security reasons” when declining to comment.
Update: Oliveira’s account has been restored.
twitter suspended me bc I was impolite to straight people mocking the Pulse massacre.they have not apologized and I will not apologize.
Correction: A previous version of this article said that a tweet from @TwitterOpen had been deleted, but it has not.

Facebook has signed a deal to revive reality competition show Last State Standing, according to The Hollywood Reporter. American Ninja Warrior producer A. Smith and Co.’s Arthur Smith is behind the series, which will feature one contestant from each of the 50 states competing in games for a chance to win $500,000. A premiere date, episode count, and rollout plan are still undetermined, but production on the show has reportedly begun in Los Angeles.
Back in February, Facebook announced it hired MTV executive vice president Mina Lefevre to head development of the site’s scripted and unscripted content. Since then, contracts have been signed with outlets like BuzzFeed and Vox to create shortform series (shows 5- to 30-minutes in length).
Last State Standing’s deal comes on the heels of Facebook also reportedly closing in on a deal to revive Nicole Byer’s comedy series Loosely Exactly Nicole. The latter is a reunion for Lefevre and Byer: Lefevre originally helped develop Loosely Exactly Nicole during her tenure at MTV, where it ran for one season in October 2016.
Facebook’s original video content is expected to arrive close to the end of summer, and is part of the company’s concerted efforts, along with Facebook Live and rumors of an app for set-top TV boxes, to bring video to the forefront of user experience.

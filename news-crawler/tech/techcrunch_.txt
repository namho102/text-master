Uber is launching its in-app tipping feature for drivers in the U.K. Starting tomorrow, Uber passengers will be able to tip their driver using the app for rides and/or food via UberEATS. Back in June, Uber added in-app tipping capabilities for passengers to give drivers a little extra something in the U.S.
“While drivers have told us they love the freedom of being their own boss, we’ve also clearly heard that we need to make improvements,” Uber UK Regional General Manager Jo Bertram said in a statement.
Just like in the U.S., Uber will also charge passengers who make their drivers wait for more than two minutes. Starting August 22, passengers in the U.K. will have to pay 20p per every one minute their driver has to wait after the first two minutes.
Another change include two-minute cancellations. Right now, if an Uber rider cancels a trip within five minutes, they don’t have to pay a cancellation fee.
“Following feedback we feel this is too long as drivers are well on their way to the pick-up point and have already invested time and fuel,” Bertram said.
Other changes include a “No thanks” button, which lets drivers immediately deny trips rather than having to wait for the request to time out, and driver destination and arrival times. The drive destination feature enables the driver to match with a passenger going the same direction and the arrival time feature ensures the driver gets to their destination on time. Uber says drivers can expect additional changes down the road.
Tesla has a new way to demonstrate the possibilities of its home solar products to potential customers – using a ‘tiny house’ on wheels, which it can tow on a rolling tour with a Tesla Model X. The Tesla Tiny House made its official debut in Australia (via Electrek), where it will welcome visitors at Melbourne’s Federation Square, before taking off for a cross-country Australian tour.
The towable Tiny House is reminiscent of the mobile design studio it introduced last September, which was a reconfigured Airstream that let people build their own Tesla vehicle as a kind of mobile virtual studio. These solar-focused demonstration trailers also feature mobile design studios and configurators within, but for Tesla’s solar products, including solar panels and its Powerball energy storage battery for the home.
The Tiny House has actual siding this time around, which is made up of sustainable timber with not artificial chemical treatments. It weighs 2 tonnes (around 4,400 pounds) and has 2kW solar generation capacity using 6 panels, which can feed the single Powerwall battery mounted on the side.

Tesla’s touring the country with destinations at ever major Australian city, but residents can also request it swing by and pay a visit to smaller towns along the way, too. Tesla doesn’t yet offer solar installations in Australia, but it clearly wants to prime the pump, and it does sell Powerwall batteries for use with solar installations from other providers.
This model seems likely to be applied to other markets, too, should the Tiny House prove effective in swaying Australian customers. On the commercial side, Tesla is also building a huge renewable power storage facility using its Powerpack batteries, which will be the largest such facility in the world once it’s complete.
Rovio, the Finnish company behind Angry Birds, is planning to go public “as early as next month,” Bloomberg reports.
Citing sources, Bloomberg reports the IPO could value Rovio at $2 billion and that the company could raise about $400 million from a local market listing. Though, it seems that a final decision has yet to be made, meaning Rovio may decide to stay private for longer.
Since first releasing Angry Birds in 2009, Rovio has expanded its business to include movies and other games because the company realized it could not solely rely on Angry Birds games for revenue. The release of the Angry Birds movie in 2016 helped increase game sales and earlier this year, Rovio posted 2016 revenue growth of 34 percent to 190.3 million euros with earnings of 17.5 million euros. In the year prior, Rovio posted a loss.
Back in June, news came out that Tencent was considering a $3 billion purchase of Rovio, as well as that Rovio may consider going public in the near future.
At the time, Rovio said, “A stock exchange listing at some point in the future could be possible in order to support the continued strong growth of Rovio and its strategic targets.”
I’ve reached out to Rovio and will update this story if I hear back.
Google’s Cloud Speech API, which has allowed developers to use Google’s services to transcribe spoken words into text since its launch in 2016, is getting a major update today.
The most interesting of these is probably the addition of support for 30 new languages on top of the 89 languages the service already understood (though, to be fair, Google includes multiple regional variants of English, Spanish and Arabic in its total count). These new languages include the likes of Bengali, Latvian and Swahili and, according to Google, cover about a billion speakers.
On top of this, Google also introduced a few new core features to the service. Among these is support for word-level timestamps. The idea here is to tag every word with its timestamp so that developers can, for example, easily allow their users to hear who a given word sounded like. That’s especially interesting for human-augmented transcription and translation services that use this API to speed up their workflows. “Having the ability to map the audio to the text with timestamps significantly reduces the time spent proofreading transcripts,” says Happy Scribe co-founder, André Bastie, whose company uses the service for its $0.10/minute interview transcription service
The kind of files that developers upload to the service can now also be up to 3 hours long — up from 80 minutes in the previous version. Developers can also ask for a quota extension to upload files that are even longer.
Like before, developers can get 60 minutes of free audio processing through the Speech API and every additional 15 seconds is billed at $0.006.

Will Greene runs Tigermine, a consultancy that supports science and tech innovation in Asia. 

The first time Huong Tran pitched a group of Vietnamese investors on Epomi, a beauty retail startup she founded in 2014, she was shocked by their reaction.
“They told me that women are too emotional to run a business and they don’t like investing in them,” she said. “This was one of the leading international VC firms in Vietnam—I didn’t expect this.”
Until that point, Tran rarely had trouble convincing others to take her seriously. A Vietnamese national with an MBA from Duke and a decade of leadership experience at top multinationals like Samsung and GSK, she had a long track in business. At the time of her pitch, Epomi already had rapid sales growth, an adoring customer base, favorable contracts with top suppliers, and a clear plan to lead Vietnam’s fast-growing beauty retail market.
Tran eventually found investment for her startup, but her initial experience is not uncommon. In both developed and emerging economies, gender discrimination is a universal challenge. So is sexual harassment—a problem that’s becoming increasingly visible in light of the seemingly endless string of harassment scandals happening in the tech world.
Compared to other Asian countries, however, Vietnam performs relatively well on some measures of gender equality. For example, women hold 17.6% of board seats in Vietnam, more than any other country in the Asia-Pacific region except Australia (20.1%), according to a recent study by Deloitte. The study, which looked at 64 countries globally, also found that Vietnam outperformed the global average (15%), as well as more developed neighbors like Singapore (9.4%) and China (9.2%).
Women also run a substantial share of Vietnam’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Roughly 25% of SMEs in Vietnam are owned by women, according to a 2016 report by the Mekong Business Initiative (MBI), a development partnership co-led by the Asian Development Bank and the Australian government. In South Asia, by contrast, only 8% of SMEs are women-owned.
Women lead some of Vietnam’s largest and most iconic companies as well. One of the most prominent is Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, who is best known as founder and CEO of Vietjet, a popular budget airline that listed on the Vietnamese stock exchange earlier this year, and which helped make her Southeast Asia’s only female billionaire.
High-profile female executives can also be found in a diverse array of other industries, from retail to agriculture, as well as on the startup circuit.
Tran Bich Huong, chief executive, Epomi
In some industries, women hold a large share of senior management positions too. Between 2014 and 2016, I worked with a Singapore-based healthcare data company to launch a new service line in Vietnam. During that project, I made sales calls to nearly every multinational pharmaceutical company in the country. While many of those offices are still headed by foreign men, the majority of my business contacts were women. Behind the scenes, women often ran the show.
But not every industry had the same sensibility. Back in 2015, in a series of stories for Techonomy about Vietnam’s burgeoning IT sector, throughout dozens of interviews and site visits with local IT services firms, I came across almost no women. As in most countries, women are underrepresented in Vietnam’s tech industry, though some educational organizations are keeping this in mind as they work to build the country’s STEM talent.
“Vietnam has some prominent female business leaders, but that doesn’t mean there’s gender equality across the economy,” says Shuyin Tang, a Principal in the Vietnam office of Patamar Capital (formerly Unitus Impact), an impact investment fund with offices in San Francisco and across Asia. To help bridge the gap, Patamar Capital recently launched an investment fund specifically for women-owned businesses in Southeast Asia.
Other organizations are also working to support Vietnamese businesswomen. For example, MBI recently helped launch the Women’s Initiative for Startups and Entrepreneurship, a multi-stakeholder program that will provide programming and services to support women-owned businesses in Vietnam, which a vision to expand to the Mekong region. Another one is Women of Vietnam, a private community launched by a Vietnamese-Australian entrepreneur in 2015.
Organizations like these are tackling a thorny and sometimes contentious topic. “Anyone who brings up gender in the workplace is wading into deep and muddy waters,” wrote Sheryl Sandberg in Lean In, her bestselling book on gender and work in the modern era. “The subject itself presents a paradox: forcing us to acknowledge differences while trying to achieve the goal of being treated the same.”
Yet around the world, there’s a growing movement to encourage gender equality and prevent discrimination against women in business. As this movement heats up in Vietnam, expect to see more women entrepreneurs taking charge in this fast-growing and dynamic country.
 
Shonda Rhimes is coming to Netflix.
The writer/producer whose television empire spans from West Coast hospitals to a scandal-wracked West Wing is joining the Netflix stable of exclusive content.
It’s a blow to Rhimes’ longtime distributors at ABC, whose parent company Disney announced earlier this week that they’d be pulling their titles from Netflix’s streaming service.
The multi-year production deal with Netflix will see Rhimes’ Shondaland production company produce new series “and other projects” for the video streaming and dvd rental service.
The deal doesn’t affect Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder, which will continue to air in the U.S. on ABC.
“Shonda Rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television,” said Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Netflix, in a statement.  “Her work is gripping, inventive, pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, taboo-breaking television at its best. I’ve gotten the chance to know Shonda and she’s a true Netflixer at heart — she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience. We’re so excited to welcome her to Netflix.”
Betsy Beers, Rhimes’ longtime partner, who has helped ABC make over $2 billion from the licensing and sales of Shondaland shows, will make the move to Netflix as well.
For her part, Rhimes said that the deal is the result of a “shared plan” between herself and Netflix’s Sarandos. “Ted provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for — the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous reach provided by Netflix’s singular sense of innovation.”
While thanking ABC Studios president Patrick Moran and Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment Group, the move to Netflix is the latest in a series of high profile acquisitions that have shaken up the entertainment landscape and a blow to ABC’s parent company.
Within the past week Netflix has managed to coax talk show legend David Letterman out of retirement, snatch up the (somewhat middling) comic publishing house Millarworld for new exclusive programming, and snagged Academy Award winning writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen for a new Western series.
It’s the latest sign that the war for talent in Hollywood is well and truly on. Netflix has already spent around $6 billion this year on its original programming, and secured a $500 million line of credit earlier this year to buy even more. Meanwhile Amazon is throwing piles of its own (not-insignificant) cash horde at original programming as well.
The house that Bezos built has spent about $4.5 billion on new, original programming this year, which is hardly chump change.
Meanwhile ABC’s parent company, Disney, has been spending billions of its own to roll out a new streaming service in 2019.
Last year Disney bought a minority stake in BAMTech for roughly $1 billion (with an option to acquire the entire company). It’s the BAMTech service that will provide the foundation for Disney’s new streaming offering.
And the company is already pushing an on-demand subscription video service for Disney movies in the UK (and briefly in China) called DisneyLife.


As TechCrunch’s Sarah Perez previously reported:

DisneyLife was seen as a way for Disney to experiment with streaming, before a larger public launch.
This not only includes being able to test out the underlying infrastructure for such an endeavour, but also what sort of content users respond to, what features they want, how parental controls should work, and so on. On DisneyLife, consumers pay a small monthly fee that lets families of up to six stream Disney movies, TV shows, even music, audiobooks and e-books online, on mobile devices, and to TVs through AirPlay and Chromecast.
If anything, DisneyLife is very much like a Disney-flavored Netflix, and could be looked to as an example of what’s to come.

 
Terms of the deal with Netflix weren’t disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that Rhimes’ ABC production deal is worth more than $10 million per year to produce shows — and she has profit participation which means a percentage cut of all international deals and reruns.

White supremacist site the Daily Stormer needs to find another domain provider after getting the boot from GoDaddy. In a tweet, the company said “We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service.”

We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service.
— GoDaddy (@GoDaddy) August 14, 2017

The tweet was made in response to one by The New Agenda founder Amy Suskind calling on GoDaddy to ban Daily Stormer for posting a obscene article about Heather Heyer, who was killed in Charlottesville on Saturday after being hit by a car allegedly driven by James Alex Fields Jr. into a crowd. Fields has been charged with second-degree murder.
Heyer was among a group protesting the Unite the Right white supremacist rally this weekend, which the Daily Stormer helped organize and promote.
In an email to TechCrunch, a GoDaddy spokesperson said “We have informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service. If no action is taken after 24 hours, we will cancel the service. Given this latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent act, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service.”
GoDaddy only provides the domain for Daily Stormer and does not host the site, which calls itself “The World’s Most Genocidal Republican Website.” While GoDaddy’s action is laudable, it’s also important to note that activists, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, began calling on GoDaddy to stop providing Daily Stormer’s domain several months ago.
GoDaddy joins Airbnb and Twilio as tech companies taking action aimed at combatting hate speech in reaction to the Unite the Right rally. Airbnb deactivated the accounts of several users who were planning to attend the event, while cloud communications platform Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson said it will add “an explicit prohibition of hate speech” in the company’s acceptable use policy this week.
As the nation recovers from yesterday’s tragic violence caused by pro-nazi and white supremacist rallies that took place in Charlottesville, Va., Twitter users have been mobilizing to identify the participants in the weekend’s events.
Since early Sunday morning, the @YesYoureRacist account has been calling on Twitter users to identify participants in the rally.


If you recognize any of the Nazis marching in #Charlottesville, send me their names/profiles and I'll make them famous #GoodNightAltRight pic.twitter.com/2tA9xliFVU
— Yes, You're Racist (@YesYoureRacist) August 12, 2017



Other accounts (like @shaunking of the NY Daily News) quickly took up the cause and within several hours one of the participants in the rallies had been fired by his employer.

Identifying participants in a public rally by name does not violate Twitter’s terms of service (something Jason Del Rey noted in a Recode article earlier today) . Twitter only suspends accounts if the poster includes private information like a phone number, social security number, or home address.
The rallies in Charlottesville, which brought together an assortment of neo-nazi, white supremacist, and “alt-right” organizations to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee ended in tragedy late Saturday afternoon when Heather Heyer, a resident of Charlottesville, Va., was struck and killed by a car driven by a participant in the white nationalist marches.
The police arrested James Alex Fields Jr., a resident of Maumee, Ohio, and charted him with second-degree murder for the attack.
The identification of participants in the white nationalist demonstrations have brought up the specter of doxing — when private information is released online to harass (or encourage the harassment of) a private citizen.
But, as Dave Weigel noted earlier today, the identification of participants in a public rally isn’t doxing.


Attn trolls: It's not "doxxing" to identify people who appeared in public at a rally and have given media interviews about their beliefs.
— Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) August 13, 2017



Weigel was referring to the identification of Peter Cvjetanovic, a University of Nevada, Reno, student who was identified by @YesYoureRacist and subsequently gave an interview to a local Reno television station.


This angry young man is Peter Cvjetanovic, a student at @unevadareno pic.twitter.com/7rLGJkcT3o
— Yes, You're Racist (@YesYoureRacist) August 12, 2017



Cvetjnanovic participated in the protests, he said, because the removal of the statue was a symbol for “the slow replacement of white heritage within the United States and the people who fought and defended and built their homeland.”
Cvetjanovic also wanted people to know, “I’m not the angry racist they see in that photo.”
As the firing of Cole White indicates, the identification of participants in these protests has implications and not everyone online is comfortable with the outing of protestors (on both the right and the left).
It’s also true that the Twitterati can make mistakes — which was the case when the conservative YouTube celebrity Joey Salads was accused of attending the rallies. Salads (not his real name) was actually vacationing in Jamaica.
Companies are well within their rights to fire people for their political beliefs, as this New York Times piece from 2015 outlines. 

For private employees, who account for about 85 percent of the work force, the First Amendment’s guarantee offers no protection from being fired for something you’ve said, either in the workplace or outside of it, as on social media. That’s because the amendment addresses actions by the government to impede free speech, not by the private sector.
And while federal laws bar employers from firing workers because of such variables as their race, religion and gender, there is no such protection for political affiliation or activity.

Even in states like New York and California, which have adopted laws that provide the most cover for political speech, people can be fired for expressing their views (in or out of the workplace).
As Times reporter Alina Tugend writes:
The broadest-based laws, such as those in California and New York, make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of an employees’ political activity or beliefs in or out of work, Ms. Brantner said, unless such activity interferes with the functioning of the business.
Businesses can take a broad view on what kinds of activities interfere with the functioning of a business, and the law offers little protection.
It’s that kind of legal backdrop that has made some commenters question the outing of the neo-nazi and white nationalist participants in the rallies in Charlotte.
The question seems to revolve around something that my colleague, Brian Heater, brought up earlier today.
The new generation of white nationalism seemingly does not see the need to hide behind hoods as their intellectual forebears may have done, because they do not think they will be held accountable for their views.
But there’s no anonymity online these days, and anyone who acts in public can potentially face public scrutiny. The question is whether the people marching on a weekend are willing to have their views circulated in an office on Monday morning.

Top 10 digital media predictions for 2017
Is Netflix Disney’s next big buy and is Reed Hastings its next CEO?



Last week, Disney rocked the media world when it officially – and inevitably — threw its mouse ears into the direct-to-consumer over the top video ring with separate forthcoming streaming video on demand (SVOD) services for Disney and ESPN television and movies.
At the same time, Disney announced that it would no longer license its prized content to global SVOD behemoth Netflix.  With this 1-2 gut punch, Disney looked straight into Netflix’s eyes and pronounced, “Game On!”  So, how worried should Netflix and its investors be?
In a word, “Very.”
Here are a few reasons why.
Disney is supremely motivated to “win.”
In the past several months, Disney had wanted to buy – not fight — Netflix to become an instant global SVOD juggernaut (I wrote about that previously in TechCrunch).  But Netflix apparently had too high of an opinion of itself (in the eyes of Disney, at least).  Disney doesn’t like to lose.  So, now the gloves are off.
But, more fundamentally, Disney had no choice but to make a massive move to prioritize digital OTT platforms by either buying or competing with Netflix, given the cut-the-cord bleeding of traditional cable and satellite television packages that historically have been Disney’s cash cow. ESPN’s downward slide in traditional pay TV packages has been well publicized, but the Disney Channel is right there too.  
SVOD is Disney’s newly-minted plan to make up for this lost ground, and you can bet that CEO Bob Iger will ignite all of the his multiple businesses, platforms and channels to promote Disney’s new cause celebre to consumers.  
Scary indeed.

Disney knows that “content is king” like never before, and is now using its content might as a weapon to win.  
Amidst the massive tectonic (tech-tonic?) entertainment shift to OTT video viewing and the global SVOD land grab, exclusive content is the great differentiator.  That’s why each massive player is trying to capture our hearts and minds (and most importantly, our eyes) with high-priced, high-profile exclusive original television and movies (“Originals”).  Well, guess what, Disney already owns the rights to the most valuable brand, franchises, content and characters in the world.
Due to massively astute strategic moves over the past decade plus, ESPN and Disney princesses now share the stage with the Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar holy trinity. So, why give industry-leading Netflix the keys to its content castle when Disney can deliver that magic kingdom directly to consumers itself?
Exactly — and Disney isn’t.  Not anymore.
Make no mistake, that hurts Netflix.  Disney-esque kids-focused programming is increasingly strategic to Netflix, since about half of Netflix’s subscribers regularly watch kids-focused programming (and that content is frequently and uniquely “evergreen,” which means it never gets old).

Disney is just the latest in a long and growing list of far better resourced industry behemoths hell-bent on taking Netflix down.
That list now includes AT&T’s DirecTV Now, Amazon Video, YouTube TV, Apple — and soon will include upcoming services from Verizon and Comcast.  None of these giants (including Disney) are “Netflix Killers” on their own.  But, together, this cabal may result in “death by 1,000 cuts.”  Netflix is too big to fail, of course.
But, that doesn’t mean it can survive as an independent long-term.  Disney, after all, has a market cap of about $160 billion compared to Netflix’s relatively paltry $75 billion.  So, Disney – like all the other behemoths — certainly has deeper coffers with which to compete. 
Even more significantly, Disney and the others bask in the glow of a holistic, multi-faceted business model.  In Disney’s case, it can monetize multiple divisions with multiple product lines and revenue streams (movies, television, theme parks, merchandising, licensing), all on a global scale.  Netflix can’t.  Its business model is one-dimensional.  Netflix’s very existence is justified by subscriptions alone.  
Disney’s SVOD services, on the other hand, just need to play their parts in an overall smooth-running Disney machine.  That gives Disney (and the other mega-competitors like it) tremendous freedom that Netflix doesn’t have, especially as budgets for Originals continue to skyrocket amidst this massive competition.

Netflix spent a whopping $6 billion this year alone on its Originals and just secured a $500 million line of credit to fund even more (after securing nearly $1.5 billion more in notes just a few months earlier).  I have long been bearish on Netflix due to its singularly challenged business model, and Disney’s call to arms certainly doesn’t help.  
Naysayers no doubt will challenge the notion that Netflix, with its global brand and massive head start, faces any real existential crisis from Mickey and his fellow cast of giant OTT characters.  After all, all of us reading this article undoubtedly count ourselves as being part of the Netflix faithful.  Would any of us ever really leave?
Well, chew on this.  Each of these three meta-forces is a massive new threat, the likes of which Netflix has never seen before.
First, the onslaught by Disney and the burgeoning list of other major players – all of which can afford to play the long game — now offer real choice to consumers for the first time.  Take Amazon for example.
Amazon Video is reported to be gaining ground on Netflix in Europe, out-performing Netflix in Germany only a few months after its launch.  That study also found that average viewing of Netflix programs in Europe was down significantly year-over-year, whereas Amazon’s was way up.  

So perhaps in increasingly critical international markets where the Netflix brand is not so deeply entrenched, neither is viewer uptick or loyalty in the face of compelling alternatives.  Even in the U.S., consumers face no real “switching costs” in an OTT world.  If they lose interest in Netflix Originals or simply prefer those of Amazon or others, all they need to do is cancel their monthly subscriptions.
Yes, many will pay for more than one.  But, U.S. market penetration already exceeds 50% of U.S. households.  Not much margin of error here.
That leads to the second disruptive factor of ever-escalating herculean budgets for Originals in order to both acquire and retain customers.  Amazon, with its more ironclad checkbook, spent $4.5 billion on Originals this year, closing in on Netflix’s $6 billion in that regard.
Ultimately, Netflix’s foes can out-spend the reigning champ – or undercut its pricing — if they choose to do so.  Can Netflix even afford to maintain, let alone drop, its pricing long-term? 
Finally, Disney’s internationally beloved franchises, characters, and overall brand – all, if nothing less, marketing goldmines to attract new users — are now apparently out of Netflix’s reach forever.
It’s not too much of a stretch to assume that Time Warner’s movies and television will follow suit if DirecTV Now’s AT&T closes that $85 billion mega-deal.  
Together, these amount to a perfect-storm that inevitably will stunt Netflx’s growth and depress its shares.  Maybe not overnight, or even next year.  But, ultimately Netflix will not be able to go it alone.
Disney can.
Now, for Disney and its OTT ambitions, the pivotal question becomes whether it hires the right talent with the right digital-first DNA and gives them the freedom and flexibility to pull it off.

The ‘attention economy’ created by Silicon Valley is bankrupting us
Does Silicon Valley have a moral responsibility to stop developing robots?



There are few more credible authorities on artificial intelligence (AI) than Hilary Mason the New York-based founder and chief executive of the data science and machine learning consultancy Fast Forward Labs.
So, I asked Mason, who is also the Data Scientist in Residence at Accel Partners and the former Chief Scientist at Bitly, whether today’s AI revolution is for real? Or is it, I wondered, just another catch-all phrase used by entrepreneurs and investors to describe the latest Silicon Valley mania?
Mason – who sees “AI” as the “umbrella term” to describe “machine learning” and “big data” – acknowledges that it has become a “very trendy” area of start-up activity. That said, she says, there has been such rapid technological progress in machine learning over the last five years to make the field “legitimately exciting”. This progress has been so profound, Mason insists, that it is making AI “close” to the heart of our new innovation economy.
But in contrast with the fears of prominent technologists like Elon Musk, Mason doesn’t worry about the threat to the human species of super intelligent machines. We humans, she says, use machines as tools — and the advent of AI doesn’t change this. “Machines aren’t rational,” she thus argues, implying that there are many more important things for us to worry about than an imminent singularity.
What does concern Mason, however, are questions about the role of women in tech. That’s a question interviewers like myself should be asking men rather than women, she insists. It just creates “extra burden” for female technologists and thus isn’t something that she wants to publicly discuss.
Many thanks to the folks at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commercefor their help in producing this interview.

Some had guns and some carried sticks and shields. Some carried homemade pepper spray and mace. But one thing nearly everyone on all sides carried: a camera. There were television cameras, DSLRs, 360-cameras and, most commonly of all, simple smartphones. 
It was the one constant in the crowds of yesterday’s showdown between politically emboldened white nationalists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, VA. The streets were full of raised cameras documenting the sad and scary events unfolding from every angle, often in real-time. In an event like this, spurred on by racist and xenophobic national discourse from prominent political figures and once-fringe media properties, violence seemed inevitable — or at very least, extremely likely. 
As such, it’s hard to see a downside to ubiquitous, first-hand documentation. It presents a record of action and insight into violence that might otherwise disappear into the mob. “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.” It’s one of those quotes that’s been run through the ringer and co-opted by all sides of the political spectrum since Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis penned it more than 100 years ago. But the idea is still a powerful one. Transparency is our best tool against oppression, and technology can be a powerful means to that end. 
Take the recent example of police body cameras. Most (many officers included) have embraced the technology for its potential to shed light on cases of police misconduct. And indeed, studies have shown that the mere existence of these cameras has had a positive effect in the policing community. 
A study out of Cambridge University late last year marked a 93-percent drop in complaints against officers after cameras were introduced. People tend to behave better when they’re being watched. Once cameras are introduced, the halo effect continues, even when they’re no longer present, a phenomenon researchers refer to as “contagious accountability.” 
All good news, and a great argument for the presence of video documentation in tense moments. But let’s focus on the “accountability” part of “contagious accountability.” As we have informed discussions about the role of technology in our lives, let’s not forget the fact that the mere presence of technology does not immediately equal accountability. That, after all, is in our hands, not the technology we employ. All the videographic evidence in the world won’t hold guilty parties responsible. 
If the point weren’t already clear enough, we’re forced to keep learning it time and again, most notably in the case of several recent police shootings. Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Philando Castile — all examples of graphic death caught on video, which ultimately seemed to have little impact on the verdict of the officers involved in the shootings. In all of the above cases, video furthered the outrage of unwarranted death, but outrage and accountability are two different things, entirely. 
This is important to remember as the political temperature of the country reaches a boiling point. Yesterday’s events, sadly, were not an isolated incident. They may have been the most egregious example we’ve seen in recent memory, but things could get worse before they get better.
And technology, sadly, has undoubtedly played a role in this. Social networking echo chambers and the fragmentation and polarization of media platforms are powerful amplifiers of heated political rhetoric that have emboldened hate groups to march in the streets. 
In a time when all of these things converge to embolden individuals to take to the streets and spread messages of hate no longer shrouded in the hoods and robes of their forebears, technology can play an important role in shining a light on those involved. Video appears also to have played a role in the apprehension of a suspect accused of killing a 32-year-old woman by driving his car through a crowd of counter-protesters at the event. 
But let’s not forget that technology is politically agnostic. While it’s true that video can be edited or suppressed to tailor it to one’s political ends, technology in its purest form has no allegiance to belief systems or country. We are the ones who imbue it with meaning, and we are the ones who must make sure that those engaged in violence are held responsible for their actions.
All of the video evidence in the world won’t convict a person of wrong doing. As a nation in which the legal process is, at least, in theory, in the hands of its people — that ultimately falls on all of us.

Over the past few decades, comic books have become Hollywood’s most reliable well for source material. It’s easy to see why — not only is comics one the most vibrant storytelling mediums in the world, but the books themselves offer built-in storyboarding, providing writers and directors a visual template on which to build a film. 
This past week’s news that Netflix would purchase independent comics publisher Millarworld is hardly an outlier. It echoes larger moves made by Warner Brothers and Disney, when they purchased the two largest comics publishers, DC and Marvel, respectively, cementing their own cinematic comics universes. And while the specifics of those deals differ, both have kept their comics publishing wings most in tact. 
In the case of Netflix, however, the decision seems a bit more crass — or at least, it’s a decision that has very little to do with the comics themselves. There’s no doubt about the company’s motivations here. Seemingly spurred on by Disney’s plans to launch its own streaming media platform(s), Netflix went ahead and bought its own comic book universe. 
It’s a sort of preemptive measure. Netflix says it’s still in talks to hold on to Star Wars and Marvel titles, but if Disney opts to pull Marvel properties from the service, the service now has a Plan B in place. 
Unlike the DC and Marvel acquisitions, Netflix appears to be making no bones about the fact that it didn’t purchase Millarworld to get into the comics publishing business.  Yes, it says “Millarworld will also continue to create and publish new stories and character franchises.”
But also appears to be the key word here — as the press release spells out, the publisher’s main value to Netflix is in its IP: “The acquisition, the first ever by Netflix, is a natural progression in the company’s effort to work directly with prolific and skilled creators and to acquire intellectual property and ownership of stories featuring compelling characters and timeless, interwoven fictional worlds.”
Deals like this risk undermining the source material. It’s in line with a growing fear in recent years that, the comics industry has becoming something of a farm league for Hollywood films. And indeed, it seems that many prospective screenwriters and directors have come to view the comics industry as a back door into Hollywood..text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

Benchmark Sues Travis Kalanick | Crunch Report

Eric Reynolds, Associate Publisher of alternative comics house Fantagraphics, bluntly sums up the opinion of many in the indie comics community. 
“I have never read a Millarworld comic and as such have no clue and don’t really give a shit about this stuff, but of course it’s bad if media companies see comics as nothing more than IP factories,” he told TechCrunch. “I mean, if you actually care about the medium of comics, anyway, and believe that it has its own intrinsic value as an art form.”
This may all sound a bit alarmist, prompting the skeptical reader to quote crime novelist James M. Cain, who responded to concerns that Hollywood had ruined his novels by saying, “They haven’t done anything to my books. They’re still right there on the shelf. They’re fine.” Similarly, we might hope that no matter how many titles get pulled into the studios’ universe-building schemes, the comics themselves will be fine.
Except these larger corporate decisions are affecting the comics. Look no further than Marvel, where comics featuring the Fantastic Four and X-Men (characters whose movie rights were sold to Fox before the publisher started making its own films) have languished in recent years.

Sure, long-running titles can benefit from a break, but former Fantastic Four writer Jonathan Hickman was pretty open about the fact that that’s not what’s happening here: “I think it’s pretty common knowledge at this point that Marvel isn’t publishing Fantastic Four because of their disagreement with Fox.”
Might other comics publishers get bought up in similar deals? It doesn’t seem likely. Prominent companies like Image and Dark Horse have plenty of potential source material for future films, but the characters and stories are usually owned by creators, making it more difficult for a studio to acquire the rights in a single deal like this one.
Millarworld is an unusual publisher in that respect, making it perhaps an ideal target for Netflix. After all, the company doesn’t exactly represent the kind of organically developed universe built up over the course of decades as in the case of DC or Marvel. Nor is it a portfolio of disparate, mostly creator-owned titles like Image. Instead, the publisher is explicitly the vision of a single writer, Mark Millar, who launched the company in 2004, in order to develop his own work outside the world of Marvel, where he cut his teeth.

Over the past decade, Millarworld has become far better known for its IP than its actual books. While Millar’s early superhero work like The Ultimates and The Authority has its fans, you’d be hard-pressed to find Millarworld titles like The Secret Service, Kickass and Wanted on anyone’s list of their favorite comics. Instead, they were “successful” in the way that Millar probably intended: They were de facto pitches for blockbuster films.
Really, Netflix hasn’t so much purchased a publisher as it has the characters and services of one of the comic world’s best known writers. It’s a more roundabout version of the deal Amazon just made with Robert Kirkman, creator of The Walking Dead.
“The thing that’s most curious about Millarworld is that in my opinion it isn’t a brand except insomuch as Mark Miller wants it to be a brand,” TV Guide Managing Editor (and comics podcast host) Alex Zalben told TechCrunch. “[The Millarworld imprint is] a sign that Mark Millar is working with a name artist to get them to try something outside the Marvel/DC realm, not an interconnected series of stories, or universe. There are some great stories that can make excellent TV shows, but the only thing acquiring Millarworld does is let Mark Miller say ‘Netflix acquired Millarworld.’”
We’re not trying to be snobs or purists about this, insisting that comics and Hollywood remain completely separate. Even beyond the realm of corporate behemoths like Disney/Marvel, we’ve enjoyed cinematic adaptations of creator-owned comics like Ghost World and Hellboy (not to mention the Broadway version of Fun Home, where at least one of us cried). Nor do we begrudge indie luminaries like Dan Clowes and Marjane Satrapi, who have built successful new careers in film.
But we risk undermining the importance of the comics medium when movie studios — or even worse, comics creators — view them as only a commodity. This is the art form that gave us Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer Prize-winning Holocaust memoir Maus, the sprawling epics of Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez’s Love and Rockets, the formalist heartbreak of Chris Ware’s Jimmy Corrigan, on and on and on.
And yes, those titles might eventually be turned into movie or TV shows, perhaps even good ones. But the best comics aren’t just a proving ground for characters and plot lines. They take advantage of the medium’s unique combination of prose and graphic imagery, telling stories in a way that can never be fully replicated elsewhere. Their success is not measured in their contribution to Hollywood’s bottom line. It would be a shame to forget that.

Down with the tyranny of geography. Down with commuting, “the daily activity most injurious to human happiness.” Down with allegedly “collaborative” open floor plans built such that “high-level executives […] are exempt from this collaborative environment.” Up with more time, greater flexibility, and, believe it or not, higher productivity.
I’m talking about remote work, of course, a subject that provokes surprising vituperation whenever I write about it. (Armchair-psychologist theory: people get very angry at notions which imply they have spent much of their lives needlessly making themselves very unhappy.) It’s also a subject I know more than a little something about: we at HappyFunCorp have been building software with all-remote and/or partly-remote teams for seven years now. I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t.
What doesn’t work includes confusing physical presence with checked-in code, or in-person meetings with productive communications, or valuing the starry-eyed magic of “serendipitous collisions” above all else and/or common sense. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying remote work is a panacea. It too has its failure modes. But the assumption that its failure modes are worse than those of office work, just because office work is the historical default, is sheer intellectual laziness.


My feeling is if a company doesn't have a way to support remote and flex work, they don't know how to manage for results https://t.co/DmtkCCDwnJ

We at HFC do have a headquarters in Brooklyn, where a plurality of us labor, but I’ve worked successfully with teams scattered across New Delhi, Milan, New York, Berlin, Campina Grande, and San Francisco. In this era of Slack, Skype, and Github, a team of a dozen capable people across a dozen time zones can run like a well-oiled machine.
Quite apart from the time and rent saved, there’s growing evidence that remote teams can be more productive than in-person ones. Consider: “We found massive, massive improvement in performance — a 13% improvement in performance from people working at home.” Consider companies like Automattic, Gitlab, InVision, and Zapier, all of which thrive as fully remote companies.
And if still seems bizarre, weird, or experimental, consider this:
Surveys done by Gallup indicate that in 2016, the proportion of Americans who did some or all of their work from home was 43%, up from 39% in 2012. Over the same period, the proportion who only work remotely went to 20% from 15%
The biggest transition from office to remote work isn’t the geography; that’s incidental. The biggest transition is the mode of communication, which goes from default-synchronous (walk over to your colleague’s desk) to default-asynchronous (PM them on Slack.) I certainly concede that certain forms of work, and certain people, benefit more from synchronous communications; but I put it to you that “most kinds of software development” is not among them1, and that an ever-increasing fraction of the world’s work can be described as “most kinds of software development.”
However. Having said all that. Remote work is not without its flaws and challenges. Some people prefer a tight-knit work community to the broader but more loose-knit ones that remote work fosters, which is fair enough. “Serendipitous collisions” can and do happen among asynchronous communicators, too — posts on shared Slack channels can snowball into full-scale internal projects with surprising ease — but I think it’s fair to say that they’re more likely to occur in-person. And even the largest of all-remote companies have populations measured in the hundreds, not the thousands; once you hit a certain size you need a physical footprint.
The biggest problem of all, though, is that it’s much harder for (many) junior people to learn from asynchronous rather than synchronous communication. There are exceptions, the kinds of people who learn better from textbooks than from classes; but as a general rule, in my experience, remote work is for people who are already fairly capable and experienced. That’s fine for HFC and companies like us, we have the luxury of limiting ourselves to senior developers and/or the exceptions among juniors, but that solution doesn’t scale.
Looking at the increasing numbers, though, it seems awfully apparent that remote work is the future for a substantial fraction of the modern work force. I still find it bizarre that the notion apparently makes so many people so angry.

1Pair programming has its place in this world, but I spent six months working at a 100% pair-programming shop once, and it was one of the least pleasant experiences of my professional career. I recognize and celebrate that for many people it is excellent! For most of the rest of us, however, it is the polar opposite.

What a day for Bitcoin.
24 hours ago the cryptocurrency was trading below $3,700. About an hour ago it surged passed $4,000 and has no signs of stopping. It’s now trading around $4,135.00. For reference, a week ago Bitcoin hit an all-time high as it passed $3,000 for the first time.
Check out the chart below to see what the price has done in the last 24 hours.

So the million dollar bitcoin question is…why now?
Without wasting too much of your Saturday night with detailed analysis, here are a few possible reasons you can tell your friends during brunch tomorrow.
Two weeks ago Bitcoin went through a hard fork, and came out essentially unscathed. Sure, a bitcoin-clone called Bitcoin Cash was created, but it’s gotten a lot less attention than most people expected. A few days later Bitcoin locked in SegWit, a code modification that fixes malleability issues and frees up space in blocks, allowing for more transactions to be stored in each one.
These two code-related developments have helped boost conference in Bitcoin’s future.
Another reason – the ICO frenzy. The amount recently raised via initial coin offerings have now (at least temporally) topped amount raised via early stage venture capital. Just last week Filecoin raised $180 million in a few hours. Most investors have to convert fiat currency to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to participate in ICOs, which could be driving up the price (and providing some investors with their first taste of bitcoin).
Another reason – Wall Street’s new obsession is bitcoin. You can’t watch CNBC for five minutes without seeing a trader or analyst give their opinion – which is usually something insanely bullish like “it’s going to be the best performing investment of the year”. For better or for worse, statements like these are getting non-technically inclined investors interested in bitcoin, some of which are definitely buying coins for the first time.
So what happens next? No one knows. Bitcoin could crash 50% to $2,000 tomorrow or spike to $5,000 – and I don’t think anyone who truly knows crypto would be surprised at either option. E
veryone has a different opinion – some say the bubble is oversized and should have popped months ago – others think that bitcoin is currently just a fraction of what it could eventually trade at.
Whichever camp you fall in, here’s one friendly reminder: don’t invest more than you can afford to lose – because if you ask anyone who’s spent more than a few months in the cryptocurrency world they’ll tell you it’s a roller coaster.

Amazon is issuing refunds for those who’ve purchased possibly fake solar eclipse glasses on the site in anticipation of this summer’s big solar eclipse event.
A lot of folks have been gearing up for the event that will — depending on where you are — either totally block out the sun or partially block it as the eclipse moves across the North American hemisphere on August 21st. Many of these same people have turned to the ease of Amazon for ordering the protective eyewear needed to look directly up at the sky while the solar phenomenon passes overhead.
However, Amazon has not been able to verify all of the glasses on its site have come from reputable manufacturers and, as first reported in the Verge, has now sent out a safety warning, telling customers not to use the questionable eyewear.
“Safety is among our highest priorities,” an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch about the matter. “Out of an abundance of caution, we have proactively reached out to customers and provided refunds for eclipse glasses that may not comply with industry standards. We want customers to buy with confidence anytime they make a purchase on Amazon.com and eclipse glasses sold on Amazon.com are required to comply with the relevant ISO standard.”
Reports of safety issues have been going on for a couple of months. One woman whom Amazon recently refunded, bought 500 eclipse glasses in bulk on the site from a Chinese manufacturer who told her they were safe. It was only later she learned the manufacturer had purposely misled her with a fake safety labeling.
It goes without saying, but improper eyewear could seriously damage the vision of those looking directly into the eclipse. “Homemade filters or ordinary sunglasses, even very dark ones, are not safe for looking at the Sun; they transmit thousands of times too much sunlight,” warns the American Astronomical Society (AAS).
Amazon has reportedly been shutting down shops offering unverifiable eclipse eyewear and issuing notifications not to use them in case they cause eye damage but it may be a little too late for some who don’t get the warning in time. We’re also right up to the edge of purchasing the proper glasses from the site in time for the eclipse for those without Prime.
Of course, there’s still a wide selection available to choose from on the site if you are looking to get a pair. But, look for a mark on the glasses with the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard before purchasing. These glasses are verified to block out all but 1/100,000th of the Sun’s light and can protect your eyes from harmful radiation while you enjoy the event.
Also keep in mind NASA and the AAS only recognize a short list of brands that meet the proper safety standards. Check out the full list of approved manufacturers here before buying online.
Those Amazon customers who did not receive a message from the company warning them of the safety concerns have purchased a product that was confirmed by the supplier to be ISO compliant, according to Amazon. Those concerned they may have a non-compliant product can still reach out to Amazon’s customer service for a refund under the A-to-z Guarantee.

Not a minimalist? Startups will gladly store, manage and deliver your items
The state of the unicorn



For many of us, our first experience with fake meat involves rubbery tofu that tastes more like sneaker sole than seared filet. As we forage on, next come the veggie burgers, the soy dogs, the meatless meatballs, the caramel-brown vacuum-sealed lumps called field roasts.
Eventually, we grow accustomed to these chewy, protein-dense, vaguely meat-like foodstuffs. And yet, the dream lives on: What if fake meat tasted and satiated like the real deal?
These days, startups are developing products that more closely resemble animal proteins. Venture capitalists and strategic investors are piling on, too, collectively putting hundreds of millions of dollars to work in companies developing meatless foods offering high protein and, in some cases, a meaty taste.
Over the past two years, Crunchbase has identified about $250 million in disclosed investments in what we call the alternative protein space. Actual investment levels may be quite a bit higher as strategic investors don’t always reveal round size.
While progress has been made, there’s work to be done. Heading to the Marina Umami Burger in San Francisco on a weekend afternoon, Crunchbase News ordered an Impossible Burger, a veggie patty heralded for its beefiness, and a regular burger made the same way. We then cut them in half and had each variety in sequence.



Eating healthy with @chernandburn
A post shared by Alex (@alexwilhelm1) on Aug 6, 2017 at 2:22pm PDT


Without question, the Impossible Burger was edible. It was not lumpy; it was not an old shoe. But it was also very much not a burger. It remains firmly a substitute, not a replacement.
Luckily, there’s still plenty of capital sloshing around the fake meat venture ecosystem to fuel further innovation. Crunching the numbers, we’ve identified a few noteworthy trends for the alternative protein space. Here’s a quick overview of the key investment themes.
Investors chomp down on more late-stage rounds
It’s just as well there is no alternative protein unicorn. It just seems wrong to give a fake-meat company an animal moniker, even if it is a mythical one.
That said, there are alternative protein companies that have raised substantial sums of venture capital. This month, for instance, Impossible Foods, maker of the aforementioned burger, closed a $75 million Series E round that brings total funding for the six-year-old Silicon Valley company to more than $250 million. Backers include Bill Gates, Google and Temasek. So if anyone’s going to be the first soy-based unicorn, it’s probably Impossible.
The next most heavily funded company, Hampton Creek, has had its share of troubles delivering on its plan to produce veggie-based foods, in particular eggless versions of traditionally egg-reliant products like mayo. The San Francisco company has raised more than $200 million, including a $60 million round a year ago, and has its products on the shelves of major food retailers. But it has been in the news recently for internal problems, including the resignations a few weeks ago of four out of five board members.
Beyond Meat is also bulking up as it distributes more veggie burgers and mock chicken strips to grocery chains. The eight-year-old company has only disclosed $17 million of its total investments, but the actual total is much higher since the last several funding rounds have been of undisclosed size. Most recently, Beyond closed a Series F led by Tyson Foods and General Mills. The interest of Tyson, America’s largest beef producer, indicates that “big meat” sees promise, and potential competition, in the space.
Burgers and the art of “artificial meatener”
Much of the innovation in the fake-meat sector is centered around figuring out whether vegetables can be mixed up or engineered to taste more like meat. Just as the soda industry spent decades optimizing non-caloric sweeteners, alternative protein entrepreneurs are racing to perfect the 100 percent vegetarian “artificial meatener.”
Impossible’s quest began in 2011, with a five-year research project devoted to what creates the unique sensory experience of meat, and how to recreate it with plants. The closest thing Impossible has to an artificial meatener is an ingredient called “heme,” which is abundant in animal muscle and contributes to the characteristic color and taste of meat. The startup figured out how to take heme from soy roots and produce it using fermentation.
Beyond Meat, meanwhile, relies on pea protein for its meatless burger products. The startup uses “a proprietary system that applies heating, cooling, and pressure to align plant-proteins in the same fibrous structures that you’d find in animal proteins.” Beyond also adds yeast extract for flavoring, as it contains amino acids, including Glutamic acid, that add something resembling a savory meat taste to its faux beef and chicken.
Another approach, not targeted to those on a solely plant-based diet, relies on producing meat from animal cells, eliminating the need to raise livestock. Memphis Meats (actually based in San Francisco) has raised $3 million to pursue this goal. The startup isn’t selling products yet, but it has unveiled some of what it’s cooked up in labs, including a meatball, chicken and duck. Hampton Creek has also announced plans to deliver lab-made meat as early as next year.
Just add some protein
Not all the alternative protein investments are around mimicking meat. There’s also high consumer demand for healthy, convenient sources of protein, whether it’s in the form of pasta, shakes, chips or even water.
And these days, it seems like everybody wants more protein. While dieters cut carbs and slash fat intake, protein generally gets a pass, seen as a source of “good calories” that promote satiety and sustained energy levels. And although the pros and cons of high-protein diets are a topic of continued debate, there’s broad consensus about the value of high-protein foods in a balanced diet. Startups are seeking to address the cross-section of consumers who want the protein, but prefer to limit or avoid consumption of animal products.
Most recently, Detroit-based Banza raised $8 million to scale up production of chickpea-based pastas that offer a few grams more protein per serving than wheat-based varieties. At least three protein and meal-replacement beverage providers, Koia, Protein2o and Soylent, also closed multi-million-dollar rounds in the past three months. Soylent alone has raised more than $70 million to date to sell more beverages fortified with soy protein.
Eat bugs
Lastly, we look at bugs. Many bugs, and grasshoppers, in particular, are high in protein. They’re also commonly eaten in many parts of the world, and potentially marketable as feed source for livestock. And after looking at round counts, there are actually quite a few recent deals involving bug farmers, bug protein products and marketers of said products.
The Crunchbase database contains at least five companies in the insect protein space that have secured funding. The largest funding recipient is Exo Protein Bars, which makes snack bars containing cricket flour. The most recent funding recipient, meanwhile, is Hargol FoodTech, an Israeli startup that raised $600,000 this summer to build what it claims will be the world’s first commercial grasshopper farm.
Given that there’s not a lot of venture capital directed at this space, we’ll have to wait and see if it develops into something bigger.
A meaty conclusion
Anyone who thinks today’s alternative protein products sound too weird to satiate mainstream appetites should consider how drastically eating habits have changed over the last few generations. Some of the most popular meals of the 1900s apparently include a number of dishes, like chicken pudding and liver loaf, that would repel modern palates.
Fake-meat companies can get acquired for lots of money, too. Just ask Quorn Foods, whose private equity backers sold the company to Philippines food conglomerate Monde Nissin in 2015 for $830 million.
Quorn describes its veggie protein recipe as “taking a natural nutritious fungus from the soil and fermenting it to produce a dough called Mycoprotein.” Doesn’t sound too yummy, but apparently, the process produces tasty mock ground beef and chicken cutlets.

Two unconnected events that splashed controversy over the tech industry this week share the same underlying theme: Empathy. Or rather a lack of it.
Here’s the first: An internal memo written by a Google staffer was leaked to the press. The 10-page note, authored by a white, male software engineer called James Damore, argued that Google’s left-leaning political bias has created an “ideological echo chamber” that shames “dissenters” into silence.
Specifically, the writer criticized the company’s diversity efforts and tried to ascribe tech’s gaping gender gap to innate biological differences between the sexes. Among his suggestions for reworking the company’s internal culture was that Google should “de-emphasize empathy”.
“I’ve heard several suggestions for increased empathy on diversity issues,” wrote Damore. “While I strongly support trying to understand how and why people think the way they do, relying on affective empathy — feeling another’s pain — causes us to focus on anecdotes, favor individuals similar to us, and harbor other irrational and dangerous biases. Being emotionally unengaged helps us better reason about the facts.”
As others have noted, this amounts to a manifesto for the mass employment of robots instead of humans.
Shortly after the document was made public, Damore was fired by Google for “perpetuating gender stereotypes”.
In an email to staff explaining his decision to terminate Damore’s employment, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote: “To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.”
And here’s the second event: A consumer app, called FaceApp, which uses neural networks to power photorealistic face-editing features, added a new set of filters that gave users the ability to apply a different ethnicity to a face.
Asked why he thought it was OK to create what he termed “ethnicity change filters”, and why he did not feel the filters were racially insensitive, FaceApp’s founder, a white male software engineer called Yaroslav Goncharov, told us the filters were “designed to be equal in all aspects”, asserting: “They don’t have any positive or negative connotations associated with them. They are even represented by the same icon. In addition to that, the list of those filters is shuffled for every photo, so each user sees them in a different order.”
A few hours later, after public criticism of the filters, and after we had pointed out the historical context that makes ‘blackface’ racist and offensive, FaceApp removed them from the app.
Apparently, Goncharov and his team’s perspective on racism did not extend to considering the history of racist stereotypes.
And this despite FaceApp chalking up a prior race-related controversy, after a ‘hotness’ filter was shown to be equating whiteness with attractiveness by bleaching the skin of people of color. In that instance, FaceApp later said the issue had been caused by bias in their AI training dataset.
Now if we assume no out-and-out malicious intent, we must conclude that FaceApp’s team suffers from a lack of diversity, and thus exhibits low empathy for ethnicities outside its caucasian baseline — all of which drastically limits its perspective, causing the team’s product choices to bounce them from one offensive controversy to another.
At the same time, software engineers having less empathy is literally being lauded as a desirable goal — by a privileged, white male software engineer, Damore, who, until very recently, held one of the most coveted jobs in tech, as a “Googler”.
At the time of writing, Damore is busy donning the garb of a victim, describing his firing from Google as a “betrayal“, and being embraced by the alt-right as a ‘free speech martyr’ — instead of considering how his own limited (i.e. white, male) perspective has derailed his own career.
This former college kid is also displaying an apparent lack of historical awareness vis-a-vis what living inside a Gulag would actually be like…

FaceApp’s snafu is exactly the kind of situation that would — it logically follows — be more likely to occur if you were to adopt Damore’s idea of de-emphasizing empathy in your software engineering team, most especially should that team be drastically lacking in diversity (NB: Google’s engineering staff skews 80 per cent male)..text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

So, basically, [insert full spectrum facepalm emoji bar right here].
Don’t be stupid (or evil)
No consumer product exists in a societal vacuum. Which was a point we apparently had to make to FaceApp, as controversy flared over its latest racist filters — yet the team apparently remained clueless as to why they were once again offending masses of potential users.
You can’t ignore context. Or, well you demonstrably can, but you do so at your peril. Because it’s a spectacularly stupid thing to do.
The ability to see not only a bigger picture, but a fully rounded, full spectrum color picture is essential if you want your product to win friends and influence people everywhere, in all walks of life.
See, for example, how long it took Apple — a company whose executive ranks still skew overwhelmingly male — to add period tracking to its Health application. Um, ignoring the needs of ~50 per cent of the population isn’t good business sense, guys!
Being ignorant of gender issues or historical and cultural context might explain why you’ve failed to avoid the massive pitfall opening up in front of you. But it’s not a defense against failing massively.
You’re still going to trip up and fall right into that gaping hole.

Nor can your personal ‘sense of fairness’ and/or ‘facts/logic’ shield you from causing wider offense if you also lack the ability to see beyond your own monotone boundaries (also known as having a ‘limited perspective’ — a typical human state that can be ameliorated by empathizing with people other than and different to yourself).
If you have no idea about the history of racist stereotypes, and how they have been deployed to misrepresent and oppress, then I guess it’s possible to convince yourself that all you need to do to make sure your race-related product choices aren’t horribly offensive is to randomly shuffle the order you present your “ethnicity filters” and badge them all with an identical, globe-shaped icon.
However your product will remain horribly offense to people who do not share your (i.e. white, privileged) world view.
And you will quickly find yourself wearing the equivalent of an egg-on-your-face filter, as FaceApp has. At least they quickly pulled the filters when their obvious idiocy was pointed out to them.
Just as, if you have zero life experience outside of the privileged confines of elite engineering schools, where you probably mostly encountered other privileged white guys who shared the same world view as you, it’s apparently possible to convince yourself that the gaping gender disparity so massively evident all around you in the highly privileged space you and your male peers occupy and enjoy, is somehow, y’know, a naturally occurring phenomenon — like rainbows or cumulonimbus clouds — instead of stemming from the tectonic social forces that continually shape and bend individual choices and opportunities, i.e. long after a developing foetus has been exposed to prenatal testosterone.
It’s frankly amazing to watch a twentysomething Googler disinterre and rehash sexist myths that men are more ‘logical’ and women more prone to “neuroticism” — cherry picking some stuff he found on the Internet to use as citations to justify a prejudiced view — before confidently (and now publicly) calling for less empathy in the workplace.
And yet here we are.
The ugly connective tissue that’s being glimpsed behind the scenes across the tech industry, whether via outspoken anti-diversity sentiments or ill-judged digital product launches or indeed sexism that’s so baked in as to be systemic, does not look like a coincidence.
Nor indeed does the growing tsunami of dubious data readily available online — and trivially amplified with the help of additional powerful tech tools.

Overview
FaceApp is a photo-editing app that uses a neural network for editing selfies in a photorealistic way.

The app lets users upload a selfie or a photo of a face, and offers a series of filters that can then be applied to the image to subtly or radically alter its appearance — its appearance-shifting effects include aging and even changing gender.

Data, remixed and selectively spewed, is the weapon of choice in the culture wars. And it can be made to construct any narrative you choose. Someone should really tell Damore that’s not “science”; it’s fiction.
Increasingly, we’re glimpsing a sort of warped reverse mirror view of the Silicon Valley utopianism that tech CEOs love to project as a halo to shine over their “world changing” products.
The reality is rather more destabilizingly narrow and damaging to those who lie outside the member’s club.
Or, to put it another way, world changing for the worse.


It's 2017. How can an adult confidently argue that one gender has more empathy and collaboration AND is thus less suited to tech industry?😱😱

I don't mean to say they can't remain profitable. But this: the skills they sorely lack in-house is manifesting as harm around the world.
— Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep) August 8, 2017



To really spell it out: Your lack of perspective, your lack of diversity and your lack of empathy are your blindspots. And your blindspots will sink you and/or your product if you let them.
In Damore’s case, they have sunk his immediate career prospects.
Although, given he hails from a position of privilege, and is already being raised up by those who identify with an anti-diversity viewpoint — and handed a platform to continue to expose and amplify such views — he’s unlikely to be forced to go unemployed for long. Just as he’s hardly being silenced.
A better choice of T-shirt for Damore would carry the slogan: ‘RIP Irony’.
Other slogans are also available.
Off the top of my head, here’s a couple of ideas —

Encourage diversity
Embrace empathy
Don’t be an asshat

We reached out to Damore with questions about his views on empathy. At the time of writing he had not responded to, nor apparently read, our email — although he had updated his LinkedIn profile to add his #NewProfilePic

Last night, OpenAI’s Dota 2 bot beat the world’s most celebrated professional players in one-on-one battles, showing just how advanced these machine learning systems are getting.
The bot beat Danil “Dendi” Ishutin rather easily at The International, one of the biggest eSports events in the world, and remains undefeated against the world’s top Dota 2 players.

Elon Musk’s OpenAI trained the bot by simply copying the AI and letting the two play each other for weeks on end.
“We’ve coached it to learn just from playing against itself,” said OpenAI researcher Jakub Pachoki. “So we didn’t hard-code in any strategy, we didn’t have it learn from human experts, just from the very beginning, it just keeps playing against a copy of itself. It starts from complete randomness and then it makes very small improvements, and eventually it’s just pro level.”
To be clear, a 1v1 battle in Dota 2 is far less complex than an actual professional battle, which includes two teams of five players completing a variety of tasks simultaneously to achieve victory. But OpenAI said that’s working on another bot that could play against and alongside humans in a larger 5v5 battle.
Not shockingly, Elon Musk was watching along and had some thoughts of his own, calling unregulated AI vastly more dangerous than North Korea:


OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess & Go.

Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2017



This isn’t the first time Elon Musk has spoken up about the dangers of AI without regulation. He said that the process of setting up a government body to regulate AI should start in the immediate future, speaking at the International Space Station R&D conference a few weeks ago.
Musk has also thrown shade at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Twitter, saying that Zuck’s understanding of AI is limited.
Speaking at TC Sessions: Robotics, Rodney Brooks, founder of iRobot and Rethink Robotics, disagreed with Musk saying that, currently, there isn’t much to regulate.
If you’re going to have a regulation now, either it applies to something and changes something in the world, or it doesn’t apply to anything. If it doesn’t apply to anything, what the hell do you have the regulation for? Tell me, what behavior do you want to change, Elon? By the way, let’s talk about regulation on self-driving Teslas, because that’s a real issue.
At the same event, head of Amazon Robotics Tye Brady said the following:
I’m not really a fan of regulation. I’m a fan of doing whatever the customer seeks. We have a mission in mind to do order fulfillment in the best way possible. So, yeah, I’m not a fan of regulation.
Obviously, some of the world’s greatest minds in the fields of robotics/AI/ML are at an impasse, but the maturation of AI waits for no man.
If you don’t care too much about loyalty programs, chances are that you’ve been relying on platforms like Booking.com and Expedia to find the cheapest flights and hotel rooms. Moneytis wants to do the exact same thing, but for foreign exchange services.
TransferWise is arguably the biggest consumer brand in international transfers. Instead of telling your bank to send money to your bank account, you send money to TransferWise first. The startup then converts the amount and transfers your money to the other account abroad.
It’s been an eye-opening experience for many consumers who realized that they’re getting screwed by banks, Western Union, Moneygram, etc.
But TransferWise is just one player in this space. For instance, while the startup is usually quite competitive when you want to convert GBP into EUR, it’s not as competitive when you want to send money from the U.S. to Europe. Other services, such as CurrencyFair let you keep more money at the end of your transfer.
That’s why Moneytis is applying the Booking.com model to international transfers. The experience is quite straightforward as you just have to put two different currencies and how much money you plan on sending.
“I was an expat in China and Etienne [Tatur] was in Europe. And I was shocked by hidden fees every time I wanted to send money,” co-founder and CFO Christophe Lassuyt told me. “That’s when we listed and compared all solutions out there. Friends quickly asked us to see the list. We ended up launching a comparison tool. We then understood that users wanted to compare, but also transfer easily. That’s the service we’re launching.”
Moneytis then compares many services and displays the fastest service, the cheapest one, the most popular one, etc. You don’t have to sign up to other services as you can send your money directly on Moneytis.
The startup doesn’t add any fee. Instead, Moneytis takes a small cut from third-party services as it is generating leads for those foreign exchange services. On average, clients are sending $2,000 — Moneytis takes 0.3 percent (representing $6) and it’s transparent for the user.
There’s no clear winner in the foreign exchange space as big players like TransferWise only cover some currencies. Exchange rate volatility also means that some services are going to be cheaper one day and more expensive the next day. Finally, some services will be able to get better deals for particular routes.
Moneytis is clearly a volume play as the startup will need thousands of transfers per day to scale. It could build an API so that big clients can automate transfers and always use the cheapest service out there. This way, the service could become an essential tool for companies doing business in many different countries.

Shortly after a group of Uber shareholders asked Benchmark to relinquish its spot on Uber’s board of directors, Sherpa Capital’s Shervin Pishevar is petitioning Benchmark via Change.org to remove itself from Uber’s board. The petition also asks Benchmark to sell at least 75 percent of its stock so that the firm no longer has rights to appoint members to Uber’s board of directors.
“We have investors ready to acquire these shares as soon as we receive communication from Benchmark that they are willing to withdraw their lawsuit and sell a minimum of 75% of their holdings,” the petition states.
Benchmark is suing former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, alleging violation of fiduciary duty and fraud by seeking to “increase his power over Uber for his own selfish ends.” Benchmark’s lawsuit ultimately seeks to remove Kalanick from the board. Since filing the lawsuit, the tables have turned, and a group of shareholders is now asking Benchmark to remove itself from the board.
Uber’s board of directors has also spoken out against the lawsuit, saying it’s “disappointed that a disagreement between shareholders has resulted in litigation.”
Now back to the petition. At the time of publication, Pishevar’s petition had just 41 supporters. Change.org will deliver the petition to Benchmark once it hits 100 supporters. A source says Pishevar has sent the petition to some fellow Uber investors, asking them to get on board.
Why Pishevar thinks Change.org will be more effective, I’m not sure. I’ve reached out to him and will update this story if I hear back.
Here’s the full petition:

As a group of shareholders of Uber Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) we were surprised and distressed to learn through the media of the lawsuit brought by your firm against the Company, and its founder and former Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick.
Naturally, we share your concerns about the problems that the Company has confronted in recent months, but we are greatly concerned about the tactics employed by Benchmark to address them, which strike us as ethically dubious and, critically, value-destructive rather than value enhancing.
Specifically, we do not feel it was either prudent or necessary from the standpoint of shareholder value, to hold the company hostage to a public relations disaster by demanding Mr. Kalanick’s resignation, along with other concessions, on a few hours’ notice and within weeks of a personal tragedy, under threat of public scandal. Even less so your escalation of this fratricidal course – notwithstanding Mr. Kalanick’s resignation – through your recent lawsuit, which we fear will cost the company public goodwill, interfere with fundraising and impede the critical search for a new, world-class Chief Executive Officer. Benchmark has used false allegations from lawsuits like Waymo as a matter of fact and this and many actions has crossed the fiduciary line.
Benchmark’s investment of $27M is worth $8.4 billion today and you are suing the founder, the company and the employees who worked so hard to create such unprecedented value. We ask you to please consider the lives of these employees and allow them to continue to grow this company in peace and make it thrive. These actions do the opposite.
Accordingly, we would request that Benchmark help the Company realize its full potential by allowing the necessary work to be done in the Board Room rather than the Courtroom. To this end, at this point, in light of your suit against the Company, we believe it would be best, and hereby request, that Benchmark remove its representative from the Company’s Board and move promptly to divest itself of enough shares in the Company so as to cease to have Board appointment rights. We have investors ready to acquire these shares as soon as we receive communication from Benchmark that they are willing to withdraw their lawsuit and sell a minimum of 75% of their holdings.
We are also asking for a symbolic Board of Directors vote on this matter at today’s Board meeting to show how the Board of Directors stands on this lawsuit brought against the company, its founder and the 15,000 employees of Uber who have all worked so hard in concert to create the fastest growing company in history.
Many other shareholders share our views and will be adding their names in the days ahead.
Sincerely,
Shervin Pishevar

The comment period for the FCC’s proposal to roll back the net neutrality rules established in 2015 was originally August 16 — next Wednesday. But after advocacy organizations asked the agency to add time to the clock in order to look through existing comments, the deadline has been extended (against the strenuous arguments of the broadband industry) by two weeks, to August 30.
The EFF, Public Knowledge, the ACLU and more filed a motion at the beginning of the month asking for eight weeks to be added. There’s adequate reason for it; 20 million comments are a lot to wade through, and thousands of them are more than the simple “I support/oppose the proposal.” One filed earlier this week is from Representatives who actually helped write and modify the Telecommunications Act that grants the FCC its powers to begin with.
Given the enormous volume, scope, complexity, and importance of the issues raised in the first round of comments, good cause plainly exists for this request. An extension is necessary to give Movants and other interested persons a minimum of adequate time to work through the initial comment record and prepare thorough and well-informed replies.
A filing from several broadband and telecom industry groups opposed the motion, saying that there’s already been plenty of time, and anyway we’ve talked it all over before.
The debate over the proper regulatory classification and treatment of broadband internet access is neither new nor novel. All stakeholders have had multiple opportunities to weigh in on the core issues in play here for over fifteen years across a range of public dockets…the facts and issues presented remain the same today as they have been for the entirety of this debate.
The filing also points out that millions of comments appear to be fraudulent — associated with nonexistent addresses, or duplicates, or what have you. There’s no denying that, on both sides of the equation, it turns out. But if anything that suggests more time should be spent examining the comment record, not less.
At any rate, the Commission agreed to delay the deadline, but by two weeks — less than the eight asked for by the movants, but more than the ten days suggested (if extension there must be) by the opponents.
It will, reads the order from Daniel Kahn from the FCC’s Wireline Competition Bureau, provide the Commission with more thorough commentary, “ensuring that the Commission has a complete record on which to develop its decisions.”

The Uber saga continues, and the board of directors has weighed in on the brewing battle between early investor Benchmark and former CEO Travis Kalanick.
In wake of a lawsuit Benchmark filed against Kalanick, the company’s board has issued a statement urging both parties to resolve their differences so that employees can get back to work and the company can get back to hiring a new CEO.
Yesterday Benchmark sued Kalanick for fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty in Delaware Chancery Court. The lawsuit was filed in an effort to kick Kalanick off the board and get rid of a few empty board seats that were added last year, with Benchmark arguing that it never would have approved the addition of those seats had they been aware of Kalanick’s “gross mismanagement” of the company.
The mismanagement Benchmark cites in the case includes sexual discrimination claims brought against Uber earlier this year, as well as the acquisition of autonomous trucking company Otto, which has led to a trade secret case filed against it by Google-owned self-driving car unit Waymo.
Benchmark’s lawsuit led some investors earlier today to urge the investment firm to vacate its place on the board and divest enough shares so that it would no longer have board voting rights.
And now, Uber’s board is weighing in, through a statement sent out by Uber co-founder chairman Garrett Camp on behalf of all the directors — or at least, those who are not Kalanick or Benchmark.
In it, the board says it is “disappointed” the disagreement between shareholders has resulted in litigation and has urged the two parties to resolve the matter “cooperatively and quickly.” It also says that the board is taking steps to facilitate that process, but doesn’t go into details.
Already Camp has said Kalanick will not return as CEO, despite reports that he has been angling to do just that. The specter of the combative founder pulling strings behind the scenes has apparently spooked some CEO candidates, but of course, the litigation by Benchmark probably doesn’t help as the company continues its search for a new chief executive.
Full statement is below:
The Board of Directors is disappointed that a disagreement between shareholders has resulted in litigation. The Board has urged both parties to resolve the matter cooperatively and quickly, and the Board is taking steps to facilitate that process. At a time when thousands of employees around the world are working hard to serve our drivers and riders and continue to innovate, our priority remains to select Uber’s new CEO as quickly as possible. We are fortunate to have several outstanding candidates who share our belief in Uber’s great future.

A wise man once said “The hat mighta had a L V on the back but at the swap meet that ain’t jack,” and now researchers can ensure that the Louis Vuitton or Prada or Coach you bought is the real deal. The system, which essentially learns the difference between real and fake products over time, uses a small microscope connected to a phone.
“The underlying principle of our system stems from the idea that microscopic characteristics in a genuine product or a class of products-corresponding to the same larger product line-exhibit inherent similarities that can be used to distinguish these products from their corresponding counterfeit versions,” said New York University Professor Lakshminarayanan Subramanian.
The researchers have commercialized the product as Entrupy Inc., a startup founded by Ashlesh Sharma, an NYU doctoral graduate, Vidyuth Srinivasan and Professor Subramanian. You can even buy the product now and run a few dozen authentications per month.
The system is non-invasive and does not damage the merchandise. Because it uses a “dataset of three million images” you can assess a material almost instantly. It takes about 15 seconds to test a product and it can distinguish fabrics, leather, pills, shoes and toys. It can even tell if electronics are authentic.
“The classification accuracy is more than 98 percent, and we show how our system works with a cellphone to verify the authenticity of everyday objects,” said Subramanian.
Entrupy has raised $2.6 million in funding and has apparently authenticated $14 million in real and fake purses, watches and other fancy stuff. I can definitely help out if you get angry and feel the need to begin sockin’ more fools than Patrick Swayze because they are selling bootleg purses.
Snap, the Snapchat parent, has had a very difficult ride in the stock market since debuting in March. After pricing its IPO at $17 and then reaching highs of $27, the company has fallen to less than half that. After losing 14 percent of its value in a single day’s trading, Snap closed Friday at $11.83.
The growing social media company revealed on Thursday that it has 173 million daily active users, up more than 20 percent since last year. But that wasn’t enough to impress Wall Street, which was expecting more than 175 million users.
Analyst expectations are always built into the stock price and missing them will cause shares to plummet. And Snap not only missed on user growth, but revenue and losses, as well. 
The company brought in $181.7 million in revenue, a 153 percent increase from last year, but investors were expecting more than $186 million. But losses also increased substantially, $115.9 million for last year’s quarter versus $443.1 million for this year.
The success of Instagram Stories is one of the main reasons that investors are skeptical of Snap. Instagram copied its short-form video feature last year and has seen tremendous success. The Stories feature already has 250 million daily users, over 75 million more than Snap.
Snap also recently found out that it won’t be in the S&P 500, which is a significant blow because a lot of investors buy that index. And it looks like the company’s Spectacle glasses aren’t selling well.
The bull case for Snap is that the team has been innovative. The company popularized disappearing messages and came up with the stories idea. Snap also has been clever with its use of AI-enhanced face filters. But in order to survive as a public company, the team will have to come up with something that can’t be so easily replicated.
TechCrunch’s Josh Constine has a few ideas. 
The Libreboot T400 doesn’t look like much. It’s basically a refurbished Lenovo Thinkpad with the traditional Lenovo/IBM pointer nubbin and a small touchpad. It’s a plain black laptop, as familiar as any luggable assigned to a cubicle warrior on the road. But, under the hood, you have a machine that fights for freedom.
The T400 runs Libreboot, a free and open BIOS and the Trisquel GNU/Linux OS. Both of these tools should render the Libreboot T400 as secure from tampering as can be. “Your Libreboot T400 obeys you, and nobody else!” write its creators, and that seems to be the case.
How does it work? And should you spend about $300 on a refurbished Thinkpad with Linux installed? That depends on what you’re trying to do. The model I tested was on the low end with enough speed and performance to count but Trisquel tended to bog down a bit and the secure browser, “an unbranded Mozilla based browser that never recommends non-free software,” was a little too locked down for its own good. I was able to work around a number of the issues I had but this is definitely not for the faint of heart.
That said, you are getting a nearly fully open computer. The 14.1-inch machine runs a Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 processor and starts at 4GB of RAM with 160GB hard drive space. That costs about $257 plus shipping and includes a battery and US charger.
Once you have the T400 you’re basically running a completely clean machine. It runs a free (as in freedom) operating system complete with open drivers and applications and Libreboot ensures that you have no locked-down software on the machine. You could easily recreate this package yourself on your own computer but I suspect that you, like me, would eventually run into a problem that couldn’t be solved entirely with free software. Hence the impetus to let Minifree do the work for you.
If you’re a crusader for privacy, security, and open standards, than this laptop is for you. Thankfully it’s surprisingly cheap and quite rugged so you’re not only sticking it to the man but you could possibly buy a few of these and throw them at the man in a pinch.
The era of common Linux on the desktop – and not in the form of a secure, libre device like this – is probably still to come. While it’s trivial (and fun) to install a Linux instance these days I doubt anyone would do it outright on a laptop that they’re using on a daily basis. But for less than a price of a cellphone you can use something like the T400 and feel safe and secure that you’re not supporting (many) corporate interests when it comes to your computing experience. It’s not a perfect laptop by any stretch but it’s just the thing if you’re looking for something that no one but you controls.
Snap took a beating yesterday in its Q2 earnings, but in the midst of the disappointing financials and user growth numbers, the company’s 10-Q SEC document filed today also confirms that it purchased social maps app Zenly for $213 million, as TechCrunch first reported.
After Snapchat rolled out its location-sharing Snap Map feature in June, many were quick to point out the interface similarities to Zenly, a Paris-based startup which lets teens keep tabs on what their friends are up to and where they are. It turns out Snap hadn’t blatantly copied them for Snap Map, but had, in fact, acquired the team them while allowing the company and its app to operate independently.
SEC documents not only detail the $213.3 million acquisition price for Zenly, but also that the company paid $135.2 million for an “advertising measurement services company.”
Additionally the document discloses that Snap spent $62.1 million acquiring “a component of a business from a social advertising software company” as well as a startup that operates a “cloud hosted platform for building content online.”
Snap is taking a beating after missing investor expectations with the stock currently down more than 14 points.
Machine learning techniques excel at doing a good-enough job quickly in situations where there’s lots of data to grind through. It turns out that’s a great fit for backlogs of plant samples at herbariums and other repositories around the world, which have millions of the things waiting to be digitized and identified — including some that may be new to science.
There are thousands of such collections around the world housing some 350 million specimens like the ones shown. It’s suspected that hidden among them may be tens of thousands of new species — but the labor cost of manually going through all the samples to double-check them, modernize taxonomy and so on is prohibitive.
Not only that, but the valuable info in these slowly vanishing temples to the plant kingdom needs to be modernized in order to be of use to an increasingly digital-first scientific community.
Enter the deep learning system. The researchers, from the Costa Rica Institute of Technology and the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development, felt the time was right to let loose the technology on this huge corpus of data.
They trained a plant-identification algorithm on a quarter million images of plant samples, and set it to work IDing new sheets. It matched the species picked by human experts exactly 4 out of 5 times, and 90 percent of the time the correct species was in the algorithm’s next few guesses.
Depending on what discipline you’re in, those results may sound either good or bad. But this kind of work is as much art as it is science, and samples of a given species may vary so widely that two taxonomists may come to different conclusions. So getting it right most of the time on the first try is an excellent result. And anomalous results, of course, may indicate an unknown species and be flagged for extra attention.
As a bonus, the researchers found that if the algorithm was trained on images from an herbarium in, say, France, it was still effective if applied to samples from Brazil. This effective transfer learning was a relief, since it means a new system doesn’t have to be created from scratch and tweaked for every collection or style of plant sample.
The system’s expertise did not, however, carry over to leaf scan pictures, like those you might use to ID a plant in the field. The process of drying and mounting simply produces too different of an image type and whatever the system “learned,” it didn’t apply to fresh leaves. That was expected, though, and anyway, effective systems for that side of the science are already in use.
And don’t worry, it’s not going to put the botanists out of work.
“People feel this kind of technology could be something that will decrease the value of botanical expertise,” study co-author Pierre Bonnet told Nature. “But this approach is only possible because it is based on the human expertise. It will never remove the human expertise.”
Now that the basics of the system have been established, the researchers are looking to expand it. Metadata about the plants, such as when and where they were collected, what phase of flowering or growth they were in, and so on could improve accuracy and create research opportunities — for example, systematically comparing how leaf sizes of a certain species have changed over a century of climate change. Similar systems geared toward fossils or animal samples will also be informed by the team’s work.
The research was published this week in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis is concluding his tech tour of the West Coast today with a visit to Google’s Mountain View campus. Mattis spent time at Amazon and DiuX, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, earlier in the week. His key takeaway from all the socializing with tech leaders is that the Department of Defense needs to embrace technology coming out of the private sector if it hopes to stay ahead of the technological curve.
In a briefing before Mattis’ media address at DiuX, Sean Singleton, director of business development for the unit, explained that commercial R&D is outpacing federal R&D at a rate of nearly three to one. And companies like Amazon and Alphabet spend more on R&D than traditional military contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.
To stop the military from falling behind the times, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental works with startups to accelerate commercial innovation for national defense. DiuX provides non-dilutive capital to companies willing to work with the government to solve specific problems. The group’s work is similar to In-Q-Tel, a VC firm that brings the CIA closer together with tech companies.
The unit is focused on autonomy, AI, human systems/life sciences, information technology/cyber and space. But of those five investment areas, AI remains a key enabling technology for all of them. And Secretary Mattis was the first to admit that he sees many of the greatest advances in AI happening in the private sector.
“The bottom line is we will get better at integrating the advances in AI that are being taken here in the Valley into the U.S. military,” Secretary Mattis told reporters at the DiuX briefing.
Underscoring this point, Singleton told the story of DiuX managing director Raj Shah going into the desert with Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet. The two observed archaic processes for planning out tanker routes for jets with Schmidt insisting that the problem was fixable with technology, it just needed attention.
To date, DiuX has invested in Quid, Saildrone, Orbital Insight, Shield AI and more. These companies don’t solely produce products and services for the U.S. Government, but they promise to dedicate resources to address public sector priority problems.
For example, Shield AI drones can scan a house in a military context to identify threats. The drones and accompanying software also can serve the private sector, monitoring oil and gas fields and surveying construction sites.
DiuX currently has four offices across the United States, in Cambridge, Mass., Mountain View, Calif., Washington, D.C., and Austin. The 48-person team is expected to grow to 75 by the end of 2018, assuming Secretary Mattis is genuine about his commitment to build bridges between the military and private sector tech companies.
In what is rapidly devolving into an all-out brawl on the board of the world’s highest-valued private company, a group of Uber shareholders have asked the venture capital firm Benchmark to step down from the board of directors.
This move comes only a day after Benchmark took the aggressive step of filing suit against Uber’s former CEO Travis Kalanick, arguing that the founder had violated his fiduciary duty to the company and had committed fraud by seeking to “increase his power over Uber for his own selfish ends.” Their suit is seeking to remove Kalanick from the board and reduce his role at the company.
First uncovered by Axios, we’ve also confirmed that an email, signed by Shervin Pishervar of Sherpa Capital, Ron Burkle of Yucaipa Companies and Adam Leber of Maverick, criticizes the manner in which Benchmark demanded Kalanick’s resignation and their subsequent lawsuit against him.
“…We do not feel it was either prudent or necessary from the standpoint of shareholder value, to hold the company hostage to a public relations disaster by demanding Mr. Kalanick’s resignation, along with other concessions,” the letter says in part. “Accordingly, we would request that Benchmark help the Company realize its full potential by allowing the necessary work to be done in the Board Room rather than the Courtroom.”
The group further requests that Benchmark divests enough of their Uber shares (currently valued at $8.4 billion) to lose their board appointment rights. TechCrunch has reached out to Benchmark and Sherpa Capital for more details.
Uber declined to comment on the report.
Uber’s board of directors will reportedly be meeting later today. Below is the full text of the email, which was sent this morning:

As a group of shareholders of Uber Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) we were surprised and distressed to learn through the media of the lawsuit brought by your firm against the Company, and its founder and former Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick.
Naturally, we share your concerns about the problems that the Company has confronted in recent months, but we are greatly concerned about the tactics employed by Benchmark to address them, which strike us as ethically dubious and, critically, value-destructive rather than value enhancing.
Specifically, we do not feel it was either prudent or necessary from the standpoint of shareholder value, to hold the company hostage to a public relations disaster by demanding Mr. Kalanick’s resignation, along with other concessions, on a few hours’ notice and within weeks of a personal tragedy, under threat of public scandal. Even less so your escalation of this fratricidal course – notwithstanding Mr. Kalanick’s resignation – through your recent lawsuit, which we fear will cost the company public goodwill, interfere with fundraising and impede the critical search for a new, world-class Chief Executive Officer. Benchmark has used false allegations from lawsuits like Waymo as a matter of fact and this and many actions has crossed the fiduciary line.
Benchmark’s investment of $27M is worth $8.4 billion today and you are suing the founder, the company and the employees who worked so hard to create such unprecedented value. We ask you to please consider the lives of these employees and allow them to continue to grow this company in peace and make it thrive. These actions do the opposite. Accordingly, we would request that Benchmark help the Company realize its full potential by allowing the necessary work to be done in the Board Room rather than the Courtroom. To this end, at this point, in light of your suit against the Company, we believe it would be best, and hereby request, that Benchmark remove its representative from the Company’s Board and move promptly to divest itself of enough shares in the Company so as to cease to have Board appointment rights. We have investors ready to acquire these shares as soon as we receive communication from Benchmark that they are willing to withdraw their lawsuit and sell a minimum of 75% of their holdings.
We are also asking for a symbolic Board of Directors vote on this matter at today’s Board meeting to show how the Board of Directors stands on this lawsuit brought against the company, its founder and the 15,000 employees of Uber who have all worked so hard in concert to create the fastest growing company in history. Many other shareholders share our views and will be adding their names in the days ahead. Any shareholders who want to join this letter and petition may email one of our signatories of this letter so that we can submit a final list of shareholders who support this request.

Benchmark’s move is very controversial in Silicon Valley. “Things have really gone off the rails,” said Kate Mitchell, co-founder and partner at Scale Venture Partners, on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast. Uber has had “huge value destruction” and Benchmark’s team “obviously believes that there needs to be a huge wakeup call.”
One Uber investor, who asked not to be named, told us that Benchmark made a “shocking” mistake when it granted Kalanick control of additional board seats last year. He said it was not good for shareholders, but believed Benchmark was letting Kalanick do whatever he wanted because they thought of him as the next Zuckerberg.
And there could be a long-term impact on Benchmark’s deal flow. Investors cultivate a “founder friendly” image and some founders are already speaking out against Benchmark’s decision.


Cue every Benchmark portfolio company checking its shareholder documents. Glad to have GV, FRC and others on our board. https://t.co/7cbAzvV4GI

Facebook has acquired a German company called Fayteq that builds software add-ons for video editing that can remove and add whole objects from captured video using computer vision. The acquisition was first reported by a German startup publication (via Variety) and confirmed to TechCrunch, and could be useful as Facebook pursues additional video filter creation technology, both for its live streaming efforts, and for platforms like Instagram Stories.
Of course, being able to add objects to live video and remove them or cover them over on the fly is also something that can be put to interesting use in the emerging field of augmented reality. Facebook launched an AR platform for its built-in camera feature in April at this year’s F8, with the aim of encouraging developers to build AR experiences for use in Facebook on smartphones, which Mark Zuckerberg has said will be “the first augmented reality platform that becomes mainstream.”
Some aspects of this platform include recognizing real-world objects captured by a smartphone camera and applying digital effects specific to those objects. Facebook’s move into becoming an AR platform was made more interesting when Apple revealed plans to actually do much the same thing at a system level throughout iOS with ARKit, which makes it astonishingly simple for developers to add virtual objects to scenes.
Fayteq’s expertise could help Facebook continue to build out this area of its product plans, and its IP and patents could help the social network own the results of its work in AR more definitively, too.
Facebook confirmed the acquisition, but had no additional info to share regarding their plans for the company.
Y Combinator backed Plasticity is tackling the problem of getting software systems to better understand text, using deep learning models trained to understand what they’re reading on Wikipedia articles — and offering an API for developers to enhance their own interfaces.
Specifically they’re offering two APIs for developers to build “more robust conversational interfaces”, as they put it — with the aim of becoming a “centralized solution” for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Their APIs are due to be switched from private to public beta on Monday.
“One thing where we think this is really useful for is conversational interfaces where you want to integrate real world knowledge,” says co-founder Alex Sands. “We think it’s also really useful when you want to provide instant answers in your application — whether that’s over the entire Internet or over a custom corpus.”
One example might be search engines that are competing with Google and don’t have their own instant answer technology. “[They] could use something like this. We’re in talks with a few of them,” notes Sands.
“The other application is conversational interfaces who want a new NLP stack that will give them a lot more information than what an academic package like Stanford CoreNLP would provide them today,” he adds.
A few years back, the founders worked on a hack project that expanded the powers of Apple’s AI voice assistant Siri, by adding support for custom commands — such as playing a Spotify track or dialing up the temperature via a Nest device. This was before Apple opened up Siri to third party apps so they were routing voice commands through a proxy — and claim to have basically built “the first app store for voice commands”.
The experience taught them that “NLP in general is not robust” for handling more complex commands and queries, says other co-founder Ajay Patel.
“The other problem was a lot of the natural language processing tools out there really take a simplistic approach to understanding what a user says,” he adds. “The most simplistic way to explain it is they’re looking for keywords to figure out what a user is asking.”
Plasticity is taking a different approach vs these keyword-based NLP systems; building a system that understands the semantics of a sentence so it can perform a linguistic breakdown — “to figure out all of the relationships and entities in a sentence”.
They can then hand that information to developers so they can build “more robust conversational interfaces around it”, as Patel puts it — such as, for example, a chatbot that’s more conversational and capable, given it can serve up answers it found online.
“Today you can ask Siri fact-based questions, like who directed a movie, or who a particular song. But you can’t ask it a more useful question, like when is Stanford Spring break?” he adds. “It can’t take a sentence from the Internet and then find the direct answer in that sentence and then return that to the user.”
Instead Siri usually performs a Google search and serves those results to the user — leaving users to do the last mile legwork of extracting an actual answer.
Plasticity’s promise is to cut out that last step by returning the right answer directly to the user.
“Our core technology uses deep learning to figure out the base level of NLP tags — so that’s things like parts of speech, syntax dependency tree. So we use machine learning on the base to figure that out, and we use TensorFlow and Google’s SyntaxNet module,” says Patel. “And then on top of that we’ve built custom C++ code that basically operates a lot more accurately and a lot faster than a lot of the competitors out there.”
Of course if the Internet is your oracle then there’s limitless scope to return not truthful answers but full-on falsities, fake news and other skewed and prejudiced views — as indeed we’ve already seen Google Home do. Oops. So how does Plasticity avoid its technology falling into a similar trap and ensure accuracy in the answers its API can help provide?
“What we do right now is we run it only over Wikipedia,” says Sands on this. “Then the plan from there is to slowly expand whilst still maintaining that accuracy that you’re talking about.”
The API has been more than 1.5 years in development at this point, and they claim “much higher accuracy and much higher speed” at parsing sentences than IBM Watson, for example.
Initially, Patel says they focused on areas that existing, keyword-based NLP systems we’re handling well — such as lists — and then continued building out the complexity to handle other “linguistic edge cases”.
While they name Google as their main competitor at this point — given the company’s stated aim of organizing the world’s information, building systems that can understand text is a clear necessity for Mountain View’s mission — even so they reckon there’s room for another NLP player to offer similar services to the wider market.
“[Google has] put a lot of work into understanding text on the Internet to do their instant answer question and answering… But we really think that there’s still a space in the market for a solution for everybody else out there, who’s not Google, who’s not putting in hundreds of millions of dollars of investment into machine learning — and we really think they’ve got no ambition to become a leader in NLP. For example Apple actually outsources their question and answering on Siri to Wolfram Alpha.
“So we think there’s a significant place in the market to be the natural language processing solution and knowledge graph solution for all the other artificial intelligence products out there.”
And while their first focus is on building NLP tech that can understand semantic structure and perform granular linguistic analysis, Patel says they may also expand to other areas — such as program synthesis — to add more abilities to the API in future.
Funding wise, they’re still in the process of closing out their seed but have taken funding from multiple investors at this point — including First Round Capital’s Dorm Room Fund and General Catalyst’s Rough Draft Ventures. They’ll be looking for more investment after YC demo day, they add.

From Uber’s former CEO Travis Kalanick getting sued by his company’s lynchpin investors at Benchmark to Google’s struggles with a recently fired employee over a gender diversity screed that went viral, it’s been a wild week in tech. Meanwhile, Snap and Blue Apron both reported disappointing earnings — something we discuss in this week’s episode of the Equity podcast. From the boardroom to the trading floor, here are the stories that took Silicon Valley by storm this week.
This post exists primarily as the Weekly Roundup weekend newsletter. Sign up here to have it delivered to your inbox every Saturday. 
1. Benchmark sues former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick 
Benchmark, the Silicon Valley venture firm and early investor in Uber, has sued former CEO Travis Kalanick. The suit alleges that Kalanick committed fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. Both Kalanick and Benchmark hold Uber board seats. Benchmark accuses Kalanick of being “selfish” by packing Uber’s board with “loyal allies,” and that the ousted CEO broke the law by trying to pave the way for his own return. If successful, the Benchmark lawsuit could kick Kalanick off the board of directors, making his return impossible.
2. Google’s Sundar Pichai cancels internal meeting following firing of the employee behind gender diversity memo
After Google fired the employee behind a controversial memo on gender diversity that went viral within the tech industry, CEO Sundar Pichai cancelled a company town hall meeting where discussions about gender diversity were set to take place. Some employees fear that they may become harassment targets if they were to express unpopular opinions. In an email to employees, Pichai wrote, “Googlers are writing in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be ‘outed’ publicly for asking a question in the Town Hall.”
3. Snap sinks as Q2 growth and revenue fall short 
“Snap’s Q2 earnings report was another failure on a long, downward path for the social media company as user growth slowed under the pressure of Instagram,” reported TechCrunch’s Josh Constine. It looks like Snap’s “cool factor” may be wearing off, and the company will need a lot more than dancing AR hot dogs to fix its problems.
4. Blue Apron stock crashes after the company’s first earnings report 
Snap wasn’t the only tech company having a really bad week. With Blue Apron, “The problem quickly became getting customers to stick around and keep buying meals. This time around, the company was able to improve the health of its customer base as they are spending more money and buying slightly more meals, but it still has to show that it can grow that base even as it starts to pull back on marketing,” writes TechCrunch’s Matthew Lynley.
5. Coinbase raises $100M led by IVP at $1.6B valuation
Bitcoin reached a record high valuation of $3,000 per coin to complete a rollercoaster week that began with the long-awaited split of the cryptocurrency. Now the most established wallet and exchange service, Coinbase announced a Series D funding round. The startup has been in the right place at the right time to capitalize on the excitement in the industry. In other cryptocurrency news, Filecoin, the much-anticipated cryptocurrency that will eventually power a distributed file storage system, opened its record-breaking ICO for accredited investors after raising $52 million from advisors. 
6. SoftBank’s Vision Fund backs Flipkart in record India tech investment 
Flipkart confirmed that SoftBank has invested in its business, via its $100 billion Vision Fund, as part of an extension to the $1.4 billion financing round announced in April. The Vision Fund is buying a mix of primary and secondary sales, but the size of the investment is not disclosed. But we do know that the deal is the largest private investment in an India-based tech company, and it makes the Vision Fund one of the largest shareholders in Flipkart.
7. Toyota, Intel and others form a big data group for automotive tech
A collection of prominent names in the tech industry, including Denso, Ericsson, Intel and NTT Docomo, have teamed up with Toyota to work on developing big data systems to support self-driving cars and other future automotive advances. “The companies have come together to tackle concerns around data usage in connected cars of the future, a critical component to making real-time mapping, driving assistance and other services go from theory to working in practice. Handling the huge volumes of data in a reliable and secure manner is critical,” writes TechCrunch’s Jon Russell.
Weekend reads
Breastfeeding mothers have a few options when it comes to next-generation breast pumps, but a lot of them are expensive and the market has not been claimed yet. There can be a lot of anxiety surrounding how much you’re pumping and how much your baby is feeding. So what does the future look like for breast pumping tech? Read more in “How high-tech breast pumps help new mothers reclaim their time.”
Apple reported its earnings last week, and with a surprisingly positive report the shares spiked again as Apple signaled a potential huge iPhone release. The jump pushed Apple’s market cap to over $800 billion. If Apple’s promise plays out — or exceeds — what Wall Street hopes for the September quarter, we may soon be asking ourselves whether or not Apple really will fulfill the promise of a company that could hit a market cap of $1 trillion. Read on in “How Apple could become a $1 trillion company.”

Esports is becoming a true spectator sport, but will the average Joe one day care about competitive League of Legends or Overwatch or Counter-Strike the way they care about watching football on Sundays?
A number of factors are at play for esports to garner the same level of popularity as mainstream sports like football, baseball, basketball and fútbol everywhere but the U.S., some of which are within the control of the gaming industry and some that are not.
This week, CWL Champs is underway. It’s the grand finale to a year-long season of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and the first-place team will take home $600,000, the largest chunk of the $1.5 million prize pool for the tournament. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is the No. 4 competitive video game in terms of earnings, according to e-Sports Earnings. And it’s through the lens of this franchise, its competitive history and this particular tournament that we can look at the various ingredients necessary to take esports into the mainstream.
Infrastructure
Where would the NFL be without stadiums and broadcast television? Esports as an entity is a toddler at this point, but there’s visible growth happening when you look at the way these leagues are maturing. Though competitive Call of Duty has a rich history, it wasn’t until January 2016 that Activision introduced the Call of Duty World League (CWL).
The CWL brings with it a direct line to the game-makers themselves, which makes the prize pool bigger and the viewing experience better. Casters, the folks who drive the viewing experience for the audience and commentate over the action, are now able to actually offer a high level of production value to the experience.
For example, Activision and Treyarch made it possible for casters to change the colors of the teams to fit their real-world team colors for the Black Ops 3 seasons. The caster also offers the ability to silhouette players in their team color whether or not they’re in direct view on the screen.
“The line of scrimmage in the NFL is a big inspiration for player silhouettes,” said Kevin Flynn, director of product marketing for the CWL. “We try to be hyper aware of innovations that impact the viewing experience of spectators.”
For reference, the talent at the professional Call of Duty level is so high that most players are usually behind full-body cover at any point in the game. To an amateur, without player silhouettes, we’d have a difficult time seeing any of the players on the map at all.
This seems like pretty obvious stuff, but these refinements wouldn’t be possible if the publisher of the game wasn’t somewhat invested in the competitive league play and viewing experience.
Sometimes that investment comes in the form of an ever-refining CoD-caster, and sometimes it comes in the form of actual investment. Activision acquired MLG.tv in January 2016, just before the launch of the CoD World League, in a deal valued at $46 million. Plus, Activision has implemented an in-game streamer so that folks playing IW or Black Ops 3 on a PlayStation 4 can watch directly from their console. And that doesn’t include the live streaming on YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and even on broadcast TV in Europe.
Now, this is hardly ESPN, but it’s a start to uniting the game-makers and the viewers under the same roof. And while most viewers of a tournament like CWL Champs are amateur CoD players or industry folks, it’s not difficult for a non-gamer to make the leap into watching a game like this.
Last weekend was the Stage 2 Playoffs, which determined the seeds for this weekend’s Champs tournament. I happened to be tuned in when a handful of friends came over, and threw it up on the big screen when they arrived. Three of my five guests never played Call of Duty, and certainly never watched esports. And yet, after peppering in a few questions to understand the basics, they seemed perfectly content and maybe even excited to watch the action go down.

Narrative
Part of that is due to the casters, who work hard to explain the rules of the game, the strategies and the context of those strategies in laymen’s terms.
But beyond explaining the difference between gamemodes like Hardpoint, Uplink and Search & Destroy, these casters also do an incredible job of setting up the storylines of the teams and the players. This is yet another area where the CWL is taking cues from Big Sports.
“The casters do a great job of demystifying things, breaking down and celebrating big moments, just as traditional sports have done so well,” said Flynn. “We’re also trying to emphasize the star power of these guys and celebrate rivalries, as the NBA has done so fabulously with players like LeBron versus Stef Curry, and Kyrie Irving versus Kevin Durant.”
Unfortunately, Call of Duty happens in a digital world with virtual characters, and the viewer doesn’t necessarily get to know Clayster or Scump or Gunless as anything more than a gamertag on a screen. The CWL is working to give more insight to player profiles, and the players are putting themselves out there as real people with real lives.
For example, only a few weeks ago one of the greatest AR players in the game, James “Clayster” Eubanks, was traded from his long-time home at Faze Clan (a dominant force in competitive Call of Duty) to the new, rising team on the scene, eUnited. He was traded for the game’s newest superstar, Pierce “Gunless” Hillman.

And Clayster explained the whole thing to fans, in his own words, via YouTube.

It’s the equivalent of trading Dak Prescott for Aaron Rodgers, who fittingly is the mainstream athlete that Clayster most likens himself to.
“I’m a big Aaron Rodgers fanboy,” said Clayster. “I love the way he goes about things, the logical decisions he makes, always calm and cool. He shows hype when he does something crazy, but he’s always grounded in logic.”
So imagine the drama surrounding the Stage 2 Playoffs when eUnited outplaced Faze and Clayster went on to play in the finals of the tournament.
And then there’s the story of Optic Gaming, undoubtedly the most dominant team in Call of Duty for a few years running. Two of the veterans on the roster, Damon “Karma” Barlow and Ian “Crimsix” Porter, have won championship rings on other teams and have quite the resumes. But Seth “Scump” Abner (considered the best player in Call of Duty history) and Matthew “Formal” Piper (a legendary AR player who moved from competitive Halo a few years ago) have yet to get their rings.
“I think the worst thing to do is to put pressure on myself and the team,” said Scump. “It’s just another tournament, and we’re going to work map by map and go through it together. I can’t think about it.”
For some perspective, Optic Gaming is currently playing their first match of the day, and viewership on the MLG.tv stream alone is hanging around 50,000 viewers.
The last two years in a row, Optic Gaming has choked at Champs, despite the way they’ve dominated tournaments and league play. Will they finally clutch up this year? Will Scump and Formal get their rings?
Time
The NFL is nearly 100 years old, and esports is a baby by comparison. But the model of esports is around amateur players becoming viewers, and the ESA says that more than 150 million people play video games regularly in the United States alone.
That audience shouldn’t be difficult to convert, and each of those players-turned-viewers inevitably becomes some sort of evangelist for players of other games, or non-players. We watch action movies all the time, and we love rivalries and underdog stories. Esports brings those two things together in a way that is instantly gripping, even for this nearly 30-year-old female tech reporter.
Plus, the sheer amount of cash being pushed around in this industry is staggering. Forget the $4 million prize pool across the whole season of Infinite Warfare. These players have deals with brands like Lootcrate, Brisk Mate, Scuf, Turtle Beach, Astro Gaming and more. In fact, Optic Gaming just got an endorsement deal with Chipotle.
“I used to play for $2,500 for first place in tournaments and now I’m playing for $150,000 today,” said Scump. “And when the bigger matches of the tournament get going later today, this place is going to be insane.”
My generation dreamt of being a pop singer or a quarterback, making riches and bathing in fame. Today’s young people dream of playing video games to make their millions. Just this year, there are 20,000 players who are trying to be CoD pros by participating in the pro point program, up nearly 400 percent from last year.
These players are becoming role models, breaking stereotypes of the way that most people think of gamers.
“There’s a level of accountability you have to hold yourself to,” said Clayster. “The players and organizations have taken steps toward breaking the stereotype of the basement dweller. A lot of parents don’t understand it, but there are tons of fans watching me and looking up to me that I’ve met personally and I try to explain to them and their parents what a big deal it is. That we’re playing at Amway Center for $1.5 million.”
Just like my dad grew up watching football with his dad, and I grew up watching football with my dad, there is a generation of gamers out there who will raise their children watching esports. And I’ll probably be one of them.

Hey startups! Disrupt San Francisco (September 18-20) is just a few weeks away and registration is open for startups looking to showcase their product or company to thousands of people on the Disrupt floor. According to Crunchbase, startups that exhibited in Startup Alley at Disrupt SF 2016 raised more than $35 million in seed and Series A funding post-Disrupt, with $4 million of that raised in just the first three months. 
But don’t just take our word for it, Sage Wohns of Agolo said: “Disrupt was a phenomenal event for us, meeting new partners and reconnecting with high-value customers [like] Samsung and HP as well as bunch of investors too.”
For $1,995, you’ll get one full day to exhibit, two full conference passes to Disrupt SF and admission to our After Party (as long as you’re over 21). Ready to join us? You can secure your exhibit spot here.
What else do you get with your participation in Startup Alley, you might ask?
Well, you get access to CrunchMatch, Disrupt’s startup and investor matching program. It’s designed to make it easy for startups to meet investors based on a curated analysis of which startups fit with a given investor’s profile. 
In addition to CrunchMatch, Startup Alley companies have the opportunity to be selected as a “Wild Card” and participate in the famous Startup Battlefield competition. On Monday and Tuesday of the conference, attendees will be able to vote (via the Disrupt app) for their favorite startup. Through a combination of attendee votes and TechCrunch editorial votes, one startup will be chosen on each day to participate in Battlefield. At Disrupt NY 2017, RecordGram went from Startup Alley to Wild Card and ended up winning the Startup Battlefield competition — and took home $50,000! 
Over the course of the three-day conference, you’ll make tons of connections with other tech enthusiasts and listen to panels covering topics ranging from artificial intelligence & machine learning to hardware, and more.
So, if your company is less than two years old and has less than $2.5 million of funding, Startup Alley is the place for you.
Secure your table here before we sell out!

Everything that’s old is new again. That’s how the tech game is played. Products evolve and leave vacuums for new startups to rush in and fill. For Mighty, the long, slow death of the MP3 player presented just such an opening.
The company launched a Kickstarter last year with the promise of “streaming music without your phone,” delivering the still-tangible benefits of devoted music hardware for the Spotify generation. The startup built up enough excitement to hit $300k on the crowdfunding site, and the recent end of the iPod shuffle and nano have only furthered that interest among consumers.
CEO Anthony Mendelson tells us that company has embraced the media’s christening of the devices as an “iPod shuffle for Spotify.” While much of the underlying technology is different, the principle is basically the same: a screenless, clip-on player for taking music on the go.
It’s a small niche in the overall music listening market, and clearly Apple didn’t see enough value in continuing to produce the things.
But there are certain scenarios that aren’t served by phones alone. Fitness is probably the largest — going for a run with a smartphone is a pain. There’s also an opening for users with an underground commute and people who frequently have to switch into airplane mode. Parents have expressed interest in the device so they don’t have to hand kids their phone to listen to music and people have also picked a Mighty up for elderly parents.
Price was alway the other key to the shuffle’s success, and Mighty has taken great pains to keep its first player under $100. That’s easier said than done for a relatively small run from a brand new company, but the device (known as the M1, internally) is priced at $86 — pricier than the last Shuffle, but at a considerably higher (8GB) capacity. Hitting that price point required some comprises on the company’s part, and there are still a fair number of wrinkles to iron out here, but the first Mighty will tick most of the important boxes for users.
Small, but…

The Mighty’s not a bad looking player. It’s a bit boxy and fairly reminiscent of the shuffle — the form factor, after all is fairly limiting. The startup’s industrial design lead came over form Samsung and took the necessary precautions to avoid coming too close to Apple’s design language here.
The result is a similar circular button array, with play/pause at the center. The circle sports volume and track advance options, though, oddly, there’s no fast forward or rewind yet. It’s a pretty big blindspot for a music player, but apparently the Spotify API that allows for it creates a pretty big lag. Mendelson tells me the company is working on a fix, but didn’t offer a timeframe.
Above all that is a button designed specifically cycling through playlists, the primary method for inputting music from Spotify, at present. Playlists certainly make sense as a method for grouping together music on a playing without a screen. Otherwise it’s all a big crapshoot. There’s also a robot voice that lets you know the name of each playlist before it begins.
The player is made from a plastic composite. It feels a bit cheap — one of those aforementioned cost cutting measures. Mendelson tells me the company is looking into building an aluminum model for the next go-round, but the current model is still reasonably rugged. It can withstand a quick dip water and will likely survive a couple of falls onto the harsh concrete below.
There’s also a big clip on the back, a la the shuffle, and headphone jack up top. The device will connect to Bluetooth headphones, but excluding a hardwired option doesn’t make a lot of sense on a device that counts cost among its main selling points.
Stream team


Apparently Spotify was so impressed with Mighty’s Kickstarter that it decided to work closely with the startup. For Spotify, it mean a piece of hardware devoted exclusively to its service, without having to invest in any R&D. For Mighty, it means a figurative seal of approval, along with a literal one on the product’s packaging.
As far as actual integration goes, the setup requires tying a bunch of accounts together. Mighty has its own app that needs to be associated both with the Spotify app. Users can also tie it directly to Facebook for quicker account set up. Direct integration with Spotify would be nice, but the streaming service isn’t really set up for that. Instead, users drag and drop content through the Mighty app.
That means there’s a lot of switching back and forth — you make the playlists on Spotify and import them through Mighty. It feels like a bit of a workaround, but unless Spotify ends up embracing this sort of technology more fully, it’s a necessary one. At very least, it gets the job done.
Mighty’s full embrace of the Spotify SDK means offline streaming works exactly the way the service wants. The built-in WiFi means the device connects to Spotify’s server at regular intervals, ensuring that the account associated with the device is still active (up to three offline devices can be associate to one account). If it goes 30 days without checking in, the system tacks a vocal watermark to the music, telling you to sync it, and assumedly ruining the listening experience in the process.
One step beyond

The Mighty is a good first step for the company. And if you’ve had a shuffle-sized hole in your life since streaming conquered the music industry, this should fill it pretty nicely. But there’s still a lot of room for the product to grow, and in some ways this first product feels a little rushed. Mendelson told me during our conversation that the company worked fast to be “first to market.”
It’s odd phrasing for a device that’s essentially a streaming update to a bygone product, but Mighty clearly wasn’t the only company circling the idea. Pebble was flirting with the idea with Core before the company imploded and was subsequently swallowed up by Fitbit. If the LTE-enabled Apple Watch rumors prove true, that could potentially cut into a significant piece of Mighty’s niche, by playing to runners looking for musical accompaniment beyond the phone.
Mighty is clearly already looking beyond this initial release. Mendelson has already previewed a number of things the company is working on to both improve this first generation and offer up in the inevitable M2 device.
Some of the key things coming to this first device include:

Fast forward/rewind
Shuffle (another glaring omission, given all of the iPod comparisons
Support for dragging and dropping non-playlist content, i.e. dragging songs in by album or folder
The ability to use the product as a storage device for non-music content

And for the M2, we can expect some combination of the following

Aluminum backing and clip (the front will remain plastic for bluetooth transmission purposes)
Full waterproofing
The addition GPS and an accelerometer for fitness functionality, including syncing music to running speed.

You can probably expect that model to arrive roughly a year from now, at a higher price point than the current version. More than likely it will exist alongside its predecessor as Mighty continues to work to improve functionality on that unit. It remains to be seen how large the market really is for these devices, but as it stands, the Mighty does a pretty admirable job filling in the gap left by the iPod shuffle and its ilk.

Netflix is still in active talks with Marvel over potentially retaining streaming rights to Marvel and Star Wars movies after 2019, which is the date Disney has set for when it’ll remove Disney and Pixar movies from the subscription service in favor of its own in-house Disney streaming offering.
We already knew the fate of Disney’s Marvel co-production TV shows, including Daredevil, The Punisher, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Luke Cage and The Defenders was not subject to the new arrangement Disney announced earlier this week. These ongoing talks around feature-length Marvel and Lucasfilm-made movies reveal those could also still have a future at Neftlix.
When the deal was announced earlier this week by Disney CEO Bog Iger, the fate of the Marvel and Star Wars films wasn’t yet fixed. Netflix told Reuters on Friday that “active discussions” are going on right now to retain streaming rights beyond 2019, and it seems possible that this could end up being the result depending on Disney’s goals with franchises housed under the Marvel and Star Wars brands.
While it sounds far from something settled, it could be that Disney’s own streaming service is focused more on entertainment for families and children, while the more mature reach of the Star Wars and Marvel films end up being better suited for a distribution platform with a broader audience. It’s also very possible that Disney’s still evaluating how it would position Marvel and Star Wars dedicated subscription services, something it’s been rumored to have mulled in the past.
Whatever the outcome, Netflix isn’t slacking on its alternative content options: The company continues to invest in and produce plenty of original content, and will only be ramping up those efforts in the near future.
SoundCloud has just closed the necessary funding round to keep the struggling music service afloat. CEO Alex Ljung will step aside though remain chairman as former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor replaces him. Mike Weissman will become COO as SoundCloud co-founder and CTO Eric Wahlforss stays as chief product officer. New York investment bank Raine Group and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek have stepped in to lead the new Series F funding round of $169.5 million.
SoundCloud laid off 40 percent of its staff last month, with 173 employees departing in an effort to cut costs. The company only had enough runway left to last into Q4, and today’s investor decision was viewed as a do-or-die moment for the company. Now it will have the opportunity to try to right the ship, or sail into an established port via acquisition.
SoundCloud declined to share the valuation or quantity of the new funding round. Yesterday, Axios reported the company was raising $169.5 million at a $150 million pre-money valuation. That’s a steep decline in value from the $700 million it was valued at in previous funding rounds. The new Series F round supposedly gives Raine and Temasek liquidation preferences that override all previous investors, and the Series E investors are getting their preferences reduced by 40 percent. They’re surely happy about that, but it’s better than their investment vaporizing.
Raine will get two board seats for bailing out SoundCloud, with partner and former music industry attorney Fred Davis, and the vice president who leads music investments, Joe Puthenveetil, taking those seats.
While abdicating the CEO role probably wasn’t exactly what Ljung had hoped for, at least he gets to stay on with the company as chairman of the board. “This financing means SoundCloud remains strong, independent and here to stay,” he wrote.


As I said @SoundCloud is here to stay. I'm very excited to announce that we're ready and strong for decade II. https://t.co/c78jEy9ubz
— Alexander Ljung (@alexanderljung) August 11, 2017



SoundCloud says its total revenue is now at a $100 million annual run-rate. If it can keep costs low and grow that number, it may eventually get to break even and no longer need infusions of investor capital.
TechCrunch broke news about the magnitude of the SoundCloud crisis last month. Sources from the company told us the layoffs had been planned for months, but SoundCloud still recklessly hired employees up until the last minute, with some being let go within weeks of starting. Employees told TechCrunch that the company was “a shitshow” with inconsistent product direction and dwindling cash. Ljung was seen as reluctant to be honest with the team, and unfocused as he partied around the world like a rock star.
Our report led to a flurry of follow-on coverage, prompting fans and artists to speak up in favor of the service. The rally was reminiscent of the love shown to Vine after Twitter announced it would shut down. Popular musician Chance The Rapper tried to get involved to save the company. He, like many other indie hip-hop artists, made their name on the platform as part of a genre that came to be called “SoundCloud Rap.” In the end, SoundCloud was saved when Vine wasn’t.

For now, music and other audio saved on SoundCloud is safe. But the company will need to find a way to make its subscription tiers more appealing and scale up its advertising despite having much less staff to drive the changes. If it can’t, SoundCloud could be back begging for cash in a year.
The new management should provide some additional confidence. I’ve interviewed both Ljung and Wahlforss in the past, and neither had answers to the big questions facing SoundCloud about its product direction, business model and the spurious copyright takedowns that have eroded its trust with musicians.
Trainor may be able to institute some more discipline at the startup. He was the CEO of Vimeo from 2012 to 2016, and has poached his former COO there to help run SoundCloud. They helped Vimeo fend off bigger rivals like YouTube by doubling down on what was special about the service: a focus on high-quality artful film rather than amateur viral videos. That experience makes Trainor a great fit to lead SoundCloud, which is fending off bigger rivals like Spotify and Apple Music.
SoundCloud’s best bet isn’t to battle them directly, but double down on the user-uploaded indie music scene, including garage demos, DJ sets, unofficial remixes and miscellaneous audio you can’t find elsewhere. Whether it stays independent long term or tries to seduce an acquirer, SoundCloud will benefit from spotlighting its unique community of creators and hardcore listeners.

Yesterday, Benchmark, the powerful venture firm and a major Uber shareholder, filed a lawsuit against the company’s recently ousted CEO Travis Kalanick in a remarkable move. The suit seeks to remove Kalanick from the board, while eliminating three additional board positions that it says Kalanick sought (and won) approval for last year, partly by withholding crucial information from the board.
The central issue: When Kalanick resigned as CEO, he also resigned from his board seat, but he quickly re-appointed himself to one of those outstanding and “fraudulently procured” seats, says Benchmark. It now alleges that Kalanick ultimately hopes to “pack the board to facilitate his desired re-appointment as Uber’s CEO,” and it aims to stop that maneuver.
The suit casts Kalanick in a highly unflattering light yet again. But if I were an investor in Benchmark’s funds, I’d be just as furious with the venture firm. What was Benchmark thinking, giving Kalanick three new board seats and carte blanche to do with them whatever he liked? It’s beyond belief that the firm wasn’t acutely aware of Kalanick’s management style a year ago when it agreed to this crummy deal. It had front row seats into what was happening at the company — not to mention unfettered access to the endless media coverage that Uber’s controversial corporate culture has received since its initial launch in San Francisco. A February blog post by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler may have set off the chain of events leading to this moment, but nothing new transpired between last year and this year other than intensified media scrutiny combined with growing public outrage.
“It feels a little to me like they painted themselves into a corner, and now they’re crying about it,” says succession expert Jeff Cohn of Benchmark’s lawsuit. “It was poor and unusual governance practice, and now it’s come back to bite them.” Adds Cohn, “There was always doubt around Kalanick’s style.”
We reached out to Benchmark earlier this morning. The firm hasn’t responded to our request as of this writing.
Despite the unprecedented nature of the suit — Benchmark has been sued in the past by a former portfolio company but has never sued one of them, as far as we know — it isn’t surprising, looking back at the last decade or so. As one institutional investor with many years of experience (and a penchant for privacy) tells us, “Giving away three board seats is far from standard operating procedure, but as you’ve seen over time, the leverage has swung from investors to founders, and now there’s this worship of the genius entrepreneur founder who can do no wrong.”
The problem, continues this person, is that, “that’s bullshit. It started with the Google guys, then Mark Zuckerberg. Now we have Snap, which gave shareholders no voting rights at all,” and is also backed by Benchmark, notably.
Asked if Benchmark’s own investors might have the stomach to sue Benchmark, this person jokes that “every VC today could probably be sued by [their own institutional investors]” for their overly relaxed approached in dealing with startups.
Either way, he believes that Benchmark’s lawsuit — which he calls a “misstep” — is “a completely obvious outcome of all this excess and absurdity of the recent years. It’s like when you’re a parent and you spoil your kid and he turns out not to be what you hoped. Are you going to love him or cut him off?”
Benchmark has clearly made its choice — cutting off ties to Kalanick with this lawsuit — but the move puts Benchmark in a particularly precarious position.
Not only does the lawsuit feel disingenuous, but the six-person partnership — considered among the top firms in the world and a unique alternative to fierce rivals like the sprawling Andreessen Horowitz, as well as the more metrics-driven Sequoia Capital — has now made plain that when push comes to shove, it won’t be so founder-friendly after all.
Even for seemingly thick-skinned Kalanick, that must sting. Given Benchmark’s reported 10 percent stake in Uber, its partners each stand to make hundreds of millions of dollars from the company in carried interest.
“They were riding the gravy train, and now they’re sticking it to him,” says the institutional investor of Benchmark. The optics, he notes, aren’t great. “These guys are all billionaires anyway, but this could definitely taint their reputation.”
A second institutional investor who also believes Benchmark should shoulder more of the blame, agrees that founders may grow wary of the firm following its recent actions. But he notes that even this worst-case scenario isn’t likely to turn off Benchmark’s backers.
Aggravated though they may be, “every [limited partner] will still re-up with Benchmark,” says the second investor. Between Benchmark’s early bets on Uber and Snap, as well as Benchmark’s early investment in the co-working juggernaut WeWork, now valued at $20 billion, “the fund that owns a position in Uber [and these others] is still one of the best funds ever.”
Sleeperbot, which has raised about $2M in seed funding from Birchmere VC and Expa, and boasts hundreds of thousands of users, calls itself Slack for sports.
It’s essentially an app (and website) that lets sports fans have conversations around different subjects they’re passionate about. These discussions happen in channels – some of which are created by the company and are general topics like fantasy advice, and some are created by users – like an Eagles fan club.
And now they are adding another feature that is sure to make it even more useful for sports fans – fantasy sports. Starting with NFL this season, Sleeperbot is adding support for season-long fantasy sports right inside its app.
This move makes total sense because season-long fantasy sports, unlike daily fantasy sports, is a very social activity.

Most people play in leagues with friends they have known their whole life – and the social/chat element can be just as important as the actual gameplay. That’s why it doesn’t make sense for casual player to use sites like ESPN or Yahoo fantasy anymore – who wants to make a trade in one app then switch to iMessage or GroupMe when its time to talk to the rest of the league when you can do it all from one place?
So Sleeperbot’s fantasy product is very focused on social – in fact almost every screen in the app has an embedded chat so you can talk to your league. There’s also a feature to power in-person drafts, which is something important in most serious fantasy sports leagues among friends.
While the fantasy product is just launching, Sleeperbot as a chat app has been around for a bit and seen some pretty good traction. Users open the app 4-5 times a day and spend 3-5 minutes per session – and on peak game days average users can spend up to 30 minutes in the app talking sports with their friends.
Sleeperbot’s free NFL fantasy product launches this season, and other sports will roll out later this year.  You can download their app on the iOS App Store here and Google Play Store here, or play on the web.

Technology was going to free us from cable. It’s right there in the phrase “cord cutting” — a liberation from the bonds of traditional television. This is supposed to be the era of on-demand entertainment, when we don’t have to subscribe to some bloated cable package in order to get the content we want. But the golden age of television has yet to meet its streaming counterpart. And if the news this week from companies like Disney is any indication, we’re steadily moving in the wrong direction.
A few days ago, the entertainment giant released a few bombshells on the media world, announcing the imminent launch of its ESPN streaming service, and noting that it was set to pull its content from Netflix in favor of its own proprietary offering. The news also left open the very real possibility that the company would launch additional services for its Marvel and Star Wars properties.
Earlier this week, FX launched its own premium service, FX+ — and back in March, the company pulled a significant number of titles from Netflix. Publishers have noted the popularity of a given third-party streaming service and pulled their content. They’re emboldened by their viewership on Netflix and Amazon, and assume customers will follow them to their own first-party services.
It’s a growing trend toward fragmentation of streaming services that will ultimately work against the best interests of consumers. A world in which every film studio and television station has its own proprietary offering sounds like a bit of a nightmare — worse even than the most convoluted of cable plans. It’s a sort of death by a thousand cuts, each studio and TV station emptying viewers’ bank accounts, $5 or $10 at a time.
Record labels attempted something similar in the post-Napster land rush, each launching proprietary music services. But most consumers don’t have loyalties to record labels, they have loyalty to bands — or even more likely, songs. For the most part, the same thing goes for movie studios. There’s a reason, after all, that networks had trouble finding success with a streaming solution before joining forces to create Hulu.
A catchall service like Netflix or Amazon is the ideal solution for most users. Neither will ever offer all of the content most users want, but a single destination with a broad selection is what people are looking for in a streaming solution.
Content providers taking their ball and going home is a good way to drive users away from video streaming — or even more likely, driving them toward illegal solutions. Time and again, studies have shown that streaming experiences like Netflix and Spotify help curb piracy. Give users a friendly content experience, and they’ll be willing to pay for it. But there’s a law of diminishing returns at play here, as well.
The rush to fragment the video streaming landscape is being driven by studios that can’t wait to shoot themselves in the foot, in hopes of creating a walled content garden. It’s a shame really, because services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon have proven that users will pay for access to content, as long as it’s part of a simple solution. A thousand different companies with a thousand different services is anything but.

You may have heard the term ‘MRE’ – otherwise known as “Meal, Ready-to-Eat” – bandied about in discussions related to the military or survivalists. Now, it looks like Amazon is exploring ways to produce its own MREs, but with the aim of creating something tasty and satisfying for ordinary consumers, rather than for service people or extreme hikers.
Amazon is looking at using tech originally designed for the military to create meals that are ready for consumption that don’t require any refrigeration. This would help make them much easier to manage from an inventory and logistics standpoint, since warehousing and transportation needs would be far less complex, Reuters reports. Amazon’s difficulties in cracking the grocery and fresh food market has a lot to do with the difficulty in dealing with perishable goods, and this could go a long way to addressing that.
This is also a potential advantage when it comes to Amazon’s efforts in the area of on-demand meal delivery, where it’s already making pilot efforts to compete with dedicated companies in the field like Blue Apron.
The specific tech involved is called ‘microwave assisted thermal sterilization’ (MATS) and involves heating sealed packages of food in high-pressure water baths within microwaves, which helps them keep their original flavour and much of their nutrient content while eliminating bacteria and extending shelf life to up to a year. The process is used by 915 Labs, a startup that is pursuing commercialization of the technology currently.
This doesn’t mean Amazon will actually end up offering this to consumers, of course; it could just be another potential avenue it’s pursuing in grocery and meal delivery that it doesn’t end up deploying as a final product. But it’s an interesting look at the commerce giant’s thought process and research efforts when it comes to addressing the major roadblocks it’s encountering in fielding viable products in this specific area of its business.
India-based messaging app Hike is back on the acquisition trail after it picked up Creo, a hardware company that previously released smartphones, streaming devices and an operating system.
The price of the deal is undisclosed. Hike released a short statement late on Friday announcing the acquisition, although it does not appear that the 50-person Creo will continue to work on hardware.
“The Creo team will begin work on a developer platform to enable third party developers to build services on the Hike platform,” a Hike spokesperson said.
Creo recently slashed the price of its Mark 1 smartphone, and it confirmed on its website that it will be its last.
“To build our next product, we need all the focus and good luck we can. Owing to this, we will no longer be making new CREO Mark1 devices or releasing any software updates,” it wrote on its website.


Which one is you? pic.twitter.com/f78CzH8VHl
— CREO (@CREOspeak) September 2, 2016



Bangalore-based Creo was founded in 2013, it had raised $3 million and it has plenty of links with Hike. Founders Sai Srinivas Kiran G and Shubham Malhotra are former Hike employees, while Hike CEO Kavin Bharti Mittal is one of its investors alongside major names like Sequoia.
Unsurprisingly that led to plenty of rumors of an acquisition, with The Ken reporting last October that a deal was close. Bharti Mittal rejected the deal at the time saying that Hike talks to many companies at any given time.
The deal is Hike’s third acquisition. It bought WiFi calling startup Zip Phone in 2015 and live-streaming company Pulse, although it has not confirmed the latter deal. It was valued at $1.4 billion following a $175 million investment by Tencent last year. It has raised $261 million in total.

Amazon has a new overall deal with The Walking Dead comic book series creator Robert Kirkman. Kirkman’s comic provided the inspiration for the hit AMC show of the same name, and now he’ll work with Amazon and his own Skybound Entertainment company to create TV projects designed to air exclusively on Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service.
The deal is the latest for Skybound, which also has a two-year first look arrangement with Universal, as Variety reports. In addition to The Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead, Kirkman’s comic Outcast has resulted in a horror series that airs on Cinemax and just concluded its second season. Kirkman’s comics success include ongoing Image series’ Invincible, as well as Thief of Thieves, both of which have had successful runs and built a strong following.
I would love to see an Invincible TV series, personally, but that’s already been optioned for a Universal Pictures film helmed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Still, Kirkman’s creative power is a force to be reckoned with and a proven recipe for success in original TV content production, so it seems like a good pick-up for Amazon’s own original streaming content push.
This news comes in the same week that Netflix announced its own acquisition of comic book creator Mark Millar’s Millarworld publishing company. Netflix announced the news just ahead of Disney’s announcement that it would be pulling its movies from the service in 2019 and creating its own subscription streaming offering. The Defenders and the companion Netflix series derived from Marvel content are part of a separate deal, and that remains intact for now, but it’s clear that all streaming providers are looking to comics as a wellspring of creative inspiration for programming.
Kirkman’s Amazon Prime deal should have both comics and streaming fans alike excited, but we’ll have to wait and see to find out what exactly comes out of the new partnership.

Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s weekly venture-themed podcast where we dive into the numbers behind the noise.
Forget the summer lull, friends. This week was chock full of news that broke right up until the very last minute. Matthew Lynley was off this week, but Katie Roof and myself were incredibly lucky to have Kate Mitchell, co-founder and partner at Scale Venture Partners on hand to help us shift the weight.
Picking from among the various conflagrations, mistakes, and Softbank-led boondoggles deals, we dove into Blue Apron’s earnings report, which led to a steep decline in its market value. We then turned to Snap’s earnings report, which also led to a steep decline in its market value.
Following the two public companies’ sheepish reports, we moved on to the brand new Benchmark-Uber-Travis Kalanick lawsuit, which may deter the troubled ride-hailing company from finding a proper new CEO. That Travis wants to come back to the company appears correct. That the company’s investors don’t want that also seems correct. To the courts with Uber, then.
And, finally, we spent a few minutes digging into the JOBS Act, and the impact that opening private IPO filings to all firms might have on the pipeline of companies going public.
It was a big week, but Kate was nothing short of a smashing hit. Tune in, and we’ll be right back in seven days.

Ring is steadily releasing new products, but the Ring Video Doorbell 2 is the first re-think of its original, core product. The new version of the smart Wi-Fi doorbell that started it all still offers both wired and battery power options, but the batteries are now removable, and it’s got a few other upgrades including true 1080p HD video.
I’m a longtime user of the original, and it’s been one of the connected home gadgets I’ve found to be the most useful overall. The new design takes the strengths of the original and improves them, and I’ve found that they make a big difference in the product in terms of improved usability and convenience. The real strength of the Ring Video Doorbell 2, in particular, is its battery power option, which allows you to use it on houses (like mine) where wiring is either nonfunctional or not present for directly powering a traditional doorbell, or one of Ring’s higher-end options.
The Ring Video Doorbell 2 improves in this regard by offering removable battery packs, which can charge directly using micro USB, and which easily slot in and out of the bottom of the doorbell itself while it remains installed at your front door. The battery packs each offer between six and 12 months of use under normal conditions, or the equivalent of about 1,000 notification events, according to Ring. I obviously haven’t had a year to test it yet (the product was only recently released), but already it seems to be longer-lived than the original Ring Video Doorbell it replaces.

Swappable batteries also address the single biggest issue I had with the original: When the battery was drained, it mean going without a doorbell entirely for hours at a time while the unit charged. With the new model, you can pick up a spare battery pack for $20 and keep it charged and ready to swap in, meaning no down time at all between charges. It seems like a small thing, but after multiple years with the original, I can guarantee that the swappable battery packs will end up making a huge difference in terms of overall convenience when using the Ring.
The other big improvement here is an upgrade from 720p video to 1080p. Again, it seems like a relatively small thing – who’s concerned about getting great video fidelity out of a device they use mostly to tell delivery people it’s okay to just leave packages at the door, after all? But the difference in video quality is instantly apparent, and it extends beyond just resolution. Color and detail are all greatly improved, as is the overall smoothness of the footage captured. Night-vision capture is better, too.

All of these are key features because a big part of what Ring provides with its connected video products is peace of mind. Better video means the new version of the Video Doorbell is better at home security, offering you a clearer picture of visitors, and of people who approach the door but don’t necessarily ring the doorbell when you have motion alerts enabled. Motion alerts also seem to work better and with nearly 100% reliability based on my experience.
There are other video doorbell options out there, but Ring’s latest offering seems like a very good contender as the strongest of the lot. It combines easy installation (with all the hardware you need included) with great video and intercom audio quality, along with an easy to use app and convenient power options. Ring’s cloud service will cost you an additional $3 per month, or $30 per year, but it’s a worthwhile subscription in my opinion.
If you want something that ‘just works’ and that’s backed by a reliable company focused on solving this specific problem, the $199 Ring Video Doorbell 2 is probably your best bet for a connected video doorbell solution.
Ulysses is one of the most popular apps for writers. It lets you write, edit, organize, sync and export all your writing in a single, unified interface. That’s why it’s interesting to see that it is switching to a subscription-only business model.
I’ve already written about Ulysses a few times. It’s a rock-solid, well-designed writing app for iOS and macOS. It relies on Markdown formatting and lets your export your writing to WordPress and Medium — among other things.
Ulysses is the exact same app on iOS and macOS, proving that you can make professional apps for the iPhone and the iPad. The company behind it won an Apple Design Award at WWDC. It used to cost $45 on the Mac and $25 on iOS.
While the company released a free macOS trial on its website, there was no easy way to let you try the app on your iPhone or iPad. Additionally, it was a bit confusing that you had to buy the same app twice so that you could use it on all your devices. But if you were a serious writer and you were willing to spend $60 on two apps, Ulysses could become your writing studio.
Yesterday, the company announced that it would drop upfront purchases altogether. If you want to use Ulysses, you can now download the app on iOS and macOS to start a 14-day free trial. After that, you have to pay $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year. There’s a $10 discount on the annual subscription if you were a previous Ulysses user, and students are also eligible to a special subscription of $11.99 per six months.
And it turns out that people care a lot about subscriptions. While hundreds of millions of people pay a subscription to access Spotify, Netflix and other content services, making people pay for apps is still unpopular.
Max Seelemann wrote a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind subscription pricing. As a customer, I’m more than happy to see that subscriptions are going to make Ulysses more sustainable.
According to Ulysses’ website, there are a dozen people working on Ulysses. I looked back at my purchasing history. I was an early Ulysses buyer so I ended up paying less than the full price for both apps. I paid $20 for the Mac app 4 years and a half ago and $20 for the iOS app 18 months ago.
There’s no way you can build a successful business with customers that pay $40 over the course of four years and a half. Your local coffee shop probably has a higher customer lifetime value while hiring fewer people.
Software giants, such as Adobe and Microsoft, have successfully switched to subscriptions. The majority of customers and companies pay a monthly fee to access Photoshop, Microsoft Word and other productivity apps.
But most small software companies still rely on upfront purchases and regular paid upgrades. That’s why many apps end up being neglected or stop working after a major operating system update. Let’s see if Ulysses can reverse the trend.
In an example of more revolving doors in London’s heated fintech space, TechCrunch has learned that Curve co-founder Tom Foster-Carter is joining Monzo. As of Monday, he takes up the role of COO at the digital-only challenger bank, with some aspects subject to regulatory approval.
At Curve, a platform that lets you consolidate all your bank cards into a single card and manage your money, Foster-Carter held the position of Head of Operations, which I understand is being filled by newly promoted Rona Ruthen. Prior to Curve, he was COO at kids banking app Osper, as well as spending three months at another London-based challenger bank Tandem.
In a brief call with Foster-Carter this morning, he confirmed that he has left Curve and taken up the COO position at Monzo. He stressed that he remains friends with Curve founder and CEO Shachar Bialick, who recruited him to co-found Curve in March 2015 in addition to Anna Mostyn Williams, who has also since left the startup.
He said that after raising Curve’s Series A the pair agreed it was best to part ways. He remains bullish on Curve and the startup’s team (where he remains a minority shareholder), but is also excited to join Monzo, which, based on its weekly growth, he says is definitely onto something.
“Curve co-founders Shachar Bialick and Tom Foster-Carter have agreed to part ways amicably, with Bialick staying on as CEO and Rona Ruthen being promoted to Head of Operations,” said Curve in a statement. “Ruthen was previously Payments Operations Manager at Payoneer and brings a fantastic range of fintech skills and experience to the role. With the Series A funding round recently closed, the business is now focused on scaling up on its mission to simplify the way people spend, send and see their money”.
Zooming out a bit further, it is interesting to note that both Curve and Monzo — and almost every other recent consumer fintech play — are aiming to become the single convergence platform to help you manage your money via a central UI that connects to all of the other financial services you use. However, the difference in product strategy (or how they’ll get there) couldn’t be greater.
Bialick has always insisted that nobody needs to become a bank, which brings with it significant extra capital and regulatory overhead. Instead the advantage of Curve is that it is a platform and UI layer than runs purely on top of existing banking and payment rails and doesn’t ask you to switch banks and is agnostic regards where your money resides. That also makes it a potential partner to existing incumbent banks, as the recent Series A backing from Santander Ventures points to.
In contrast, Monzo co-founder Tom Blomfield believes that the best “attack vector” — as he likes to call it — is the humble current account. It is only by building as much of your own banking rails as possible can you innovate fast and deep enough to provide a significantly better UX than what exists today, or that being built by other competing fintech upstarts.
This one has a long way to play out yet.
Article updated 11.13am PDT on 11th of August to remove additional comments attributed to Foster-Carter, and speculation regards Curve recruiting an outside COO.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is sending a supercomputer to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX’s next resupply mission for NASA, which is currently set to launch Monday. Officially named the “Spaceborne Computer,” the Linux-based supercomputer is designed to serve in a one year experiment conducted by NASA and HPE to find out if high performance computing hardware, with no hardware customization or modification, can survive and operate in outer space conditions for a full year – the length of time, not coincidentally, it’ll likely take for a crewed spacecraft to make the trip to Mars.
Typically, computers used on the ISS have to be “hardened,” explained Dr. Mark Fernandez, who led the effort on the HPE side as lead payload engineer. This process involves extensive hardware modifications made to the high-performance computing (HPC) device, which incur a lot of additional cost, time and effort. One unfortunate result of the need for this physical ruggedization process is that HPCs used in space are often generations behind those used on Earth, and that means a lot of advanced computing tasks end up being shuttled off the ISS to Earth, with the results then round-tripped back to astronaut scientists in space.
This works for now, because communication is near-instantaneous between low-Earth orbit, where the ISS resides, and Earth itself. But once you get further out – as far out as Mars, say – communications could take up to 20 minutes between Earth and spaceship staff. If you saw The Martian, you know how significant a delay of that magnitude can be.

“Suppose there’s some critical computations that need to be made, on the mission to Mars or when we arrive at Mars, we really need to plan ahead and make sure that that computational capacity is available to them, and it’s not three- or five-year old technology,” Dr. Fernandez told me. “We want to be able to get to them the latest and greatest technology.”
This one-year experiment will help Dr. Fernandez hopefully show that in place of hardware modifications, a supercomputer can be “software hardened” to withstand the rigors of space, including temperature fluctuations and exposure to radiation. That software hardening involves making adjustments on the fly to things like processor speed and memory refresh rate in order to correct for detected errors and guarantee correct results..text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

“All of our modern computers have hardware built error correction and detection in them, and it’s possible that if we give those units enough time, they can correct those errors and we can move on,” Dr. Fernandez said.
Already on Earth, the control systems used to benchmark the two experimental supercomputers sent to the ISS have demonstrated that this works – a recent lightning storm struck the data center where they’re stationed, causing a power outage and temperature fluctuations, which did not impact the results coming from the HPCs. Dr. Fernandez says that’s a promising sign for how their experimental counterparts will perform in space, but the experiment will still help show how they can react to things you can’t test as accurately on Earth, like exposure to space-based radiation.

The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with the Dragon spacecraft onboard, launches from pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Saturday, June 3, 2017. Dragon is carrying almost 6,000 pounds of science research, crew supplies and hardware to the International Space Station in support of the Expedition 52 and 53 crew members. The unpressurized trunk of the spacecraft also will transport solar panels, tools for Earth-observation and equipment to study neutron stars. This will be the 100th launch, and sixth SpaceX launch, from this pad. Previous launches include 11 Apollo flights, the launch of the unmanned Skylab in 1973, 82 shuttle flights and five SpaceX launches. Photo Credit: (NASA/Bill Ingalls)
And while the long-term goal is to make this technology useful in an eventual mission to Mars, in the near-term it has plenty of potential to make an impact on how research is conducted on the ISS itself.
“One of the things that’s popular today is ‘Let’s move the compute to the data, instead of moving the data to the compute,’ because we’re having a data explosion,” Dr. Fernandez explained. “Well that’s occurring elsewhere as well. The ISS is bringing on board more and more experiments. Today those scientists know how to analyze the data on Earth, and they want to send the data down to Earth. It’s not a Mars-type latency, but still you’ve got to get your data, got to process it and got to get back and change your experimental parameters. Suppose, like at every other national lab in the nation, the computer was right down the office from you.”

Local supercomputing capability isn’t just a convenience feature; time on the ISS is a precious resource, and any thing that makes researchers more efficient has a tremendous impact on the science that can be done during missions. Japan’s JAXA space agency recently started testing an automated camera drone on board for just this purpose, for instance, since not having to hold a camera means researchers can spend more time on actual experimentation. For HPC, this could have an even larger impact in a couple of different ways.
JAXA’s Jem Int-Ball drone camera is also designed to save astronauts time.
“You do your post-processing right down the hall on the ISS, you’ve saved time, your science is better, faster and you can get more work out of the same amount of experimental time,” Dr. Fernandez said. Secondly, and more important to me, the network between the ISS and Earth is precious, and it’s allocated by experiment. If I can get some people to get off the network, that will free up bandwidth for people who really need the network.”
In the end, Dr. Fernandez is hoping this experiment opens the door for future testing of other advanced computing techniques in space, including Memory-Driven computing. He also hopes it opens the door for NASA to consider making use of the same sort of system on future Mars missions, to help with the experimentation potential of those journeys, and to help improve their chance of success. But in general, Dr. Fernandez says, he’s just hoping to contribute to the work done by those advancing various fields of research in space.
“I want to help all the scientists on board, and that’s one of the dreams of this experiment,” he said.

Now is a good time to be in the co-working industry in Southeast Asia, it seems. Barely days after WeWork announced plans to enter the region, which is home to over 600 million people, through the acquisition of Singapore startup Spacemob, now a company that operates like an Airbnb for office space rentals has raised money.
FlySpaces, a startup headquartered in the Philippines, raised $2.1 million this week in funding round described as pre-Series A.
The company operates a service that aggregates a selection of co-working spaces in six cities across Asia — Manila and Cebu in the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong/Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. It was launched in 2015 with $500,000 in initial financing, and CEO and co-founder Mario Berta was previously with Rocket Internet’s Uber rival Easy Taxi.
While its core focus is office space rentals, Berta told TechCrunch that FlySpaces has diversified into other enterprise verticals including event venues, retail space and corporate dining. He said other expansions may see it move into billboard spaces.
“We’re looking at how we can cross sell other things into this space once we acquire a customer,” Berta said.
On the business side, the FlySpaces makes money through commissions on bookings made through its site. It retains a cut when a customer that first found a space through its service signs on for a longer leasing, Berta confirmed. That seems essential when most people might book a day or another short lease to test an office before committing to a longer booking. In addition, the company also runs some ads selectively, but that accounts for less than 25 percent of income.
Berta said his company is already profitable but it sought out investment to ramp up its growth through hiring, increased marketing and product development. The backing comes from undisclosed players in the retail space — although one named investor Net Group co-president Raymond Rufino — because Berta found that tech VCs “don’t understand” the FlySpaces business. But he admitted that there’s the potential to be more strategic with these backers.

FlySpaces already covers the main markets where English is a primary language for business in Southeast Asia, and Berta said that while there is no immediate plan for further country launches, he’d like to be in all ASEAN countries eventually. That’ll necessitate moves into Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia at some point.
Speaking generally on the industry — which now includes WeWork in Southeast Asia — Berta said that one of his biggest frustrations is that co-working spaces are commonly thought to be focused on tech startups and freelancers. A point he said isn’t true.
“It’s huge misconception, the money is in SMEs and corporates,” he argued. “It’s ideal for companies who don’t want to invest in capex and want to maximize their office space.”
Some of the customers that have used FlySpaces include Google, P&G, Media Corp and Uber, according to its website.

A collection of prominent names in the tech industry have teamed up with Toyota to work on developing big data systems to support self-driving cars and other future automotive advances.
Denso, Ericsson, Intel and NTT Docomo joined hands with the Japanese car giant to announce the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium today. The group said it has plans to add “relevant global technology leaders” to its membership this year.
The companies have come together to tackle concerns around data usage in connected cars of the future, a critical component to making real-time mapping, driving assistance and other services go from theory to working in practice. Handling the huge volumes of data in a reliable and secure manner is critical.
“It is estimated that the data volume between vehicles and the cloud will reach 10 exabytes per month around 2025, approximately 10,000 times larger than the present volume. This expected increase will trigger the need for new architectures of network and computing infrastructure to support distributed resources and topology-aware storage capacity,” the group said in a statement.
To give an idea of scale, 10 exabytes is 10 billion gigabytes — a lot of data indeed.
Toyota has been pretty busy in the connected car space, to say the least. Last week, it took a stake in Mazda to advance its AI and autonomous tech push, and other notable advancements this year have included a connected car partnership with NTT, a move into the blockchain, and a $100 million fund to invest in AI startups.
China continues to crack down on online media after the government announced that it is investigating three of the country’s most influential social networks for hosting illicit content.
The Office for Cyberspace Administration is looking into content on chat app WeChat, micro-blogging platform Weibo and web forum Baidu Tieba, each of which stands accused of failing to stamp out material that “jeopardised national security,” the BBC reports.
Principally that includes content related to terrorism, pornography and other obscenities, the office said. Companies like Tencent, which is Asia’s most valuable tech company, and Weibo already aggressively police content on their platforms, but evidently aren’t doing so at a level that pleases the government.
The crackdown follows the closure in June of around 60 celebrity gossip accounts on WeChat, China’s largest messaging app with over 600 million users. The influential accounts were accused of disseminating similarly illegal content. The agency said at the time that media should “actively propagate core socialist values, and create an ever-more healthy environment for the mainstream public opinion.”
Today’s news follows a major setback for free speech in China when Apple pulled a range of popular VPN apps from its Chinese App Store. The apps allow people to circumvent China’s ‘Great Fire Wall’ internet censorship system, but Beijing has outlawed any that do not operate with government-approved permits.
China recently upgraded its censorship apparatus to add new capabilities that have allow it to partially disrupt communications made through WhatsApp and WeChat. That’s of course in addition to blocking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google as well as media including The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
China’s implemented new cybersecurity laws on June 1 and, though the full scope is unclear, they are believed to have the potential to impact foreign businesses. Apple is among the first to have moved accordingly after it announced plans to develop its first datacenter in China to comply with the regulations.

Global co-working behemoth WeWork is best known for providing flexible office rentals to startups and other small businesses, but enterprise clients are becoming an increasingly large portion of its business. With that in mind, WeWork has acquired Israeli startup Unomy to help its team sell enterprise clients on the idea of opening offices in its workspaces around the world.
With plenty of new funding, WeWork has been investing heavily in opening new shared co-working spaces in places like China, Japan and Southeast Asia. In the meantime, it’s hoping to get more large businesses using its real estate.
Enterprise customers already make up 30 percent of the company’s total membership and 30 percent of its monthly sales, but it’s looking to increase those numbers.
But getting a company with thousands of employees to commit to having employees join a co-working space is a tougher sell than signing up a four-person startup on a month-to-month lease. That’s why owning a sales intelligence platform important as WeWork rapidly moves upmarket to serve Fortune 500 customers like Microsoft or Bank of America.
Unomy has built a sales and marketing intelligence platform that is designed to help salespeople connect with potential customers. It does that by simplifying the process of creating sales lists, getting better leads and ultimately converting more enterprise sales.
It’s a product WeWork had already been using as a customer, but also one that it thought could provide more value to its sales team as part of the company’s own internal tools. According to WeWork SVP for Digital Product Ron Gura, the company adopted Unomy after evaluating a number of similar tools and deciding Unomy’s tools were the best on the market.
“Their B2B intelligence layer will be able to help us enrich our data sets when we’re driving sales in the enterprise market,” Gura told me. According to him, integrating Unomy into its existing product set will help B2B sales processes run even faster and convert more customers.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but prior to the acquisition Unomy had raised $2.4 million in outside funding from investors that include JANVEST Capital Partners, Altair Capital, Leta Capital and a series of angel investors.
WeWork is hiring Unomy’s 20 employees to work out of its Tel Aviv office as part of the digital product team under Gura. It eventually plans to close Unomy’s business to outside customers but will be looking to help transfer customers to similar products.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai was expected to hold an all-hands meeting this afternoon in light of now-former Google engineer James Damore’s post about differences between men and women. Shortly before it was scheduled to start, Pichai sent out a note to employees letting them know it’s cancelled, Recode reports.
Some employees reportedly expressed fear that they’d be targets of online harassment if they were to speak up and ask questions in the town hall.
“We had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally,” Pichai wrote in an email to employees. “Googlers are writing in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be ‘outed’ publicly for asking a question in the Town Hall.”
Pichai cut his vacation short a couple of days ago to deal with hellfire that has ensued as a result of the memo. In the days since his return, Pichai has spoken with many Googlers about the memo and Google’s decision to fire Damore, Pichai wrote in his note to employees today.
“The vast majority of you are very supportive of our decision,” he wrote. “A smaller percentage of you wish we would do more. And some are worried that you cannot speak out at work freely. All of your voices and opinions matter … and I want to hear them.”
Although there will be no meeting today, it sounds like Google employees will soon be able to meet up and freely discuss the events of the past week. You can head over to Recode to read the full memo.

LaterPay is offering media companies a business model that goes beyond subscriptions and ads.
Cosmin Ene, the German startup’s founder and CEO, argued that while some publications are having success with paywalls and online subscriptions, it’s an approach that only convinces the most loyal readers to pay.
So LaterPay is trying to help monetize “the vast space” between subscriptions and ads, allowing publishers to charge for their content on an à la carte basis. That can mean charging per article or video, or asking users to buy a pass to their site for a limited period of time.
Ene knows that might sound depressingly similar to the micropayment models that have fallen flat, despite the hype that they might save journalism. In fact, he recalled being told by an investor, “Micropayments don’t work on the internet.”
Ene’s response was to point to the sushi dinner that they were eating. If they had to pay for each plate of sushi before they ate it, or if they had to pay “100 bucks before we see the menu,” well, that would be a crummy dining experience. Instead, they ordered the food they wanted and then paid the bill at the end.
Similarly, Ene said most micropayment platforms asked users to pay upfront, before they’ve read anything, or when they first hit a paywalled article.
LaterPay, meanwhile, is supposed to make the payment process as frictionless as possible. Users don’t even have to enter any payment information when they buy their first piece of content — they don’t have to make a purchase at all until their bill reaches $5. As a result, the company says that 78 percent of article purchases made through the LaterPay platform take 10 seconds or less.
Switching food metaphors, Ene added, “The vast amount of occasional users just want to buy a glass of milk, but not the whole cow.”
LaterPay has already signed up some big customers in Germany, including Der Spiegel.
Now it’s launching in the United States. To fund these efforts, it’s raised an additional 5 million euros (bringing the company’s total funding to 20 million euros). And its U.S. expansion will be led by Hal Bailey (formerly director of emerging business development at Google), who’s been brought on as the company’s new chief revenue officer.
Update: Asked about the investors in the new funding, LaterPay said the money comes from “private investors from Switzerland and Germany, with industry experience in finance and technology.”

Microsoft today announced a new version of Windows 10 that’s specifically geared toward professional users that use high-end hardware to support mission-critical workloads. As rumored, Windows 10 Pro for Workstations will feature Microsoft’s server-grade file system (the Resilient File System), support for persistent memory (NVDIMM-N), faster file sharing with SMB Direct and support for high-end hardware with up to 4 CPUs and 6TB of memory.
As the name implies, the focus here is indeed on high-end hardware and for this edition of Windows, which also means support for Intel Xeon and AMD Opteron processors. Standard versions of Windows 10 only support up to 2 CPUs and 2TB of memory, so this new version gives users on these top-of-the-line workstations (and the OEMs who want to build the hardware for them) access to a lot more power — especially when combined with persistent memory.

The Resilient File System (ReFS), as the name implies, is meant to provide an extra level of data availability, resilience and fault-tolerance. It can handle very large volumes and automatically repair errors when data on one of the backup drives becomes corrupted. In comparison to Microsoft’s standard NTFS scheme, which can handle volumes of up to 256TB, ReSF can theoretically be used for volumes of up to 4.7 zettabytes (that’s about a billion terabytes and 8 million years of 8K video — so not something anybody would really need anytime soon).
Users can then also take their data and use SMB Direct to make it available to other users on their network. Using the Remote Direct Memory Access capability of this new version of Windows 10, SMB Direct enables fast file access with low latency that barely uses the local CPU. This feature has been available in Microsoft’s server operating systems since the launch of Windows Server 2012, though it’s worth noting that it takes the right kind of network adapter to work.
Windows 10 Pro for Workstations will launch later this fall as part of the Fall Creators Update.
 
Amazon might get into event ticket sales, according to a new report from Reuters. The commerce giant has eyed the space, which is largely dominated by Live Nation’s Ticketmaster in the U.S., and found it a space for plenty of potential opportunity, according to the outlet’s sources.
There’s definitely wiggle room on the side of consumer experience; Ticketmaster receives plenty of grief from customers for its fees and practices. And Reuters claims there’s appetite on the side of sports leagues, venue operators and sports teams, since they hope to grow ticket sales in general with some variety in distribution avenues.
Ticketmaster has managed so far to fend off potential upstart competitors, including ticketing platforms like Universe and Front Gate. Amazon, of course, is not a startup, and could carry considerably more weight. Plus, it already has relationships in place with key music industry players, and arguably one of the largest addressable customer bases with payment information on file ever amassed.
Reuters says that Amazon had talked to Ticketmaster about potential partnerships stateside, but that its sources claim those talks have stalled. Amazon has also talked to leagues about potential StubHub-style secondary market ticket resales, too, the report claims.
Where Amazon might have difficulty moving forward in this potential endeavor is around customer data. Venue and team owners want specific customer info to help them develop the right approach to marketing to their most lucrative customer demographics, but Reuters says Amazon has been reluctant to share said data in a prospective ticket sales partnership.
Ticket sales could end up being a potential additional driver for Prime memberships, too; you can imagine how Amazon would be able to secure reserved blocks for Prime members for high-demand events, open early pre-sales or offer other member-exclusive benefits. It’s a model already used by other membership-style programs, including American Express’ cardholder programs.
We’ve reached out to Amazon for a statement, but had not received a response as of publication time.
Snap’s Spectacles sunglasses may prove to be more of a fad than a must-have device. Snap revealed during its call following weak Q2 earnings that it generated $5.4 million in “Other” revenue, which would equate to around 41,500 pairs of its Spectacles camera sunglasses at a $130 price point. That’s compared to $8.3 million in Other revenue in Q1, or fewer than 64,000 pairs, meaning Spectacles sales have declined roughly 35 percent.
Snap recently began selling Spectacles on Amazon and in other companies’ retail stores, like Harrod’s, but those sales won’t show up til Q3 earnings. Snap did start selling Spectacles online and through its Snapbot vending machines in Europe for the first time back in June. That means the 41,500 number may have been propped up by this expansion, and sales in the U.S. may have slipped further.

Snap may either need a radically different, AR-equipped version 2 of Spectacles to reinvigorate interest, or it may need to look to other cameras to sell. It recently acquired Zero Robotics, a Chinese maker of the Hover selfie drone, for between $150 million and $200 million. Sources told TechCrunch today that the deal is complete. But more potential may lie in a camera people can fit in their pockets, like a 360 camera.

There are a million and one services for voice transcription on the market. But even with just one job to do, I’ve never seen a service that can handle the long tail of vocabulary used in the real world. This is particularly challenging if you’re a startup trying to sell your service to enterprises that rely on accurate transcription for their operations.
Jon Goldsmith, co-founder of Tetra, a voice transcription startup, understands this challenge — in fact, he is even willing to admit that he hasn’t 100 percent cracked the problem. But Goldsmith believes the answer lies in deep learning, and he’s setting out to prove it with a $1.5 million seed round led by Amplify Partners, with participation from Y Combinator and a number of angels.
I dropped by the Tetra office to check out what Goldsmith, his co-founder Nik Liolios and one other engineer had created. Goldsmith gave me a call using his smartphone with the Tetra app installed. As he and the deep learning models running in the background listened, I threw out a barrage of challenges for the transcription service.
Speaking at varying speeds, throwing out numbers, startup names and other tough words did stump Tetra to some degree — but to be fair, there is no AI that I haven’t broken. Given how easy Tetra is to use, I could see it being used as a backup reference or for record keeping — turn it on, forget about it and use it to search through notes later.
The Tetra platform
In cases where 99 or 100 percent accuracy is required, Tetra offers human transcription for a fee and a 24-hour wait. This actually helps both customers and Tetra in the sense that accurate transcriptions can feed back as training data to improve future performance.
Goldsmith told me he is finding traction selling to investors making frequent diligence calls. These customers want Tetra to create a permanent record of conversations with industry experts. Other, more traditional, enterprise use cases exist as well, like within sales.
This seems to be working out fairly well for the company. And things remain fairly lean with the three-person Tetra team working out of a residential apartment dually zoned for commercial. On the engineering side, a lot of the underlying infrastructure is being powered by off-the-shelf APIs.
Tetra pricing plans
This is actually a good thing, because it means Tetra isn’t wasting time building things that already exist on the market and instead is focusing on collecting a massive transcriptions data set that will only continue to improve the quality of the service moving forward.
The team’s approach is heavily dependent on being able to optimize which parts of conversations are sent to which cloud API. For example, some NLP service providers are better at understanding speech relating to movies, music and media, while others are better at numbers, etc.
The $1.5 million in seed financing is going to be used to scale up the engineering team and improve machine learning pipelines. Tetra includes search functionality so users can quickly find specific sentences within traditionally unsearchable voice recordings. I could see this becoming more proactive in the future — flagging names and dates automatically, for example.
Snap has an awful Q2 earnings report… but at least its dancing AR hot dog was viewed 1.5 billion times. To prove their confidence, co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy have agreed not to sell any shares this year, and the company will withhold shares they’re owed to pay for any necessary taxes. Of course, there are only five months left in the year, so this isn’t exactly a long-term lock-in.
One concrete metric announced was that Snap generated $5.4 million in “Other” revenue, which would equate to around 41,500 pairs of its Spectacles camera sunglasses at a $130 price point. That’s compared to $8.3 million in Q1 and $4.5 million in Q4.
Snap glossed over its shortcomings in user count and revenue to focus on several vanity metrics during its earnings call:

The average user creates 20 Snaps per day.
The dancing hot dog that Spiegel called the world’s “first augmented reality superstar” was viewed more than 1.5 billion times on Snapchat, plus tons more as it was made into viral memes shared around the web.
Publisher Story views are up 30 percent quarter-over-quarter.
Snap doubled the number of original “Shows” that premiered on its platform in Q2 versus Q1, with some getting more than 10 million views per episode.
250 million Snaps are saved to Memories each day.
Since launching its Snap Map that shows what other people are doing around the world, submissions to Our Story have increased 30 percent.
Snapchat users under age 25 spend more than 40 minutes per day on the app, while those over 25 spend more than 20 minutes a day on the app. That one-ups Instagram for teens, where under-25s spend more than 30 minutes per day, but falls short of Instagram’s older age group that uses it for 24 minutes per day.

Canada is North America’s up-and-coming startup center
Austria: The up-and-coming early-stage investment capital of Europe




On a Tuesday morning in Lima, Peru, MapQuest co-founder Chris Heivly stood onstage before 600 attentive listeners at Peru Venture Capital Conference, a photo of an Amish buggy projected behind him. “It’s a common sight in the town MapQuest was created,” Heivly says. “If you can build MapQuest in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, think of what you can build in Lima, Peru.”
Heivly — who currently is Entrepreneur in Residence at Techstars — makes a good point. Lima is a bustling capital city located on the Pacific Ocean. Its culinary scene is repeatedly rated as one of the best in the world. Furthermore, Lima’s metropolitan area inhabits 10 million people, about one-third of the Peruvian population. It is the fifth largest metropolitan area in Latin America.
However, while for the past decade the Peruvian economy has been one of the fastest moving in the region — it has an average growth rate of 5.9 percent — it’s apparent Peru’s technology ecosystem is still in its infancy. A country that’s economically driven by mining, Peru invests just 0.08 percent of its GDP in innovation today. In comparison, Chile invests 0.37 percent, and has distributed about $40 million to 1,300 growing businesses.
Yet Peru refuses to be left behind. Now in an effort to reduce its dependence on raw materials, the Peruvian Ministry of Production wants to increase investment in innovation by ten-fold over the next decade. This would at least make the country comparable on a regional level, says the Director of Innovation at the ministry Gonzalo Villarán. “We’re way behind. We’re down there,” he says.
Even still, Peru deserves some recognition for its recent efforts. The country has already begun fostering innovation through hefty government support. Outside parties have taken notice of Peru to provide funding. Particularly, the startup communities in Peru are energized — and they’re ready to play a part in helping the ecosystem flourish.
Wide government support
Upon walking into a crowded Demo Day event at UTEC Ventures — a business accelerator and the entrepreneurial department at Lima’s engineering and technology university, UTEC — you’d be surprised to learn that just three years ago, Lima’s tech ecosystem was very deflated. In fact, the accelerator had difficulty finding startups to work with when it launched in 2014.
“We literally looked at every corner of the city trying to find some good startups,” said UTEC Ventures Program Manager and co-founder Andrés Benavides. “The pipeline of projects has increased significantly. I can even say exponentially.”
So what was the turning point for the ecosystem? Most notably, the government began to invest in innovation. Ministry of Production initiative Startup Peru was launched in 2012, with an objective to promote the emergence of Peruvian startups and innovative products. Just this year, 837 projects applied for seed capital from Startup Peru — of those, 106 ventures were chosen to receive the equivalent of $5,000, $46,000 and $153,000 USD in funding.
Silicon Valley is not magical. They’re not magicians over there. They are all very human. Peru has the potential to do similar things.— Claire Delaunay, Uber Director of Engineering
There’s also Innovate Peru, which the Ministry of Innovation launched in 2014. Its goal is to strengthen companies, entrepreneurs and support systems within the Peruvian ecosystem, and facilitate collaboration between them through dozens of specific funds — such as offering money for scientific equipment at institutions, or high-impact projects for the Peruvian economy, society or environment.
And over the years, the amount of funding has grown. Peru now boasts a whopping $100 million fund to promote micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loaned $40 million USD toward the fund, with the Peruvian Ministry of Finance putting in $60 million USD. Even more, The World Bank approved a $45 million USD loan earlier this year for the development of science, technology, and innovation in Peru.
Additionally, Lima is currently working with the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program — a two-year initiative that works with local government, academia, investors, entrepreneurs and corporations to develop an actionable framework for strengthening innovative and entrepreneurial ecosystems.
Other notable players in the ecosystem include Universidad del Pacifico, where much of the tech talent arises, Peru’s first accelerator Wayra, accelerator Endeavour Peru, as well as 10 other accelerators and incubators in the community.
Collaboration within the ecosystem
While the country’s tech ecosystem has been developing for a few years now, the Peru Venture Capital Conference — which took place in June 2017 — was really the first time entrepreneurs and innovation enthusiasts gathered under one roof.
Led by COFIDE, FOMIN and UTEC, the two-day conference focused on creating community, corporate innovation, angel investment and venture capital in the country — but perhaps more notably, it aimed to bring together all the key players in the ecosystem to foster collaboration and build momentum. According to Villarán, it was all about “that collision of atoms.”
The conference featured some pretty big international speakers, too — including Otto co-founder and Uber Director of Engineering Claire Delaunay, Paul Singh of Result Junkies, co-founder of mach49 Dave Blakely and chairman at Firth Ventures Nelson Gray.
There’s still one big thing holding back entrepreneurs in Peru: There’s a serious lack of investor engagement.
Delaunay says she came to Peru because she believed innovation was possible in the country. “We need innovation from a lot of different…continents, and we need innovation from a lot of different cultures. Different cultures mean people do things differently, and think things differently,” she said.
“[In Peru] they have fresh energy, and they still want to change a lot of things. And I do believe they can totally rally people around to recreate the fabric needed to support startups and innovation.”
Private money and the effect on Peru
Really, Peru has just one big unicorn: Cinepapaya. In December 2016, Cinepapaya — which sells movie tickets via mobile — was acquired by U.S.-based Fandango of NBCUniversal, also in the movie-ticket selling business.
However, while it’d be nice to have another unicorn, Benavides says the real goal in Peru is to create more viable companies. It’s better for more people to have money in their pockets. “If we try to make sustainable businesses, we will be able to have big businesses. One of them is going to do really well,” said Benavides.
However, there’s still one big thing holding back entrepreneurs in Peru: There’s a serious lack of investor engagement.
“The entrepreneurs are there. Government is involved. Incubators and other support systems for startups are there. And one of the things that is just starting to evolve is the investor component,” says Benavides. In fact, he argues there are no institutional investors past seed-stage funding.
Gabriel Massa agrees. He’s the CEO of Nanda, a beauty salon booking app. “We don’t have people that want to invest in startups because of the high risk,” he says, adding that Peruvians are more likely to invest in things like apartments. “There’s a long way to go there.”
However, Peru is making an effort to change this. The Ministry of Production launched a public contest last year to fund the operation of potential VC funds, and up to $2.25 million USD will be delivered to investment fund entities that come up with high-impact proposals for funding in order to encourage the creation of venture capital funds in the country.
The goal is to provide at least 10 high-impact projects about $500,000 USD each in the next two years, according to RPP Noticias. In five years, the aim is to fund at least 50 high-impact projects — which, in turn, will create more than 5,000 high-quality jobs.
According to The World Bank, the poverty rate in Peru fell from 58.7 percent in 2004 to 21.8 percent in 2015 — still, Peru is a developing country. However, the country’s newfound support for startup innovation will hopefully — both directly and indirectly — help a larger percentage of the Peruvian population rise to success.
And there’s a lot of people rooting for them, too. “Silicon Valley is not magical. They’re not magicians over there. They are all very human. Peru has the potential to do similar things as long as the younger generation believes in it,” said Delaunay.

How startups are trying to fix consumer debt
Why the recent hype about insurance tech will be just the beginning



After building a product, the hardest test a startup faces is finding the first five to ten customers who are willing to bet on you when no one has heard of your company and when your product has yet to be battle-tested.
This is by far the hardest challenge for an early-stage enterprise software startup to overcome, and it takes focus, perseverance and sometimes, a bit of luck.
Salesforce B2B Sales Benchmark Research finds that the average time for conversion from lead to opportunity is 84 days with an average conversion rate of 13%, and out of that 13% less than 1% of total leads end up becoming actual customers.
Mind you, this is across all business-to-business companies so the sales funnel numbers are likely even worse for early-stage startups.  As an early-stage founder, how are you going to find that initial product/market fit with your first token customer before you run out of cash?  We surveyed the top 30 B2B startups within our network including some companies we have invested in at our current and prior funds —to distill some of their secret sauce and here are the primary takeaways.

Get lots of early supporters
Founders and VCs (ourselves included) are often laser-focused on convincing initial customers to pay for the product. Those first few paying customers serve as validation that you have achieved product/market fit and are one step closer to those revenue targets for your next financing round.  That’s why the words of one CEO of a successful B2B software company stuck out to me: “Give away your product for free three times so you’ll have three great references”.
What’s more important than those first dollars in the bank is having amazing advocates for your solution.  Taking it one step further, this CEO suggested that you tell your first few customers to “name their price” and allow them to work alongside you to help shape future product iterations and roadmap.
The most successful companies make their customers feel like they are receiving custom product designed specifically for them without actually ending up becoming a custom shop or working for free.  When you treat those beachhead customers as  partners rather than customers, they will significantly increase their commitment to your success and help you refine your product with invaluable market feedback.
And where do you find your first few customers?  Start with your personal, business and investor networks.
Grant Miller, CEO of Replicated said, “For venture backed companies you have to think about your investor network as your company’s surface area. Early teams of 3-6 people just can’t reach that many perspective customers while building an initial product. Having a large pool of engaged investors gives you reach far beyond your size. Spend time with every investor to make sure they know what sort of customer profiles you’re looking for so they can easily spot an opportunity and make the intro.”
Another tried-and-true way to get invaluable feedback from customers is to form a customer advisory board (CAB). We found that  most CIOs (Chief Information Officers) are super excited (almost to the point of being too eager) to join CABs for early-stage startups.  Initially, this seemed counterintuitive to us: CIOs are  the hardest people to get hold of when you are trying to sell them.
But what we began to understand was that most of them want their voices to be heard and take a real interest in supporting innovation.  70% of the top B2B startups we interviewed had CABs in place from the early days and were not shy to leverage them in outbound efforts.  Many were also able to leverage CABs to provide real-world feedback on how the product is being used along with insight into its strengths and weaknesses.
As Eli Portnoy, founder at Sense360 puts it, “Involve your first customers and listen very carefully. If you are going above and beyond for them, which you absolutely should, they will not only share high-value feedback and guide your product development, but they will feel personally invested in the success of your product. This will turn them into huge advocates that will drive further sales.“
The lesson here: create a CAB, even if it’s an informal one, and offer it up as a carrot to your early customers. It will make your customers feel like their voice can be heard while also reducing the risk of over-engagement.

Find the right sales leader with the least number of tries
If you are like most startups, you are not going to find the right sales leader, be it your VP of Sales or an individual contributor on your first three tries.  This is very painful as each restart leaves you having to rebuild the pipeline and relationships with customers that are further down the funnel.  A common theme among the most successful startups we talked to was that they found a great sales leader much faster than average.
Tal Riesenfeld, VP of Sales at Sunbit insists that the hiring of the sales leader cannot be delegated to recruiters or external people – the recruitment process must be structured and led by the CEO or founders. Down the line, the head of sales will be tasked with bringing in an amazing group of sellers that Tal likes to call “purple unicorns”.
These are leaders who are charismatic, smart, strategic, analytical, and persistent go-getters who can penetrate any account and build long lasting relationships with clients, all while representing a revolutionary product.  And like most good things, they don’t come easily, so you need to make sure you have the right leader to hunt them down.”
The key to doing that, they say, was applying a rigorous vetting process when hiring.  “Don’t rely on your gut instinct and/or an ad hoc hiring process alone. We added talent assessment surveys to our screening process to lower the risk of a bad hire” suggests Hill.  Specifically, it’s critical to do multiple performance and fit-based reference calls for each candidate and asked these three questions to unearth a great sales leader:


“Can you put me in touch with your three biggest customers?” 
 You want to spend time understanding their big wins as a sales leader in the past and how they contributed to those deals.  If possible, get on the phone with three of their biggest wins / customers and understand what the process was like, how the sales leader won the deal and what, if anything, they would have changed about the sales process.


“How much time do your leads typically spend in the pipeline?” 
One of the biggest traps less experienced sales teams find themselves in is spending too much time with poorly qualified leads.  A quick “no” is the second best answer you can possibly get and you want salespeople who exhibit a history of higher conversion rates from lead to close with fewer active leads that are stuck in no man’s land (>180+ days in the pipeline).One reason that leads spend too much time in the pipeline is because those leads aren’t the decision-makers themselves. One CEO we surveyed told us of this salesperson who was great in customer meetings, but could never close a single deal.  A deeper look revealed that while this salesperson did a good job of convincing the product groups, he failed to get buy-in from the decision maker who controls the budget.
Great sales leaders are not afraid to ask tough questions and should be able to identify the right decision makers early on in the process.  At the end of the day, if they can’t get that elusive signature from the right person, they need to realize when to cut bait and move on.


“How do you collaborate with product teams during the sales process?” 
More and more companies are finding it challenging to critically evaluate startups and newer technologies and frankly, really do not want to be sold to.  They want to come to a realization themselves that something is valuable, helps relieve a pain point and makes them look better for implementing it within their organization.Drew Woodcock, VP Sales at ChowNow (Karlin Ventures portfolio company) believes that “companies should look for a sales leader who has proven they can envision and implement a buyer-centric sales process. Today’s buyer expects the sales person to add value and prove they understand what challenges the buyer is facing. The right sales process combined with great customer success stories sets the foundation for a high performing and scalable sales team.”
Almost all of the top B2B startups we spoke to echoed this perspective in that they found that potential customers were far more interested in meeting the product team to understanding the inner workings of the product and the applicability to their organizations rather than being ‘sold to.’  We are not diminishing the importance of a sales leader to negotiate and close deals, but the new equilibrium is that product and technical knowledge trumps experience so plan to leverage your product and technical teams to support and optimize the sales process.

Sell a vision, but make sure you can deliver
You are way too late if you’re only selling your product when it is 100% ready.  Most founders are product-centric people and may struggle with this. But you need to wise up and come to grips with the fact that your product is not going to sell itself and you’re not going to close a sale as soon as it’s ready to ship.
Your first conversation with a prospective customer should be to offer them advice and only after you have created some mutual respect and trust should you focus on the close.  Even then, it is probably months before you get to the implementation phase, under a timeline that will undoubtedly be subject to your customer’s internal policies, roadmap and release schedules.  Does that then mean that you can go out selling vaporware and assume that your product will be able to play catch-up? Of course not, but there is a delicate balance to be found that doesn’t require overselling.
A common theme we heard was that the best B2B startups were able to deliver amazing product within the purchasing cycle.  With the sale of any enterprise product, there are expectations of what the product can do and the results it will ultimately deliver (cost savings, increased revenues, etc).
Most renewal decisions are made 2-3 months before the 1-year mark and, at that point, you need to be able to deliver on the promises you made to your customers or risk not getting that renewal.  The rule of thumb here is to sell with the understanding that what you are selling will be part of the core product within 6-9 months.

 Use technology to help you be at the right place at the right time
The old adage of being in the right place at the right time couldn’t hold more true for B2B software startups.  With a society that is suffering from information overload, it’s critical to use newer techniques and technologies to ensure your story gets in front of the right decision maker, at the right time and at the right place.  Sales automation solutions can help with that: 100% of the companies we spoke with had a sales automation solution in place, the most popular ones being Salesforce and HubSpot.
We heard loud and clear that a good mix of targeted social, email, and event marketing alongside clear messaging helps your voice be heard.  It’s also critical to attend 2-3 relevant conferences each year and always try to secure a speaking/panel slot (as conference admission is typically free for speakers).
Bizzabo maintains a great tech conference calendar as does Techmeme, but we’ve found that you often get more ‘bang for your buck’ at smaller, more industry-focused events.  Do your research, and don’t be afraid to approach high profile execs on the showroom floor.  They are typically much more receptive when you hunt them down, introduce yourself and clearly communicate how your business can help theirs.
Sales is not an easy job, nor is it ever meant to be.  Once you’re able to sign up your first few customers, hire a seasoned sales leader, and sell both a product and a vision across the enterprise, you’re well on your way to securing that next round of fundraising.  Clearly, there is no substitute for determination and grit but hopefully these lessons from these startups will make the journey slightly easier for you.

Pig organs are the same size as human organs and function pretty much the same way, but pig to human transplantation has long been an elusive goal for researchers due to fear of activating dormant viral diseases in the pig’s cells.
But there’s hope on the horizon, thanks to a new study out in Science today involving CRISPR’d piglets. Researchers in the study used the gene-editing technology to effectively cut out a porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) commonly found throughout pig bodies.
The findings represent an important breakthrough in the potential for xenotransplantation, or the use of animal organs in humans. Currently there are more than 117,000 men, women and children on the donor waiting list in the U.S., 22 of whom die each day from lack of a matching donor. The ability to use a pig heart, lungs or other body parts could shore up the shortage and save numerous lives.
This is the first time researchers have been able to demonstrate they were able to inactivate PERV and open the way for xenotransplantation without cross-species contamination.
The company behind the study, eGenesis, which was founded by Harvard genome godfather George Church and Luhan Yang, says it used a technique involving a combination of CRISPR and a method preventing primary cell death during the editing process to inactivate all 62 copies of PERV in piglet embryos. Those embryos were then implanted in sows, growing to fully formed piglets, free of PERV.
CRISPR holds enormous potential to wipe out diseases in both humans and animals, upend our food system and has many other applications we likely don’t see yet. Just last week, U.S. scientists were able to demonstrate they could successfully CRISPR out a faulty heart gene mutation in human embryos. However, there is still a lot to take into account before applying the technology to fully formed human beings.
eGenesis says it will continue to monitor the piglets for any long-term effects and, according to Yang, will also “further engineer the PERV-free pig strain to deliver safe and effective xenotransplantation.”

Snap’s Q2 earnings report was another failure on a long, downward path for the social media company as user growth slowed under the pressure of Instagram. Snap added 7.3 million daily active users to reach 173 million with a 4.2 percent growth rate, slower than the 5 percent growth that got it to 166 million DAU in Q1. Snap missed on revenue that reached $181.6 million with a loss of -$0.16 earnings per share. That’s compared to Wall Street’s estimates of $185.8 million in revenue and a loss of -$0.14 EPS plus 175 million users.
Snap lost $443 million this quarter, up nearly 4X from $116 million in Q2 2016, showing its marketing and sales expenses are ballooning despite it still missing on earnings.
Investors we spoke to wanted to see daily active user count grow 5 million, to at least 171 million, and average revenue per user above $1.05 or $1.10. Average revenue per user was actually $1.05, up a strong 16 percent from Q1. Total revenue grew 153 percent year-over-year, up 21 percent from $149.6 million in Q1 revenue. But with slowing user growth, that wasn’t enough to satisfy investors. 
Snap had closed at $13.69 today just before earnings, and immediately fell more than 16 percent on the bad news, to hover just above $11.50.

One bright spot in the earnings was that Snapchat added 4 million users in the lucrative North America region compared to 3 million the last two quarters. Another was that Snap boosted its ARPU significantly in the Rest of World, from $0.19 in Q1 to $0.29 in Q2, demonstrating that it’s learning to monetize lower-bandwidth users.
Investors hoped that Snap’s shrinking user growth rate was just a phase, and that it would bounce back from competition. It saw 17.2 percent growth in daily users in Q2 2016, but that fell dramatically after Instagram launched its clone of Stories, falling to a low of 3.2 percent in Q4 2016. Yet Snap couldn’t build on last quarter’s 5 percent growth, and the slippage has dragged down its share price.
Earnings call highlights
During the Q2 earnings call, Snap breezed past the obvious shortcomings in its earnings report to discuss some vanity metrics, hardware sales and its advertising plan:

Snap earned $5.4 million in Other revenue, predominantly from selling Spectacles, which means it sold less than 42,000 pairs of $130 camera sunglasses in Q2 despite expanding sales to Europe. That revenue is down 35 percent from Q1.
The average user creates 20 Snaps per day.
The dancing hot dog that Spiegel called the world’s “first augmented reality superstar” was viewed more than 1.5 billion times on Snapchat, plus tons more as it was made into viral memes shared around the web.
Publisher Story views are up 30 percent quarter-over-quarter.
Snap doubled the number of original “Shows” that premiered on its platform in Q2 versus Q1, with some getting more than 10 million views per episode.
250 million Snaps are saved to Memories each day.
Since launching its Snap Map that shows what other people are doing around the world, submissions to Our Story have increased 30 percent.
Snap will move to a bidded auction model for ad sales in hopes of boosting ad prices.

Snap needs a new strategy
Snap has had a tough quarter since it fell way short on its Q1 earnings report, and its share price fell from nearly $23 to around $18. That’s after pricing its May IPO at $17 and seeing a big first day pop. Further competition has depressed the share price, as Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status now each have 250 million users, making the clones much bigger than Snapchat as a whole. Snap only caught a break last week when rumors that Google was interested in acquiring it briefly perked up the share price.
Snap has been aggressively courting advertisers in hopes of getting its revenue growing faster, adding self-serve and bulk ad buying tools and striking ad measurement partnerships. It scored a viral hit with its dancing hot dog augmented reality feature, but that fad has come and gone.
Snap has plenty to fix if it’s going to claw its way back to its $22 billion private funding valuation or its $31.4 billion post-IPO pop price. An algorithmically sorted feed, better relations with brands and influencers and a clear strategy for fending off Facebook could all help secure Snapchat’s future. But that could require diverting from some of the product philosophies that got it this far.

Benchmark, the Silicon Valley venture firm and early investor in Uber, has sued former CEO Travis Kalanick.
In a Delaware Chancery Court filing, originally identified by Axios’ Dan Primack, the suit alleges that Kalanick committed fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. Both Kalanick and Benchmark hold Uber board seats.
Accusing Kalanick of being “selfish” by packing Uber’s board with “loyal allies,” Benchmark alleges that the ousted CEO broke the law by trying to pave the way for his own return. Reports have suggested that Kalanick has been telling people that he’s “Steve Jobs-In it” and will be back at the helm.
If successful, the Benchmark lawsuit could kick Kalanick off the board of directors, making his return impossible.
Much of the complaint revolves around a June 2016 decision that expanded the size of Uber’s board from eight to 11. Kalanick was given the right to choose those seats. Kalanick eventually gave one of those to himself when he lost his CEO seat. The other two are still unfilled.
Benchmark is claiming that it would never have given Kalanick the power to choose those seats if the team had been aware of the gender discrimination, sexual harassment and other misconduct.
A spokesman for Kalanick is telling media outlets that the suit is “completely without merit and riddled with lies and false allegations.”
Uber has had a tumultuous 2017. After a former Uber employee wrote a story detailing sexual harassment and an environment that discriminated against women, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder oversaw an investigation into the company’s culture. This ultimately led to a series of executive departures and Kalanick’s resignation.
Uber has also been embroiled in a patent lawsuit with Waymo, the self-driving car division owned by the Google parent. Unsurprisingly, it’s another major point of contention in the new lawsuit. In a long list of items that Benchmark characterizes as “gross mismanagement” by Kalanick is his “personal involvement in causing Uber to acquire a self-driving vehicle start-up that, according to a confidential report not disclosed to Benchmark at the time (the ‘Stroz Report’), allegedly harbored trade secrets stolen from a competitor.”
The stakes are high because Uber is the most valuable private company at $70 billion. Benchmark and Kalanick are amongst the largest shareholders.
This is significant, not only because of Uber’s size but because Benchmark is considered one of Silicon Valley’s top venture firms, with the team including noted investor Bill Gurley. Venture capitalists typically cultivate a “founder friendly” image when competing to invest in the most promising startups, but it seems like Benchmark decided the ouster and lawsuit are worth it.
Other board seats belong to former Uber CEO Ryan Graves, co-founder Garrett Camp, TPG Capital, Nestle’s Wan Martello, Didi Chuxing’s CEO, Saudi Arabia’s Public investment fund and Arianna Huffington, who co-founded HuffPost.

Backblaze is one of the few unlimited backup services standing — in part because of its prowess in securing its own hard drives and building its own cloud services. Today, the company launched version 5.0 of its service and desktop clients. This new version introduces faster backups and restores, as well as improved browsing speed, image previews on the restore page and a new file sharing feature backed by the company’s B2 Cloud Storage service.
The highlights here are clearly the increased speed and the new file sharing feature. Backblaze for Mac and PC now makes smarter decisions about how many simultaneous upload connections it can handle. On a slow connection, you don’t want to have to use too many parallel threads, but on a fast connection, you may want as many as possible. The company says that its service can now achieve backups of up to 100 Mbps, though in the infrastructure backwater that is most the U.S. in 2017, not everybody has access to these kinds of fast connections.
It’s worth noting that Backblaze founder and CEO Gleb Budman tells me that he remains fully committed to offering unlimited backups without any speed restrictions.
As for the new file sharing feature, Backblaze now allows its users to publicly share any of their backed up files through its B2 service. While this cloud storage service is mostly meant for developers, all B2 accounts come with 10GB/month of free storage and 1GB/day of free downloads, which should make it powerful enough for sharing photos and other files with friends and family. You do need a B2 account for this to work, but the sharing tools will walk you through setting one up if you don’t have one yet.
Backblaze charges $5/month for its personal backup service (or $50/year if you pre-pay) and $50/year per computer for its business plan.
Global payments processing company PayPal announced this morning that it has agreed to acquire Swift Financial, which provides small business owners with working capital. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition will give PayPal better tools to expand its own Working Capital product.
For PayPal, the acquisition should bolster a portion of the company’s business that has seen increased competition over the years. It first launched a Working Capital product for businesses back in 2013, and since then has seen competitors like Square and Kabbage emerge as offering their own credit lines to small business customers.
With that in mind, PayPal has acquired Swift to add to its own underwriting capabilities and expand the amount of data it can use to assess the creditworthiness of its customers. Doing so should expand the amount of capital it makes available.
“We know and value Swift’s technology platform and people, and we believe their talent and capabilities will further strengthen our overall merchant value proposition,” PayPal’s Darrell Esch wrote in announcing the deal. “Building upon an existing commercial relationship, the acquisition of Swift Financial will enable us to better serve small businesses by enhancing our underwriting capabilities to provide access to affordable business financing solutions to more businesses to help them grow and thrive.”
Since being founded in 2006, Swift Financial has provided funding to more than 20,000 small businesses, according to its statement announcing the deal. That’s not bad for a startup, but clearly PayPal will give Swift massive distribution and the ability to reach more companies that it works with.
In its announcement, PayPal says it has provided access to more than $3 billion in funding to more than 115,000 small businesses since it launched PayPal Working Capital. The companies expect the acquisition to be completed later in the year.

It’s been quite a week in tech, with now-former Google engineer James Damore’s controversial post about gender going viral and his subsequent firing. So, right on cue, workplace culture and company review platform Comparably has come out with a ranking of the top 10 tech companies for people of color, as well as the top 10 for women.
Because gender is top of mind for a lot of people right now, let’s first take a look at that. Salesforce is No. 1, with a score of 82, Apple comes in at No. 9 with a score of 78 and Facebook is ranked No. 10 with a score of 77. Here’s the full list for gender:

Salesforce (82)
Adobe (80)
Intuit (80)
T-Mobile (79)
LinkedIn (79)
Accenture (79)
PayPal (78)
Workday (78)
Apple (78)
Facebook (77)

Comparably’s gender score is based on how female employees rate their experience at a respective company, while the “diversity” score is based on how employees of color rate their experience at a company. All of the ratings were collected between March 2016 and August 2017. As you may have noticed, Google is not on the top 10 list for gender.

Comparably has raised more than $12 million, with its most recent round coming in at $7.25 million earlier this year. Since launching in March 2016, Comparably’s goal has been to provide more transparency and opportunity in the workplace.
Uber SVP of Global Operations will be leaving that full-time senior leadership role in the middle of September to “focus” on his role as a director of Uber’s board.
Graves, who acted as Uber’s CEO from early 2010 until founder Travis Kalanick took over the position at the end of that year, had been seen as a close associate of Kalanick’s over the course of his long tenure at the ride-hailing company.
An earlier report from Business Insider suggested that Graves had had a decreased role in Uber’s operations since last August, and he remained out of the spotlight during Uber’s recent issues around culture and accusations of sexual harassment. In an email to employees announcing Graves’ departure from his SVP role, he ends by alluding to the need for the company to focus on culture now, as it neglected much of the need to do so during its rapid growth to this point.
The full email from Graves to staff, obtained by TechCrunch by a source close to the matter, is included below.

Uber team —
In the past 7.5 years of building Uber, I’ve learned so many different lessons, one of which is the fact that people who embrace uncertainty and change have the best grip on reality. In the middle of September, I’ll be embracing another big change on my journey with Uber and will transition out of a full-time operating role to focus on my role as a Board Director.
In every position I’ve held at Uber, as GM, then CEO, then SVP of Global Operations, I’ve focused on people and team. Uber’s launch, our rapid growth, and now global impact, are all a testament to the quality of the folks that I have had the pleasure of working and growing with. That team is now the driving force behind the durability and importance of the business we run in over 600+ cities.
In some ways my focus going forward will not actually change very much — it remains all about people, and it’s clear to me the stability of our board of directors, the selection of our new CEO, and the empowerment of our management team is what is needed most. So I will do everything in my power to deliver on those goals for the benefit of our organization and the millions of people — riders, drivers, eaters and couriers — and their communities that Uber serves every day.
I could not possibly stress enough how insanely proud I am of this organization. The dedication towards our mission of providing transportation that can be trusted, to everyone, is noble. We, as a team, have achieved something that has truly changed the world for the better, and will continue to do so long into the future.
I also have deep gratitude for the lessons learned from Travis, from my colleagues on Uber’s ELT, and my Global Ops leadership team over the years — notably Rachel, Austin, Jo, Mac, Pierre, Droege, Penn, Jambu, Ro, Mike, Amit, Meghan, Barnes, and so many others who have given so much of their hearts and lives to building this company. Thank you. Without you, I wouldn’t be the person I am today and for that, I will forever be in your debt.
When you go through an experience like we have building Uber you forget that it’s not just the people across the desk that are making a huge investment, it’s also the partners and spouses, the families and the friends at home also making sacrifices. I would never have been able to make this journey without my wife Molly there to listen and advise. The ride hasn’t always been easy but nevertheless, she’s been there with me to laugh, to cry, to plan, and to celebrate. She deserves more credit than anyone in supporting me through it all. She’s been the most constant and enduring partner, right at my side, and building her own company and our family along the way. I *really* look forward to being able to return the love and spend more time with her and with our boys.
So, why now? Well, there is no great time for a move like this one. But it’s really important to me that this transition doesn’t take away from the importance of the onboarding process of our new CEO, whoever they might be. My hope is that ensuring my transition is known and planned for well before our board’s decision on CEO it will help to make it clear to our team and to our new leader that I will be there to support however I can.
There is another lesson I’ve learned that we should have applied much earlier. We should have taken more time to reflect on our mistakes and make changes together. There always seemed to be another goal, another target, another business or city to launch. Confucius said that reflection is the noblest method to learn wisdom, and fortunately, our new found reflection and introspection has become an asset to us and we have evolved and grown considerably. Our culture, our processes, our leaders, and our teams have become wiser, stronger, and more mature because of it. Regardless of which role I hold in the future, I’ll be dedicated to supporting Uber’s leadership, partnering with Uber’s new CEO to understand the complexities of this business and this organization, and to continuing to deliver on the critically important mission and future we have ahead of us. Again, thank you all, and let’s Uber on!
Best,

SoundCloud will soon collapse if investors don’t vote for a rescue funding round tomorrow. The stumbling music streaming community site had to suddenly lay off 40 percent of its staff last month. Now it’s asking investors for $169.5 million at a pre-money enterprise valuation of just $150 million, according to Axios‘ reliable business editor Dan Primack. That’s a steep drop from the $700 million valuation of its previous rounds.
If SoundCloud doesn’t get the funding, CEO Alexander Ljung reportedly told investors that SoundCloud won’t be able “to continue as a going concern.” That could force SoundCloud to sell even though Ljung has stubbornly fought to keep the dying startup independent. If it can’t find funding or a buyer, SoundCloud could vaporize, destroying its massive archive of user-uploaded music, podcasts and other sounds.
Investors would be forgiven their distrust since SoundCloud has burned over $230 million in funding plus $70 million in debt with little monetization progress to show for it.
[Update: At least this new funding deal would bring in new management. Recode reports that former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor would replace SoundCloud CEO Alex Ljung if investors do provide the funding.]

Last month we detailed the many, MANY problems with SoundCloud. Employees told us the company is “a shitshow,” with a lack of product direction, talent leaving and employees secretly using Spotify.
Rather than focus on its unique value proposition of being the “YouTube for Audio” with demos, DJ sets and remixes available nowhere else, SoundCloud chased dreams of grandeur as it tried to evolve into a Spotify competitor. But after taking years to negotiate deals with the major record labels, the extremely late $9.99 SoundCloud Go+ subscription service flopped. Meanwhile, it had burned credibility with core users like DJs by removing their music over dubious copyright claims while trying to suck up to the labels.
SoundCloud CEO Alex Ljung would be replaced if the company receives the new funding
SoundCloud lavishly spent money on offices around the world while its CEO galavanted at music festivals like a rock star. SoundCloud recklessly wasted money, hiring people up until the moment it announced they’d be immediately let go as part of the 173 layoffs it announced last month. Now staff morale is in the toilet, the user experience is a mess, the subscription models are unappealing, competitors are growing rapidly and musicians are fleeing to other upload platforms.
That’s why it seems crazy for investors to fund a $170 million Series F to keep a sinking ship afloat a little longer unless SoundCloud is willing to swallow its pride and get acquired for whatever it can get.
The new investors would be Raine Group and Temasek, plus existing backers Union Square Ventures, Doughty Hanson and Atlantic Technology. They’d at least get preferred stock that’s paid out upon exit before previous investors. But how are they to know they won’t get diluted too when SoundCloud runs out of money again? The new deal would reportedly reduce the liquidity preference of the previous Series E investors by over 40 percent.
We reached out to SoundCloud PR and its CEO for comment or clarity on the do-or-die fundraise, but didn’t hear back.
Investors’ best bet is to fund a small bridge round just big enough for SoundCloud to shop itself around and find a buyer. Perhaps Google would buy it to align the YouTube of Audio with the YouTube of YouTube. Or Amazon could step in and try to do for musicians what it did for book authors by creating a convenient aggregated marketplace, though acquiring Pandora might better mesh with Amazon’s mainstream demographic.
SoundCloud has proven it can’t manage itself. It’s too damaged, too in debt and too far behind to thrive independently without a miracle turnaround. No matter what, the whole service is on shaky footing, so musicians may want to archive their audio and start promoting their presence somewhere safer.
Facebook malware is nothing new, but an emerging threat offers some unique karmic retribution. In an unpublished report, security researchers at Sydney-based LMNTRIX Labs have identified software advertising itself as a Facebook password stealer that injects malicious code in the background once downloaded, making the user vulnerable to having their own credentials stolen.
“This appears very widespread and growing,” the research team told TechCrunch. “We classified this as an ongoing malicious campaign with the threat actors actively marketing it as ‘Facebook Password Stealer’ or, more innocuously, ‘Facebook Password Recovery.’
“The attackers also seem to be sophisticated marketers who understand there is potentially big demand for the purported service and are distributing the sample via Spam, Ad campaigns, Pop-ups, Bundled Software, Porn sites and also some times as a standalone software.”

Fittingly dubbed “Instant Karma” by the LMNTRIX researchers, the malware campaign lures victims who are seeking software that can crack into other people’s Facebook accounts. Once downloaded and run, it drops a remote access trojan in the background after the victim clicks the “hack” button.

The researchers cross-referenced the contents of “spoolsvfax.exe” with VirusTotal’s database, where they identified it as containing a newly uploaded trojan.

Before identified and neutralized, Facebook malware that offers useful (if sketchy) services often thrives thanks to Facebook’s incomparably massive user base. It can take many forms, from tempting downloads that offer to notify a user when they are unfriended to malware bots posing as a friend on Messenger. A simple search of “hack Facebook account” yields pages of results and links to all manner of likely malware-tainted software solutions, many of which are targeted toward the average user, no technical skill required.
This particular threat appears limited to Windows desktop users, though malware targeting Facebook’s mobile experience isn’t uncommon either. It’s no surprise that the largest social network in the world is a hacker goldmine if tricks like these can be leveraged successfully.
“The target market goes beyond a typical hacker subset (if there is such a thing) and targets the general user who may be tempted to get inside someone’s Facebook account (friends, enemies, significant others, et al.),” the researchers told TechCrunch. “While there have been methods and apps offering Facebook hacks, this specific malicious campaign which uses the promise of easy Facebook password theft as bait is completely new.”
Cryptocurrencies are back. But did they ever go away? If you ask cryptocurrency advocates, they’re going to tell you that it’s been a slow and steady rise filled with initial coin offerings, forks and updates. That’s why we’re excited to welcome Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and AngelList co-founder and CEO Naval Ravikant at TechCrunch Disrupt SF. They’re going to have a conversation on stage about all things related to cryptocurrencies.
Many people discovered cryptocurrencies through bitcoin around 2011 and 2012. After that, mainstream interest quickly waned. But entrepreneurs and engineers kept working on various projects related to cryptocurrencies. It’s unclear why many people outside of the cryptocurrency community got back into cryptocurrencies, but 2017 has definitely been a crazy year for the space.
In particular, Ethereum broke some kind of glass ceiling and became a major cryptocurrency on its own. At some point, the total market capitalization of all ethers currently in circulation was above $36 billion. Bitcoin is still the dominant cryptocurrency, but Ethereum is also a heavyweight now.
Vitalik Buterin is one of the best persons to talk about Ethereum as he’s been one of the main architects behind this blockchain.
At the same time, there’s been a bitcoin fork last week and bitcoin miners are about to adopt an update focused on scalability thanks to Segregated Witness. Ethereum already experienced a fork, and its main developers are also thinking about ways to increase scalability. It’s going to be interesting to hear Buterin’s take on those topics.
One of the reasons why Ethereum has become so popular is that many startups have raised the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars by offering new coins thanks to initial coin offerings (ICOs). Many investors have been funneling ethers to exchange them into new tokens that represent a stake in a company or a project. So the rise of Ethereum and ICOs have been intrinsically connected.
In addition to his role at AngelList, Naval Ravikant has been tweeting and writing about ICOs and cryptocurrencies for a while. He’s one of the biggest cryptocurrency advocates in the startup and VC community. He even launched CoinList with AngelList to make it easier to back and hold an ICO. He has a ton of interesting things to say on those topics.
Having these two people on stage at the same time should be a great experience. If you want to hear this discussion, grab an early-bird ticket to Disrupt (September 18 – September 20). You’ll also hear from Anna Fang (Zhen Fund), Adi Tatarko (Houzz), Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors), Sebastian Thrun (Udacity), Lisa Jackson (Apple) or dozens of other terrific speakers.
Amazon is facing a lawsuit from two former employees that alleges the company harassed them and threatened them physically. The Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF) filed the lawsuit on behalf of the couple, Allegra Schawe-Lane and Dane Lane.
After Schawe-Lane was outed as transgender, she began experiencing “discrimination and harassment by Amazon employees, supervisors, and managers,” the lawsuit alleges. The discrimination and harassment, according to the lawsuit, entailed being intentionally referred to by male pronouns and titles “with the purpose and effect of humiliating” her, sexual harassment, threats of physical violence, “hostility” that made it hard for her to use the women’s bathroom, pay deductions and a lot of other really messed up stuff.
More specifically, people at Amazon, including managers and supervisors, allegedly made discriminatory and derogatory comments directed at her like “it,” “sir,” “he/she,” “chick with a dick,” “shemale,” “tranny”  and “tranny prostitute.”
In addition to what Schawe-Lane was subjected to, her partner faced retaliation, sexual harassment, disparaging comments from co-workers and a hostile work environment, according to the lawsuit. For example, one of Lane’s employees allegedly touched him in a sexual way, “gyrated his crotch” and offered him porn and sex toys.
“Allegra and Dane endured severe bigotry and sexual harassment after their Amazon colleagues learned that Allegra is a transgender woman,” the TLDEF wrote on its blog. “They were targeted with vicious slurs and threats. When they complained, they endured retaliation and were told that they were not allowed to make complaints in writing. While driving home one day from the secure Amazon parking lot, they found that the brakes on their car were not working correctly, and learned from their mechanic that the brake line was intentionally severed, putting the couple at significant risk of serious injury or death.”
The lawsuit, among other things, seeks for the court to order that Amazon implement policies, programs and training that ensure equal employment opportunities for people who are transgender, have transitioned genders or are undergoing a gender transition. The lawsuit also seeks compensation for both Schawe-Lane and Lane as a result of the losses they faced due to the “unlawful practices” at Amazon.
I have reached out to Amazon and will update this story if I hear back.

The ascendance of the so-called “hard right” in the US and the Trump administration’s work to protect its power means it’s unlikely the movement will be beaten by Democrats or left leaning parties at this point. The power of the hard right in red-states has become
institutionalized. So perhaps the answer is, instead, empowering traditional Conservatives who are passionate about public education and the environment to take power back in Republican party primaries? That could tilt the balance in a more centrist direction.
Value Voting, which is graduating as part of the Y Combinator programme, develops political targeting software for advocacy groups. They show leaders which of their members are voters, how many votes they need to flip an election, and help them form alliances to get the votes they need to win.
Here’s their thinking:
Turnout for party primaries in midterm years is extremely low (10-14% of registered voters). Using Value Voting, advocacy group leaders share anonymized voter data with allies to know which elections they can influence, find candidates to run in those elections, and coordinate messaging across alliances.
The startup is in part borne out of the experience of cofounder James Vaughan, who worked in Congress in 2009. At that point Democrats were getting roasted on Obamacare. Republicans were unwilling to compromise because to do so had become a political liability in the primaries. This loss of compromise between parties is clearly damaging pragmatic politics and thus its ability to deal with the complex problems the country faces.
In terms of traction, groups with a total of 530,000 voters are using the platform. Three alliances have been formed – with 290,000 anonymized voter profiles shared.
How does it work?
Well, the “user”, an advocacy group leader, receives an e-mail invite from an ally. After signup, the user joins the alliance and uploads their member data. Value Voting then matches the member data with the voter file – assigning each member a “voter type.” Then they anonymize this voter data and add it to the alliance totals. For example, the user will now know that across the alliance, they have 4,000 unique Republican primary voters in a district and it will take 7,000 votes to win the next election.
The “competitors”, if you will, in this case are traditional political consultants. In theory Nationbuilder could become a competitor, but, says Vaughan, they are focused on campaign software. “We think of them as a potential partner – the candidates our users surface will probably use Nationbuilder’s campaign software,” he says.
The key difference with Value Voting is that is allows allies to share anonymized voter data; includes elections results and turnout predictions so that users know their potential influence over a politician (voters/turnout needed to win); and its helps users influence ‘down ballot’ races – State Senate, State House, and Board of Education.
The plans are to later include county officials, city officials, and school boards. In these down-ballot races strategic collaboration goes a long way.
Most political activity focuses on calls, texts, dollars donated etc. Instead, Value Voting focuses on candidate discovery and helping its users coordinate for the primaries. That’s how their users will create a credible electoral threat and achieve legislative success. As Vaughan says: “Calling 100 times is ineffective if you have no one to vote for except the incumbent.”
Crucially they don’t make things complicated by replacing long-used CRMs. Instead they have a simple interface most people pickup quickly.
The business model is to charge advocacy groups a monthly fee to use the platform and in future to charge campaigns a fee for chatting with voters through the platform.
The market is good. In Texas, with current product for advocacy groups, the obtainable market is $7M. With a product for individuals that gives strategic primary voters access to candidates, this is worth $143M. Strategic primary voters are the most valuable voters in politics. Candidates will pay $2-$5, depending on the race, per conversation with a verified primary voter, according to Vaughan.
“We are going to prove the product in Texas before expanding. The key to capturing the market is electoral success. Geographic dispersion lowers the odds of being successful. We will scale as soon as our users have won a few political victories,” says Vaughan.
So far it’s raised $620,000 in Seed funding from Y-Combinator and Vaughan himself, and is looking to raise more.
The team consists of Can Sar, who previously started Apture (multimedia integration for news publishers), which was sold to Google in 2011. At Google he worked on Inbox. Previously he was a Stanford CS PhD student. After graduating from Stanford, Vaughan worked in Congress, noticed complete gridlock and left for the private sector in Peru. There, he took a hotel to number one on TripAdvisor, and founded a real-estate investment company.

Coinbase has had a pretty crazy six months.
It may be hard to remember, but at the beginning of 2017 the cryptocurrency world was a different place. Bitcoin was below $1000 per coin and the entire market cap for all cryptocurrencies was about 7x less than it is today. Since then, the market has surged. And as arguably the most established wallet and exchange service that exists today, Coinbase has been in the right place at the right time to capitalize on the excitement in the industry.
So to support this growth Coinbase has raised $100M in Series D funding led by IVP, with participation from Spark Capital, Greylock Partners, Battery Ventures, Section 32 and Draper Associates. The funding gives the digital currency startup a post-money valuation of $1.6B.
While Coinbase had previously raised a total of $106M, it’s been two and a half years since their last raise – which was their $75M Series C round in early 2015. But it seems that the wait paid off, as the recent growth allowed the startup to nearly triple their valuation to $1.6B, from a rumored $500M in 2015.
So just how explosive has this growth been?
Coinbase has facilitated almost $15B in digital currency exchange in just the first half of 2017, which is 5x more that was exchanged in the entirety of 2016. At this pace the startup may see a 10x increase in transaction volume from full-year 2016 to full-year 2017. The chart below helps put this growth in perspective.

And during this same six-month period the startup has also had a 4x increase in new customers signing up for the platform.
But of course with insane growth comes growing pains.
The exchange has experienced some downtime over the last few months, which they attributed to degraded performance related to “unprecedented volume”. Customer service response times have also been a big issue, but the company has acknowledged this and is working getting response times to below 6 hours by Q3 2017, and phone support for at least some percentage of the customer base by Q4. They also said that some of this new funding will support scaling customer support and engineering teams.
Of course there’s also been a lot of good. The exchanged added support for Ethereum in 2016 and Litecoin in 2017, and have been open about the fact they want to add many more cryptocurrencies in the future. And on the product front, GDAX recently added margin trading to appeal to professional traders, and Coinbase is planning on opening a GDAX office in New York City to continue building relationships with institutions and professional traders.
So what’s next for Coinbase? Besides the expected goals – like improving customer support and adding new cryptocurrencies when the market supports them, Brian Armstrong, cofounder and CEO of Coinbase, hinted that he sees the company beginning to transition into phase three of its “master plan” – which is described as building a consumer interface for digital currency apps that can potentially reach 100M people.
And he’s right – the next year or so will determine whether cryptocurrency breaks into the mainstream, aided by technology that helps make it accessible to the average consumer, or remains a relative niche within the technology and finance community.
Get ready for more BuzzFeed-branded products.
The company has hired Eric Karp, previously the general manager of licensing at Crayola, as its first head of licensing. Karp will be working with outside partners to develop new products around BuzzFeed brands.
BuzzFeed has already been moving into unusual product areas with things like the Glamspin (a fidget spinner with lip gloss) and the Tasty One Top (an app-connected hot plate). However, Head of BuzzFeed Product Labs Ben Kaufman noted that these products were developed internally, by his team, though usually with help from outside partners.
Hiring Karp should open the door for many other companies to create their own BuzzFeed products, and it could create new revenue opportunities as the online publisher considers going public. At the same time, Kaufman insisted that BuzzFeed will approach licensing in “a thoughtful way,” rather than just slapping its name on any random product.
“We as a company believe that every great media company has a great licensing strategy — a way to protect your brand as you enter the world of licensing,” he said. “There are brand guidelines for all of our flagship brands, but one of the best things about BuzzFeed is that we birth new brands on a regular basis. [Karp will be] involved in the inception of these brands, defining the guidelines and the rules.”
 Kaufman also said BuzzFeed will continue to experiment with products on its own. When an idea has some “core” BuzzFeed characteristics — if it’s “easily shareable, something that currently compels people to create content, something that feels unique and new to market” — his team will try to build it themselves.
On the other hand, “if it looks like something a subject matter expert would really good at taking on, we’ll look to partner and license,” he said. “Why reinvent the wheel?”
Karp will also be overseeing BuzzFeed’s existing content licensing partnerships, Kaufman said. And yes, he said there are some licensing deals already in the works, though they haven’t been announced yet.

Discord wants to destroy its biggest, best-funded competitor in the battle to be the communications layer for gaming. It wants to be the home for gamer clans strategizing and trash-talking with each other. After out-gunning its gaming-specific competitors like TeamSpeak, Mumble and Ventrilo with a secret $50 million fundraise earlier this year, Discord is setting its sights on Skype.
Today Discord expands beyond text and voice with the launch of video chat and screensharing. Now friends can watch each other play their favorite games while talking face-to-face. These features could further addict Discord’s 45 million users, 9 million of whom use its web, desktop and mobile apps each day.

“This is the most requested feature on Discord probably a year running,” says CMO Eros Resmini. “A lot of infrastructure had to be built up for this launch,” he warns, though, since the video features run at a remarkably smooth and crisp 720p at 30 frames per second. Skype runs at half that FPS. My briefing with the company was held over its new video chat, and it looked much better than what’s standard.
That’s why only 5 percent of users will get video today, and it will only work with groups of up to 10 people. Embodying Discord’s playful style, the company explains that “It’s possible that we’ll need to completely turn off video calls during this test. If you find the feature is missing all of a sudden, we suggest you lay on the floor and stare at the ceiling until it’s fixed.”
If the video launch goes smoothly, Discord could snatch gamers from its competitors that either lack video entirely, or do screensharing poorly like Skype, as they weren’t built for conveying rapid-fire action with sharp graphics. One big thing that’s lacking is sound from screenshares, which Discord will need to figure out.
Video chat could be a stepping stone for Discord to start competing with massive one-to-many broadcasting channels like YouTube and Twitch.

From gamer to game developer to Discord
Discord was originally a game developer itself, making the critically acclaimed but publicly ignored mobile battle arena Fates Forever. “We couldn’t figure out how to get over the hump on the monetization side,” Resmini says. So in late 2014, it started tinkering with other ideas.
CTO Stan Vishnevskiy had been dreaming of a tool like Discord. “I played MMORPG [Massively multiplayer online role-playing games] 15 hours per day,” he told me, and was dissatisfied with TeamSpeak and Mumble. Those required IP addresses that could be attacked by trolls, rented servers and clumsy apps. “Can we make a 10X project? Low-friction usage, no renting servers, beautiful design we took from mobile.”
Discord launched in May 2016 and has been a rocket ship ever since. It’s now raised a total of $79 million, including the $50 million round led by Index Ventures in January 2017. The 70-employee startup now handles 200 million messages per day and up to 4 million concurrent users as groups chat about World of Warcraft, OverWatch, League of Legends and Clash Royale.
The startup earns money from $5/month subscriptions to its Nitro tier, which gives users cosmetic upgrades and a few bells and whistles. “Discord has made the promise to our user base of keeping the core Discord experience free,” says Resmini. But the company is considering launching in-app purchases to enhance the new video features and earn some extra cash.

Don’t equip the trolls
The company insists that the majority of its users are gamers chatting with small groups of friends, where someone calling someone else a colorful, profanity-laced name is more a joke than a harassment issue. But there are some larger public servers for entire sub-Reddits where people discuss topics beyond games, and Discord has unfortunately found itself used by hate groups to coordinate trolling and harassment.
“We focus on giving people tools and controls so they never get in a situation that they’re with a stranger that’s doing something you don’t think is OK,” says Resmini. “You can block folks, you can leave places, you can remain in a private space.” The team also relies on users to report abuse to its team trained to quickly banish harassment, doxing and other problems.
Some startups, like subscription crowdfunding platform Patreon, have taken a relatively permissive approach to dealing with hate-mongers, and decline to comment on incendiary topics like Gamergate. That’s why it was encouraging to hear Discord speak candidly about its disapproval of the alt-right and sexism in the gaming business.
“Their ideologies aren’t welcome,” Resmini declares. “We don’t like people that act that way, people that harass people. We’re on the side of gaming that’s a positive community. That’s an inclusive community.”

Still, Discord won’t proactively jump in unless there are abuse reports. “We don’t read people’s private servers. We believe in privacy at Discord. The censorship thing is something we’ve stayed away from. We think it’s a very slippery slope,” Resmini admits. But once hatred surfaces, it’s comfortable dealing out lifetime bans and deletions of servers.
If Discord ever wants to become a mainstream communication tool for gaming culture that’s grown increasingly popular worldwide, it has to keep things clean and friendly, even if that means friends laughing while they swear at each other. “Some of the happiest times of my life have come from gaming,” Vishnevskiy concludes. “And things that make me happy, I want to bring to others.”
Ride hailing company Lyft has acquired two companies focused on growth, including customer acquisition, retention, referral programs and more. The companies being acquired are YesGraph, whose team and talent will join Lyft, and DataScore, whose growth team is coming over to the ride share provider.
The acquisitions are designed to help Lyft capitalize on its existing rapid pace of growth, which the company says has been “rapid” over the past year. Third-party data backs that up, suggesting that Lyft is seeing uncharacteristically high gains thanks in part to the difficulties faced by rival Uber. Lyft has also expanded to over 160 new cities during the past year alone, and already has seen more rides in 2017 than it provided during the entirety of 2016.
These new companies joining Lyft look designed to help press the gas pedal further on that pace of expansion, with a focus specifically on attracting more riders and drivers to the platform. YesGraph’s expertise is in building referral programs that reward customers for bringing in new ones, and Lyft says they’ll be focused on improving and building out the Lyft Driver Referral Program as part of the company.
DataScore’s team will be focused on scaling both driver and passenger sides of the equation, using their expertise in “customer acquisition, conversion and retention programs,” according to Lyft. DataScore’s tagline prior to the acquisition is “We help startups grow,” and they advertise “a data-driven marketing approach,” “powered by proprietary technology” to help make that happen.
This seems an acknowledgement on Lyft’s part that now is the time to aggressively pursue growth in order to capitalize on its position relative to industry leader Uber. Lyft has been doing a lot in terms of product and market work to help with that, but acquisitions focused on bringing in new users is also a smart use of its position, and its new funds, which include a $600 million round confirmed in April. The company did not disclose financial terms of either of these new acquisitions.
The Surface line has been a surprising hit for Microsoft in recent years. What many regarded as little more than proof of concept for Windows 10 has become a leader in the two-in-one tablet category in its own right. But according to a new survey conducting by Consumer Reports, the devices have proven far more unreliable than much of the competition. In fact, things are so bad, the publication has revoked its recommendations of the products. 
In a survey of 90,000 tablet/PC owners, Consumer Reports found that around a quarter of Surface owners reported breakage problems with their devices within two years. That’s significantly higher than the number reported for Apple, Samsung and Acer at 10-, 16- and 18-percent. Though Toshiba and Dell followed close behind at 24- and 22, percent, respectively. 
That means that Microsoft’s not alone at the top of the list, but the idea of a quarter of customers reporting significant problems with a product within the first two years is troubling — particularly in the case of a tablet or PC. The investment involved in purchasing such a product comes with the expectation that it’s going to last longer than a smartphone contract or a term in the House of Representatives.
In fact, it’s high enough that CR has pulled its stamp of approval from two Surface Laptop
and two Microsoft Surface Book SKUs. The publication does this from time to time, and it rarely bodes well for the company in question. Often times it’s followed by a public reaction mirroring the five stages of grief. In Microsoft’s case, we appear to be in “denial.”
The company offered us a statement that basically agrees to disagree with Consumer Reports about the whole kerfuffle.
“Microsoft Surface Pro is designed and built with performance and reliability in mind,” a spokesperson writes. “Microsoft’s real-world return and support rates for past models differ significantly from Consumer Reports’ breakage predictability. While we respect Consumer Reports, we don’t believe these findings accurately reflect Surface owners’ true experiences or captures the performance and reliability improvements made with every Surface generation. We’re proud of the high performance and versatility marks Surface Pro received in Consumer Reports’ laptop lab evaluations.” 
If this plays out the way these things usually do, the acceptance stage should involve the company promising to work more closely with Consumer Reports. 
My own experiences with the Surface line of products have been mostly positive, though my testing hasn’t included the sort of day to day rigors these devices are subject to by the people who own them. As Microsoft notes in its statement, the devices, including the new Pro and Laptop, have performed well in CR’s lab testing, but that also fails to take into account long term, real life usage. 
betaworks, the startup studio responsible for companies like Giphy, TweetDeck, and Dots, is today formally announcing the launch of a $50 million early-stage fund called betaworks ventures.
betaworks ventures has actually been active in the market for the last year, though operating somewhat under the radar, and betaworks has been making investments long before that from the over-arching betaworks holding company. The $50 million fund allows betaworks to invest across all three of its main interests, including betaworks studio (the arm that launches home-made companies), betaworks camps (theme-based accelerators) and external investment (outside companies).
Borthwick explained to TechCrunch the way that betaworks ventures will divvy up resources across all three divisions of the company.
Like everything betaworks does, the fund will be focused specifically on a few categories of technology, including conversational interfaces, spatial computing, native media, playable media, and emergent behavior in legacy systems.
In terms of number of companies, the majority of investments will go toward companies launching out of betaworks camps — previous camps include BotCamp and VoiceCamp — while a relatively small number of investments will go toward studio companies, as only two or three launch each year. Outside investments will fall somewhere in the middle.
That said, the actual amount of cash will break down a bit differently, with outside investments seeing around 50 percent of the fund’s investment capital. Studio companies will receive larger investments, taking up about 25 percent of capital, with a large number of small seed and pre-seed investments going to camp graduates.
Partners in the fund include betaworks boss John Borthwick, Matt Hartman, and Peter Rojas. betaworks ventures will also benefit from a fellowship program, letting folks from the betaworks community scout startups that may be of interest to the fund. Those fellows will receive a share of the economics on deals they bring in, but not of the fund as a whole.
Though the fund is focused on pre-seed and seed stage funding, the new structure of betaworks as a whole will allow for more flexibility for Series A, Series B, and follow-on rounds.
“Our ability to do follow-ons was so restricted,” said Borthwick. “Giphy grew extraordinarily fast, along with some others, and we couldn’t double down as those things grew up because our source of capital was exclusively through the holding company.”
Borthwick said he’s mulled starting a fund for the past five or six years, but last year he eventually put his foot down and made it happen.
We reported on the story last year, and though Borthwick wouldn’t confirm or deny whether Twitter invested in the fund, he did confirm that both the New York Times Company and Guardian Media Group have joined as LPs.
To date, betaworks ventures has made around 30 investments from the fund.
It’s clear that voice is becoming a major interface, as we witness the rise of the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Siri, Cortana and their ilk. We’re also seeing an increasing use of chat bots and other voice-driven tools, which often require speech recognition with a very specific vocabulary.
That’s where AssemblyAI, a member of the Summer ’17 Y Combinator class comes in. The startup is building an API that will help developers build customized chat interfaces quickly.
“We’re building an API for customized speech recognition. Developers use our API for transcribing phone calls or creating custom voice interfaces. We help them recognize an unlimited number of custom words without any training,” Dylan Fox, AssemblyAI’s founder told TechCrunch.
He says, most off-the-shelf speech recognition APIs are designed to be one size fits all. If you want to customize it, it gets really expensive. AssemblyAI hopes to change that.
When Fox was working at his previous job as an engineer at Cisco, he saw first-hand how difficult it was to create a speech recognition program with custom words. It usually involved a lot of engineering resources and took a long time. He came up with the idea of AssemblyAI as a way to make it easier, less costly and much faster. He added, that recent advancements in AI and machine learning have made it possible to do what his company is doing now.
It’s worth noting that the tool requires GPUs, rather than CPUs, for increased processing power because the task is so resource-intensive. Getting access to a sufficient number of GPUs to build and run the tasks has been a challenge for the three-person startup, but their affiliation with Y Combinator has helped in that regard. It’s also brand new tech, so they have to solve every problem they encounter on their own. There are no books to read or solutions to look up on Google.
Even though they are just three people, they believe user experience is going to be key to their success, so they have one team member fully devoted to developing the front end. They claim that no training is required to run the API. You just upload a list of terms or names and the API takes care of the rest.
Fox fully recognizes that it’s hard for startup to build a speech recognition tool without constantly worrying about the bigger companies swooping in and grabbing their market share, but he says his company is working hard to differentiate itself as a go-to tool for developers.
“As a smaller company focused on a speech recognition technology, we can provide a better experience [than the bigger companies].” He says that means paying attention to the little things that attract developers to a tool like better documentation, simpler integration and just making it easier to use overall.
So far the product is in private beta with several companies deploying it on GPUs in the cloud, but it’s early days. He says when the customers come, they will have to scale to meet those demands using additional cloud-based GPU resources. If it works as described, that shouldn’t be long now.

Cancer and heart disease are the two leading causes of death in the United States. So far, Color Genomics has been focused on testing for mutations leading to a higher risk of certain cancers. But, today the four-year-old company is introducing a new category of genetic testing for cardiovascular health.
The new Color Hereditary High Cholesterol Test will tell you if you have a genetic mutation for something called Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), a hereditary condition  that causes high cholesterol levels leading to coronary heart disease.
Possibly 34 million people are affected by the disease worldwide. About one in fifty people with high cholesterol have the mutation. The problem? Most people with the genetic mutation don’t know they have it until they have a potentially fatal heart attack.
Like cancer testing, earlier detection of the mutation can prevent the disease, improve survival rates and reduce medical costs. And that’s where Color hopes its new test can help.
“We started with cancer because it was one of the leading causes of death and the science around genetics and cancer was well-established,” Color chief marketing officer Katie Jacobs Stanton told TechCrunch. “Similarly, there is well-established science around genetics and cardiovascular disease…Given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death (and combined with cancer costs over $1.1trillion per year), we saw an opportunity to help more people learn their risk of developing hereditary cardiovascular conditions and proactively managing their heart health using genetic data.”
Unlike at-home genetic tests like 23andMe, you order this one through your doctor. The test is $249 for new customers. However, those who’ve gone through Color’s cancer testing can purchase the cardiovascular test for an additional $150.
If you’re looking for a little more arcade feel for your Nintendo Switch, look no further than 8Bitdo’s NES30 Arcade Stick. The Bluetooth controller accessory is compatible with a range of platforms besides the Switch, and it’s a well-made gadget with careful attention paid to how buttons and the joysticks feel, giving an authentic arcade cabinet experience. It’s also very big, which is not necessarily a bad thing – just something to be aware of.
The NES30 Arcade Stick is a little larger than two Switch consoles stacked on top of one another, and thicker, too. It’s big and solid, which makes it optimal for staying planted when you’re getting fast and furious with fighting game combo action. The Joystick on the left is replaceable if you feel like you want a custom option from Sanwa, and the buttons are standard 30mm arcade models which can also be swapped out if you’re not entirely happy with the feel.

In my relatively amateur opinion, however, 8bitdo did a good job with the stock joystick and buttons included with the controller. They feel like a genuine arcade experience, with satisfying, audible clickiness for the buttons and just enough resistance when you’re rotating that stick. It’s a much better experience overall for pulling off special moves vs. using the existing Switch controllers, and really amps up the fun factor for Ultra Street Fighter II, as well as the many re-released classic SNK fighters available for the console.
The console also features a dedicated turbo button, and a switch for changing between X-input and D-input modes, as well as wired USB support for PC and Raspberry Pi devices, via the included 3-meter USB cable (which is also used for charging the internal battery). It gets 18 hours of playtime on just an hour or two of charging, which is plenty for a single charge, and works with Windows, Android, Mac, Switch and Steam wirelessly via Bluetooth, too.

Functionality aside, the best thing about the NES30 Arcade Stick might be its charm. The use of NES (or Famicom, depending on your model) inspired colors and graphics really makes for an attractive package. Depending on your interior decor tastes, it could even be a central conversation piece adorning a coffee table or curio cabinet when not in use.
The NES30 Arcade Stick is available to pre-order from Amazon for $79.99, and will ship starting on August 20.
Filecoin, the much-anticipated cryptocurrency that will eventually power a distributed file storage system, is opening its ICO today at 12pm PT / 3pm ET today.
Last week Filecoin concluded a much talked about “advisor” sale that brought in a total of $52M from ~150 investors including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, Winklevoss Capital and about 100 individual high-profile Silicon Valley investors.
Ten percent of tokens allocated will go to advisors and ICO investors, with 15% going to Protocol Labs (the company creating FileCoin), 5% going to a new foundation, and 70% being held for miner rewards. The ICO is capped in terms of FileCoin sold at 200M, but the final price of FileCoin will depend on the total amount of USD raised, which is uncapped.

If you’re interested in more specifics related to the ICO distribution, you can read the economics of the token sale here.
Some have criticized Filecoin’s advisor distribution, saying that there will likely be a large valuation difference between the price per coin paid by advisors, and the higher price that may be paid by later investors.
Filecoin’s founders responded to these issues, saying that “The advisor sale involved an amazing group of technologists, researchers, entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, industry leaders, and investors…and all of them are committed — vested — to work closely with us to make the Filecoin Network as valuable as they can, for years to come. Hence the discounted price.”
The advisor sale was priced at $0.75 per coin with discounts for extended vesting periods. The ICO opening today starts at $1 per token (also with discounts for extended vesting), and increases by a dollar for every $40M USD raised – with a cap around $6 dollar per token. However FileCoin founder and Protocol Labs CEO Juan Benet explained that the offering’s increasing price feature is designed to “price out” participants, and they don’t expect it to be fully subscribed.
Some were also concerned with the method of ICO distribution – like many previous ICOs, Filecoin was totally first come first serve, meaning that there was a chance of network congestion or unfair price distribution depending on payment confirmation times. In response, Filecoin announced that all investments made in the first hour will be averaged for fairness, with the standard price increase happening for all investments not made in the first hour. After the first hour the price will increase as more investments are made, and that rising price will be visible to investors before they decide to participate.

Notably, Filecoin is hosting its ICO on CoinList – a new platform designed to let groups hold SEC-complaint ICOs. The platform was originally built by Protocol Labs, but AngelList has become involved and CoinList may eventually become a spun-off joint venture between the two companies that hosts future ICOs from other projects.
This will be CoinList’s first ICO, and they’ve worked with lawyers to create a SAFT – or Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, which in itself is a security. Since the network isn’t launching for at least 6 months, investors aren’t actually buying tokens right now – they are just signing a contract to receive them in the future.
While the SEC hasn’t directly ruled on this specific agreement, they did recently say that ICOs have to comply with existing security registration laws, but Filecoin (and of course many expensive lawyers) think that this agreement is totally SEC-compliant.
Plus, only accredited investors ($200,000+ in income or $1M+ in net worth) will be able to participate, which AngelList will vet just like they do for investors trying to join that platform.
So if you’re a regular person that wants a piece of the action, you are going to have to wait until the tokens begin trading on an exchange, or the networks opens so you can add storage space and “mine” tokens that way.
The offering goes live today, and if you want to learn more you can check out FileCoin’s page on CoinList.
The burst of the wearable bubble may have been overstated — on a global scale, at least. The category has been struggling here in the U.S., but internationally, it’s still seeing growth. Wearables are up eight-percent year-over-year, according to new numbers from Canalys — not exactly exponential, but at least things are trending in the right direction. 
It’ll come as no surprise to anyone who’s been following the space with any regularity that Xiaomi is leading the way here. Last week Strategy Analytics noted that the Chinese company had taken charge of global shipments for the first time ever, following Fitbit’s middling financial report, and that assessment is reflected in these numbers.
Canalys’s numbers (which are a bit lower than SA’s) put Xiaomi in first place at 3.5 million shipments, just edging Fitbit’s 3.3 million. What’s more notable than the photo finish however, is Fitbit’s on-going struggles, which find the company dropping a full 34-percent year over year.  It’s an almost complete reversal of last year’s 36-percent year over year growth. Apple’s number also dropped in the report, with company’s smartwatch moving to third place at 2.7 million shipments. 
Price has been the primary factors driving Xiaomi’s growth in recent years. The company sells trackers for as low as $15 here in the States — something Fitbit and Apple can’t come close to competing with. Fitbit’s lowest priced tacker, the clip-on Zip, retails for $60, and Apple essentially only sells a single product in the category. 
Fitbit’s been putting a positive face on all of this, of course. The company anticipates a reversal of fortunes with the upcoming launch of its long-awaited smartwatch. Fitbit’s Apple Watch competitor is the result of multiple high profile acquisitions, including Pebble, Vector and Coin. The company has pumped a lot of time and money into the product, which has reportedly been plagued by numerous delays. 
It’s a strategy that finds Fitbit growing in a premium direction, away from the low end of the market where Xiaomi has found a majority of its success. Though, to be fair, Canalys does anticipate continued global growth in the smartwatch category. The firm expects that upward movement to be fueled by increased availability of cellular enabled devices, like the rumored upcoming Apple Watch. 
Things are not going so well for Blue Apron this morning after reporting its second-quarter earnings (its first earnings report ever), and the stock is crashing as a result of it.
The company’s stock is down more than 14 percent on the earnings report, which came in pretty mixed compared to what Wall Street wanted. Blue Apron is looking to pull back on its marketing spend as it tries to get its burn under control, which resulted in a drop in its number of customers. The company was able to squeeze out a small profit in a past life, but since then it began to aggressively spend on marketing as it sought to acquire customers.
The problem quickly became getting those customers to stick around and keep buying meals. This time around, the company was able to improve the health of its customer base as they are spending more money and buying slightly more meals, but it still has to show that it can grow that base even as it starts to pull back on marketing. The company reported a loss of 47 cents per share on revenue of $238.1 million, while Wall Street was looking for a loss of 30 cents per share on $235.8 million.
Chart time:

So, better than expected revenue but with a widening loss even, as it pares back its marketing expense. The company gave off some negative signals about its next quarter, forecasting a loss between $121 million and $128 million in the second half, according to Business Insider. These comments were likely made on the earnings call, which we’re reviewing right now. But those kinds of negative signals are going to punish a freshly-IPO’d company, especially amid a period of wild uncertainty with the decline of Snap and possible fading appetite for new IPOs.
If Blue Apron sees some turbulence heading into the back half of the year, the persistent threat of Amazon definitely isn’t going to help. Information is slowly dripping out that Amazon is gunning for the meal-kit delivery space, which has crushed the stock over time. The company went public at $10 per share, but has since collapsed and lost nearly half its value.
Still, the IPOs will continue to come. Dropbox is reportedly inching closer to an IPO, and TechCrunch previously reported that Stitch Fix has confidentially filed for an IPO.

Ikea’s smart lighting system has received an update that makes its wireless hub compatible with Apple’s HomeKit, as well as with Amazon Alexa, and Google Home. This means if you have the hub and bulbs, you should be able to control them with your voice using any of those devices, as well as control them in Apple’s iOS Home app.
The update also makes it possible to discover and add Ikea’s bulbs to Philips Hue’s HomeKit-compatible hub, which is perhaps better news for existing Philips Hue users who want to be able to expand their systems with alternate options, 9to5Mac reports. Ikea plans to offer multicolored bulbs starting in October, too.
Hue’s entry-level all white bulbs retail for $15 in the U.S. right now, while Ikea’s are $18, so there’s not actually a cost advantage to being able to buy Ikea’s connected bulbs for your Hue system. Still, it’s another option, and the freedom to mix and match depending on your needs is never a bad thing.
Finding a bra that fits well is hard, but Brayola is looking to make it easier.
The ecommerce platform for bras has raised another $2.5 million in Series A financing, bringing the total A round to $5 million. Investors include The Firstime Fund, Ilan Shiloah, Nir Tralovsky, Jonathan Benartzi, Gett founders Shahar Waiser and Roi More, and Haim Dabah.
The strategy behind Brayola is simple. Through troves of data and a smart algorithm, Brayola lets users submit the bra they love (brand and size) to receive back recommendations on other bras that fit the same way. Founder Orit Hashay says the company has less than 10 percent return rate on bras sold through the platform.
Through traditional platforms, return rates on bras sit around 30 percent, partially because some women don’t know how to find the right fit of their bra, and partially because the rise in online shopping has made it even harder to find the right fit.
Brayola has partnered directly with more than 100 brands, offering over 1 million SKUs.
These integrations allow Brayola to work directly with distribution warehouses so that Brayola bras arrive in Brayola packaging. Plus, partnering with brands allows Brayola to purchase individual bras at wholesale price instead of stocking up on inventory.
Brayola grew rapidly over 2016, hitting a $10 million revenue run rate by the end of the year. If growth keeps up, Hashay expects the company to hit $27 million run rate through this year.
The company has not yet spent much capital on marketing and brand promotion, and a significant portion of this funding will be dedicated to building brand awareness.
There are lots of reasons scammers send a phishing email. They may want to get access to the company network or perhaps a quick payout with ransomware. Maybe it’s just a good old-fashioned con to trick someone into sending money or personally identifiable information, but whatever the reason, everyday countless phishing emails are sent into the world, and some percentage of them are successful, or people wouldn’t bother sending them.
When employees received hundreds of emails a day, how do companies protect themselves from this insidious and all too common threat? One way is by carefully training employees to recognize a scam, not fall for it, and most importantly report it, so the company can remove all such emails from their domains.
That kind of testing has tended to be out of reach for SMBs, who, in spite of the obvious threat, haven’t been able to justify the cost of spending money to provide that training. All of those excuses went away today when PhishMe, a 6.5 year old startup that helps companies protect themselves from phishing scams, announced it was releasing a free phishing testing tool for companies with 500 employees or less.
The new tool called PhishMe Free is a cloud service that’s a subset of their enterprise product, PhishMe Simulator. It doesn’t include all of the tools you’ll find in the pay version of course, but it puts anti-phishing training within reach of any company regardless of size.
The SMB customer simply signs up for the cloud service and PhishMe provides templates that look very similar to recent phishing scams. You can modify it with a company logo to make it look more authentic as you wish, then send it to all your employees, or just a subset. Typically, a company conducts monthly tests to limit the number of checks and risk making people immune to tests (or worse real phishing emails).

So what happens when an employee falls for one of the tests? They receive a gentle admonition, explaining that they just fell for a phishing email, and some brief training on how to recognize phishing scams in the future.
Phishing emails have become increasingly sophisticated, and it’s not always easy to recognize a fake, says Rohyt Belani, co-founder and CEO at PhishMe. He says the goal is to reduce the number of people who fall for these emails, while turning the workforce into a group of live phishing sensors. The hope is that more people report a phishing email when they recognize it and ultimately protect the entire company from similar attacks.
While Belani understands all too well that no solution will ever be completely fool-proof, especially as the people running these scams get increasingly sophisticated in their approaches, the goal is to reduce the risk associated with phishing attacks. The free product lets any company get started with the basics while raising awareness. If they need more, they can upgrade, he says.
PhishMe launched in 2011. It’s raised over $58 million across three rounds, according to Crunchbase.

Uber is starting to roll out a new in-app chat feature globally today, which will allow riders to send text messages directly to their driver once they book a ride, and vice versa. The new feature replaces the somewhat clunky mechanism of SMS for text communication between rider and driver, helping to preserve privacy for both sides in all markets, and cutting down on potential confusion.
Now, when you book a ride, a chat option appears that lets you message your driver directly. It’ll show your driver’s name, vehicle type and plate number at the top of the messaging window, and you can see read/received receipts for messages sent. On the driver side, received messages will be read aloud to help minimize distraction, and drivers can acknowledge a message with one tap to send a ‘thumbs up’ emoji response. Drivers can also initiate chat, but the Uber driver app cautions directly in the messaging window that drivers should only do so when stopped and not actually driving.
The in-app messaging feature arose because the SMS method had a number of areas where it was lacking from a user experience perspective, according to Uber Product Manager Jeremy Lermitte. He explained in an interview that in some markets, there is cost sensitivity associated with using limited SMS plans for getting in touch (and in some cases, drivers don’t have voice plans on their devices at all for calls), and that’s just one among many reasons to bring messaging in-app.
“In many of our markets, SMS isn’t actually available for us, we don’t have the technology in place,” Lermitte said. “That’s especially true in some of our key markets like Brazil and India. And then in other emerging markets where we do offer SMS, we don’t have the technology in place to anonymize the personal contact info, so the rider and driver are actually sharing their personal contact information in some of those markets.”

Besides cost, availability and privacy, Lermitte says Uber also heard that people wanted more visibility into whether or not their messages were actually being received and read by either party. That’s something they could easily offer in-app, to add clarity to the flow of text communication and reassure both parties involved.
“Riders and drivers wanted to understand the status of their message,” he said. “Did my driver read my message? Did the rider receive my message? Now we’re giving that delivered and read status which isn’t always available today with SMS technology.”
Built-in SMS also means that travellers won’t be left unable to communicate with their driver when they don’t have an international plan for roaming. Provided they can connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot, which is pretty much always the case at airports and other travel hubs, they’ll now be able to communicate with their driver.
“The riders really just wanted a consistent experience,” Lermitte noted. “Lots of stories with folks travelling internationally where, let’s say you land in Paris, and you’re in the airport, you don’t have a voice plan or a cellular plan setup, you can now just connect to Wi-Fi and communicate with your driver for the pickup.”
The built-in messaging feature makes a lot of sense when you think about it, and Lermitte says that it’s something Uber can offer without requiring significant ongoing overhead to maintain. He also says that Uber is still putting resources behind building out this new feature, which could expand in the future to cover more areas. While message threads disappear and communication is closed at the end of a ride now, for instance, they’ve heard some feedback that this might be a good way to check for lost items in future. Also, the team has definitely considered VoIP audio calls as another potential candidate for in-app inclusion, and will continue to explore that.
Messaging can also be leveraged for Uber’s other businesses, including UberEATS, and makes a lot of sense there, too, as a future consideration, the company says. In-app communication could be a vector for all kinds of potential business extensions for Uber, too, including connecting riders mid-ride with other businesses and promotions. Regardless, it’s a smart flag to plant, and a great new convenience feature, too.

Interest in blockchains is at an all-time high, but there are still plenty of technical issues to solve, especially for enterprises that want to adopt this technology for smart contracts and other use cases. For them, issues like throughput, latency, governance and confidentiality are still major stumbling blocks for using blockchains. With its new Coco Framework, Microsoft wants to solve these issues and make blockchains more suitable for the enterprise.
In an interview earlier this week, Microsoft’s CTO for Azure (and occasional novelist) Mark Russinovich told me the company is seeing a lot of interest in blockchain technology among its users. They like the general idea of a distributed ledger, but a system that can only handle a handful of transactions a second doesn’t work for them — what they want is a technology that can handle a thousand or more transactions per second.
The Coco Framework solves these fundamental issues with blockchains by introducing a trusted execution environment (TEE). The basic idea here is that you have a trusted box on which you can trust to put your blockchain code. That trust is established through tools like Intel’s Software Guard Extensions or Windows’ Virtual Secure Mode — and because it’s an open framework, it can also support other TEEs as they become available. With these TEEs you can then build a network of trusted enclaves that all agree on the ledger and Coco code they are running (it’s a concept Intel and others have also experimented with in the past).
Once you have these trusted enclaves, all the other pieces fall into place. Because you can trust the updates to the ledger, you don’t need to perform any proof of work, which greatly increases the transaction speed. In a typical ledger, that would take seconds or even minutes. But with the enclaves, that’s not an issue, and Microsoft says Coco and Ethereum can handle up to 1,600 transactions per second in its prototype setup. Thanks to this, the blockchain network — when combined with a protocol like Paxos for ensuring consistency — becomes a usable database.
Enterprises also want to ensure that one of their suppliers can’t see the orders you placed with another supplier. That’s a hard problem to solve when your ledger is public. Coco, however, adds a confidentiality layer on top of a ledger like Ethereum (or any other ledger, because the framework is ledger-agnostic). Enabling this only took some minor addition to the Ethereum protocol in Microsoft’s prototype.
Another feature Coco enables is governance. To explain this, Russinovich used the example of a bank consortium that wants to use a blockchain network. Who gets to add another bank to this network? The Coco governance system allows the members of the consortium to set up rules for voting on decisions like this.
What’s important here is that the Coco Framework will be compatible with any ledger protocol and can run virtually anywhere — in the cloud or on premises, and on any operating system and hypervisor that supports a compatible trusted environment. R3 Corda, the Intel-incubated Hyperledger Sawtooth and J.P. Morgan Quorum will integrate their distributed ledgers with Coco.
“We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to bring blockchain to the enterprise,” said Rick Echevarria, vice president, Software and Services Group and General Manager, Platforms Security Division at Intel, in today’s announcement. “Our mutual customers are excited by the potential of blockchain. Intel is committed to accelerating the value of blockchains powered by Azure on Intel hardware, by improving the scalability, privacy and security of the solutions based on our technologies.”
Don’t get too excited yet, though. It’ll be early 2018 before Microsoft will open source the code for Coco. Russinovich tells me the team is still hardening the code and getting it ready for open sourcing. The company is making a technical whitepaper and demonstrations available today, though.

This week seems to be a good one for media streaming companies in Asia. Hot on the heels of Malaysia-based Iflix raising $133 million for its Netflix-like service for emerging markets, Hong Kong’s PCCW has pulled in $110 million for its range of video and music streaming services.
Hony Capital, which recently backed WeWork’s China business, Foxconn Ventures and Singapore sovereign fund Temasek have taken an 18 percent share in the PCCW International OTT business. PCCW Media, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will retain majority ownership.
The business operates three digital products, video streaming service Viu, short clip service Vuclip and music service MOOV. Viu is available in 15 countries in Asia and the Middle East with 12 million monthly active users. It takes a hybrid model offering both paid subscriptions and ad-supported user options. Vuclip, which was acquired two years ago, differentiates by offering shorter videos in 19 countries across India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
On the music side, PCCW Media has MOOV which is available in Hong Kong. It expanded to Vietnam last year, where the firm sees potential among a young popular with booming 3G data subscriptions.
In an interview with TechCrunch, Janice Lee, PCCW Media managing director, said the business didn’t need to raise capital since it is funded by its parent, but the deal is driven by potential synergies.
“We saw that there are strategic investors we feel we are very complementary [and] playing in different parts of the OTT space. Foxconn is a transforming company [while] Temasek and Hony have [backed] companies that have been successful in the media space,” Lee said.
Foxconn in particular, which is best known as a key Apple manufacturer, could open the door to hardware products in the future, although didn’t elaborate on that in detail.
“It’s a direction where we see cooperation,” she said. “There are definitely commercial synergies to working together.”
Indeed, Foxconn has made a sustained push into internet-of-things and media in recent times. That’s particularly clear with its investments, which have included Chinese dock-less bike rental company Mobike, audio maker Devialet, next-gen display startup DigiLens, Indian chat app Hike and SoftBank’s colossal $100 billion Vision Fund.
PCCW Media has aggressively expanded its video services with a pipeline of market launches over the past year or so, and Lee said that the primary focus now will be getting deeper into its existing markets. There may still be country launches, but adding new content — including the company’s own original productions out of Hong Kong and markets like India and Indonesia — is the immediate priority alongside product development and localization tweaks.
The overall strategy is to take a local approach to content — not unlike Iflix — to gain engagement in individual market. Already though, PCCW Media claims its most engaged users are on its service for upwards of 1.3-1.8 hours per day, consuming more than 15 videos per week.
As for MOOV, PCCW Media has been more measured with its approach with just two active markets.
“We selectively assess where we go next,” Lee explained, since the company believes that, for now in Asia, “video is much more ready for monetization for both advertising and subscriptions.”
Amplitude has raised $30 million to fund what CEO Spenser Skates said is a mission of “helping product people build better products.”
That’s not quite how Amplitude pitched itself initially, which was more about undercutting other analytics companies on price. Skates (pictured above with his co-founder Curtis Liu) said this is less a change in direction for the company than a new articulation of “what we’re good at.”
He added that Amplitude was “afraid to say that in the past,” partly because it was afraid of alienating marketers — a group that Skates is now comfortable insisting Amplitude is not built for. Instead, he said he’s focused on creating analytics tools for product teams.
What’s the difference? Skates said that when marketers look at analytics, they’re basically looking at where visitors are coming from and then how those visitors convert into paying customers: “Each step is a subset of the last step.” The product team, on the other hand, is trying to answer more difficult questions, like how different features affect long-term retention.

“Your users can do anything,” Skates said. “The questions you’re trying to answer are a lot more complex.”
Amplitude says that it has more than 5,000 customers, and in the past 12 months, it’s signed up big new ones including Microsoft, Capital One and Twitter.
In fact, in the funding announcement Microsoft’s Gooi Chungheong said, “Amplitude has saved us months of engineering investments into understanding user behavior in our products.”
The new Series C funding was led by IVP, with existing investors Benchmark Capital and Battery Ventures also participating. IVP’s Somesh Dash will become a board observer.
Amplitude has now raised a total of $59 million.

Amid the ever-present specter of Amazon, Blue Apron reported its second-quarter earnings today — where it showed a mixed performance for Wall Street, but also some small much-needed improvements in certain metrics.
The biggest drag on the company was that it said it was paring back its marketing expenses between the first and second quarter, resulting in a 9% decrease in total customers when comparing the second and first quarter this year. Blue Apron saw its burn rise dramatically in the periods before its IPO as it sought to acquire as much of the market as it could in an increasingly competitive industry, and now it’s had to try to show that it can be something that’s wholly sustainable now that it appears very possible that Amazon will try to go after it.
“In the second quarter, we saw an 18 percent year-over-year increase in net revenue, and a $20.6 million improvement in our net loss between the first and second quarters. We recently strengthened our balance sheet as a result of our initial public offering, convertible note issuance and the expansion of our revolving credit facility,” CEO Matt Salzberg said in the earnings release. “We are beginning a new chapter as a public company, and remain focused on our long-term strategy to build an iconic consumer brand, develop a more diverse product portfolio, and further build out an end-to-end supply chain platform.”
But because of that decrease in its costs, the average amount of revenue that it brought in for each customer — of which there are around 943,000 — rose significantly. Each customer generated $251 in revenue for the company, which was still well below the performance the company was seeing in the second quarter last year. It is still a high in terms of customer value for the year thus far. The average order per customer, too, grew to 4.3 from 4.2 in the first quarter this year. The jump seems very incremental, but every bit of margin is critical for the company. The drop in net customers was due to a planned reduction of marketing of $26.1 million between the first and second quarter, the company said.
Following the report, shares of Blue Apron briefly jumped, though it looks like things have once again leveled out as Wall Street continues to temper its expectations for the company. The company brought in $238.1 million in revenue with a loss of 47 cents per share. It was a mixed result for Wall Street, which was looking for a loss of 30 cents per share on revenue of $235.8 million.
All of this is, once again, with respect to Amazon’s looming threat to its existence. Since the company filed to go public, evidence of Amazon’s plan to go after the meal-kit delivery space has trickled out slowly and has put significant pressure on Blue Apron. Its stock price has cratered from where it was when it first started the IPO process — during the middle of which Amazon announced that it would purchase Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Since then, it’s been a drip-drip-drip of bad signals for Blue Apron, from registered trademarks to test launches.
And for good reason: Blue Apron, over the span of just a few years, exposed a market that’s worth at least $800 million, and Amazon is known to simply bulldoze its way into new markets that Jeff Bezos thinks are interesting and have potential. Since then, Blue Apron’s shares have done very poorly — down more than 30% since going public (and even worse when you consider where it originally priced).

A young startup in India wants to makes autonomous driving technology more widely available for truck operators, especially those outside of the U.S., by lower the cost significantly.
The concept of self-driving trucks sat in the background for some time as the vision of autonomous cars ferrying consumers from A to B hogged the limelight, but the potential for trucking is at least on par if not higher — particularly on a global level. Beyond potential safety gains, integrating elements of autonomous car tech can help boost efficiency, too.
Thus far the technology has been pioneered in Silicon Valley, where giants like Uber and Google are working on bringing the tech into trucks — via their Otto (now Uber ATG) and Waymo business units, respectively — while Tesla is preparing to enter to foray. All these solutions require expensive kit that isn’t deployable on all vehicles. That combination means it is likely to be out of reach for most of the world’s trucking community once it is finally available on a commercial basis.
That’s where Flux Auto, a 16-person startup based in Bangalore, hopes to make a difference by democratizing autonomous systems. It is developing technology that, when finished, could enable any kind of truck to be retrofitted with self-driving car technology at a far lower price.
To make its tech accessible, Flux Auto has had to make a compromise. It doesn’t use Lidar — Light Detection and Ranging — sensors which have become the standard for autonomous vehicles, but are incredible expensive. Waymo CEO John Krafcik recently revealed a Lidar would cost $75,000 a few years ago, but these days he claims it is just 10 percent of that price. Even still, at $7,500 it remains prohibitively costly for many truck operates — and that’s just one component.
“While the competition is focusing on LIDAR technology which is very expensive and processing heavy (due to a lot of unneeded data), our vision algorithms can be used with any cheap cameras and has a much quicker response time. This drives down our cost and in turn, the cost for the customer as well, all while having similar levels of accuracy as a LIDAR system,” Flux Auto founder Pranav Manpuria explained to TechCrunch.

Uber ATG’s trucks use a Lidar mounted above the cab
Flux Auto is looking at a product that would retail for around $3,000-$4,500, the price range would be dependent on the level of features a customer wants.
The system is being developed to handle cruise control, lane keeping and collision avoidance. Like Uber AG and Waymo, the idea is to take the strain off of drivers and help make journeys more efficient.
“We’re using cameras along with other sensors — sonar, radar, ultrasonic, etc — to understand everything that’s happening around the vehicle, and make decisions based on that,” Manpuria said. “We’re developing our entire tech stack as an after market accessory. This allows us to target the massive market of already existing commercial vehicles.”

Flux Auto’s Lidar-less test truck
Manpuria, who graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology and previously ran a payment startup, said the company is looking to raise around $1.5 million to fulfill its goal of deploying its systems on trucks in a range of markets beyond India. Initially it began testing on cars, but it has just equipped its first truck (see above) for the next stage of testing before the end of this month.
Money from investors will go towards expanding the team and developing its technology. Flux Auto is aiming to deploy its tech on 2,500 vehicles within the next twelve months. That’s likely to necessitate a U.S. office, and Manpuria said the business may need to migrate to the U.S. to continue its development in the future. That’s particularly true if India bans autonomous cars, as its transport minister has threatened.
“I’ve been very interested in self-driving and it’s benefits for a while now. However, working on a self driving car didn’t seem appealing since car owners would be reluctant to spend a few thousand dollars on technology where the benefits to them aren’t that obvious,” he said.
“Where this technology makes the most sense, and can have the biggest impact is the trucking industry — and the benefits we provide with our technology are worth an investment into it by truck owners,” said Manpuria.

Computer vision continues to find its way into all sorts of apps as the underlying tech powering convenience-oriented image searches. Latest — and it must be said late — to the party is fashion ecommerce player Asos, which has just added a visual search feature to its iOS app.
The update lets iOS users snap a photo of a garment or fashion accessory with their device camera or pull in an existing outfit shot or Instagram screengrab (say) from their camera roll and have the app show clothes items that are at least in the general fashion ballpark of whatever it is they’re trying to find.
Asos says the visual search will be rolled out to their Android app “soon”.
The company says 80 per cent of UK traffic for ASOS comes from a mobile device, as do almost 70 per cent of UK orders — with consumers spending 80 minutes per month on average in the app.
We tested the feature on a few items of clothing and it worked reasonably well. It’s not necessarily going to find a perfect match — not least because there are only 85,000 searchable products in Asos’ index — but when not matching quite right for form, it was at least pulling in similar sorts of patterns. So you end up with the same sort of fashion feel at least.
Given the specific ecommerce use-case here, where Asos’ aim is to drive sales of its stock by greasing the clothes discovery pipeline (being as text searches are pretty tedious, especially so on smaller screen devices), you’d expect a bit of wiggle room in the search results — exactly to encourage a bit of serendipity in the shopping experience.
The UK-based company is a long-time player in the ecommerce space, having launched on the web in 2000 — so it’s by no means pioneering visual search tech here (nor is it building the underlying tech itself, but says it’s partnered with an unnamed startup to deliver the visual search).
Over the last five (or so) years there have been a large number of startups attempting to build fast and convenient visual search engines, often specifically for fashion, including the likes of ASAP54, Craves, Donde Fashion, Slyce and Snap Fashion, to name a few.
Tech platforms have also recently started paying more attention to visual search too, spying potential to combine the vast quantity of visual data they hold with recent developments in deep learning/AI technology that is helping realize the potential of computer vision.
For example, Pinterest has launched a camera-based search feature that turns a real-world object (e.g. an avocado) into a series of Pinterest results (e.g. recipes for avocado). eBay also has its own ecommerce-focused image search in the works, due for launch this fall.
While at its developer conference earlier this year, Google announced Google Lens — demonstrating how it intends to bake awareness into mobile cameras, by applying computer vision smarts so the software will be able to understand what the lens is being pointed at.
SoftBank missed out on getting a piece of Flipkart when its deal to acquire Snapdeal, the e-commerce firm which SoftBank backed in 2015, fell apart last month, but the Japanese tech giant has finally gotten there.
 Flipkart today confirmed that SoftBank has invested in its business, via its $100 billion Vision Fund, as part of an extension to the $1.4 billion financing round which was announced in April.
The Vision Fund is buying a mix of primary and secondary sales, but the size of the investment is not disclosed. All that both sides said is that the deal is the largest private investment in an India-based tech company, and that it makes the Vision Fund “one of the largest shareholders in Flipkart.”
Citing sources, India’s Economic Times reported that the deal is around the $2.5 billion mark. SoftBank and Flipkart both declined to comment.
Flipkart did say that the fresh injection leaves it with over $4 billion on its balance sheet. That’s a pretty handy arsenal for battling Amazon’s India unit, which CEO Jeff Bezos has committed to continuing to fund after already injecting some $5 billion to date. This extension also adds SoftBank, a major global influencer, to the already-stellar names of Microsoft, Tencent and eBay which participated in Flipkart’s April funding round.
That deal was a record Indian investment at the time, so SoftBank is spending at least $1.5 billion this time around. It could well be more — much more. Bloomberg reported at the end of July that the two sides were in talks over a potential $2 billion investment and now Economic Times is saying it is higher still.
“India is a land of vast opportunity. We want to support innovative companies that are clear winners in India because they are best positioned to leverage technology and help people lead better lives. As the pioneers in Indian e-commerce, Flipkart is doing that every day,” SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement.

— binnybansal (@binnybansal) August 10, 2017



Beyond press speculation, a deal seemed on the cards when Son admitted his interest in Flipkart at an investor meeting this week. He also went public with his intention to invest in Uber — another much-rumored deal — although he also admitted that SoftBank is studying a potential deal with Uber’s U.S. rival Lyft.
The Vision Fund announced an initial $93 billion close in May, but SoftBank is targeting a total close of $100 billion. The fund includes Apple, Qualcomm, UAE-based Mubadala Investment Company, Saudi Arabia’s PID public fund, Foxconn, and Foxconn-owned Sharp among its LP base. Early deals include ARM, Nvidia, Roivant Sciences, Improbable, Brain Corp, Plenty, SoFi and Guardant Health.
There are so many, we actually made a gallery.
One area the fund is not investing in ride-sharing companies. That’s been left to SoftBank itself, which owns stakes in Didi Chuxing (China), Ola (India), Grab (Southeast Asia) and 99 (Latin America).

Glint, a stealthy London fintech startup that promises a new “global currency,” has raised £3.1 million from a plethora of individual backers in the financial services and asset management space, alongside early-stage investor Bray Capital.
They comprise Haruko Fukuda, former CEO of the World Gold Council and NED of Investec Bank; Oliver Bolitho, formerly Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Asia; Hugh Sloane, co-founder of asset manager Sloane Robinson; and Lord Flight Of Worcester, formerly of Guinness Flight Global Asset Management.
The Glint website describes the startup as “a new global currency, account and app” and says it will make your money “reliable and independent” and give you more control in the way you “store, spend, exchange and transfer money”. If that all sounds a bit vague —
aside from alluding to a new (and more) stable currency tied to a payments app — it’s probably intended to be. The company isn’t pegged to launch until the last quarter of this year.
However, I understand that Glint will offer a frictionless way to both store and spend your money in gold, including at the point of sale, just like a regular local currency. The bigger picture is that gold historically has been a better storage of value than any government-created currency, and therefore — with the aid of technology — is (arguably) a good candidate for an alternative global currency. The startup has already been authorised and is regulated by the U.K.’s FCA, under, presumably, an Electronic Money Institution license.
Meanwhile, Glint’s founders both know a thing or two about gold.
CEO Jason Cozens co-founded GoldMadeSimple.com, a website that helps clients buy and sell physical gold and have it stored securely or delivered. He also previously founded two other companies: Visuality — where he is said to have pioneered Virtual Reality, e-commerce and online marketing, selling to ERP software company McGuffie Brunton — and Bite, a digital marketing agency.
Glint COO Ben Davies is said to have over 17 years’ experience within international financial and commodity markets. He was the former head of trading at RBS Greenwich, and co-founded Hinde Capital in 2007, an alternative investment management company specialising in precious metals.
500 Startups continues to feel the impact of a sexual harassment scandal involving its co-founder and former managing partner Dave McClure. Two weeks after the closure of its Canada-based fund, its maiden venture in Australia is getting the chop before it even began.
The U.S. firm doesn’t have a dedicated fund in Australia, but it did announce an accelerator program — 500 Melbourne — in May in partnership with LaunchVic, a $60 million entrepreneurship scheme backed by the government of Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state. Now, however, LaunchVic has terminated its partnership with the VC firm.
The relationship had certainly gotten tense over the past month, since McClure resigned from 500 Startups in early July after a number of women came forward with sexual harassment allegations against him. LaunchVic put the firm “on notice” last month after it was kept in the dark over the claims against McClure, who had traveled to Australia to front the launch of 500 Melbourne despite the fact that he had taken a back seat at the firm following an internal investigation into the claims.
LaunchVic said it wanted to see a “change in culture” at the firm if the project was to go ahead, but the final straw seems to have been the resignation of 500 Melbourne head Rachael Neumann. Neumann quit the firm because she believes that “this is simply not the right time for 500 to launch in Australia.”
She explained on Twitter that she had traveled to the U.S. to meet with 500 Startups’ leadership over its Australia plan, but following discussions made a decision to leave.

“While I am deeply disappointed at how this has ended, I feel confident in LaunchVic’s strong course of action over the past month to give 500 Startups an opportunity to show leadership to improve culture in the startup sector and fix the issues at hand,” LaunchVic CEO Dr Kate Cornick said in a statement.
“Unfortunately, as we’ve expressed to 500 Startups, that without Rachael Neumann at the
helm we don’t believe it will work,” Dr Cornick added.
“500 strongly believes in the future of the Australian tech sector, but now is not the right time to move forward with this new partnership. We look forward to future opportunities down the road,” a spokesperson for 500 Startups said via email.
The dissolving of the partnership won’t impact LaunchVic’s overall budget. A representative of the organization clarified to TechCrunch that the grant of over $2 million that it originally pledged to 500 Melbourne will not be allocated to the project or 500 Startups itself.
LaunchVic will instead use the grant to develop a different accelerator project that maintains links to the global and local startup community.
GM’s Maven car sharing company is expanding its Gig service across the U.S., with six new major urban markets to be added to the locations where the short-term rental service aimed at gig economy workers is available. Those include L.A., where it’s going live today, as well as Boston, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C. this fall, with Baltimore and Detroit to be added some time after that.
Maven Gig offers cars from its fleet of GM vehicles on a weekly basis, with no longer-term commitments required. Gig rolls in insurance (minus the deductible), unlimited miles and regular maintenance for one flat weekly fee, which start at $180 per week plus tax for vehicles like the Chevrolet Cruze.
The idea is that the freelance driving economy, including ride hailing as well as activities like grocery and package delivery, all require people to have readily available vehicles. Gig economy workers are often occasional, however, and work when they need to boost their spending but not necessarily on a consistent basis that would be best served by them owning their own vehicle.
The new expansion also brings in a new official partner, HopSkipDrive, which is a ride sharing service designed for getting kids around town with additional screening processes for drivers and real-time monitoring. Other official partners including GrubHub, Instacart, Roadie and more, though Gig can be used for any freelance workers looking for a vehicle on a limited term basis.
Maven says Gig drivers have already driven over 170 million miles since the service began in 2016, with the Bolt EV (Gig’s most popular rental option) having driven 1.4 million all-electric miles in California since February, 2017. Maven says Gig drivers average 30 percent more miles per day than those using traditional engine vehicles.
Apple Music aficionados are already acquainted with an aggravating attribute of the app: when you plug your iPhone into your car, it automatically plays the first song in alphabetical order from your library. This gets old pretty quickly, but instead of deleting that song from your music (and then gradually going down the list like Arya Stark), you can now download a new track called “A a a a a Very Good Song” by Samir Mezrahi. It features 9 minutes 58 seconds of delectable silence, enough time to start driving and figure out what you actually want to listen to.

hey I released a blank song that will play 1st so that *one* song won’t play every time u plug ur phone into ur car https://t.co/FL83YUOOcz
— #1 samir (@samir) August 9, 2017

Mezrahi, who’s been in charge of social media strategy at BuzzFeed and The Dodo, now runs Kale Salad, a Twitter account that finds and shares original tweets and photos stolen by meme accounts. While at BuzzFeed, Mezrahi wrote about his own run-in with Apple Music’s automobile auto-playing quirk, which auditorially ambushed him with “A-Team” by Vampire Weekend every time he plugged his iPhone into his car. His article was posted back in May 2016, so even though this issue is relatively minor in the scheme of recent developments like the threat of nuclear war, it’s been preventing Apple Music users from living their best life for quite a while.
There are different (irritatingly complicated) things you can try to turn off the feature, but in the meantime, you can save your sanity and help Mezrahi realize his childhood dream at the same time:

It’s my dream ever since I was a little boy in 1987 to trend on iTunes and have the number one song, please help me make that happen. https://t.co/23SlQgbaAC

In a mind-boggling world first, a team of biologists and security researchers have successfully infected a computer with a malicious program coded into a strand of DNA.
It sounds like science fiction, but I assure you it’s quite real — although you probably don’t have to worry about this particular threat vector any time soon. That said, the possibilities suggested by this project are equally fascinating and terrifying to contemplate.
The multidisciplinary team at the University of Washington isn’t out to make outlandish headlines, although it’s certainly done that. They were concerned that the security infrastructure around DNA transcription and analysis was inadequate, having found elementary vulnerabilities in open-source software used in labs around the world. Given the nature of the data usually being handled, this could be a serious problem going forward.
Sure, they could demonstrate the weakness of the systems with the usual malware and remote access tools. That’s how any competent attacker would come at such a system. But the discriminating security professional prefers to stay ahead of the game.
“One of the big things we try to do in the computer security community is to avoid a situation where we say, ‘Oh shoot, adversaries are here and knocking on our door and we’re not prepared,'” said professor Tadayoshi Kohno, who has a history of pursuing unusual attack vectors for embedded and niche electronics like pacemakers.
From left, Lee Organick, Karl Koscher, and Peter Ney from the UW’s Molecular Information Systems Lab and the Security and Privacy Research Lab prepare the DNA exploit for sequencing
“As these molecular and electronic worlds get closer together, there are potential interactions that we haven’t really had to contemplate before,” added Luis Ceze, one co-author of the study.
Accordingly, they made the leap plenty of sci-fi writers have made in the past, and that we are currently exploring via tools like CRISPR: DNA is basically life’s file system. The analysis programs are reading a DNA strand’s bases (cytosine, thymine etc, the A, T, G, and C we all know) and turning them into binary data. Suppose those nucleotides were encoding binary data in the first place? After all, it’s been done before — right down the hall.
Here comes the mad science
Here’s how they did it. All you really need to know about the transcription application is that it reads the raw data coming from the transcription process and sorts through it, looking for patterns and converting the base sequences it finds into binary code.
“The conversion from ASCII As, Ts, Gs, and Cs into a stream of bits is done in a fixed-size buffer that assumes a reasonable maximum read length,” explained co-author Karl Koscher in response to my requests for more technical information.
That makes it ripe for a basic buffer overflow attack in which programs execute arbitrary code because it falls outside expected parameters. (They cheated a little by introducing a particular vulnerability into the software themselves, but they also point out that similar ones are present elsewhere, just not as conveniently for purposes of demonstration.)
After developing a way to include executable code in the base sequence, they set about making the exploit itself. Ironically, it’s inaccurate to call it a virus, although it’s closer to a “real” virus than perhaps any malicious code ever written.
“The exploit was 176 bases long,” Koscher wrote. “The compression program translates each base into two bits, which are packed together, resulting in a 44 byte exploit when translated.”
Given that there are 4 bases, it would make sense to have each represent a binary pair. Koscher confirmed this was the case. (If you’re curious, as I was: A=00, C=01, G=10, T=11.)
“Most of these bytes are used to encode an ASCII shell command,” he continued. “Four bytes are used to make the conversion function return to the system() function in the C standard library, which executes shell commands, and four more bytes were used to tell system() where the command is in memory.”

Essentially the code in the DNA escapes the program as soon as it is converted from ACGTs to 00011011s, and executes some commands in the system — a sufficient demonstration of the existence of the threat vector. And there’s plenty of room for more code if you wanted to do more than break out of the app.
At 176 bases, the DNA strand comprising the exploit is “by almost any biological standard, very small,” said Lee Organick, a research scientist who worked on the project.
Biopunk future confirmed
In pursuance of every science journalist’s prime directive, which is to take interesting news and turn it into an existential threat to humanity, I had more questions for the team.
“CONCEIVABLY,” I asked, in all caps to emphasize that we were entering speculative territory, “could such a payload be delivered via, for example, a doctored blood sample or even directly from a person’s body? One can imagine a person whose DNA is essentially deadly to poorly secured computers.”
Irresponsibly, Organick stoked the fires of my fearmongering.
“A doctored biological sample could indeed be used as a vector for malicious DNA to get processed downstream after sequencing and be executed,” she wrote.
“However, getting the malicious DNA strand from a doctored sample into the sequencer is very difficult with many technical challenges,” he continued. “Even if you were successfully able to get it into the sequencer for sequencing, it might not be in any usable shape (it might be too fragmented to be read usefully, for example).”
It’s not quite the biopunk apocalypse I envisioned, but the researchers do want people thinking along these lines at least as potential avenues of attack.
“We do want scientists thinking about this so they can hold the DNA analysis software they write to the appropriate security standards so that this never makes sense to become a potential attack vector in the first place,” said Organick.
“I would treat any input as untrusted and potentially able to compromise these applications,” added Koscher. “It would be wise to run these applications with some sort of isolation (in containers, VMs, etc.) to contain the damage an exploit could do. Many of these applications are also run as publicly-available cloud services, and I would make isolating these instances a high priority.”
The likelihood of an attack like this actually being pulled off is minuscule, but it’s a symbolic milestone in the increasing overlap between the digital and the biological.
The researchers will present their findings and process (PDF) next week at the USENIX Security conference in Vancouver.

Nextdoor, the social media platform for neighborhoods, is rolling out a real estate listings feature, showcasing housing for sale in local communities.
The idea is to formalize behavior that’s been happening organically, suggests CEO Nirav Tolia. “These real estate conversations are already happening,” he said, so Nextdoor wanted to devote a section to it.  
The feature isn’t just for those looking to buy homes. It also aims to help users assess the changing real estate prices in their respective communities. “People spend the majority of their net worth on their homes, and they want to know how those home values are doing over time.”
It will also bring in revenue for the billion-dollar company, with real estate agents sponsoring the section. Tolia called it Nextdoor’s second major monetization effort, saying that this will help it add new streams beyond in-feed advertising.
People use Nextdoor as a forum for everything from local events to crime. Users need to verify their address before joining.
Tolia wouldn’t share user numbers, but says he expects that at least 50 percent of the households in the San Francisco Bay Area will be using the platform by the end of the year. He says the demographic is 60 percent female, with $100,000 or more in household income.
Tolia says that Nextdoor expects to be in 85 percent of U.S. neighborhoods by the end of the year. It is also available in Germany and wants to expand into India, Japan and Brazil.
The company has raised more than $200 million in funding from firms like Benchmark, Greylock and Kleiner Perkins over the past five years but is not ready to go public in the near future. Tolia says he wants to build a “standalone independent company” but says there is “no timeline for an IPO.”

When AWS today became a full-fledged member of the container standards body, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, it represented a significant milestone. By joining Google, IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat and just about every company that matters in the space, AWS has acknowledged that when it comes to container management, standards matter.
AWS has been known to go the proprietary route, after all. When you’re that big and powerful, and control vast swaths of market share as AWS does, you can afford to go your own way from time to time. Containers is an area it hasn’t controlled, though. That belongs to Kubernetes, the open source container management tool originally developed inside Google.
AWS was smart enough to recognize that Kubernetes is becoming an industry standard in itself, and that when it comes to build versus buy versus going open source, AWS wisely recognized that battle has been fought and won.
Once it recognized Google’s dominance in container management, the next logical step was to join the CNCF and adhere to the same container standards the entire industry is using. Sometimes it’s better to switch than fight, and this was clearly one of those times.
What we have now is a clearer path to containerization, a technology that is all the rage inside large companies — for many good reasons. They allow you to break down the application into discrete manageable chunks, making updates a heck of a lot easier, and clearly dividing developer tasks and operations tasks in a DevOps model.
Standards provide a common basis for managing containers. Everyone can build their own tools on top of them. Google already has when it built Kubernetes, Red Hat has OpenShift, Microsoft makes Azure Container Service — and so forth and so on.
Companies like standards because they know the technology is going to work a certain way, regardless of who built it. Each vendor provides a similar set of basic services, then differentiates itself based on what it builds on top.
Technology tends to take off once a standard is agreed upon by the majority of the industry. Look at the World Wide Web. It has taken off because there is a standard way of building web sites. When companies agree to the building blocks, everything else seems to fall into place.
A lack of standards has traditionally held back technology. Having common building blocks just make sense. Sometimes a clear market leader doesn’t always agree. Today AWS showed why it matters, even to them.

Facebook has a new home for original video content produced exclusively for it by partners, who will earn 55 percent of ad break revenue while Facebook keeps 45 percent. The “Watch” tab and several dozen original shows will start rolling out  to a small group of U.S. users tomorrow on mobile, desktop and Facebook’s TV apps.
By hosting original programming, Facebook could boost ad revenue and give people a reason to frequently return to the News Feed for content they can’t get anywhere else.
Watch features personalized recommendations of live and recorded shows to watch, plus categories like “Most Talked About,” “What’s Making People Laugh” and “Shows Your Friends Are Watching.” Publishers can also share their shows to the News Feed to help people discover them. A Watchlist feature lets you subscribe to updates on new episodes of your favorite shows. Fans can connect with each other and creators through a new feature that links shows to Groups.

Facebook says it plans to roll out access to Watch to more users and more content creators soon, starting with the rest of the U.S. before expanding internationally. Users with access will see a TV-shaped Watch button in the bottom navigation bar of Facebook’s main app that opens the new video hub.
Facebook admits that “we’ve also funded some shows” as examples, but notes that these are only a small percentage of all the available shows. “We want any publisher/creator who is interested to be able to create a show in the future,” a Facebook spokesperson tells me. “So there will be hundreds of shows at launch, and we’ll hopefully scale to thousands.”
Business Insider reported some leaked details about the redesign earlier today, but pegged the launch of original programming as starting August 28th, when the shows actually will begin to roll out tomorrow.

What Facebook’s First Shows Look Like
Facebook’s shows will run the gamut from live event coverage to reality TV to scripted programs.  “More and more people are coming to Facebook in order to watch video” Facebook’s director of video product Daniel Danker tells me. “When they come with that in mind, we want to make a place for them where they can find that video, connect with the creators and publishers they love, and know they won’t miss out if there’s a new episode from one of those creators.”
Here’s a list of some of the original programming that will be available on Watch:


Tastemade’s Kitchen Little – This cooking show sees kids watch a how-to recipe video, then instruct a pro chef how to make the dish with comedic results

Major League Baseball – The MLB will broadcast one game a week live on Facebook

Major League Baseball “12:25 Live” –  A comedic look at baseball with help from the fans

Mike Rowe – Rowe finds people who’ve done great things for their community and gives them a special experience in return

Nas Daily – Vlogger Nas (Correction: Not the rapper) makes videos with his biggest friends each day

Gabby Bernstein – Motivational speaker and author answers fans’ life questions in live and recorded segments

A&E’s “Bae or Bail:” – Reality TV game show where couples face their fears and see who runs

All Def Digital’s “Inside the Office” – A look inside the office life at Russel Simmons’ hip-hop media empire

Billboard’s “How it Went Down” – A documentary series of musicians sharing crazy stories

David Lopez’s “My Social Media Life”  – A reality show about the social media star’s life

Golden State Warriors’ “Championship Rewind”  – A behind-the-scenes look at the Bay Area’s NBA championship 2016-2017 season

Univision Deportes’ “Liga MX” – Live coverage of LigaMX soccer matches

National Geographic’s “We’re Wired that Way:” – Mini-documentaries about weird quirks of humanity like songs you can’t get out of your head

Nat Geo WILD’s “Safari Live” – Watch live safaris led by National Geographic’s guides

NASA’s “Science @ NASA” – Explore science topics in quick four to five-minute episodes

NBA’s “WNBA All-Access” – A behind the scenes show with women’s basketball stars

The Dodo’s “Comeback Kids: Animal Edition” features determined animals facing difficult conditions or challenges meet people who refuse to give up on them.

Tommy Mac – A master woodworker gives live tutorials on how to make furniture

What’s clearly absent is the type of longer-form scripted dramas and comedies people are used to watching on television. Instead, there are plenty of mini-documentaries, reality shows, and sports coverage.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg writes that “We believe it’s possible to rethink a lot of experiences through the lens of building community — including watching video. Watching a show doesn’t have to be passive . . . You’ll be able to chat and connect with people during an episode, and join groups with people who like the same shows afterwards to build community.”
When you open Watch, you’ll be able to scroll through a long list of categories of shows to view. Alternatively, you can either swipe over or arrive from a notification about a new episode to view the Watchlist of all the lastest shows released by creators you follow. Once you’ve opened an episode you’ll see all the details about it, with one tab for joining a live comment reel with other viewers, and an “Up Next” tab displaying what you’ll view after the current episode if you prefer a glazed-eyes lean-back experience.
There’s no specific content restrictions on swearing or violence beyond Facebook’s existing community standards, but Facebook will monitor for shows that get flagged.
Publishers can choose to insert ad breaks if they want to earn money off their shows, though the guidelines on where and how long they can be are still being finalized. If publishers want to give away their content, they don’t have to show ads. Another option is to do product placed or branded content, in which case the creator has to tag the sponsor paying them for transparency. Shows will have their own dedicated Facebook Pages, and creators can set up special show Groups where fans can ask questions and geek out together.
Beyond the Watch tab, you can also discover shows through the News Feed if a publisher you follow posts an episode or friends are talking about it. That gives Facebook the opportunity to artificially boost the presence of shows in News Feed to build a bigger audience for the new content initiative.
Evolving From Spontaneous To Deliberate Viewing
Facebook first launched its dedicated video tab in April 2016, but it only hosted the more generic News Feed videos people were already seeing from Pages and friends. Now Facebook is in the business of funding original content, initially through direct payments, though it seeks to switch entirely to a revenue-share model in the future to make its original programming effort sustainable.
Facebook’s competitors like YouTube and Snapchat have already experimented with creating original video content. YouTube Red funds several original series, giving bigger production budgets to some of its biggest stars. Snapchat has tried making its own shows in-house, but now focuses on signing deals with partners like TV studios to get fresh, vertical video content into its Discover section.
Facebook’s benefit is that Watch is cross-platform, allowing people to view videos from all their devices, while also being a daily destination for 1.32 billion users. It’s already become a powerhouse in serendipitous video discovery via the News Feed, and Watch will surely provide enough suggestions to get people hooked on shows they weren’t expecting.
But through premium original programming, Facebook is also trying to become a home for deliberate video consumption where people come to view a specific show. While there are already plenty of reasons to visit Facebook, original shows give people a reason to spend longer staring at their screens. If it can drive enough viewers to these shows thanks to its 2 billion total users, Facebook could offer significant revenue-share payouts, attracting better and better content creators.
Facebook’s been trying to eat the whole internet for years now. With Watch and these shows, it’s breaking out of the web to challenge traditional television, which is seeing viewership slide. As ad spends follow eyeballs from TV to the web, Watch could give Facebook a way to net more attention and dollars.
Subscription streaming service Seeso will be shutting down later this year. The NBCUniversal-owned service made the announcement today on Facebook.
It was revealed earlier that several Seeso originals, including HarmonQuest and My Brother My Brother and Me, will be moving to Vrv, a gamer- and geek-focused streaming video service from digital media company Ellation. (Ellation PR would like me to remind you that HarmonQuest season 2 will premiere on Sept. 15.)
Seeso hasn’t been around for very long — it launched at the beginning of 2016, offering a mix of originals and classic comedies like Monty Python and Saturday Night Live, all ad-free for a subscription price of $3.99 per month.
That’s a lot cheaper than many other streaming video subscriptions, but perhaps the niche was just too small, particularly when viewers can get plenty of comedy on Netflix and other services. Back in June, Deadline revealed that the team had had layoffs and that NBCUniversal was reassessing the business model.
“Though we will be departing, much of our comedy will live on,” the company said today, hinting at future announcements about Seeso programs finding a new home.
Tesla is working on self-driving technology specifically tied to its forthcoming electric semi-truck plans, according to a Reuters report. The tech would allow the transport trucks to move in convoy formation with a lead vehicle providing guidance for autonomous follow trucks, according to emails discovered by Reuters in which Tesla discusses the work with the Nevada DMV.
Tesla is also set to meet with the California DMV to discuss autonomous trucking technology, according to comments made by that organization to Reuters. Tesla has already confirmed that it is working on an all-electric semi truck, set to be revealed in more detail at a planned event teased by Elon Musk to take place in September.
This is relatively familiar territory for any company making serious investment in self-driving tech: Uber acquired Otto, a company founded by former Google self-driving car team members dedicated to autonomous trucking, and it continues that work under its Advanced Technologies Group. Waymo, the Alphabet company created from the Google self-driving car project, has also recently revealed that it also is in the early stages of creating autonomous truck tech.
While neither Tesla nor Elon Musk has mentioned autonomy in relation to their electric transport truck plans, the automaker’s CEO has discussed potential surprises to be revealed alongside the big rig this fall. It’s also been working a lot on Autopilot improvements, something Musk said during his most recent Tesla earnings call that he himself spends a lot of time on.
Platooning could mean that the autonomy requirements aren’t much more technically advanced that those found in current Autopilot systems for consumer Tesla vehicles. A lead vehicle with a human driver could be used, with autonomous follow vehicles that cut down on the total need for drivers and increase overall efficiency.
Tesla reportedly wanted to meet with Nevada to discuss the testing of two prototype trucks, so it sounds like the project is quite far along. The automaker hasn’t yet applied for a license to test the vehicles, however, so that could be coming later, once the trucks themselves are a known quantity revealed to the public.

Like many large corporations, SoftBank invests its cash across a broad portfolio of asset classes. It also invests some of its substantial capital reserves in earlier-stage technology companies. So where does that cash go, and how is it doled out to startups across the globe?
SoftBank is not your typical CVC setup
In most cases, corporate venture capital funds (CVCs) are named after their corporate parents. True to the parental metaphor, most of these CVCs receive an ongoing allowance from their corporate sponsors, with no outside money joining the capital pool. Accordingly, it’s often thought that CVCs are beholden only to the corporation and its strategic initiatives.
This is not necessarily the case with SoftBank’s investment arm. Although SoftBank does invest its own money in startups, and it has been doing so since 1995 under the aegis of SoftBank Capital, a new fund raised by the company’s founder and CEO, Masayoshi Son, blurs the traditional CVC model.
According to research done by the Financial Times, Softbank’s new fund, called the “Vision Fund,” has raised quite a bit of money from partners, including:

$45 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.
$15 billion from Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company.

$1 billion from Apple.

$1 billion from Sharp.
$3 billion from Qualcomm, Foxconn and Oracle founder Larry Ellison’s family office.
$28 billion of SoftBank’s own capital.

According to June 2017 SEC filings, that’s some $93 billion in total. That leaves $7 billion to go to meet a publicly stated target fund size of $100 billion by November 2017, six months after the initial close. Crunchbase News has learned that the fund is intended to be deployed over five years, with anywhere between seven and nine years to mature before distributing assets back to investors.
This mixing of assets from multiple partners — both strategic and not — combined with an unorthodox leveraged financial structure and a decision-making framework that makes Masayoshi Son the final arbiter of deals, to say nothing of the sheer scale of the fund, is unusual.
From an outside perspective, it seems like Son has made a kind of Faustian bargain. SoftBank has partnered with some of the world’s most influential investors in the interest of furthering his 300-year plan to build the largest company on the planet. In doing so, SoftBank runs the very real risk of overwhelming markets for late-stage venture capital, private equity and post-IPO equity deals, which already have a lot of cash chasing relatively few opportunities.
In the following sections, we’ll compare SoftBank’s investing style to other CVC groups, chart the growth of its venture capital and private equity investments over time and discuss some of the challenges SoftBank’s Vision Fund may face over its 12-year cycle.
Even with a unique CVC structure, SoftBank doesn’t break the mold
As mentioned earlier, SoftBank began its corporate venture capital practice — SoftBank Capital — in 1995. It quickly found success with early investments in Yahoo, Alibaba and Huffington Post, among other notable deals.
For a 20-year run between 1995 and 2015, when SoftBank’s then newly appointed president Nikesh Arora made the decision to start winding down SoftBank Capital, SoftBank Capital was one of the top CVC shops around.
Even over the last five years, including the two years where SoftBank Capital was on its way out, the company’s early-stage investing style didn’t meaningfully deviate from other CVCs at leading technology companies. Based on Crunchbase data for 1,200 deals made by SoftBank and four of the other most active corporate venture groups backed by big tech conglomerates, we can see that SoftBank ranks among the most active CVCs.

In terms of the rounds that have been publicly surfaced, we can see that SoftBank may not have been the most active CVC. Regardless, it’s in the top 2 percent of corporate investors by VC, private equity, venture debt and post-IPO financing activity overall.
In early-stage, SoftBank was about average
Although SoftBank has lately been swimming in deeper capital pools, its early-stage investing practice hasn’t been all that different from other leaders of the CVC pack. Here’s a chart which averages out 799 Seed, Series A, Series B and Series C deals led or participated in by these top five corporate venture investors between January 2012 and August 2, 2017.

On average, the size of SoftBank’s early-stage venture capital deals were more or less in line with the company’s CVC peers, at least in terms of straight averages.
So, at least for SoftBank’s early-stage investing practice, the firm really was just another garden variety CVC. However, with the decline of SoftBank Capital and the rise of the new Vision Fund, early-stage investments would be “more of the exception than the rule,” Arora told ReCode in an interview announcing the decision.
SoftBank’s investment pivot
The Vision Fund is a significant departure from SoftBank’s previous investing style, even when including other CVCs. Although the new $100 billion fund was just announced in the late Spring of 2017, the decision to wind down early-stage venture capital investing was made in 2015. In the same interview with ReCode, Arora suggested that “the way to preserve the long-term sustainability of SoftBank is to be large minority shareholders of many assets.”
And it’s possible to see, in the intervening years between largely ending its early-stage investing initiatives and announcing the Vision Fund, that SoftBank had been busy establishing a track record of playing in what Arora characterized as “the large-check marketplace.” Although it’s hard to know exactly how much capital SoftBank has invested in individual rounds, we can sum the total amount of capital raised in VC and PE rounds in which SoftBank was either a participant or the lead investor.

Year-to-date in 2017, SoftBank was a lead or participant in over $14 billion worth of venture capital and private equity rounds alone. This does not account for SoftBank’s $4 billion post-IPO investment in Nvidia in May, any non-PE or VC financings or other funding events that haven’t yet been announced. And given that SoftBank seems to be announcing new deals every week or two these days, the chart above is likely to be out of date very soon. (Update: Softbank didn’t take long to prove us right.)
Visualized a different way, we can see how SoftBank has consistently ramped up the size of checks it’s willing to write. Below is a logarithmically scaled (i.e. by powers of 10) plot of SoftBank’s VC, PE and post-IPO financing events since the beginning of 2012.

To put this in perspective, in just five short years, the average round in which SoftBank invests has grown by approximately two orders of magnitude, from the low seven figures to the mid-to-upper nine figures.
Deploying $100 billion is harder than it looks
The challenge, of course, is that SoftBank now has to deploy two pools of capital: the Vision Fund and its own corporate cash. Crunchbase News has learned that Vision Fund will be SoftBank’s primary investment vehicle, with preferred access to deals over $100 million. SoftBank declined to comment on the record.
At the time of writing, Crunchbase data shows that, globally, there were just 126 VC, PE and post-IPO equity financing rounds larger than $250 million. (We chose $250 million because it’s a round number and also the amount SoftBank invested in business lending platform Kabbage’s Series F.) In U.S.-based companies, there were just 50 rounds of that size closed in 2016.
Even if the global venture capital and private equity markets continue to recover from their mid-2016 lows, and there are more of these quarter-billion-plus rounds, it’s still going to be difficult to invest that capital judiciously. In a good year, $100 billion is about the size of the entire global VC market. To fill out the rest of the Vision Fund, it’s likely we’re going to see more deals like the $32 billion all-cash buyout of ARM that SoftBank completed in July 2016. As it stands, the Vision Fund now holds 25 percent of ARM, the now $5 billion stake of Nvidia, as well as equity stakes in a few startups financed directly by Vision Fund. It’s also possible that marginal shares of other recent large-dollar investments previously made by SoftBank could be absorbed into Vision Fund.
Arora told Recode the large-check marketplace is “less crowded,” noting that “it’s a smaller universe of companies we have to understand and support.” What he didn’t say, though, was that a constrained universe of big deals is a kind of double-edged sword. This being said, SoftBank shows no indication it’s going to be falling on it anytime soon.

Long the gold standard for bragging rights about your blazing broadband speeds, Speedtest.net has plenty of data to work with. Now, it wants to open up a new segment of that data to everyone, allowing users to compare aggregate speed reports from countries around the globe. The data will be compiled into a monthly report called the Speedtest Global Index, and the first one is available now.
The tool will offer 12 months of broadband and mobile speeds (both download and upload) for each individual country in the index. Ookla suggests that the stats could be used to “uncover trends and detect potential storylines” — given that the ride toward high speed global connectivity has plenty of bumps along the way, we’re inclined to agree.

Perhaps more interesting than the static rankings themselves, the index includes stats on how countries are moving up or down the charts. For example, in July 2017, Japan dropped three points in broadband ranking to No. 13 while, the United States sat not-so-pretty at No. 9. Singapore continues to dominate global broadband speeds, while Norway offers the fastest mobile connections (the U.S. comes in at a pitiful No. 46 and dropping).
“We hope you’ll come to see Speedtest Global Index as a go-to resource for global internet performance data. Take this data and use it to tell stories that help make the internet faster in your home country and around the world,” Ookla’s blog post states.
“We’ll update Speedtest Global Index with data based on the previous month at the beginning of every month so you’ll have fresh statistics and an early eye on new developments.”

Starcraft II has been a target for Alphabet’s DeepMind AI research for a while now – the UK AI company took on Blizzard’s sci-fi strategy game starting last year, and announced plans to create an open AI research environment based on the game to make it possible for others to contribute to the effort of creating a virtual agent who can best the top human StarCraft players in the world. Now, DeepMind and Blizzard are opening the doors to that environment, with new tools including a machine learning API, a large game replay dataset, an open source DeepMind toolset and more.
The new release of the StarCraft II API on the Blizzard side includes a Linux package made to be able to run in the cloud, as well as support for Windows and Mac. It also has support for offline AI vs. AI matches, and those anonymized game replays from actual human players for training up agents, which is starting out at 65,000 complete matches, and will grow to over 500,000 over the course of the next few weeks.

StarCraft II is such a useful environment for AI research basically because of how complex and varied the games can be, with multiple open routes to victory for each individual match. Players also have to do many different things simultaneously, including managing and generating resources, as well as commanding military units and deploying defensive structures. Plus, not all information about the game board is available at once, meaning players have to make assumptions and predictions about what the opposition is up to.
It’s such a big task, in fact, that DeepMind and Blizzard are including “mini-games” in the release, which break down different subtasks into “manageable chunks,” including teaching agents to master tasks like building specific units, gathering resources, or moving around the map. The hope is that compartmentalizing these areas of play will allow testing and comparison of techniques from different researchers on each, along with refinement, before their eventual combination in complex agents that attempt to master the whole game.
The whole goal here is to come up with AI that can play StarCraft II better than any human can, in much the same way that DeepMind did with its AlphaGo software for playing the ancient physical board game of Go. DeepMind wants this to propel the existing research forward, hence its appeal to larger research community and this open release of tools.
Update: Shortly after this article was posted, and after a brief correspondence with FaceApp’s founder in which we pointed out that the product does not exist in a societal vacuum, FaceApp’s founder emailed to say it would be removing the ethnicity filters. 
“The new controversial filters will be removed in the next few hours,” Goncharov told us.
At the time of writing the filters have indeed been removed. 
Our original article follows below… 
FaceApp, ignoring its own previous missteps and those of others, has wandered back into controversy with a new update launching today that adds “ethnicity change filters,” allowing users to see what it would look like if they were Caucasian, Black, Asian or Indian.
When the company launched last year, there were some reports that filters designed to make users look “hotter” was just, in fact, making them whiter. Now, with four of the 10 filters available in the free version of the app being explicitly devoted to “changing” ethnicities, FaceApp seems to be getting a little too focused on races rather than faces.
The app, which has 40 million installs across Android and iOS devices, just launched a 2.0 update last week, which added paid “style” filters designed to make users look better by adding makeup or a hipster beard.
Face filters are an admittedly difficult technology to navigate from a cultural standpoint, but there have been enough controversies with apps like MSQRD (acquired by Facebook) and Snapchat for young startups to learn from and avoid making mistakes. Unfortunately, though FaceApp has already endured its own controversy, its misguided efforts to correct them… aren’t a great look.


Wow… FaceApp really setting the bar for racist AR with its awful new update that includes Black, Indian and Asian "race filters" pic.twitter.com/Lo5kmLvoI9
— Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) August 9, 2017



It seems apparent the founder just made some dumb decisions in his efforts to evade further controversy. FaceApp CEO Yaroslav Goncharov stressed that any of the filters designed to make people’s faces look better would preserve the ethnicity of the user, while the “ethnicity change filters” were “designed to be equal in all aspects,” Goncharov told TechCrunch in a statement. “They don’t have any positive or negative connotations associated with them. They are even represented by the same icon. In addition to that, the list of those filters is shuffled for every photo, so each user sees them in a different order,” he added.
The app’s face-altering technologies are undoubtedly improving and it’s clear the app could have some very cool use cases, but ethnicity filters are a bad direction in which to be moving.

Rumor has it that Amazon’s AWS cloud computing platform will soon launch its own Kubernetes-based container management service. Those rumors are getting a bit more concrete because AWS today joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the open source home of the Kubernetes project, as a top-level Platinum member. With this, all of the major public cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google and IBM, are now part of this Linux Foundation-based group, which aims to bring modern cloud management techniques to the masses.
Amazon already hosts the vast majority of Kubernetes deployments, according to a recent survey, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Amazon is joining the foundation that, to a large degree, is steering this project. It’s worth noting, though, that AWS makes use of plenty of open source projects, and also regularly releases its own projects on GitHub. The company also has been a Linux Foundation member since 2013 and is a founding member of the Core Infrastructure Initiative. Unlike all of its main competitors, it isn’t a member of the Cloud Foundry foundation, though.
As for the CNCF, Amazon has been contributing to containerd, the group’s container runtime. “AWS plans to take an active role in the cloud native community, contributing to Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies such as containerd, CNI, and linkerd,” the CNCF notes in today’s announcement. Adrian Cockcroft, the VP of Cloud Architecture Strategy at AWS, will join CNCF’s board.
In his announcement, Cockcroft did not talk about what Amazon’s short-term plans for Kubernetes are, but given the wide-spread support for the platform — which is giving Google and Microsoft an opening in competing with AWS on this quickly expanding field — I would be surprised if we didn’t see increased direct support for Kubernetes on AWS (you can, of course, already use it on AWS, but only with the help of tools from third-party vendors).
Curbside, a startup powering same-day shopping experiences for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, including CVS, is today announcing a new partnership with Yelp that will allow consumers to shop in Yelp’s app, then pick up their items locally. For shoppers, the idea is that they’ll be able to browse area businesses’ products and promotions in Yelp, then drive to the store to pick up their order — without even having to get out of their car to retrieve it.
The startup already had a relationship with CVS, which invested in Curbside last year. At the time, CVS said it planned to roll out this new curbside pickup option to its 9,600 retail pharmacy locations, which would take advantage of Curbside’s technology to power this experience.
This partnership also allowed CVS to introduce an in-app feature, called “CVS Express,” on mobile, which was available at 350 retail locations across the U.S. as of August, 2016. That rollout has continued at a fairly rapid pace, and has now reached 4,000 retail stores.
The “CVS Express” experience allows customers to shop from nearly 10,000 SKUs in the CVS app. When their order is received and filled, an alert is sent to the customer’s phone, telling them the order is ready for pickup. Curbside’s geo-location technology then alerts store staff when the customer arrives, and they bring the order — already bagged — out to the car.
This same experience is now coming to Yelp.

Even if customers don’t have the CVS mobile app installed, they can shop from CVS via Yelp — an app that is, in many cases, more likely to have a presence on users’ smartphones. The CVS integration in Yelp has the same footprint as to what’s available through CVS’s own app and website, it’s just a different means of accessing the pickup feature.
But to be clear, this feature is something that Curbside is providing to its customers — not Yelp. Curbside today works with a number of stores beyond CVS, including through partnerships with Sephora, Westfield malls and others. But because it requires an inventory feed, Curbside works well for restaurants with fixed menus and larger retailers — not mom-and-pops — on the retail side.
In addition to CVS, this pickup option is also available for Curbside customer Pizza Hut, which is live now in the Bay Area on Yelp. The Pizza Hut integration is considered a trial.
Other stores and quick-serve restaurants will be added in the future, Curbside tells us. It’s working with a handful of restaurant chains — those that are regional or national — which will add pickups to Yelp in the months ahead.
For Curbside, going live on Yelp makes sense because it gives its customers the ability to reach customers on a larger platform, and reach customers who may not have the business’s app installed.
“The way things are going, consumers are spending time on properties like Yelp,” says Curbside CEO Jaron Waldman. “It’s more cost-effective and a better customer experience to be reaching them in the context of where they’re living, essentially,” he explains.
The timing of the Curbside partnership is interesting, too, given that Yelp just exited its food delivery business. Earlier this month, the company said it was selling Eat24 to GrubHub for $287.5 million, and reported solid earnings.
The original plan with Eat24 was that people searching for a restaurant on Yelp would then take the next step to just order their food, too. But Yelp’s core competency was not in food delivery — a space that now has a ton of competition, including from Uber and Amazon, in addition to others like Seamless/GrubHub.
With Curbside, however, the option to move customers forward to the point of shopping and ordering becomes a possibility again, but without Yelp having to get involved in the logistics of handling those orders. Plus, Curbside can offload orders to delivery partners, like Uber, if the customer desires.
“Yelp doesn’t need to be in the business of delivery and logistics. Instead, we can work with great partners who specialize in fulfillment. We plan to continue adding new partners and products in the future, including Platform partnerships such as Curbside,” says Peter Curzon, Director of Biz Dev at Yelp. He also pointed out that Yelp has a history of working with partners, including GrubHub.
Yelp also is participating in a revenue-sharing agreement with Curbside for the transactions occurring on its platform, but the companies declined to disclose the specifics of their deal.
Curbside’s integration on Yelp is live today.
Snapchat’s powerful but hidden Story Search feature is finally making itself useful by giving us a behind-the-scenes glimpse inside Apple Park, Apple’s new spaceship-like campus that will open soon.
Typing “Apple Park” into Snapchat’s search bar will show you the Apple Park Story, which is a collection of videos taken on the property. The full Apple Park story isn’t showing up on the map itself, so you’re better off searching for it directly instead of scrolling around the map.

All the videos are likely coming from construction workers, since the office isn’t yet open to employees.
The pictures show how close the campus is to being finished – the main atrium with real trees seems complete, and most of the work still being done, at least in these videos, seems happening outside the building itself.

Netflix is going to be home to the first television show created by the Coen Brothers, the directing duo that’s behind The Big Lebowski, Fargo, True Grit and many more films. The show is called The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, and is described as a “Western anthology” that will follow six stories about America’s Wild West. Joel and Ethan Coen will produce, write and direct, and the anthology should premiere sometime next year.
The show has been characterized as more of a “mini-series” in previous descriptions of the project, which was considered for a feature-length film but instead will be a multi-part show because of the scope. Each chapter will be its own unique story; the cast includes Tim Blake Nelson as the titular character, Ryne Daley, James Franco, Zoe Kazan and others.
This should be a very interesting project for Netflix, and also something the company is probably happy to be able to announce now that news is out that Disney is removing its movie catalog from its U.S. service in 2019 to create its own dedicated streaming service. Marquee content from other big-name sources that Netflix owns exclusive distribution rights to will be especially important in helping reassure investors and analysts that the streaming giant won’t suffer much from loss of the Disney deal.

Even the best shows take time to hit their stride. Who had high hopes after watching the first episode of The Office, a virtual shot for shot remake of its UK counterpart, defanged for American audiences? 
It seems unfair to judge Carpool Karaoke from a single episode, but there isn’t a whole hell of a lot present to give the viewer hope that the series might someday become more than the sum of its parts. The show’s source material is some pretty thin soup, viral segments wherein late night’s most affable and least offensive host sings songs in a moving vehicle with famous people.
Carpool Karaoke: The Series answers the question no one but a few network executives dared ask: what if the premise were stretched to 20 minutes and served up for 20 straight episodes? They gave Triumph the Insult Comic Dog his own show, too, and not even Kenneth from 30 Rock could save it. Turns out the only thing it was good for was for American to poop on. 
The first episode comes out the gate with guns blazing, pairing up host James Corden with Will Smith, one of the most broadly likable human beings to ever grace the face of the Earth. They sing a Smith song and then there’s a big reveal with a marching band accompanying the duo on 1999’s “Get Jiggy Wit’ It” (I’m not telling you anything that wasn’t already revealed in the trailer).

The episode then abruptly shifts to Corden’s version of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee — which is to say an otherwise standard interview format, set against the backdrop of a sometimes moving car. Corden’s not the most compelling or insightful interviewer, but at least he’s a professional capable of eliciting an interesting reaction from a guest. 
Of course, he’s only on-board for a couple of episodes. Future pairings include the likes of Alicia Keys with John Legend and Miley with Billy Ray Cyrus. Without an an experienced interviewer in the literal driver’s seat, it’s hard to imagine things going this smoothly. Instead, the show’s entire appeal hinges upon something akin to the Battle of the Network Stars-esque premise of famous people performing kooky stunts.

Thankfully, as Variety handily points out, Corden and company have already devised a solution: pranks. They were used to break up the monotony of standalone Carpool Karaoke bits, and they look to be very much in play here, starting with Corden and Smith crashing a wedding in the premiere episode. 
Certain guests like Billy Eichner should thrive in that format, coupled with an oddball pairing like the sometimes likable members of Metallica. Though, if Eichner and celebrities hilarious screaming at strangers is your jam (as it should be), there are already 50+ episodes of Billy on the Street out in the world. 
As it stands, Carpool Karaoke is five minutes of content aimlessly attempting to fill up 20. Coupled with the dismal Planet of the Apps, an app-focused rehash of ABC’s Shark Tank where developers pitch to disinterested celebs, it’s not a compelling reason to subscribe to Apple Music. Nor is it a very good sign of Apple’s ability to compete on original content with the likes of Netflix and Amazon.
Last week, Apple accidentally released an early build of the HomePod firmware. Guilherme Rambo has been digging around a library file to spot strings and references that hint at future products and features. In particular, he just noticed that the next iPhone will be able to detect when you’re looking at the screen so that it can silence your notifications.
I looked around the HomePod firmware and found the same references to this “supportsAttenuatingTonesForAttentionDetected” class.


What @jsnell talked about on the last @_upgradefm is true: the iPhone will suppress notification sounds if you're looking at it pic.twitter.com/eFzKUfZYDx
— Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) August 8, 2017



Based on previous leaks, Apple has been working on some mysterious face detection technology. This technology codenamed “Pearl ID” should replace the Touch ID sensor altogether.
It seems like the next flagship iPhone is going to feature two front-facing cameras as well as an infrared sensor. This way, you could unlock your phone using your face even if you’re in the dark, even if you’re not looking directly at your phone.
Today’s news is a bit surprising as it means that your iPhone is going to track your face at all times. That’s how Apple can silence notifications and vibrations if you’re looking at your phone because a banner should be enough.
But Apple could use face tracking for many different things. For instance, you could unlock your iPhone by just looking at your notifications on the lock screen. When you’re ready to unlock it, your iPhone will already know that you’re looking at your phone so it should be instantaneous.
Similarly, password managers, banking apps, file management apps and other sensitive apps have been using Touch ID as an additional security layer. If your phone is always aware that you’re looking at it, apps could skip this screen entirely. Or iOS could lock itself automatically if you stop looking at your phone.
Rumor has it that Apple wanted to embed the fingerprint sensor in the display itself. But reports say that Apple couldn’t produce tens of millions of devices with this technology. That’s why Apple is switching things up and focusing on facial recognition.
Apple should be announcing three different iPhone models in September. The company should announce two more powerful phones that are going to look more or less like the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus.
But the most interesting device is a brand new super premium phone — it could be called the iPhone 8, the iPhone Pro or something different. It’s supposedly going to have a taller screen that is going to completely fill the front of the device, except for the speaker, camera and sensors at the top. It’s going to be interesting to see how Apple is going to tweak iOS for this new device.

Meet Teleport: An app that’s using a trained neural network to power a selfie-editing feature that lets you change the color of your hair at the touch of a button.
Fancy seeing how you’d look with red locks or blue? No problemo. Just upload your selfie, wait a few ticks while the AI gets to work figuring out which bits of your face are hair and which are not, and then tap on a shade of your choice to try out a new do.
Co-founder Victor Koch says the team’s experiments with neural networks have resulted in an app that makes hair coloring “qualitative and closer to natural”.
The app also lets you blur the background of a selfie. Or insert alternative backgrounds, including uploading photos of your choice.
But its most eye-catching feature is definitely the ability to generate an instant collage of brightly mopped selfies — offering a sort of insta-pop-art that’s ready to load straight into Instagram to ask your followers which look works best for you.
While not perfectly photorealistic in every instance, results can look relatively realistic, depending on how dark/light your natural hair color is — and at least give you an idea of what a particular hair dye might do for you.
Teleport launched officially in late July, initially in Europe, before being opened up globally. Koch claims it’s had two million downloads at this point, and generated more than 75k shares on Instagram thus far, or ~250k across social platforms in general. Instagram is where Teleport’s makers are clearly hoping to grab #attention.

Koch describes the app as a “neural photo-editor” — putting in the same category as the likes of the rather more radically transformative FaceApp, which had a moment of viral popularity earlier this year when people realized its gender-bending potential.
Last year another viral hit in the ‘neural photo-editing’ space was Prisma, which utilized AI running on smartphone hardware to power a style transfer feature that could turn plain old photos into painterly graphics in the style of particular artists.
Since then, style transfer has been absorbed into mainstream apps, with social giants like Facebook cloning the feature. While Google has been working in this space for longer, building automatic photo-editing features powered by AI and baking them into its own photo products to enhance the feature set.
In Teleport’s case, Koch says they’re using convolution neural networks for semantic segmentation of images/video — the team also has an app for selfie-video that lets users change the background as they shoot.
Teleport’s selfie editor app has been in development for around seven months, according to Koch, with the US-based team having raised $1 million thus far from private investors to fund development.
“The idea was born out of a set of experiments using neural networks… On complex problems, wide and deep networks significantly outperform small networks and other methods based on manual feature creation due to their flexibility but require a sufficient amount of data to avoid overfitting. However their processing time, size, and memory consumption are also much larger,” he says.
“We train our models using Tensorflow, because currently it is the most powerful and actively developing deep learning framework. We have several Amazon Instances which we use to train our model. Our dataset consists of 30k photos chosen manually. Moreover, we created our own framework which is up to 20 times faster than the popular Tensorflow library.”
The app is a free download, as you’d expect for this sort of visual novelty, but the team reckons there could be monetization potential in future by integrating with large cosmetics companies — i.e. those which sell hair dyes, since the app can reproduce the colors at least quasi-realistically and offer ‘try before you dye’.
Koch says they do also plan on adding more features, such as the ability to change hair color in real-time video, and, er, change skin color… The latter does sound a tad ill-advised, given, for example, the controversy around Snapchat’s Bob Marley filter last year. FaceApp also had to apologize after it made a ‘hotness’ filter that bleached the skin of POC.
Intel is moving quickly to ramp its autonomous driving technology efforts now that it has closed its acquisition of Mobileye, the Israeli self-driving sensor and computing company. The plan is to build a fleet of over 100 test vehicles with SAE Level 4 capabilities (fully self-driving) with the first of those hitting roads later this year.
The test fleet is designed to show off Intel and Mobileye’s hybrid autonomous driving software system, which it hopes to offer as an industry supplier for a range of different applications and uses. The test fleet will accordingly include different vehicle brands and types, the company says, to help show that the platform itself is open for use in basically any applications.
Intel’s test fleet is going to be a sales tool for the company for potential partners and customers, but the company says it’ll also be used for safety validation and for working with regulators on meeting transportation rule requirements. Data collection from the fleet will help with that, as well as with improving the technology over time.
Testing with the vehicles will be conducted in the U.S., Mobileye’s home country of Israel, and in other parts of Europe. Other companies including Waymo and GM’s Cruise also maintain active test fleets for autonomous vehicles, and if Intel’s serious about being a primary player in this market, maintaining its own fleet is basically table stakes at this stage. The company opened an Autonomous Driving Garage in San Jose in May, and that will likely figure as a key center of operations for managing this new vehicle fleet.
“Cloaking” sounds sci-fi, but it’s actually a trick used today by spammers to show content moderators or search engine spiders an innocent-looking version of their site while real visitors just see ads and scams. For example, some spammers try to fool Facebook’s review team and tech by showing any of its staffers’ IP addresses a benign landing page for links or ads, while everyone else sees diet pill scams or porn that violate Facebook’s community standards and ad policies.
So today, Facebook is cracking down on cloaking. Facebook ads product director Rob Leathern tells me now when it discovers a site using cloaking, “We’ll deactivate their ad counts, we’ll kick them off, we’ll get rid of their Pages.” Facebook will use both humans and expanded artificial intelligence systems to root out cloakers. However, it’s not publicly disclosing the signals it uses to identify cloaking so it doesn’t tip-off the spammers.
Innocent businesses should see no impact. “There’s no legitimate use case for cloaking,” Leathern says. “If we find it, it doesn’t really matter who that actor is. They’re usually bad actors and spammers by definition. So the line is if anyone does this in any way, shape, or form, we want them off the platform.” Here, Facebook is merely seeking out cloaking, rather than passing judgement on site content.
The change comes as part of a multi-pronged attack on hoaxes, clickbait, spam and low-quality sites following criticism that Facebook didn’t prevent fake news from influencing the 2016 presidential election. By cutting off traffic to spam sites, Facebook can choke out the financial lifeblood of bad actors spreading misinformation for profit or political motives.
According to a recent study of 4 million posts by more than 450 Facebook Pages spreading hyperpartisan political news, BuzzFeed concluded that “Publishers are obsessed with Facebook’s algorithm changes and with avoiding getting caught up in the social network’s stepped-up initiative to reduce clickbait and misinformation in the News Feed.”
Cloaking isn’t just a Facebook problem, though. That’s why it plans to work with other tech companies to share strategies for defeating cloakers. Facebook tells me it’s early days in these conversations with the industry about how to address this more collectively. But if it shares the fingerprints of cloakers the way it does to thwart uploads of terrorist content or child pornography, Facebook could use experience from its massive scale to inoculate fellow fixtures of the internet.

Jinn, the U.K.-based same-hour ‘shop on your behalf’ delivery app that operates quite similarly to Postmates in the U.S., has gone through a turbulent time of late. This saw the company withdraw from all markets outside of London last month, as part of several rounds of mass-layoffs. Operations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds in the U.K., and Madrid and Barcelona in Spain, have been “paused” indefinitely.
The aim, Jinn founder Mario Navarro said at the time, was to continue on a “path towards profitability” by focussing solely on the U.K. capital city, which accounted for 90 per cent of its orders. And now the startup is claiming to have done just that: “Jinn is profitable at an EBITDA level, with 30% contribution margins, and expecting to close the year with $22M in sales,” says the company.
Meanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that Jinn co-founder and COO Leon Herrera departed the startup two months ago and has relocated back to his home country of Spain. In a call, Navarro said he couldn’t comment directly on Herrera’s reasons for leaving, except to say they weren’t work-related and that the two remain on good terms and that Herrera is still a Jinn shareholder and supporter of the startup.
“I can confirm that today we are profitable at an EBITDA level,” Navarro tells me. “And that we will be EBITDA profitable in August and for the coming months”. In other words — contrary to a lot of speculation — there is life in Jinn yet.
He also says the startup has managed to automate the entire platform, meaning that it is able to handle both partner orders and non-partner orders in a much less labour intensive fashion in terms of how those orders are processed, which in turn has helped to bring down costs. The startup is also disclosing that headcount sits at a very lean 20 staff members, down from a reported high of around 100, though Navarro wouldn’t confirm that figure.
In May this year, the company announced that it had raised $10 million in further funding, capital it planned to use to continue to grow and “consolidate its presence in its main markets”. However, as I’ve noted before, it is far from clear if Jinn’s latest round was based on tranches or contingent on certain milestones or KPIs being met. In other words, it is unlikely Jinn has burned through that cash or that it all entered the company’s balance sheet in the first place. Navarro declined to comment.
“Jinn is now running a lean and efficient operation with 20 people, and has returned to its true start up roots: empowering employees to get involved in all areas of the business, innovating every day to solve problems and most importantly, getting ready for the challenge of growing the business sustainably,” says the company in a statement.
Jinn says it currently has 1,000 monthly active couriers on the platform, 1,000 partners and over 100,000 customers. It expects to double its current monthly completed orders in the next four months.
Adds Navarro in a statement: “The departure of some of our amazing employees and close friends has been the most painful part of this decision. Working alongside them has been a privilege and we can’t be thankful enough for all the effort and the commitment they’ve put into the company. We’ve been completely humbled by their understanding of the situation and their willingness to continue supporting Jinn in any way possible. If you’re looking for amazing talent, please write to me at mario@jinnapp.com”.
Smartphone company Essential, which is founded by Android co-creator Andy Rubin, has finally made official a $300 million funding round first reported in June. The funding round comes from investors including Tencent, as well as Amazon’s Alexa Fund, among others. Essential also revealed new information about its retail launch, including retail partners Amazon and Best Buy who will be carrying the phone in the U.S.
The release date itself is still somewhat mysterious, however: Essential President Niccolo De Masi told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that it’s still “a few weeks away,” but said that the company will provide an exact date “in a week.” The Essential phone has a launch exclusivity deal with carrier Sprint in the U.S., and it also previously announced availability via Telus in Canada. De Masi told the WSJ that future international carrier options would be announced later in 2017.
The smartphone startup is challenging Apple and other premium device makers with its design and premium placement, but it doesn’t have any illusions about going toe-to-toe with the current industry leaders in terms of sales in the immediate future. De Masi said that the company will consider low single digit million sales for year one “very successful,” considering that the company is a new startup.
The company’s total funding is now at $330 million, and private co. share marketplace Equidate estimates its total valuation at $1 billion, though Essential itself isn’t disclosing any official valuation figures. The Essential smartphone will be available unlocked at retail via Amazon, Best Buy and Essential.com, as well as through carriers Sprint and Telus.
Essential has generated a lot of hype around its forthcoming Android-based smartphone based on the pedigree of its founder and its unique design with maximizes the screen area of the device. It looks likely to face a similar design on the forthcoming iPhone 8, however, based on leaks, and other Android device makers are taking the cue and revealing screen-heavy prototypes with minimal bezels, so it’ll be interesting to see how Essential positions itself with its go-to-market strategy once the phone is actually available.
If you’re wondering why Marvel movies and Star Wars weren’t mentioned as being among the titles included in Disney’s upcoming streaming service, announced yesterday, that’s because they might be getting their own branded services instead. According to Disney CEO Bob Iger, the company is still considering how it wants to bring Marvel and LucasFilm titles to consumers. There’s been talk of launching proprietary Marvel and Star Wars services, he said on Disney’s earnings call on Tuesday.
But that decision is not yet set in stone.
“We’re mindful of the volume of product that would go into those services, and we want to be careful about that,” Iger explained.
The exec also noted that the other option on the table was to add the Marvel and Star Wars films to the new Disney streaming service. However, it sounds like the company isn’t sure that’s the right place for them. The feeling is that there may not be as much overlap between the Disney fans and Marvel or Star Wars fans to warrant such a move, he said.
That’s an odd take, especially given the appeal that superhero movies and Star Wars has for kids. Sure, they might be slightly older children than those who want to tune in to watch the new Frozen sequel or the latest in the Toy Story franchise, but there’s definitely going to be overlap among the potential customer base for a Disney streaming service, and one for either Marvel or Star Wars.
After all, it’s not the children who are paying for these services – it’s the parents. And many families have children of different ages, not to mention adults who are also interested in Marvel and Star Wars, too.
Still, it seems like Disney doesn’t believe it will need to add these titles to generate demand for its Disney/Pixar streaming service.
While its flagship Disney and Pixar movies will bring in subscribers, the company also said yesterday that it has already begun the development process at the Disney Channel and the Studio divisions to create original TV shows and movies that will be made exclusively for the new service. Essentially, Disney is mimicking the Netflix model here, with an attempt to create must-see shows and films that you can’t find elsewhere.
The other thing that makes a Marvel or Star Wars-branded service a possibility is that Disney now has the technical capabilities to make that happen – something that could have otherwise held up projects like this. With the company’s $1.58 billion investment in streaming technology infrastructure provider BAMTech, which gave it a controlling interest, it’s able to go where the market takes them when it comes to streaming.
“This lays the groundwork for the company to do a number of things,” Iger said, speaking in a post-earnings interview with CNBC. “It provides us with all sorts of optionality that we haven’t had before. You know, it’s one thing to say you’ll be in the business of direct-to-consumer or over-the-top, and it’s one thing to do it. And to do it, you need a really strong technology engine,” he added.
If Disney wanted to go the route of standalone streaming services for all its brands, it would have the content to do that. There are TV shows like ABC’s Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD and Marvel’s Inhumans, Freeform’s Cloak and Dagger and New Warriors, Disney XD’s Star Wars Rebels, online content, plus all the movies, and more when other licensing deals expire. But this also raises the question – what does this mean for the Marvel shows that are now on Netflix?
Disney and Netflix, as you may recall, struck a multiyear deal several years ago under which Marvel would develop four original live-action series for Netflix, “Daredevil,” “Jessica Jones,” “Iron Fist,” and “Luke Cage,” plus “The Defenders.” The deal followed an earlier agreement that exclusively licensed Disney movies during the pay TV window from Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, and Disneynature.
This latter deal is the one that’s wrapping up in advance of the 2019 launch of Disney’s streaming service. The 2019 releases – Lion King, Frozen 2, Toy Story 4 and others – will go to Disney’s service instead, along with back catalog content from the Studio and Channel made over the years, and original programming.
According to Iger, however, the company has no plans to pull its Marvel TV shows from Netflix – adding that Disney and Netflix have had a “great relationship” on that front.
He said, too, that the possibility still exists that Disney will license other titles to Netflix down the road.
 
PullRequest is a startup with a twist on the on-demand economy. It wants to be your company code checker. It takes care of finding code review experts, who can check for bugs, security issues, coding standards and performance problems.
“We offer code review as a service. As developers push code, we have on-demand experts that review it [before it gets published]. This allows them to move forward without resources constraining the operation,” company founder Lyal Avery told TechCrunch.
Avery says that industry estimates peg code review taking between 20 and 50 percent of a programmer’s time. The idea behind code reviewing as of service is to allow programmers on your team to stay focused on programming tasks, and leave the reviews to PullRequest.
Customers come to the PullRequest web site and provide the details of what they are looking for in their reviewers. PullRequest vets all the reviewers to be sure they have the appropriate expertise and finds a match.
The problem Avery is trying to solve became apparent to him at his previous startups, where he watched developers spending an inordinate amount of time on code review. When you consider how difficult it is to find programming talent for your startup, he says this seemed like a poor use of developer resources. The flip side of that was code being pushed live without an appropriate review. Both of those situations felt wrong to Avery and the idea of a code review service began to take shape.
As far as paying the reviewers, Avery says they have been experimenting with a number of compensation scenarios including per project and per hour pricing. As for how they bill the companies using the service, that too is a work in progress he says, but they are trying to find ways that appeal to both small customers with a few programmers and larger public company customers with bigger staffs.
The company is also looking at having the same reviewers work with the same company and same group of developers, so they become like an extension of the programming team. This would allow them to get to know and understand the code, as well as build a rapport with the developers on the team.
He says that the company launched in May and is participating in the Y Combinator Summer ’17 class. It already has 200 reviewers available on the platform. 300 companies, large and small, have expressed interest in the service, so far. It’s working with about a dozen of them for starters.

Los Angeles-based Pistol Lake has developed what it thinks could be the next thing in men’s activewear — a line of shirts and other products made with new fabric that could be worn at the gym or out and about. To fund the next evolution of its product expansion, the company has raised $600,000 in new funding.
Pistol Lake was founded in 2012 by brothers Will and James Sulinski, along with Andrew Kneisley, and the company has spent the last several years experimenting with different styles and types of fabric.
While it started with just two products — a crew-neck t-shirt and a v-neck t-shirt — over time Pistol Lake has added a variety of long- and short-sleeve henleys, hoodies and sweatshirts. To date, it’s funded new product categories mostly through crowdfunding campaigns.
More recently, Pistol Lake has been focused on advancing a line of activewear products based on a new fabric it developed called Eudae. Made from a blend of eucalyptus pulp and recycled plastic bottles, Eudae was created to be comfortable and sustainable.
The plan to create a new type of fabric came as William Sulinski was looking for shirts that would be just as performant as the polyester workout gear sold by the likes of Nike or Under Armour, but without the same glossy sheen that says you’re coming from the gym.
“I thought, let’s make a fabric that looks like a regular t-shirt but performs like these fitness fabrics,” Sulinski told me. After testing “probably 300 performances fabrics,” according to Sulinski, the Pistol Lake team worked with partners to come up with Eudae.
After reading a paper on the benefits of Tencel, he wondered what it would be like to combine those fibers with a kind of recycled polyester. The result was the development of a custom yarn and fabric which Pistol Lake began to use in its manufacturing.

With its Eudae line of products, Pistol Lake is aiming to hit a sweet spot among active men who will be able to wear the clothes while working out, and also as they go about their everyday lives.
The eucalyptus fibers inhibit bacterial growth and odor, suggesting that a customer would be able to work up a sweat but not have to worry about everyone around knowing it.
(Disclosure: I’m a longtime customer of Pistol Lake’s, and was a backer of its Eudae Kickstarter. I absolutely love the way the new fabric fits and feels.)
Anyway, after years of crowdfunding new products and operating off of revenues, Sulinski decided to raise a small amount of seed funding to expand the company’s business. As a result, it brought on $600,000 in financing led by Slow Ventures, with participation from Casper co-founder Neil Parikh, Joe Montana’s Liquid 2 Ventures and a handful of other strategic angel investors.
Why Slow? Because “Dave [Morin] at Slow was one of our biggest customers… and actually might be our biggest customer,” Sulinski said. In addition to buying the company’s products, Morin has also provided invaluable product feedback over the years. And since Morin has invested in a number of other successful direct-to-consumer brands like Casper and Allbirds, it’s probably feedback well worth considering.
So what’s next? To start with, Sulinski and team are going to work on having increased inventory of products to meet demand that’s been doubling every month over the last quarter.
It’s also going to continue working on bringing new products to market. That includes new styles of shirts and shorts, but also the development of new product categories for the company, like socks and underwear.
With some more cash in the bank it should be able to do that and hopefully get Eudae incorporated into more dudes’ everyday wardrobes.
Given the fact that the Echo Dot runs $50 a piece or three for $130, I suspect price isn’t a major factor hampering Alexa adoption. But leave it to the folks at Anker to undercut the price of Amazon’s cheapest Echo by offering up a $35 smart speaker with Alexa built-in. Essentially, it’s an off-brand Dot with all of your standard Echo/Alexa functionality. 
The Genie is the latest entry in the budget accessory maker’s Eufy (that’s “you-fee”) line of home automation products. The brand was launched last year, but the smart speaker is apparently really going to get the ball rolling on new connected devices from the company, including another Roomba competitor, light bulbs, wall plugs and switches. 
Anker says the Genie is the “core” of the Eufy Smart Home System, given the fact that all of the above products will also be Alexa-enabled. It’s understandable, of course, that the company is either unable or unwilling to build its own smart assistant in-house, as that’s a heck of a lot of R&D. But can you really claim a smart home system as your own when it’s so dependent on someone else’s AI?

It’s not surprising that companies are trying to hop on the smart speaker bandwagon — Amazon has sold a ton of the things — but price is a tough place to distinguish yourself. After all, Amazon’s always sold hardware at close to cost, knowing full well that it will make up for it through e-commerce and content sales made through the device. 
Of course, the same goes for every company that builds Alexa into their products. Sure, these third-party devices could potentially eat into Echo sales, but at the end of the day, that means Amazon gets another Alexa portal in the home, without having to do any of the heavy lifting on the device side. 
The company even enlisted an Amazon VP to rattle off the things the Genie can do “for less than $35” in the press release — naturally, it’s a list of Alexa skills. For Anker, it’s a chance to hop on a trend while it’s still hot, offering customers the promise of slightly cheaper hardware.
Anker promises that the sound quality is better here than on the Dot. Th Genie also uses Amazon’s Far-Field voice recognition technology, so it will play nicely with other Echoes. Though, the company does appear to have cut a corner or two in order to keep the price down — most notably, the inclusion of two microphones, versus Amazon’s seven. That could mean the product won’t be as good of a listener as Amazon’s.
I’m not sure how much of a demand there is for a slightly cheaper version of the Echo Dot. And honestly, these super cheap smart speakers feel a bit like transitional devices as more and more companies build full Echo functionality into their connected home products. But for those who are interested, the product will be available starting August 16 — through Amazon, of course.
According to new research just published by the data science team at Hired, a jobs marketplace for tech workers, Donald Trump’s efforts to push an America-first philosophy is having a measurable impact on how comfortable tech companies feel in seeking out foreign-born workers.
According to Hired — which examined patterns in the international hiring behavior it sees on its platform — there was a stunning 60 percent decrease in requests from U.S.-based companies to foreign workers from between the second and final quarters of last year, which likely owed to uncertainty around immigration policies following the U.S. presidential election results.
Foreign candidates were also more reluctant to engage with U.S. companies, says Hired, though a 4 percent decrease in the rate at which they accepted interview requests late last year has rebounded more than twofold this year, it says.
The proprietary data was based on 175,000 interview requests, says the company.
Hired separately surveyed both applicants and hiring companies globally about the administration’s rhetoric; somewhat unsurprisingly, 60 percent of the 362 respondents said they believe the administration will have a negative impact on the tech industry. More concerning, almost a quarter of respondents said they are less likely to start a company in the U.S. as a result.
Forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or the children of immigrants.
Of the 40 percent of Hired’s survey respondents who said they’ve considered relocating to another country since the election, nearly one-third cite Canada as their top choice (32 percent), followed by Germany (12 percent), Asia (10 percent) and Australia (10 percent).

Red Hat issued its quarterly update to the OpenShift platform today, adding among other things, a Service Catalog that enables IT or third-party vendors to create connections to internal or external services.
OpenShift is RedHat’s Platform as a Service, based on Kubernetes, the open source container management platform, which was originally developed by Google. It also supports Docker, a popular container platform,  and adheres to the Open Container Initiative, a set of industry standards for containers, according to the company.
As companies make the shift from virtual machines to containers, there is an increasing need for platforms like OpenShift, and Red Hat is seeing massive interest from companies as varying as Deutsche Bank, Volvo and United Health.
OpenShift is a technology that’s helping these companies, and many others make that transition to containers, says Joe Fernandes, senior director of product management for OpenShift at Red Hat. “The adoption of container technology is off the charts. Pretty much every company is adopting containers in some way,” he said.
As the company increases its container customer base, it’s trying to build out the platform to meet the needs of larger company IT departments. One of the things they’ve been hearing is that they want it to be easier to connect containerized applications to internal and external services.
The Service Catalog is not unlike an app store in that developers can go in and find pre-configured connectors. This could be an internal connector to an Oracle database or an external one to a public cloud service from AWS or Azure (or anything else). Fernandes says the app store analogy is apt, but points out that it doesn’t have any procurement capability, at least for now. It could in the future, he says.
Customers were able to make these service connections before, but it took a lot more effort. The goal is to provide a packaged approach so that users don’t have to do the work every time, which should help speed up implementation.
The Service Catalog is available as a technical preview for this release. The next release is due before the end of the year.

Every time we do a gift guide here, one editor suggests the same thing: external battery packs. Every time, like clockwork. And it’s true, everyone in your life probably needs one. We all wander through our days tempting fate by porting around gadgets with sub-par battery life.
The other big upside of gifting a power bank: they’re generally pretty inexpensive. Though that certainly doesn’t apply here — the Powerstation USB-C XXL is $150. And as its name implies, it’s pretty big as far as power banks go — at roughly the size of of an iPhone 7+ and about twice as thick.

Still, it manages to pack a lot of power into that footprint. At 19,500mAh, the Powerstation has a battery nearly seven times the size of the 7+. This is all overkill for phones, but the brick can also be used to charge a laptop. In the case of the 2015 MacBook, Mophie promises an added 14 hours of life.

That ability comes thanks to the wonders of USB-C. It used to be a lot trickier to make external batteries for MacBooks — take the sad tale of HyperMac, which had to cease production when Apple threatened the company over charging port patents. USB-C also means two-way power, so the battery can be refilled through the same port it uses to charge devices. The Powerstation still has two ports, however (one USB-C and one full USB), so you can charge your laptop and phone at the same time.
Even with all of that functionality, the Powerstation USB-C XXL is pretty pricey. You can already find higher capacity power banks from companies like Anker for less. With Mophie, you’re paying for, among other things, design. The cloth covering makes this one of the nicer power banks on the market, for whatever that’s worth.

While it’s big compared to smartphone-centric power banks, it’s impressive how much charging capacity companies are able to fit in the form factor these days. We’ve come a long way since those early Hypermac days. It’s probably a bit large and expensive for every day use, but the Powerstation will power your MacBook through just about any international flight,  if you find yourself without an outlet. 
I would have killed for one of these things back in my early live blogging days, when my laptop battery couldn’t be counted to make it all the way through a keynote on a charge. Even now, the thing is looking mighty tempting with the long days of CES coverage looming just over the horizon.

The Powerstation USB-C XXL isn’t the ideal gift for everyone, but it should make the frequent traveller or tech blogger on your list pretty happy. 
There are a number of ways to find out more about your fertility these days — including from several at-home fertility test startups that have started to pop up in the last few years. Modern Fertility hopes to soon operate in much the same way, but with a more affordable option for testing 10 key hormones affecting women’s fertility.
Though Modern Fertility’s at-home test won’t be available till later this year, you can pre-order it on their website for $149 — though the price will go up after the pre-order at a yet-to-be determined date. Should you want to get started now, the startup also offers the comprehensive screening through a lab near you, though it’s not clear what the price is for that.
The kit includes checking your hormone levels for:


Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH)


Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)


Estradiol (E2)


Luteinizing hormone (LH)


Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)


Free thyroxine (FT4)


Progesterone (P4)


Prolactin (PRL)


Free Testosterone (Free T)


Total Testosterone (T)


Modern Fertility competitor Future Family, a startup offering financing options for egg freezing and IVF procedures, also sells two separate fertility tests you can take at home. The first test kit goes for $300 and includes the three most key hormone tests: AMH, FSH and E2. Future Family’s second test, Fertility Age Test Plus, includes testing for the first three hormones and three tests for thyroid dysfunctions TSH, TPO (thyroperoxidase) and T3/T4. (triiodothironine and thyroxine levels) for a similar price.
Everlywell, a startup offering myriad home health tests, includes a similarly comprehensive fertility kit as Modern Fertility for $400, but with 11 hormone tests — and not all of them are the same ones.
Half the price for more hormone testing seems like a deal. However, there’s a hot debate among these startups over just how many of these hormone tests, and which ones, are necessary. Everlywell, for instance, doesn’t include AMH because they consider that only necessary if you are about to undergo IVF. Future Family told TechCrunch only the three key tests are necessary unless you need thyroid testing, because the other hormone tests “are widely accepted by doctors as not being true indicators of fertility.”

How does each startup determine what is necessary? Everlywell and Future Family are staffed with a chief medical officer to guide them. Modern Fertility is currently in search of the same, but says it pulls its information from medical advisors and has held initial conversations with fertility doctors.
Obviously, ask your doctor which kit is right for you (or if there’s another they suggest). The overall goal for all three is the same — empower women with knowledge about their fertility.
Modern Fertility’s main target is young women who want a family someday, but not necessarily today.
“We’re building a test that makes this info accessible to women early in their lives,” co-founder Afton Vechery said. “We believe that information is the first step.”
Vechery, who was a product lead at 23andMe before starting Modern Family, says she became interested in the space after doing some due diligence in the infertility space for a healthcare private equity firm earlier in her career.
“That’s when I learned the emotional aspect of infertility. It’s crazy to me that infertility is not seen as a medical condition in the majority of the U.S. and that such a small percentage of women get the education and services they need to start a family,” she said. “That’s the part that stuck with me.”
She then went through some testing at a clinic to find out more about her own fertility. That was an impactful moment for her. That is, until she got the $1,500 bill in the mail.
“As I started talking to more women it was clear there was a lot of anxiety over fertility but no way to afford to test it,” Vechery said. “Every woman should have access to this information that is a better predictor than just our ages.”
Modern Fertility is currently in Y Combinator’s latest batch. You can catch them later this month at YC Demo Day.
Here Be Dragons, an immersive production studio focused on virtual reality content, has closed a $10 million Series A round led by Discovery Communications with participation also coming from David Droga and David Jones. The raise sets the virtual reality studio’s valuation at $55 million pre-money, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.
As part of the round, Discovery exec Rebecca Howard will be joining Here Be Dragons’ board of directors.
While content bets are never all that simple (let alone ones focused on emerging technologies like VR), Here Be Dragons CEO Patrick Milling-Smith believes his company is in a great place after reaching profitability and working with partners like Nike, Samsung, The New York Times and GE.
The Series A raise will go toward building out some of the various divisions within the studio, Milling-Smith tells me, with a particular focus on creative development.
As consumers slowly get more comfortable with the idea of VR, the gimmicky nature has started to fade and the quality has had to improve, something that has made life harder for some resource-strapped studios, while lending established companies like Here Be Dragons the opportunity to take more risks. A lot of the companies HBD is working with have “really put the premium on the experience rather than the novelty,” Milling-Smith said.

The startup, whose mouthful-of-a-name is a reference to “dangerous and unexplored areas,” was founded in 2014 as the sister company of VR content platform Vrse, now Within. The companies occasionally collaborate, but operate independently, though they share a co-founder in filmmaker Chris Milk.
The startup has focused a great deal of its efforts on VR to date, but is increasingly looking toward augmented reality experiences as well, having just debuted a project at Comic-Con with FX that utilized the Microsoft HoloLens. Milling-Smith is also excited about seeing the potential of phone-based AR systems like what will be enabled by Apple’s upcoming ARKit, which he says will lead to “so much more innovation and so many more people creating content.”
Hyundai is working with the South Korean government to use the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as a demonstration event for the automakers self-driving tech. The conditions will be challenging, however, since the roads will be winding and with significant grades, and the hope at least is that there will be plenty of snow – a notorious enemy of sensors used in self-driving tech. Hyundai will use HD maps to overcome these challenges, according to Korea’s etnews.
The maps used for the self-driving deployment will have resolution with less than 10 cm margin of error, which is the “world’s best” according to the company when it comes to these kinds of HD maps. It’ll help supplement the on-vehicle sensors, and the mapping itself is being done by Hyundai’s MNsoft subsicdiatiry, which is using LiDAR and radar to build a high-resolution point cloud of the area, which is supplemented by images captured by 4 cameras at a rate of 200 pictures per second.
Hyundai demonstrated its HD mapping tech this year at CES, using Ioniq hybrid cars that were meant to show how the automaker could bring autonomous tech to market with a vehicle that has fewer specialized sensors and could therefore be made affordably for everyday consumers.
The Olympics are shaping up to be a key demonstration event for forthcoming autonomous vehicle tech: Hyundai plans to show of its SAE Level 4 capabilities next year in Pyeongchang, and Toyota is also set to show off its own autonomous cars during the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.
Roivant Sciences, a three-year-old, Basel, Switzerland-based company aiming to one day be a giant holding company for dozens of independent biopharmaceutical companies, has raised $1.1 billion in equity led by the SoftBank Vision Fund — making it the latest in a string of enormous bets by SoftBank, and putting the young outfit more squarely on the radar of the tech world.
Roivant focuses on developing and commercializing therapies by creating subsidiaries, all of which involve the word “vant.” To date, these include Axovant Sciences, which is focused on neurology; Myovant Sciences, which is focused on women’s health and endocrine diseases; Dermavant Sciences, which is focused on dermatology; Enzyvant Sciences, which is focused on rare diseases; and Urovant Sciences, focused on urology.
Roivant also is creating a new tech-focused subsidiary for the first time, called Datavant, an AI-driven initiative that’s aiming to unlock insights in healthcare data sets by improving the design of clinical trials, creating virtual trials between similar drugs using pooled placebo groups, and developing new molecular targets to pursue for any given drug.
SoftBank’s investment is in Roivant only — not its subsidiaries.
Roivant was founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, a biology major at Harvard who went on to nab his law degree from Yale before going to work as a hedge fund analyst, where he says he noticed pharmaceutical firms abandoning promising drugs for various reasons having nothing to do with their efficacy.
Seeing an opportunity to complete the development of some of these overlooked drug candidates and get them to market quickly, Ramaswamy struck out on his own in 2014.
One of his first moves was to acquire an Alzheimer’s pill from GlaxoSmithKline as it was dialing down its neuroscience research, forming Axovant around it. It is still awaiting Phase 3 results from that pill, now named intepirdine. Nevertheless, based on promising early results, Roivant took the company public in 2015, and it was the biggest biotech IPO of the year, raising $360 million. (Its shares, which opened at $15, currently trade at $23.)
In 2016, Roivant also took public Myovant Sciences and it, too, was the biggest biotech IPO of the year. The drug candidate around which the company is centered is called relugolix; it aims to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids and reportedly “aced” a mid-stage trial that ended in the spring.
Roivant’s giant new investment includes participation from earlier backers; these include the hedge fund Viking Global Investors, which last year provided Roivant with an undisclosed amount of funding that Ramaswamy described to us earlier this year as “one of the largest, if not the largest, private financing of a biotech company in history.”
Roivant also raised earlier funding from the hedge fund QVT Financial in New York, where Ramaswamy once worked, and Dexcel Pharma, an Israeli firm.
The investment, while jaw-dropping, is a drop in the bucket for SoftBank, which is busily working to close its Vision Fund with $100 billion and aggressively committing its capital in the meantime. For example, according to the WSJ, the SoftBank Vision Fund is also closing a $1 billion investment in the online sports retail company Fanatics.
SoftBank’s many other recent investments include Plenty, a startup specializing in vertical farming that raised $200 million from the Vision Fund last month; Brain Corp, an AI company working on tech for self-driving robots that announced a $114 million investment from the fund on the same day; Improbable, a virtual reality startup that raised $500 million in May from the fund; the cancer detection company Guardant Health, which raised $360 million from the fund in May; and the self-driving car startup Nauto, which raised $159 million in June in a round led by the Vision Fund and GM.
Earlier this  year, this editor hosted Ramaswamy at an intimate San Francisco event where we talked more about Roivant, including how it pays for the drug candidates it buys and where it finds the teams who lead its subsidiaries. You can check out that sit-down below to learn more.
Business intelligence and analytics firm Tableau today announced that it has acquired ClearGraph, a service that lets you query and visualize large amounts of business date through natural language queries (think “this week’s transactions over $500”). Tableau expects to integrate this technology with its own products as it looks to make it easier for its users to use similar queries to visualize their data.
Typically, you’d have to know SQL or a similar database query language to pull information out of most enterprise databases. Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning now allow services like ClearGraph to understand more about the underlying database and then take these sentences and essentially translate them into database queries. Given that Microsoft’s Power BI and other competitors already offer this capability, it’s no surprise that Tableau is also looking into this (though Tableau argues that — unlike the likes of Microsoft — it can be a neutral party given that it has no investment in any particular cloud or on-premise technology outside of its own).
Indeed, Tableau’s Chief Product Officer Francois Ajenstat tells me that the company actually started an internal project to build a conversational interface for its service. To build this, though, Tableau would have had to put a lot of infrastructure in place and ClearGraph had already done all of this work.
ClearGraph was founded in 2014 (and it was previously called Argo and Arktos) and the company says that it currently has “dozens” of customers, including a number of large enterprises. While the company doesn’t disclose who its customers are (which is not unusual in the enterprise space), Ajenstat tells me that they include financial institutions, retailers and major internet companies. As Ajenstat noted, every company today struggles to make its data accessible to more of its employees, so it doesn’t come as a surprise that ClearGraph’s customers span a wide range of verticals.

Existing ClearGraph customers won’t notice any immediate changes, but, over time, once it has integrated this new technology, Tableau will likely transition them to its own platform.
Ajenstat also believes that this new technology will help his company reach a wider range of users. “Even though Tableau is top in its class for ease of use, it’s about expanding the number of users who can analyze data in the enterprise,” he told me. He also noted that while this next group of potential users may be casual users, their questions aren’t simple — and that’s where Tableau thinks ClearGraph’s natural language processing technology will help it succeed.
The ClearGraph team will join Tableau’s Palo Alto office and focus on integrating its technology with Tableau’s.
The company declined to disclose the purchase price, but ClearGraph raised a total of $1.53 million from Accel Partners before the acquisition.
Buoy, a startup using an intelligent algorithm backed by medical data to guess what ails you, has raised $6.7 million in Series A funding from F-Prime Capital Partners, FundRx and various angel investors to help scale operations.
The startup debuted in March of this year to take on WebMD and other online symptom checkers with an algorithm it believes can more accurately diagnose patients. Founder and Harvard-trained MD Andrew Le told TechCrunch at the time he had implemented “a battery of tests” and conducted “a series of studies” to ensure Buoy’s accuracy.
His plan at the time was to onboard both consumers and hospital organizations to swiftly process patients before they see a doctor. Buoy claims it has experienced rapid growth since then and that more than over a quarter of a million people have used the platform.
Buoy will use this round of financing to invest in maintaining that growth in a few key areas, including the recruitment of additional clinical researchers, engineers and marketers and to build integrations with hospitals and providers. FundRx will also supply the startup with physicians for a new medical board.
“The team at Buoy has taken an innovative approach to solving the problem of health symptom search,” said Carl Byers, executive partner at F-Prime. “By engaging patients intelligently at the moment they experience symptoms, Buoy can deliver triage at scale in a way that can be adopted seamlessly within the healthcare system as a new digital front door to the care journey.”
Sony said today that it has finished developing a digital system for storing and managing educational records on the blockchain. The Japanese firm is now looking to commercialize the product, in partnership with selected educational institutions, next year.
The idea — which was first announced 18 months ago — is to make use of the blockchain as a centralized ledger for storing educational information, such as degrees, diplomas, tests and more, as a kind of ‘digital transcript.’ Sony said the system has been developed to prevent fraud, while providing access to third-parties for job interviews and assessment among other purposes.
The idea is to improve on current practice of storing candidate education histories within individual schools and institutions themselves, which requires records to be shared over email or by a physical copy. It believes that there’s a modern alternative. Sony’s blockchain-based system instead allows data from various institutions to mix together, making it more convenient and easier to share or track a person’s ‘live’ resume.
For example, securing partnerships with universities and high schools would mean candidates school and graduation records are baked into their profile and accessible to third parties, such as when applying for jobs or further education. Then there is the potential to add bespoke testing and other information.
Beyond making it easier to share information, Sony said also that the stored data sets could potentially be analyzed using AI to provide feedback and improvement ideas for educational institutions and their curriculums and management.
That’s the theory for now, and it of course requires execution to get the product to market and deliver on its potential. To that end, Sony said it is aiming to partner with educational institutions and “tailor the service to their needs.” The goal is a live launch sometime next year, but it will trial the new system for its Global Math Challenge, a worldwide competition that takes place later this year.
The system is managed by Sony Global Education, and is built on top of IBM Blockchain using IBM’s Cloud and The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 framework.
What’s particularly notable about the project is that Sony believes it can be expanded into other areas of digital asset management, including IoT, logistics, digital content, real estate and (more obviously) cryptocurrencies.

A month after committing to help WeWork enter Japan, SoftBank is lending a hand to another global unicorn with its sights set on the country. Today, it announced a tie-in that will bring Ofo’s dock-less bike rental service to Japanese soil.
Ofo, which has raised more than $1 billion from investors such as Alibaba, Didi Chuxing and DST Global, claims over 100 million registered users and eight million bikes, each of which can be left anywhere and hired by scanning an attached QR code via the Ofo app.
Ofo will work with SoftBank C&S — the firm’s division responsible for IOT, robotics and the cloud — on the Japan launch. The initial plan is to bring Ofo’s bikes to Tokyo and Osaka in September ahead of a presumably wider expansion that will happen at a later date.
“Launching in Japan is a huge milestone for Ofo. In a country where there is a strong
cycling culture, we strive to further improve the convenience and cost-effectiveness that
cycling can bring to people in Japan,” Ofo’s head of APAC Lawrence Cao said in a statement.



Ofo CTO Austin Zhang explains how to unlock a dock-less bike
Unlike the WeWork deal there is no financial aspect to this partnership — at this time, at least. There are already plenty of synergies though. SoftBank has made a number of investments alongside Alibaba, which led Ofo’s most recent $700 million funding round, and it is an investor in Didi, which backed Ofo last year.
Indeed, media reports in recent weeks have speculated that SoftBank may lead a new $1 billion-plus round for Ofo so this Japan launch could mark the start of a longer term relationship between the two.
Ofo is targeting an ambitious goal of reaching 200 cities in total by the end of this year. It hit 100 locations — which was its original goal for this year — within the first half of 2017, with most of those areas being in China. Now it is looking overseas with an aggressive slate of launches likely to come. So far, its international expansion plans have seen it enter, or get close to entering, the UK, Singapore, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and now Japan.

The EFF has filed a court filing pressing for warrants be required for searches of mobile phones, laptops and other digital devices by federal agents at international airports and U.S. land borders — describing these as “highly intrusive forays into travelers’ private information”.
It’s urging that searches of digital devices should only be possible when a border agent has obtained a signed warrant from a judge.
Such searches are currently allowed under an exception to the Fourth Amendment for routine immigration and customs enforcement. However, the EFF says digital device searches at the U.S. border have more than doubled since the inauguration of President Trump.
It also points out that increasing numbers of people carry such devices when traveling — arguing both factors highlight the need for stronger privacy rights while crossing the U.S. border.
In July, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency also clarified that its policy allowing warrantless border searches is restricted to locally stored data — meaning cloud services cannot be legally searched without a warrant.
However the average device owner still likely holds a lot of data on their devices, from documents, to offline email to smartphone photos and videos.
“Our cell phones and laptops provide access to an unprecedented amount of detailed, private information, often going back many months or years, from emails to our coworkers to photos of our loved ones and lists of our closest contacts. This is light years beyond the minimal information generally contained in other kinds of personal items we might carry in our suitcases,” said EFF staff attorney Sophia Cope, in a statement.
“It’s time for courts and the government to acknowledge that examining the contents of a digital device is highly intrusive, and Fourth Amendment protections should be strong, even at the border.”
In addition, the filing makes the point that it can be difficult for border agents to distinguish between data held in the cloud and data stored locally on a device — noting how cloud data can “appear as a seamless part of the digital device when presented at the border”.
The EFF has filed the brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in U.S. v. Molina-Isidoro. In that case the defendant, Maria Isabel Molina-Isidoro’s, cell phone was manually searched at the border, and data from the search was used to support a prosecution for attempting to import methamphetamine into the country.
In the filing, the EFF notes that border agents opened the defendant’s Uber and WhatsApp apps when they searched her device — implying that cloud data may have been accessed as part of the search. “There is no indication that border agents put her phone in airplane mode or otherwise disconnected it from the Internet when they accessed these apps,” the filing states.
The document also refers to the Supreme Court holding that police require a warrant to search the content of a phone seized during an arrest — with the EFF arguing the same principle should apply to the digital devices seized at the border.
“In sum, portable digital devices differ wildly from luggage and other physical items a person possesses when entering or leaving the country. Now is the time to acknowledge the full force of the privacy implications of border searches of digital devices. As the Supreme Court said, “It would be foolish to contend that the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the Fourth Amendment has been entirely unaffected by the advance of technology,” it adds.

If you’re sick of politics, sport and general world news then you’re probably best off avoiding social media altogether.
But if you want to have your cake and eat it, there is another option to prevent unwanted items filling up your precious timeline on Twitter. Try Mute, a way to quickly mute 100 words from Twitter as chosen by the wisdom of people on the internet — aka crowdsourced.
Twitter has long supported muting words, but Mute makes it easy to really get into the feature. Its Mute.life website lists 100 keywords that have been added and then voted on by visitors to form a ranked list. By installing a bookmark in your (Google Chrome) browser, Mute can be used to automatically add those top 100 words into your muted word list for Twitter.
To get started, visit Mute.life and follow the instructions on the left-side of the screen. You can mute individual words, but the process behind that is pretty cumbersome since it involves copy-paste and manual entry. A better approach may be uploading the full 100 and then removing those you words that you don’t want to mute. Consider Mute the starting point.


✨ Bookmarklet that auto adds Top 100 words to Muted Words list on Twitter, no idea how I got this to work, I'm in 😲 https://t.co/gLN5AqesaG pic.twitter.com/hFK83p9Ba6
— Pieter Levels (@levelsio) August 9, 2017



I took Mute — which was created by nomadic developer Pieter Levels — for a spin and it worked as advised. Within a few minutes I had 100 muted words set up.
The only problem was the crowd — the main selling point — since many of the words I had muted weren’t topics that I wanted to banish from my timeline altogether.

There’s not going to be much left in my timeline if I mute all of these
That said, I’m not really the target audience here. I can’t remember muting any/many keywords over the years. But, if you’re someone who is looking to make use of Twitter’s mute feature, then this service gives you a jump start at doing that.
Levels said on Product Hunt that he is working to bring Mute to Facebook — that’s certainly a feature that would appeal to more people, so we’ll stay tuned on that.
Update: Facebook muting is now supported too — full details on the website here.
Railsbank, a relatively new fintech startup co-founded by CEO Nigel Verdon, who previously founded money exchange and payments platform Currencycloud, has raised $1.2 million in a funding round led by seed investment firm Firestartr.
The company, yet to see its full launch and over a year in the making, offers what it describes as an open banking and compliance platform aimed at other companies, including other fintechs, that have global banking requirements that need to be accessed programatically via an API.
Other backers in this round include Kima Ventures and a number of notable angel investors such as Peter Jackson (CEO WorldPay U.K.), Tim Levene (Betfair, Augmentum Capital) and Phillip Riese (former Chairman of Zopa).
It follows an earlier angel investment in September last year, including from the former head of Google Wallet in Europe who, I’m told, wanted something akin to Railsbank when he was running Google Wallet. That’s because the unnamed bank Google Wallet ran on top of could not easily deliver on the promise of pan-European banking via an API.
“The problem with accessing global or regional wholesale transaction banking services from traditional suppliers (e.g. HSBC, Citi, BAML, Deutsche etc.) is that it takes 3-9 months to open each bank account, up to 9 months to technically connect (as each API is bespoke to the customer) and customers have to sink vast Capex expenditure to make this happen, before a single transaction is done. That is if the bank will even bank you!” Verdon tells me.
The main issues behind this holdup and expense is legacy technology that most incumbent banks run on, and the thorny issue of compliance. The latter means that friction isn’t just caused by technology alone but the need to comply with the law and cumbersome systems in place to ensure global banking does so. “Neither are changing anytime soon,” teases Verdon.
It is here — at the intersection of technology and compliance, and by using technology to scale compliance — that Verdon and Railsbank’s other founder Clive Mitchell, who is also a fintech veteran, see an opportunity. The resulting banking and compliance platform connects together a global network of partner banks for companies who want API access to global banking. “Access to global transaction banking with 5 lines of code,” akin to something like Stripe for banking, is the Railsbank mantra.
Specifically, the platform provides companies with a range of wholesale banking services, including IBANs, receiving money, sending money, converting money, direct debit, issuing cards, and managing credit through APIs. “Our tech solves the legacy issue by hiding it,” explains Verdon.
However, along with the Railsbank CEO’s insistence internally that its API should be considered its UX — since developers are the startup’s end user — the secret sauce is that compliance has been baked in from the start. This sees all transactions that are initiated through the platform stay in line with compliance policy enforced through what Railsbank calls its unique “Compliance Firewall”.
“For the first time the partner and/or customer’s compliance manual is live and active and not a PDF stuck in a drawer,” claims Verdon. “Every transaction (on-boarding, opening an account, receiving money, sending money, issuing a card, issuing credit etc.) has to pass through the Compliance Firewall and has to comply with compliance policy”.
To that end, the types of companies or fintech startups that could utilise Railsbank are far-ranging and Verdon says that every day the company is discovering new use-cases. (It offers a sandbox, including live account generation, to try out the platform.)
One example is a regulated investment company that needs modern API access to its banking. This could include creating accounts, receiving money, sending money etc, so that they can implement straight through processing.
Another is a lender that wants to offer a ‘banking lite’ current account to gain more data on an individual customer’s behaviour to lower the lending risk and possibly even the lending rates.
Or perhaps an Amazon merchant who wants to sell on Amazon’s European stores but needs to demonstrate compliance controls to a banking partner. They could use Railsbank to show they only accept money from Amazon including surfacing Amazon Marketplace data (via Amazon’s API) on what goods were sold for each Amazon settlement.

Tales of internet trolls and worse things are common to hear about — that is, if you’re not experiencing their effects yourself, as many are. But while those stories often end in the victim uselessly soliciting the help of Facebook management or clueless law enforcement, this one ends up with the perpetrator in question, a low-rent script kiddie who targeted girls, completely owned by the FBI.
The case of Buster Hernandez, alias Brian Kil, is a welcome breath of fresh air — while at the same time it’s a sobering reminder that people like him are a common threat and many do get away with it, as he vainly boasted he would.
The story is this: Hernandez, a 26-year-old who lives in Bakersfield, California, would track down the subjects of nude pictures acquired from compromised cloud accounts, forcing them to send him more under the threat of having them all released publicly. While this case in particular concerned high school girls in Plainfield, Indiana, he is alleged of having victims in “at least 10 federal districts” over the last five years.
The FBI got involved on December 15, 2015, after Hernandez (as “Brian Kil”) had already extorted a number of images and videos of one underage girl and posted them on Facebook. The images were accompanied by a graphic, threatening message of the mass-shooter variety that I won’t quote here; suffice it to say it’s just as full of the horrifying sexism and racism one finds in these pathetic manifestos. It was enough to cause the schools to close and the police to ask for help from the feds.
Facebook served up the data on “Brian Kil” in short order, but it was an anonymous email and the IP associated with the account was a Tor node. Posing as the victim, agents made contact with “Kil” and he further berated the victim and her mother, asking for apologies — regarding what, it isn’t clear.
A few days later, he posted another threat, this time to a mall, which was also then closed. He blamed the threats on the victim, saying it could have been avoided if she’d apologized. This type of post and messaging continued through the end of January on various platforms, always anonymized via Tor.
By that time he’d attempted to force another victim to go to a community meeting organized in Plainfield to discuss the problem, and posted in the comments teasing and threatening the parents and teachers of the town. At the same time, he was forcing another underage girl, this one in Michigan, to send him explicit images and video.
In February, on a new account, Hernandez wrote a new post explaining that he never intended to kill anyone and that he had faked the images showing the victim nude (the FBI report suggests otherwise). He told people it was all just a game to him and they should “suck it up.”
It took a little longer than that, but they didn’t take the L.
In June of 2017, over a year later, the FBI was given the go-ahead from a judge to use a “Network Investigative Technique” — basically the kind of officially sanctioned malware we’ve seen exposed in various leaks. This one added a code snippet to a video file that caused any computer that played that video to contact an FBI server and report its real IP address.
Hernandez was in the process of extorting one of the victims, and the FBI slipped the video into a Dropbox account he had provided for her to put her media into. He opened it immediately and his true IP was revealed to the investigators. Perhaps he perceived this somehow, as he immediately began sending death threats to the victim and her family (top image).
That IP, it turns out, belonged to a Bakersfield resident, and the FBI began tapping it a few days later. Sure enough, it was connecting to Tor, and agents also intercepted what appeared to be child pornography.
A camera was installed on July 19 outside the residence associated with the IP, and the comings and goings at the house were monitored. Investigators found that a woman they’d identified as the legal resident left around 7 AM — at which point whoever was left in the house began connecting to Tor. On July 20, a man was observed taking out the garbage. On August 1, an arrest warrant was issued for Buster Hernandez. He faces a minimum of 15 years if convicted on all counts.
It’s nice to see justice served here, however cold, and it’s a good example of how those various cyberwarfare tools might get put to use in a domestic case. Every time an overconfident internet scumbag gets caught like this, the others think a little harder before pulling the same stunts. Hernandez may be one of myriad, but even one less villain blackmailing kids and threatening schools is something to be proud of.
You can read the whole saga in the FBI filing, but be warned that it contains some pretty disturbing stuff.
BAMTech, the company that powers streaming for MLB, HBO, NHL, WWE, and now, Disney’s and ESPN’s upcoming streaming services, is valued at $3.75 billion following Disney’s new investment. This afternoon, Disney announced it would acquire an additional 42 percent stake in the streaming infrastructure provider for $1.58 billion.
The company last year had invested $1 billion in BAMTech, giving it a minority stake (33%).
The earlier deal had included an option that would allow Disney to acquire a majority stake over several years, and it’s fairly telling that the company has chosen to exercise that option so soon.
Disney now owns 75 percent of the company that will power its shift into streaming.
Even Disney admitted the move was “an acceleration of that timetable for controlling ownership” – a signal that consumer adoption of streaming services over traditional TV is moving at a much more rapid pace than perhaps expected.
BAMTech itself is a spin-out from MLBAM (MLB Advanced Media), MLB’s digital media business. MLBAM operates the official website at MLB.com and related properties, as well as the popular MLB At Bat mobile application, among other things. Video streaming, however, became such a big business that BAMTech was approved to become its own entity back in August 2015.
The business has long since grown beyond being a streaming technology provider for baseball.
The company has also been tasked with powering streaming for HBO NOW, the National Hockey League, the PGA Tour, the WE Network, and others.
When Disney bought a minority interest in the company last summer, BAMTech began to work in the streaming infrastructure needed to run a new ESPN streaming service. (It was already powering WatchESPN, as one of its many clients.)
That new streaming service was also announced today, and will include approximately 10,000 live regional, national, and international games and events a year. It will feature events from Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, and college sports. ESPN said individual packages will be available for purchase, too, including MLB.TV, NHL.TV and MLS Live.
The service will launch in 2018, and be accessible through an upgraded version of ESPN’s app. The new app will let pay TV subscribers also watch ESPN’s networks, but cord cutters would not have that option.
Disney’s deal to own the infrastructure player behind its next big investments in streaming is a smart move, especially as it dares to go head-to-head with Netflix, which has promised to spend $6 billion on original content in 2017. It also just made its first acquisition by picking up a comics book publisher and its IP – a move meant to head off Disney’s plans to go head-to-head with Netflix, that will see it keeping its next big super hero franchise for itself.
Though Disney doing a streaming service is huge news, it’s not the first time the company has dabbled with digital delivery of its content. It has its own Disney Movies Anywhere app that lets it sell its content direct to consumers for viewing on any device. And it had already dipped its toe into the streaming business with the limited launch of its subscription video platform DisneyLife back in 2015.
But DisneyLife is only live in the UK. Disney’s new service will be global, and will go live in 2019 – just when Disney has the rights to pull its content from Netflix, apparently, as that’s just what it’s doing. BAMTech will power this too.
BAMTech’s rise and now its control by Disney has come incredibly fast. Only two years ago, the company was spun out of MLBAM. A year after that, Disney bought a minority stake. And now, just about two years after becoming its own entity, Disney controls it.
As a result of Disney’s deal, BAMTech’s originator, MLBAM, will own just 15 percent of the streaming technology company. It has not given up any stake in the MLBAM digital media business, however.

Disney announced this afternoon that it’s doing the inevitable. It’s launching its own streaming service in 2019, and will pull its movies from Netflix that same year. But this is not Disney’s first streaming service, as you might recall –  just the first that will be available to consumers in the U.S. The company is already running an on-demand subscription video service for Disney movies called DisneyLife, which has been live in the U.K. since 2015, in addition to being briefly available in China.
DisneyLife was seen as a way for Disney to experiment with streaming, before a larger public launch.
This not only includes being able to test out the underlying infrastructure for such an endeavour, but also what sort of content users respond to, what features they want, how parental controls should work, and so on. On DisneyLife, consumers pay a small monthly fee that lets families of up to six stream Disney movies, TV shows, even music, audiobooks and e-books online, on mobile devices, and to TVs through AirPlay and Chromecast.
If anything, DisneyLife is very much like a Disney-flavored Netflix, and could be looked to as an example of what’s to come.
At the time of its launch, a suggestion from The FT was that the platform powering DisneyLife could eventually be repurposed for other streaming services in the future – even those dedicated to Disney’s Marvel or Star Wars franchises, if Disney chose.
But DisneyLife is not powered by BAMTech, the streaming infrastructure provider that Disney just effectively took over. With today’s announcement of its $1.58 billion investment (pending regulatory approval), Disney will own 75 percent of BAMTech.
Disney already had a minority stake in BAMTech which it bought for $1 billion last year – a deal that had also given it the option to buy a controlling interest in the coming years, the company said at the time.
BAMTech will power the new Disney streaming service in 2019, as well as next year’s streaming sports service from Disney-owned ESPN.

However, the idea that Marvel and LucasFilm (Star Wars!) content could remain separate from Disney’s streaming service plans is something that’s still on the table. Disney’s announcement today fails to mention any Marvel or Star Wars titles in its list of upcoming movies for the new service. And Disney later confirmed on its earnings call that it’s still figuring out how to handle the licensing for these titles – it might continue traditional third-party deals, or it might add them to the Disney service.
Today, Disney simply touts that its new service will include the “newest live action and animated movies from Disney and Pixar.” It specifically lists titles like “Toy Story 4,” the “Frozen” sequel, and the live action version of “The Lion King,” as expected content.
The service will be fleshed out with original programming, too, thanks to what the company says will be increased investments in original movies, TV shows, and other short-form content, the company says. Plus, it will include “other Disney-branded exclusives” (which isn’t well explained).
Also of interest, if Disney does in fact take ideas learned from DisneyLife to build its new service, it could have a live TV component. On DisneyLife, users can watch the Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Disney Junior live. Disney didn’t say that will be the case on its new service, but does note that these three channels’ programming will be included.
The service’s pricing and availability is still unknown. Disney said it will be a global offering, but will respect its deals already in place in various markets.
Back in 2003, Valerie Plame was working for the CIA overseas trying to protect the world from rogue nuclear proliferation — nothing too important or anything. Unbeknownst to her, she was about to become a pawn in a dangerous political game between the CIA and the Bush White House. It eventually escalated to the point where her identity was publicly exposed by an unnamed White House source as a covert operative in a July 2003 Robert Novak column in The Washington Post.
At the time, the Bush administration was searching for evidence that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was building weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) as rationale for sending U.S. troops into the country. Plame’s husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, investigated a rumor that Iraq had been buying yellowcake uranium, a building block for nuclear weapons. Wilson found no such evidence. The White House didn’t like the answer, and that started the ball rolling that would eventually unveil Plame.
Plame, of course wanted nothing more than to keep her identity secret, so she could do her job. When her name showed up in that Novak column, her professional life as she had known it would quickly come to an end. She obviously couldn’t operate as a spy in the open.
“It was devastating. I loved my career. I was proud to serve my country. I had a great sense of satisfaction doing nuclear counter proliferation and my name was exposed for partisan reasons,” Plame told TechCrunch in a recent interview.
Trying times
She explained that it was a difficult time for her and her family. Plame and her husband were being impugned by powerful political forces. It taught her a valuable lesson about privacy, one that is even more applicable in the internet age. “My take is, privacy is precious,” she said. “I think privacy is the last true luxury. To be able to live your life as you choose without having everyone comment on it or know about.”
Even in 2003, long before Twitter and Facebook, Plame and her family had to endure the white-hot media spotlight. Photographers camped outside her house. As she put it, “It consumed Washington.” The story was later told in the 2010 movie Fair Game with Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.
I think privacy is the last true luxury. To be able to live your life as you choose without having everyone comment on it or know about.— Valerie Plame
We who work in the technology industry tend to think of identity differently than the rest of the world. For us, it’s about having the correct credentials to access computers, systems and services. If you can prove you’re you, you’re in. For that reason, you want to keep those credentials secret — and too often they are stolen.
Plame was a keynote speaker in June at the Cloud Identity Summit in Chicago, a conference that explores in depth the concept of computer identity. She sees a connection between what happened to her and computer identity. “To be able to protect identity and make sure it belongs to the human it’s attached to, for all sorts of reasons, is crucial,” she said.
Security vs. privacy
Then there is the issue of privacy on the internet. Plame is certainly in a position to understand the tension between security and privacy, perhaps better than anyone, both because of her CIA background and what happened to her when her name was revealed. It’s telling that she is under no illusions.
“There are two sides [to privacy]: the corporate side, which is doing this to sell you more [stuff]. Then there is the government area and a whole other area with the NSA and their efforts to keep us safe — and it has spilled over into privacy. There is an ongoing tension between security and privacy,” she says.
But she warns that Americans shouldn’t be too trusting of the government, even when they seem to be conducting surveillance for the right reasons. She said the Snowden revelations jump- started the conversation about how much information we think the government should be collecting about us.
“[Surveillance] is an enduring fact of modern life. Americans [seem to be] cool with Americans seeing their stuff. I don’t think they understand implications. When they have that much information, historically we have seen that they don’t handle it as carefully as one might hope,” she said.
Further, she sees that same tension when it comes to protecting identity. We want to protect access to our accounts online, but at the same time, we don’t want to jump through hoops to achieve that. She said there is always someone trying to steal those identities, but at the same time we don’t want to enter a 15-digit password to access our bank account. Perhaps, she jokes, it would be better to buy a farm and go off the grid.
While that probably isn’t possible for her or her family at this point, who have learned to live in the spotlight, at least on occasion, she does understand the implications of privacy and identity, perhaps better than anyone. When she was exposed, it truly was a matter of life and death.

There’s a lot of talk about the quantified self, but one of the grey areas remains working out your levels of stress. Usually this requires hardware devices. Now a New York-based startup thinks it’s come up with an approach based on specially developed algorithms and machine learning using simple heartbeat readings taken with a smartphone app.
Welltory (iOS, Android) has also now closed its second investment round, raising $1 million from business angels. This is being used to launch the next version of the app, which is aimed at cutting down your stress levels and boosting your productivity. Luckily the app is, in my opinion, a joy to use in terms of interface and over-all usability.
Here’s their idea: Google Analytics for humans, complete with AB-testing features and KPI goals. The idea is to work out the effect of how, for instance, morning meditation, working from home or a diet change might affect stress and energy levels. You then keep what works for you and discard what doesn’t.
While the main measurement comes through measuring your heartbeat, using the same PPG technology found in most pulse oximeters, it then applies variability algorithms to assess the state of the “autonomic nervous system” — the body’s stress and recovery regulation center. That’s how they come up with stress and energy levels.
In fact, this is the same technique used by professionals in sports. The Red Wings hockey team relies on HRV analysis to track training and recovery with Firstbeat. Similarly, NBA players like DeAndre Jordan and Matthew Dellavedova wear HRV-based WHOOPs during games.

But Welltory is aiming to bring this kind of monitoring to the masses.
Competitors in this space are usually hardware-based, such as the aforementioned WHOOP (which is a $500 device) and Firstbeat, which has several hardware partners.
Welltory is free as a basic version, but the paid version of the Welltory app has a Quantified Self Dashboard, which lets users collect data about their lifestyles.
It also can be synced with fitness trackers and Fitbits, Apple Health and Google Fit to collect data about sleep, nutrition and physical activity. It also supports RescueTime (a desktop-based productivity tracker), home weather stations that track your surroundings and more.
Over time it generates charts for you to work out correlations between behaviors. So for instance, you can see if walking an extra mile a day helps stress levels, or see if meditation sessions are affected by the weather that day.
Jane Smorodnikova, co-founder, says the “Quantified Self” remains a mystery to most, so bringing all the data together in one interface helps explain it. “They can see how their activity influences their stress, how many hours of sleep they need to recover properly and what lifestyle habits influence their productivity at work. Stress and energy measurements is the key that connects the dots of your lifestyle data and makes it easy to get real insights.”
Welltory says it currently has 125,000 users and 650,000+ heart rate variability measurements. It’s also got a healthy growth in paid users.
Co-founders Alexander Lyskovsky, Jane Smorodnikova and Pavel Pravdin are all quantified self aficionados who come from engineering backgrounds who wanted an approach based on science and hard data. They were advised by Professor Roman Baevsky, a space medicine expert who is currently a consultant at NASA and the Mars 500 project, who applied heart rate variability to the space program in the 1960s.
The U.S. International Trade Commission is investigating Qualcomm’s claims that Apple is violating several of its patents related to mobile technologies in several of its iPhone models. Qualcomm is seeking a ban on imports of the iPhone models that allegedly infringe on its IP.
Earlier this year, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, alleging that the company was collecting royalties on patents that it had “nothing to do with.” In April, Apple announced that it would no longer be paying Qualcomm any royalties as it pursued legal action against them.
Last month, Qualcomm filed suit alleging that Apple was currently infringing on six patents that helped improve battery life on some iPhone models.
It’s important to note that this is really just the U.S. agency admitting that they’re taking a look at Qualcomm’s claims, with the USITC noting specifically that it “has not yet made any decision on the merits of the case.”
The admission of an investigation from USITC is still good news for Qualcomm, which has been suffering as the legal spat with Apple dramatically affects its bottom line. In its most recent earnings release, the company reported a 40 percent decline in year-over-year profit, with revenue sliding 11.1 percent as well. Qualcomm’s collection of royalties makes up a substantial percentage of its broader business.
“Qualcomm is pleased with the ITC’s decision to investigate Apple’s unfair trade practices and
the unauthorized importation of products using Qualcomm’s patents,” said Qualcomm exec Don Rosenberg in a statement. “We look forward to the ITC’s expeditious investigation of Apple’s ongoing infringement of our intellectual property and the accelerated relief that the Commission can provide.”
We have reached out to Apple for comment.

Diego Gomes is the publisher of SaaSholic, a blog about the growing SaaS market in Brazil and the software sector’s founders. He is the co-founder and CMO of Rock Content, the largest content marketing company in Brazil, and former editor of the ReadWriteWeb blog in Brazil. 




The SaaS market in Brazil is booming. It mirrors the rapid adoption of SaaS as the dominant cloud computing type in a global public cloud services market that’s forecast to reach more than $122 billion in 2017, per research firm IDC. Earlier this year, we embarked on an inaugural survey of more than 400 executives of Brazil-based SaaS companies, the largest research project of its kind in the region.
Here is just one founding story of a Brazilian SaaS startup called RD Station that’s indicative of the growth and fast-changing landscape of the SaaS market in Latin America’s largest country as new VC and corporate venture investment in Brazil continues to rise:
Eric Santos launched his first SaaS startup in 2011 alongside co-founders André Siqueira, Bruno Ghisi, Pedro Bachiega and Guilherme Lopes. They set up a small office in Florianópolis, the capital of southern Brazil’s Santa Catarina state. The team entered a crowded space of marketing automation with a nimble, but strikingly simple SaaS platform. It featured a landing-page creator, a metrics dashboard and an email marketing platform. But they understood the challenges of the Brazilian marketer and gained initial traction through a blog and community meetups.
Business growth was slow in the beginning, but steady. It took the small team about two and a half years to reach the R$1 million (about US$300,000) in annual recurring revenues (ARR). To help accelerate its growth, the early-stage startup raised a Series A round in 2013.
Fast-forward to 2017: RD Station has expanded exponentially. It now offers a full-featured marketing automation platform. Its annual conference attracts 10,000 marketers to Florianópolis. Today, they’ve grown from a small, bootstrapped startup with just five founders to 450 employees and more than 9,000 customers in just six years. With this kind of growth, it attracted local investors such as DGF, Astella and Redpoint eventures. More recently, international VCs TPG Growth and Endeavor Catalyst have invested. The company’s total funding today is north of US$30 million and RD Station is growing more than 150 percent year-over-year, an impressive number as only one-third of Brazilian SaaS startups achieve this kind of growth at this stage, per our research study.
A familiar tale for SaaS founders in Brazil
Many Brazilian SaaS entrepreneurs share a similar story. The local market is growing at an accelerated pace. Every other week, we’re seeing new local and foreign VCs investing. Brazil is the fifth-largest internet and mobile economy in the world, and one of the primary international markets for juggernauts such as Google and Facebook. Like the evolution of the internet in the U.S., businesses in Brazil are increasingly online and seeking SaaS solutions.
Brazil is the fifth-largest internet and mobile economy in the world.
According to Manoel Lemos, a managing director of VC firm Redpoint eventures, SaaS is now a sizable opportunity for Brazilian startups. Lemos is seeing a trend of more experienced, high-quality entrepreneurs, leaving companies such as Salesforce and LinkedIn in Brazil to start their first businesses. While Brazil is still only scratching the surface to breed global SaaS players of the likes of Salesforce or Zendesk, companies like RD Station are scaling quickly across Brazil and starting to set their sights on global markets.
Enter Brazil’s first robust SaaS market landscape
In May 2017, with support from Signal Hill and Redpoint eventures, we surveyed 597 Brazil-based SaaS founders (49 percent CEOs) to launch the inaugural version of our survey, called “The Brazil SaaS Landscape 2017.” It is important to note that the Brazil SaaS market is relatively new. Out of the companies polled in the survey, 71 percent were founded after 2010. In this research, we analyzed data about funding, employee strength, revenues, retention rates and growth rates of SaaS startups in Brazil. Here are some of the most interesting things we learned.
São Paulo is the SaaS capital of Brazil, followed by Santa Catarina and Minas Gerais
Almost 50 percent of SaaS startups are based in São Paulo, and 41 percent of total startups that surpassed R$1 million in ARR are based there. Santa Catarina takes second place for fast-paced growth. According to Diego Wagner, founder of Meetime, an inside-sales platform, Santa Catarina’s SaaS community is growing fast thanks to startup founders and employees giving back to the community with workshops, angel investments and mentoring.
Minas Gerais, a large inland state in southeastern Brazil, clocked in at third-fastest for SaaS company growth. According to Drew Beaurline, founder of Construct, an issue-tracking and communications app for construction companies, the local SaaS community there is fueled by government-funded programs such as the SEED startup accelerator.
“As a budding entrepreneur with zero capital, I was amazed I could contract a senior developer for a fraction of the cost it would take in San Francisco,” says Beaurline. “Plus, there were many more equity-free accelerator programs funded by the government.” Drew, who moved from California to Belo Horizonte, noted that Google’s first acquisition outside of the U.S. was in Akwan, a company based in Belo Horizonte.
Brazilian SaaS startups by state
Brazilian SaaS startups are mostly bootstrapped, but VC investment is growing
We were surprised to find that more than 71 percent of Brazilian SaaS businesses of those surveyed are self-funded with no outside investors. Take Superlógica as an example: The company provides recurring billing software and the founders bootstrapped it, growing it to 5,000 customers and more than 130 employees. Superlógica grew more than 100 percent in 2016, and plans triple its revenue with the launch of its own payment service, according to its chief growth officer, Carlos Moura.
Of those who raised capital, only 10 percent of SaaS founders raised more than R$10 million (about US$3 million). Most investment in SaaS has come from VC firms based in Brazil. Funds such as Ebricks (Contabilizei, ERPFlex), Monashees+ (Conta Azul, RunRun.it) and Redpoint eventures (Gympass, Olist, Pismo), are making investment bets in the SaaS space. Regarding valuations, the median multiple for SaaS rounds to date is roughly six times ARR.
Brazilian SaaS startups funding
 
Brazilian SaaS startups are incredibly capital-efficient
If you look at public, mature SaaS businesses in the U.S., many of them take more than 12 months to recover customer-acquisition costs. In Brazil, this is not true. Taking a deep look into the survey data, we can see that Brazilian startups are more like mountain goats (or cockroaches) than unicorns: they are not magical, but they are reliable and resilient. More than 60 percent of startups surveyed recover their customer-acquisition costs (CAC) in less than six months. They have healthy unit economics: 67 percent of them have a LTV/CAC ratio superior to three, a feat that would make David Skok proud.
This enables them to survive and thrive in case of even tighter funding markets. We wonder if a change in the funding market, making more capital available to those companies, wouldn’t transform our goats into magical beings.
Time to recover CAC for Brazilian SaaS companies


The SaaS-enabled marketplace is happening in Brazil, too
More than a quarter (26 percent) of the companies surveyed have a marketplace component baked into their offerings. Companies like Gympass have attached marketplace components to SaaS products and seem to be succeeding. According to Manoel Lemos, having a marketplace component helps companies create barriers to entry from foreign competition and produces a network advantage.
On the other hand, in our extensive research, we did not find any correlation with a marketplace component driving growth rates or business success across the 597 startups surveyed.
Brazilian SaaS-enabled marketplaces
Big Brazil SaaS market with its own distinctive twist
With a population of more than 211 million people, there are many potential customers to sell to, and SaaS startups are highly focused on Brazil first. SaaS products from Brazil are not clones of ones from the U.S. They mostly adapt to the local tastes and address the many government bureaucracies. Contabilizei, for example, focuses on helping small businesses manage accounting. Because all Brazilian companies are obliged by law to have an accountant, Contabilizei replaces the external accountant. When SaaS companies do expand outside Brazil, they tend to focus on other regions in Latin America first, due to proximity and lower competition.
Inspiring a new wave of SaaS entrepreneurs
“One of our key learnings is that hiring the right people is the most important thing to succeed as a SaaS company,” says Guilherme Lopes, one RD Station’s co-founders. “We were lucky to assemble such a talented and committed team that’s willing to learn the best practices and overcome the challenges that a SaaS startup faces in an emerging market like Brazil. When we started, there weren’t a lot of local benchmarks or data about the Brazilian market. We were always crazy about metrics and quite meticulous about digging into U.S.-based data and research to help guide us. But, we never knew how we compared to peers. I guess we did fine without it, but I’m glad about having in-depth data on other Brazilian SaaS companies to better understand our market dynamics.”

Cord cutters have another reason to get excited, as CBS this week announced it’s planning to launch a live streaming service for sports. The news was discussed on the company’s Q2 earnings call, and though details are light — there’s no name, pricing or exact launch date at this time, for example — the service could potentially go a long way to fill a gap that’s not currently well-covered by live TV streaming services and on-demand subscription video.
According to the company, the idea to do a live streaming channel for sports was influenced by the network’s earlier digital success with its streaming news network, CBSN. First launched in 2014, CBSN was designed to increase the distribution of CBS’s news content to digital platforms. CBS more recently announced CBSN content, including its live news and original reporting, would become a part of CBS’s over-the-top streaming service, CBS All Access.
The goal now is to replicate the CBSN model, but for the world of sports.
“Later this year, we will roll out a 24/7 live streaming channel like CBSN for sports as part of our ongoing [over-the-top] strategy,” said CBS CEO Les Moonves, on the company’s earnings call, adding that the service did not yet have a name. “We think sports fans are looking for something like this, and that opportunity is significant,” he noted.
The company has already benefited by bringing sports programming to over-the-top viewers who no longer subscribe to traditional television, like cable or satellite TV.
In December 2016, CBS announced a multi-year streaming deal with the NFL that gave it the rights to broadcast every NFL game on CBS via the CBS All Access service. Of course, there were a few caveats.
First, the games were only available where CBS offers live local broadcasts via the service. That’s not the entire U.S., but it was a sizable chunk at the time the deal was announced — 150 markets. (As of May, CBS claimed All Access reached 90 percent of U.S. households.) Also, CBS All Access wasn’t able to stream NFL games on mobile, because of Verizon’s [disclosure: TechCrunch’s parent AOL’s owner] NFL deal.
That said, CBS said that its announcement of streaming NFL games boosted weekly sign-ups, on average, by 75 percent, when compared with the weeks before the news of the deal was made public. That indicates there’s definitely pent-up demand for access to live sports through nontraditional means that CBS is able to tap into.
Additionally, Moonves explained that many of the pieces necessary to move into streaming sports were already in place at the network.
“As you know, we already have a very proactive online sports group down in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and as I said, we have the infrastructure that allows CBSN to thrive, which obviously will be used there as well,” the exec noted.
Because it would be able to keep costs down due to existing infrastructure, the company believes its chances for earlier profitability with streaming sports are good.
Moonves didn’t fully respond to a question about what kind of sports content would be live streamed, whether its focus would be more on highlights, or whether that was all still being worked out.
However, he did point out that CBS has deals with the NFL, the NCAA (through 2032, in fact), FCC football and PGA Tour Golf. But he described the project as being in the “very preliminary stages” of formation.
“CBS is a big player in the sports world,” Moonves said. “We are going to look to differentiate ourselves from the ESPN and the Fox Sports as well, and we think we have a good opportunity to succeed.”
By taking CBS sports over-the-top this year, the company will beat ESPN to its just announced launch of its video streaming service, planned for 2018.
That move was a long time coming. A profile on ESPN published by Bloomberg this spring noted that ESPN had lost more than 12 million subscribers since 2011, largely due to cord cutting. But the company seemed to still be focused on propping up the cable bundle, the report explained. It was doubling down on investments in technology to make ESPN better for cable customers — like integrations with TV remotes to pull up ESPN channels and content, new tech for SportsCenter anchors, a personalized app for cable customers and much more.
Meanwhile, ESPN’s forays into streaming had been more modest. It offers its channel and content through streaming services like Sling TV, Hulu, DirecTV Now and YouTube TV, for example. It chose not to go direct-to-consumer because the economics don’t work. As Bloomberg pointed out, an entire season of Games of Thrones costs less than what ESPN pays to air a single Monday Night Football game.
But things are changing now. Disney said today it will launch an ESPN video streaming service next year, including MLB, NHL and MLS content. It will do the same for Disney in 2019, and will pull its movies from Netflix.
The high cost of sports programming could be an issue for CBS, too. But CBS believes it has a strong position to negotiate for rights, especially with the NFL, which Moonves described as “a big supporter of broadcast television.”
However, CBS’s competitors today aren’t limited to Fox or ESPN when it comes to sports.
Consumers today have a growing number of options for over-the-top access to sports programming and live games. Twitter, for example, has made deals to live-stream MLB games, WNBA, the PGA Tour and others from smaller sports leagues. Facebook and the MLB partnered this year to bring 20 regular-season games to the social network. And Amazon scored NFL Thursday Night Football.
When ESPN’s Monday Night Football deal expires in 2021, it will be interesting to see what the NFL chooses to do at that point, given ESPN’s current struggles, the new entry of sports streaming services and the potential to roll out to other platforms like Amazon, Twitter or Facebook.
CBS said it plans to launch its streaming sports service this year.
Bad news if you were just getting used to all of the new Disney stuff hitting Netflix: that deal is on the way out.
Disney has just announced plans to end its distribution agreement with Netflix in 2019, instead opting to launch its own streaming service sometime during that same year.
The announcement came as part of some takeover news: Disney is paying $1.58 billion to acquire another 42 percent of BAMTech — a company that exists under the Major League Baseball umbrella — in addition to the 33 percent stake it bought for $1 billion last year. This gives Disney the majority controlling stake of BAMTech.
Meanwhile, Disney also will be launching a separate ESPN-branded streaming service early next year. It’ll be wrapped into a rebuilt version of the ESPN app, and host streams from the MLB, NHL, MLS, and various college sports networks.

In a new report examining cybersecurity trends for the quarter, it sounds like “ransomware” — emphasis on the air quotes — will remain very much in vogue through 2017.
The last few months saw some major malware moments, most notably the WannaCry and NotPetya (a.k.a. ExPetr/Nyetya/Petya) attacks. Kaspersky Labs’ quarterly report suggests that the trend is likely here to stay for now, as waves of increasingly sophisticated hacks further the veiled aims of shadowy individual actors and governments alike.
As the report explains:
“While very different in nature and targets, both were surprisingly ineffective as ‘ransomware.’ For example, in the case of WannaCry, its rapid global spread and high profile put a spotlight on the attackers’ Bitcoin ransom account and made it hard for them to cash out. This suggests that the real aim of the WannaCry attack was data destruction… The pattern of destructive malware disguised as ransomware showed itself again in the ExPetr attack.”
Given major malware’s trend toward disruption rather than monetary gain in 2017, the report also mentions that we should expect to see more hacks targeting energy companies and infrastructure. That kind of attack is designed for maximum damage and can even paralyze an entire nation, as we saw with Ukraine in 2015. (It’s no coincidence that BlackEnergy, the entity believed to be behind the Ukraine power grid, appears to be related to the Not Petya attack.)
Of course, attacks of this nature do massive financial damage too, but it’s damage at scale for its own sake. That scale and style is a departure from a true ransomware attack, which holds machines and data hostage in order to fatten up an attacker’s bitcoin wallet. Still, due to early confusion, a misguided early narrative declaring an attack to be ransomware often prevails.
If ransomware isn’t really ransomware, is it a wolf in wolf’s clothing? Like a grey wolf in an eastern timber wolf’s clothing? The answer to that is far from clear, but we should certainly expect more major malware incidents and more misdirection about their objectives as we move deeper into the cyber strangeness of 2017.

500 Startups is ramping up its next batch of companies in its early-stage startup program, which this time consists of 36 startups.
The firm’s pitch to companies entering the accelerator has generally been that it can better help support growth and marketing efforts. So a lot of the companies you’ll find in this batch are ones that align neatly with those needs, from financial tech to digital health. They’re the kinds of businesses that may look better at scale, but need help getting off the ground.
This one might be an awkward one, though. Frontman Dave McClure, known to show up to demo days with costumes and generally running around, resigned from the firm after admitting to “multiple” advances toward women and being a “creep.” This time around, McClure will likely be somewhat of a specter as the company closes in on its next demo day.
Still, time marches on. Here’s the list of companies participating in the most recent batch:

Ahead of a white supremacist rally this Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia, Airbnb has deactivated the accounts of some people who are trying to attend the event, Gizmodo first reported.
It’s not clear how many accounts Airbnb has deactivated (we asked and the company told us there are no numbers to share). Airbnb did, however, provide TechCrunch with the following statement:
In 2016 we established the Airbnb Community Commitment reflecting our belief that to make good on our mission of belonging, those who are members of the Airbnb community accept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age. We asked all members of the Airbnb to affirmatively sign on to this commitment. When through our background check processes or from input of our community we identify and determine that there are those who would be pursuing behavior on the platform that would be antithetical to the Airbnb Community Commitment, we seek to take appropriate action including, as in this case, removing them from the platform.
The quick context about this white supremacist rally is that it’s being put on by people affiliated with a site called The Daily Stormer. They’re organizing a stay-in and are attempting to host some after-parties at some Airbnb listings.
In the post below, one member writes that they’ve “Taken over all of the large AirBnBs in a particular area” and have set up “Nazi Uber” and the “Hate Van.”

Some Airbnb members flagged the event, which led to Airbnb investigating and confirming that some users on the platform had booked listings for those white supremacist parties.
Airbnb has banned racist hosts before. Last June, Airbnb banned someone after they cancelled on a guest because the woman was black. A few months later, in September, Airbnb laid out its plan to combat racism and hatred on its platform.
In a 32-page document, Airbnb explained that anyone who used Airbnb would have to agree to a community commitment, which entailed treating fellow members with respect, and without judgment and bias. Airbnb’s non-discrimination policy, developed under the guidance of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, prohibits content that promotes things like racism and bigotry. Given the nature of the Daily Stormer’s event, I would say Airbnb was absolutely correct in deactivating some of these people from the platform.

Audio is beginning to play an increasingly important role in how consumers connect with information, thanks to the popularity of podcasts and other short-form audio programming, improvements in voice technologies, and the growing consumer adoption of smart home devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Today, a company called Audioburst is unveiling a new search engine designed to connect you to the information found in audio content from podcasts and programs aired on the radio.
Tel Aviv-based Audioburst, which also has staff in New York and Palo Alto, has been developing its technology for an audio search engine and content library over the past two years.
The idea is that much of the information arising from daily news programs or topical podcasts – or even TV news – is not available in an organized, searchable fashion. It’s broadcast over the radio, and then it largely disappears; or it’s only heard by those who subscribe and then listen to a particular episode of a podcast series, for example.
The larger goal is to make this sort of audio content available across platforms – including from Audioburst’s own search engine; major search engines like Google and Bing; from smart assistant apps, like Google Assistant; and from voice platforms like the Alexa-powered Echo speakers and Google Home.
Audioburst had previously rolled out its Google Assistant integration, its “News Feed” skill for smart devices, and developer API. Now, the company is unveiling Audioburst Search, a web and mobile-optimized search engine that helps you find, discover, and listen to audio news.

The product works by ingesting audio content from a number of sources. In some cases, Audioburst is proactively scouring the web for available live streams to import. However, the company is largely focused on partnership deals with radio stations, radio programs, and podcasters. It’s also starting to venture into the TV space, with plans to index TV news, and is chatting with a small handful of auto manufacturers about integrating Audioburst into their own in-car entertainment systems.
To make audio content searchable, the company pulls in millions of audio segments daily from now over 1,000 sources. While it’s not disclosing a full list of partners, if you look in its search results, you’ll find that it’s indexing the likes of Bloomberg Radio and some Fox radio programs, numerous radio stations, as well as a lot of podcasts, particularly in the tech space.
After ingesting the audio, Audioburst leverages technologies like A.I. and natural language processing to understand not just what’s being discussed, but also the context.

It also doesn’t only match users’ search queries to those exact same words when spoken, either. For example, it knows that someone speaking about the “president” in a program about U.S. politics was referring to “Donald Trump,” even if they didn’t use his name.
The audio content is then tagged and organized in a way that computers understand, making it searchable. And it’s broken into smaller sections – clips it calls “bursts” – which Audioburst identifies by understanding when the audio changes.
It can identify when an ad break starts, when there are station breaks, when a new speaker joins, when there are pauses, and other signals that tell it when to start and end an audio clip – a process that all happens automatically.
This allows its search engine to not just point you to a program or show where a topic was discussed, but the specific segment within that show where that discussion took place. (If you choose, you can then listen to the full show, as the content is linked to the source.)

As the technology is further developed, its ability to understand consumers’ personal preferences will be improved. For example, if you’re a fan of a particular sports team, and they won their last game, you might hear audio content featuring more praise and cheering from the commentators; but if your team lost, the news returned may have a less emotional tone.
Audioburst isn’t there yet – it’s only beginning this process of understanding listener behavior. But in the long-term, the company believes this would pave the way to things like personalized audio advertisements, alongside a daily news briefing, for example. It may also choose to generate revenue through more traditional methods, like sponsorships and promoted content. Revenue would be shared with the audio content’s producers.
But these are goals that are still a year or two out, we understand.

While the startup is making its technology available across platforms – web, mobile, and one day, cars, it sees potential in the voice-powered smart device market, in particular.
“Of course, voice assistants and smart speakers are the natural interfaces to use our library, because it’s all about voice,” explains Assaf Gad, VP Marketing and Strategic Partnerships at Audioburst. 
“It allows you to ask a question and get a result. Instead of Alexa reading it out loud to you in her voice, you can get the actual speaker,” he says, noting that audio could come directly from a public figure’s sound bite or the host of the audio program itself. “It’s a more human voice,” Gad adds.
The company recently closed on a $6.7 million round of funding led by Japanese speech recognition tech company Advanced Media to further develop its underlying technology and its consumer-facing products.
Its audio search engine, Audioburst Search, is live on web and mobile here.
Microsoft is launching a new opt-in beta program for Outlook.com today that will give users access to a faster and more personalized email experience, as well as an overhauled design. Over the next few weeks, the Outlook.com team will roll out to all users a new toggle for opting into the beta. Those who don’t like the new look and feel can easily switch back to the old version.
The plan here is to test new features in this beta program and bring to the standard version of Outlook.com those that worked out well. It’s probably fair to assume that the new design will also make it to the regular version of Outlook.com over time.

For this redesign, Microsoft is using a new development framework that the company claims is more responsive and that enables the team to deliver a more modern design. It’s our understanding that this new framework Microsoft is using here is Facebook’s ReactJS, which has become increasingly popular for building modern web apps.
The new version also will feature an upgraded search experience, as well as a refreshed conversations view. In addition, the Outlook.com beta will offer new personalization options that, among other things, include the option to pin to your sidebar shortcuts to emails from specific people.
And because no modern applications can live without them, you can now also easily find emojis and GIFs right inside of Outlook.com, add them to your emails and surprise your friends with your uncanny ability to conjure up old memes.
Other new features include Quick Suggestion, which pops up restaurant information, flight data and “your favorite teams’ schedules” (I assume that’s something that sports fans talk about a lot?). That sounds like a pretty clever idea, given that it makes it pretty easy to drop a card with info about a restaurant and coffee shop into an email, for example.
The new Outlook.com Inbox will also group all of your incoming sent and received photos into a single spot.
It’s been a while since we last heard about Outlook.com, so it’s good to see that Microsoft is putting a bit more effort into what is still one of the most-used web-based email clients around.
Pro.com started out as a marketplace that wanted to connect homeowners with home improvement and renovation professionals. Today, however, the company is a tech-centric general contractor with licenses in Washington state and California — and it’s also probably one of the best-funded general contractors. The company today announced that it has raised a $10 million growth financing round led by DFJ, with participation from existing investors Maveron, Madrona Venture Group and Two Sigma Ventures. DFJ’s Bill Bryant will join the Pro.com board.
According to Pro.com CEO Matt Williams (who launched the earlier incarnation of the service in 2014 and who was also previously at the helm of Digg.com after that company went through its darkest days), the team realized that while it could make the marketplace work, it couldn’t guarantee that the homeowners would have a good experience.
So instead of helping homeowners connect with pros, it now has its own teams in place in all the cities it operates in. These include carpenters, electricians and project managers, for example. If needed, the company also works with a group of pre-screened sub-contractors (who are often specialists in their fields) to help with its projects.
The idea here is that homeowners will get a far smoother experience than is typically the case when it comes to working with general contractors. Pro.com can generally generate quotes much faster than its competitors, for example, thanks to the company’s use of technology and its analysis of local prices (and the plan is to introduce same-day/next-day quotes soon). The company also uses its mobile apps to manage its staff, capture updates from its work sites and generate invoices. Williams tells me that the company plans to expand this use of technology to keep track of a given project over time.
“With their end-to-end virtual contractor service, Pro.com is fundamentally changing the consumer experience when engaged on a home improvement project, from first touch on estimation to the last day of inspection and sign off,” DFJ’s Bill Bryant told me. “No more stress, just a beautiful kitchen delivered on time, on budget!”
Williams didn’t want to talk about where exactly Pro.com will launch next, but he noted that the company’s focus right now is on the West Coast and that he plans to use the additional funding to launch in at least 10 new cities within the next year or so.
“We have been a company that has been heads-down focused for the last two years after the last round of funding,” Williams told me. “That brought us to this product/market fit. We have been growing over the last year with this model and realized this is working — and working well. Now, we can penetrate a new market quickly.” For some states that means getting the right kinds of licenses, of course, which can take a while, but for the most part, activating a new city for Pro.com is mostly about hiring the right people and finding the right sub-contractors (which is relatively easy for the company, thanks to its experience with running local marketplaces for pros).
In its Seattle market, Pro.com currently generates quotes for about three to four percent of all projects and wins a high number of these, according to Williams. The plan, of course, is to increase these numbers over time. Given how fragmented the market for general contractors is, Pro.com has a good chance of establishing itself as a leader in this space, especially given that many of its competitors are solely focused on offering a marketplace.
BlueJeans Network, the cloud video and collaboration company, announced today that Quentin Gallivan, an industry veteran who has helped run several tech companies, will be taking over as CEO.
Former CEO and company founder Krish Ramakrishnan will remain with the company and take on the role of executive chairman. He will also continue to lead strategy and innovation.
Ramakrishnan doesn’t see this move as stepping back. He said that he actually pursued Gallivan precisely because he has a track record of scaling companies like Pentaho, Verisign and Postini –and he believed he needed a leader that could take the company to the next level. Meanwhile, Ramakrishnan will be freed up to concentrate on other projects that could take the company’s core video conferencing and collaboration business in new directions.
As Gallivan comes in the door, he takes over a company that he sees in pretty good shape — one of the primary reasons he was attracted to the job — but that requires some additional tweaking to go public eventually and all that entails. That means becoming a company fully committed to the needs of large enterprise customers.
The two leaders developed a bromance when they met informally at a gathering about 9 months ago. Ramakrishnan was soon convinced that Gallivan was the perfect fit to take over the CEO duties at BlueJeans. First, he had to talk Gallivan into leaving his position as CEO at Pentaho, the data and analytics company he had been running for over five years.
As the two talked, Gallivan discovered that Ramakrishnan was looking to take on a different role. Gallivan liked what he saw, a well capitalized company poised for growth. While he hadn’t worked with video in his previous positions, he said as he explored the company, he learned that it was playing an increasingly important role in enterprise communication and collaboration.
Of course he’s not the only one to notice that. Big players like Cisco Google and Microsoft have taken a shine to video communications. Facebook has too, although BlueJeans says they’re a partner with both Facebook Live and Workplace by Facebook.
Other video startups are also extremely well capitalized. Zoom raised $100 million in January on a billion dollar valuation. Another competitor, Fuze has raised $330M with $104 million coming in one big chunk in February (when it also hired a new CEO).
In spite of the heavy competition, Gallivan believes that BlueJeans is well positioned to take on all comers. “It’s taking the foundation we have and building off of that and completely focusing on the enterprise space,” he explained. He believes that the enterprise offers the greatest potential revenue and the best path to differentiating itself from the list of worthy competitors in this space.
BlueJeans has been around since 2009 and has raised over $175 million. Investors include Accel Partners, NEA, Battery Ventures and Derek Jeter’s Jeter Ventures.

Xbox is changing up its user interface on Xbox in a major way again, and Xbox Insiders can check out the latest switch-em-up now. The new interface includes big changes for Xbox One users, as well as tweaks to Windows 10 PCs using the Xbox app.
The new interface focuses on a custom home screen that users can create themselves, which is a good way to hopefully help make that initial launch screen you find when you boot up your console more personally relevant. You can pin games and friends to home, and you can move the whole block of content up or down. Adding stuff to Home won’t just add the title itself, however – you’ll get a feed of blocks that are related including activity posts from a game’s developer or notifications when friends are playing, for instance.
Home, Social, and My Games and Apps screens are also now unified, with no unnecessary loading when you switch between them to call up additional assets, which is a nice change for people bothered by unnecessary visual fluff bogging down menu navigation. A pop-out guide now also features tabs for easily navigating to wherever you want to go, from wherever you happen to be in the Guide itself.

Microsoft has also focused on rebuilding the community sharing experiences with a more immersive Activity Feed, and the Game Bar is improved in Windows 10 with a single button that allows you to enable or disable Game Mode (which optimizes system resources for game performance) and there are new more detailed settings for sharing audio when broadcasting via Mixer.
Microsoft sure seems to do a lot of rethinking with the Xbox interface, and it can be a jolt to players since once they’re used to one redesign, a new one seems to immediately take its place. As mentioned, these are rolling out for Insiders only for now, and will make their way to general users later this year alongside other major Xbox and Windows 10 updates. Meanwhile, all users can check out a more desirable piece of software for Xbox right now: Spotify.
David Letterman has signed a deal to host six episodes of a new program for Netflix.
The company hasn’t released many details of the topics, format or guests, but it sounds like it won’t just be a standard in-the-studio talk show — Netflix’s Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement, “David Letterman is a true television icon, and I can’t wait to see him out in the wild, out from behind the desk and interviewing the people he finds most interesting. We’ll have to see if he keeps the beard.”
While Netflix has had its most high-profile successes with scripted shows like House of Cards and Stranger Things, it’s also home to Chelsea and Bill Nye Saves the World. Neither show seems like a big hit (it’s hard to say for sure, since the company doesn’t release ratings information), but Netflix is still funding them — it probably helps that they’re cheaper to produce than something like Sense8.
Letterman, meanwhile, has largely stayed out of the spotlight since leaving the Late Show on CBS in 2015. He did, however, appear in the climate change documentary program Years of Living Dangerously and he also reminded everyone how funny he can be in a recent, wide-ranging interview with New York magazine.
Letterman’s new show is scheduled to premiere next year.
“Here’s what I have learned: If you retire to spend more time with your family, check with your family first,” he said in the announcement. “Thanks for watching. Drive safely.”

As fields of research, machine learning and artificial intelligence both date back to the 50s. More than half a century later, the disciplines have graduated from the theoretical to practical, real world applications. We’ll have some of the top minds in both categories to discuss the latest advances and future of AI and ML on stage and Disrupt San Francisco in just over a month. 
We’ll be joined on stage by Brian Krzanich of Intel, John Giannandrea of Google, Sebastian Thrun of Udacity and Andrew Ng of Baidu, to outline the various ways these cutting edge technologies are already impacting our lives, from simple smart assistants, to self-driving cars. It’s a broad range of speakers, which is good news, because we’ve got a lot of ground to cover in some of the industry’s most exciting advances. 
John (JG) Giannandrea, SVP Engineering at Google:  Giannandrea joined Google in 2010, when the company acquired his startup Metaweb Technologies, a move that formed the basis for the search giant’s Knowledge Graph technology. Last year, Google appointed Giannandrea the head of search, the latest indication of the company’s deep interest for machine learning and AI. Teaching machines to be smarter is a long time passion for the executive, who told Fortune in a 2016 interview that, “computers are remarkably dumb.” Giannandrea will discuss the work he’s doing at Google to fix exactly that.
Sebastian Thrun, Founder, Udacity: Prior to founding online educational service Udacity, Sebastian Thrun headed up Google X, helping make artificial intelligence a foundational key for the company’s moonshot products. The topic has been a long time passion for the CMU computer science grad, in fact, he now teaches a course on the subject at Udacity. The introductory Artificial Intelligence for Robotics class takes students through the basics of AI and the ways in which the technology is helping pave the way for his other key passion, self-driving cars. 
Andrew Ng, Former Chief Scientist at Baidu: Earlier this year, Andrew Ng stepped down from his role as the head of Baidu’s AI Group. In a post for Medium announcing the move, the executive reconfirmed his commitment to the space, noting that AI “will also now change nearly every major industry — healthcare, transportation, entertainment, manufacturing .” After Baidu, NG has shifted his focus toward harnessing artificial intelligence for the benefit of larger society, beyond just a single company, targeting a broad range of industries from healthcare to conversational computing.
Brian Krzanich, CEO Intel: When Brian Krzanich took over as Intel CEO in 2013, the company was reeling from an inability to adapt from desktop computing to mobile devices. Under his watch, he’s shifted much of Intel’s resources to forward thinking technologies, from 5G networks and cloud computing to drones and self-driving cars. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are at the heart of much of Intel’s forward looking plans, as the company works to stay on the bleeding edge of technology breakthroughs.
Alongside this main-stage panel, we’ll also have an Off The Record session on AI with some of the top minds in the field, which will only be available to attendees at Disrupt. Plus, there are plenty of startups in Startup Alley this year that are focusing in on machine learning.
We’re incredibly excited to be joined by so many top names, and hope you’ll be there as well. Early bird general admission tickets are still available for what’s shaping up to be another blockbuster Disrupt.

The ‘last mile’ in education and training
Blame bad applicant tracking for the soft skills shortage at your company



My 11-year-old son Leo has a strange new obsession: the state of Connecticut. It started with a school project but has evolved to ordering Connecticut license plates online, a new favorite baseball team (the minor league Hartford Yard Goats — Go Goats!) and a new hobby: writing Wikipedia entries on Connecticut topics.
His first Wikipedia entries were obscure Connecticut state roads (Routes 539, 607 and, of course, 664, among others). He also did one on the new Earth Tower of the Mohegan Sun Casino. Subsequently, as a result of the fact that his Wikipedia overlords wouldn’t let him post photos of the Earth Tower that he hadn’t taken himself, Leo insisted on: (1) an explanation of the concept of copyright; and (2) changing our summer travel plans to include a 3-day tour of Connecticut, featuring an overnight at Mohegan Sun.
I didn’t mind too much because I thought it might remind me of my college years in Connecticut. Because, despite what regular readers might conclude from the various absurd college stories I’ve shared, I’ve actually forgotten much of what went on there — certainly most non-absurd things.

Over the past few months, I’ve begun to outline the idea of last-mile training: the combination of technical education and placement services that has the potential to fill the skills gap across many sectors of the economy.
In addition to coding, University Ventures has already made investments in last-mile training providers in sales, medical devices and insurance. I’ve also suggested that last-mile providers are evolving to become college “minimum viable products” or feasible substitutes to traditional higher education. As a result, I’ve received a number of inquiries that boil down to something like this: What will we lose if the last mile becomes the only mile?
As last-mile providers are emerging as a direct result of market forces, the first objection is fittingly economic in nature: Because millennials may change jobs as many as four times in their first decade in the workforce, isn’t it irresponsible to “train” young people for just one job? Only a broad education — not technical training — can equip students for change.

As far as I can tell, this view is nearly universally held. But there are two reasons to believe it may be wrong.
First, there may not be an unbridgeable distance in cognitive and non-cognitive skill development between last-mile programs and the average college degree. College students continue to flee the cognitive skill-building humanities for pre-professional degrees in business, accounting and a plethora of health and IT majors.
According to newly released IPEDS data, English majors now account for only 1.3 percent of all BAs, down 50 percent in the past 15 years. History majors were 1.3 percent only 10 years ago, but are now only 0.7 percent. At the same time, most last-mile programs claim to develop a wide range of cognitive and non-cognitive skills, albeit in a shorter time frame.
Holberton School says its project-based learning curriculum fosters “improved communication and interpersonal/social skills, enhanced leadership skills, and increased creativity.” Make School’s “Product College” explicitly develops problem solving and communication skills.
As for the second reason, while the opposite of education is lack of education (I’ve discussed this in the context of last year’s election), in a more personally relevant sense for most readers, the opposite of education — of gaining knowledge and skills — is forgetting.

In June, the MIT Center for Brains, Minds + Machines released a working paper by Brian Subirana, Aikaterini Bagiati and Sanjay Sarma titled On the Forgetting of College Academics: At “Ebbinghaus Speed”?
The MIT researchers surveyed the scientific literature and concluded there is no evidence that anything significant and “unused” is remembered beyond two years. The “Universal Law of Forgetting,” said the researchers, is that content knowledge that is not refreshed decays according to the Ebbinghaus Curve.
Hermann Ebbinghaus was a 19th century German psychologist who pioneered the study of memory. In 1885, around the same time neurons were discovered, he published “On Memory,” which revealed the “Forgetting Curve,” where knowledge decays according to the formula R = e –(t/s), where R is retention, s is the relative strength of memory and t is time. According to the MIT researchers, the upshot — consistently reproduced across hundreds of experiments — is that we lose 50 percent of unrefreshed content knowledge every two years.
In a recent presentation at MIT, Subirana was critical about the structure of traditional higher education, hypothesizing that “what we learn in the classroom is irrelevant for students in the long run” unless they re-use it soon and often.
Subirana acknowledges that nearly all the research on this topic concerns content knowledge and not skills. And there are obvious examples of unrefreshed retention beyond two years, such as facial recognition or motor skills like riding a bicycle. So the key question for higher education is whether critical thinking, problem solving and the other core cognitive skills that college aims to inculcate are more like content knowledge or more like riding a bike.
In his presentation, Subirana and a colleague discuss another MIT paper from 2009: “What do Seniors Remember from Freshman Physics.” In the study, seniors are surprised with a request to re-take a physics exam they took freshman year. Those who hadn’t continued in physics or a physics-related field achieved at approximately half the level of 3.5 years earlier. Only those who went on to major in physics, mechanical engineering and aeronautics/astronautics did as well or better.

While a freshman physics exam is primarily about content knowledge, performance on such a test isn’t completely unrelated to cognitive skill development. Subirana surmises that unused cognitive skills are not exempt from Ebbinghaus’ curve. “Forgetting is unavoidable,” he says. In the paper, he and his colleagues speculate that “the brain may behave a bit like regular physical muscles and practice may increase their ability.”
In a general sense, every graduate practices the cognitive and non-cognitive muscles flexed in college. College improves problem solving and critical thinking abilities. Graduates enter the workforce and encounter problems that must be solved. But Subirana’s work points toward much greater specificity: The closer the practice to the original skill “memory,” the more likely the skill will be retained.
If our goal is to increase society’s store of skills, we must mount a vigorous defense to the tyranny of Ebbinghaus’ curve. The most effective defense is to link practice of skills in the workforce as closely as possible to the context in which they were learned. Unfortunately for higher education, the mountain (work) will not come to Muhammad (higher education). So Muhammad must go to the mountain.
This means that if a student’s first job is going to be in mobile UX/UI design, they’ll be more likely to retain and deepen cognitive and non-cognitive skills developed in formal postsecondary education if they were inculcated as part of a mobile UX/UI design program.
And as this is exactly the point of last-mile training, there’s reason to believe Student A’s retention of cognitive and non-cognitive skills following a last-mile training program plus two years’ work experience as a mobile UX/UI designer may rival or exceed Student B who earns an unrelated bachelor’s degree and then (miraculously is hired and) works for two years in the same job.
There’s nonetheless an obvious risk that while cognitive and non-cognitive skills developed by last-mile training (and retained through closely connected work) may end up being deep, they may not be broad. Tennyson famously said “Ring out the old, ring in the new… Ring out the false, ring in the true.”

We need to make sure that as last-mile programs and college MVPs proliferate, we’re not simultaneously ringing in the false and ringing out the true. In other words, even if these new pathways help millions of our economically disenfranchised and disgruntled brothers and sisters join the vibrant American economy, will we find we’re all more susceptible to fake news because unable to critically engage with information we find on Facebook? Or not unimportant, will anyone know who the heck Tennyson was? This is something that keeps me up at night.
Nevertheless, the study of forgetting isn’t educational nihilism. It’s instructive for determining how best to deploy the hundreds of billions of dollars that are currently flowing overwhelmingly to a single model of higher education. And it indicates that if we begin to diversify, we may lose less than we fear.

Leo and I had a great time in Connecticut. We went to a Yard Goats game. We stayed at the Mohegan Sun so he could take his photos. And we enjoyed the world’s greatest pizza: Pepe’s in New Haven. Although Leo had prepared a detailed itinerary down to the hour, I prevailed upon him to walk around New Haven for 90 minutes. I managed to show him a few important places, and pleasant memories flooded back.
People often ask me whether Leo and his brothers will go to college. My answer is: It’s entirely up to him. As long as he’s in an environment — study or work — where he’s learning from his peers, I’ll be supportive of that. And if that’s a last-mile training program or college MVP, I’m confident he’ll find his own Connecticut, and probably remember it much better.
Uber is considering its options regarding what to do with its Xchange Leasing program for providing subprime car leases to drivers on its service, according to a source familiar with the program. The Wall Street Journal reported that it planned to close the operation earlier on Tuesday, and we’ve confirmed that it’s looking at a number of options for how to proceed, including an outright sale of the business to outside parties.
Uber and its board decided that Xchange was in need of significant changes given its current operating realities, and the WSJ report claims that it is causing “unsustainably high losses” for Uber. The Xchange program was introduced by Uber two years ago as a way to help provide vehicles to potential drivers who couldn’t necessarily secure one through more traditional means.
Our source says that Uber still wants to ensure vehicles have a cost-effective way to secure vehicles, but says the company also realizes it has to be done in a way that is sustainable from a financial standpoint. This is similar in motivation to Uber’s deals with Didi and Yandex in terms of finding a strategic way to stem outbound cash flow, the source claims.
As mentioned, an outright sale of the leasing operation is one possible outcome, and outside parties have already shown interest in such a sale according to our source. It could also involve scaling back the geographic footprint of Xchange to just a few of the cities where Uber operates. The options on the table could involve layoffs, but might also involve bringing Xchange employees in-house to fill vacancies at Uber proper.
Uber has also partnered with external companies for short-term rental and leasing options for cars used to ferry passengers, and it sounds like offloading its own ownership of these vehicles is the preferred path, in order to defray the cost requirements that come with owning and operating a fleet.

This is the story of a guy who found a niche and stuck with it. The guy is a programmer named Nick who was worried about Apple’s wireless AirPods. He thought they looked stupid.
“I didn’t have particularly high hopes when Apple first announced AirPods. I figured they would sound like their wired EarPods, which are fine but not particularly impressive. I was blown away when I first tried a pair of AirPods. Obviously, they can’t compete with a really nice set of over/on-ear headphones, but they’re astonishing when you take their form factor into consideration,” he said.
Convinced that the product had legs, he looked at them more closely and began reading Apple forums. He confirmed his hunch: people didn’t want to look like Ben Stiller in that one scene in Something About Mary and, sadly, white wireless earbuds hanging out of your ears looked goofy.
He decided to do something about it. He invented Blackpods.
“After the announcement, there was a lot of chatter in the Apple ecosystem about how they looked (which I agree is a bit silly in their natural white color). The opportunity to create a more stylish, less obtrusive version that matches some of the other iPhone colors seemed obvious.”
Nick bought a few pairs of AirPods and began the long, laborious process of figuring out how to paint them. After a bit of testing he figured it out and commercialized the process.
“There are very few flat surfaces, optical sensors, and multiple acoustic openings (all of which are tiny, requiring millimeter precision). Coming up with a masking process that was not prohibitively expensive or time consuming was a huge challenge, but people seem to be very happy with the product overall,” he said. And now he wants to sell you some black AirPods. Each unit is painted by hand. Nick also paints AirPods that people send to him. You can have AirPods in any color as long as they’re black.
It’s a perfect startup story: hunch leads to problem leads to customer assessment leads to solution leads to product.





 You guys got something like these?

By carefully masking all of the little apertures – including two prominent light sensors – Nick was able to paint AirPods in glossy or matte black using a three-phase painting system. The glossy BlackPods cost $279 while the “Stealth” matte ones or $299. He can paint your AirPods for $99. And business is good.
“We move approximately 300-500 units per month, and are mainly constrained by AirPod supply, not demand for Blackpods. Supply has been opening up recently, so we are able to fulfill more than we previously were able to,” said Nick.
And thus a programmer named Nick schooled us all in proper startup design. Good job, Nick, and now we don’t need to look like Ben Stiller.
You’ve likely seen them plastered across your social media accounts, if not on someone’s feet in San Francisco, where the company is based: attractive women’s flats in bright red with black soles, or bright red with pink stripes and blue detailing, or a gray camo pattern with a red sole.
Rothy’s, available online only at the company’s site, suddenly seem to be everywhere.
What’s the appeal? In addition to their aesthetics, the shoes are highly eco-friendly. Founders Roth Martin and Stephen Hawthornthwaite — a former gallery owner and investment banker, respectively — say the company has now used more than five million plastic water bottles to create an undisclosed number of shoes. How? After sourcing the bottles from recycling centers, they are “hot-washed” and sterilized, chipped into tiny flakes, then shaped into pellets that are then melted into malleable, thread-like fibers that get weaved into shoes by car-size knitting machines.
Right now, the shoes are available in two silhouettes — a rounded and a pointed-toe version. Shoppers further have 20 patterns from which to choose.
Yesterday, TechCrunch talked with Martin and Hawthornthwaite about how, given their very different backgrounds, they came together to form this modern shoe company. We also talked about the company’s funding picture, including the $5 million that it quietly raised from Lightspeed Venture Partners in April. (The company had earlier raised $2 million in convertible notes, including from Finn Capital Partners, M13 and Grace Beauty Capital.) Our chat has been edited for length.
TC: Neither of you worked in retail. How did Rothy’s come into being?
SH: I’d spent around 18 years focused on M&A [at various banks]. A lot of what I’d worked on was in e-commerce and highly relevant, and by 2010, I was ready to make a change and really wanted to build something on my own. Roth and I have been friends for about 10 years, and professionally, he was in the same place. He’d been running a gallery and wanted to bring his design aesthetic [to something new].
RM: We were at a dinner and started kicking ideas around. We both have a passion for consumer goods and discussed a number of ideas but settled on footwear based on a number of trends we saw developing, including women wearing workout clothes whether or not they were working out. We wanted to create a front-of-the-closet shoe that she [the customer] can gravitate toward, without knowing what’s happening on a particular day.
TC: How did you decide to create knitted footwear, specifically?
RM: What drew us to knitting was the ability to create shaped art. Instead of cutting a circle from a square, one could knit a circle and eliminate waste in doing so. In typical manufacturing, 30 percent of materials can end up as waste. So we innovated by being able to program shaped parts. That drew us to knitting, then that drew us to footwear. [I will add that] the requirements of footwear in terms of fit and standardization is really complicated; we had no appreciation for that at the time.
TC: Where are the shoes made?
SH: We have 100 employees in southern China, working in a 65,000-square-foot factory that we own. The shoes are made by knitting machines that are about the size of a car, and which we’ve been adding to quickly to keep up with demand. We have waitlists for certain items; demand is still outstripping our expectations, but we’re catching up.
TC: What’s your marketing strategy? I can’t open Facebook without seeing a Rothy’s ad.
SH: Word of mouth is a huge element; customers email us all the time, delighted with their discovery of the shoes. The Facebook strategy is to visually make people who haven’t heard of Rothy’s aware of the product. Despite that you may be seeing a number of ads, we’re not spending as much money on Facebook when you look at it holistically. We’re seeing great return on our ad spend, but it’s way less than half our marketing budget.
TC: What other platforms are giving you the most bang for your buck?
RM: Facebook is important. We’re also using Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Bing, keyword advertising. I’d say we’re getting good traction on Instagram; any platform that’s particularly visual is effective.
TC: Many e-commerce companies are jumping right into off-line channels to raise brand awareness. You had a pop-up store at a farmer’s market in San Francisco. Is a brick-and-mortar store in your future?
SH: No. For now, we’re focused on direct-to-consumer. We have no wholesale or retail strategy.
TC: What about other products? What’s coming?
RM: We’re taking a really disciplined approach to any new categories. What we’re selling isn’t going to change any time soon. Where we’d like to innovate right now is by continuing to invest in our fiber technology.
TC: How long is the production cycle?
RM: We’re writing purchase orders for 15 days from now, so it’s a very nimble and responsive manufacturing process. We’re not taking a lot of inventory risk; this is just-in-time manufacturing.
TC: You’ve used five million water bottles so far. How many bottles go into each shoe?
SH: We don’t release that information.
TC: In other words, you aren’t talking about how many shoes you’ve sold so far. I’ve also read that you donate an undisclosed percent of each purchase to an organization, the Ocean Cleanup Project. Why that organization, and can you be more specific about what you’re donating?
RM: We haven’t put a stake in the ground as it relates to the ocean per se. They have one of the most innovative approaches going, but we’re always looking for equally beneficial technologies. [Regarding how much we donate], there’s no [hard-and-fixed percentage]. We intend to give generously when we can.
TC: Which shoes are selling best, and are you profitable?
SH: We’ve been profitable since the beginning. Our sales break pretty evenly between the point and [rounded toe]. Our most popular color is black. Generally, black shoes outsell others in the industry by a significant margin.
TC: I’ve read that the shoes themselves can be recycled. Does that say something about their durability? Also, is this something you’re actively encouraging customers to think about?
RM: The shoes last a really long time. Our wives are still wearing pairs that are several years old at this point. With washing — and their washability is a key selling point — they come out looking brand new.
To recycle, customers can just go to our website, print up a label at the end of [their shoes’] life, and they can be used [by Plusfoam, a partner company that makes other performance materials] for low-grade carpets and other things.

Altaeros, a Boston-based startup that develops autonomous aerostats, announced today that it has received $7.5 million in new funding from SoftBank Group. The capital will speed up the launch of SuperTower, a project that uses Altaeros’ tethered balloons (pictured above) to bring broadband wireless to rural areas.
This is the second time SoftBank has funded Altaeros. Its first investment of $7 million in 2014 was used for the development of Altaeros’ airborne wind turbines to provide renewable energy. Altaeros, whose other investors include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and RNT Associates (Indian industrialist Ratan Tata’s investment vehicle), has now raised a total of about $20 million.
SoftBank’s interest in Altaeros is understandable: not only is cleantech one of its investment focuses, but it also holds a majority stake in Sprint and SuperTower may give the telecom (and its competitors) new opportunities.
Launched in 2010 at MIT, Altaeros’ team anticipated from the beginning that its aerostats can be used for many commercial applications, says co-founder Adam Rein. Over the last two years, the startup has focused on developing SuperTower to answer increased demand for cost-effective broadband infrastructure that can cover rural areas and bring Internet to the four billion people who still don’t have access.
The SuperTower is a tethered aerostat that floats 800 feet above ground. Altaeros says it enables telecoms to expand their LTE (and future 5G) networks to rural areas at “up to 70% lower cost, in half the time and with significantly lower energy” than conventional towers. SuperTower can be deployed for permanent or temporary use, like during an emergency.
An obvious question is what advantages does SuperTower offer over Google’s Project Loon and Facebook Aquila, which use high-altitude balloons and solar-powered planes, respectively, to provide low-cost broadband coverage?
Rein says SuperTower’s key difference is that it integrates easily into existing networks. “From the carrier’s perspective, the SuperTower is just another tower type. It uses the same radios and antennas and permitting frameworks, and it provides last-mile connectivity to the end users in exactly the same way,” he explains. SuperTower is less expensive to deploy, however, and covers a much larger area. Rein claims that one SuperTower can provide coverage equivalent to 30 conventional towers.
Unlike Project Loon or Facebook Aquila, SuperTower aerostats remain fixed to the ground with conductive tethers, which also provide electricity for high-capacity radio. This means SuperTower can handle large numbers of people engaging in high-bandwidth activities, like streaming videos.
Project Loon and SuperTower both provide last-mile connectivity, but Project Loon uses solar panels and batteries. This limits how much capacity it can handle, but Rein says this also means it is suited for use in very rural areas where there are a few users spread out over wide distances. But Facebook Aquila, as well as OneWeb satellites, can complement SuperTower because they provide middle-mile connectivity, while SuperTower is meant for the last mile. Combined, the systems can reduce costs and speed up access to the Internet.
Altaeros is exploring other uses for its balloons, which it bills as the “only full-scale autonomous aerostat solution in the world.”
“Traditional aerostats are surprisingly labor-intensive to operate. They require large crews to manually handle the lines whenever they want to launch or recover a system,” Rein says. “The cost of keeping this crew on call has limited aerostats to mostly defense and government applications.”
The aerostats are designed to be used for different durations, but Altaeros generally targets a deployment time of one to two months. After that, the aerostats are brought down, refilled and launched again, a process that takes less than an hour. They don’t need a full-time ground crew, which means more sectors can use them. Aside from telecommunications and renewable energy, Altaeros’ technology can also be helpful for disaster relief and agricultural and environmental monitoring.
“We will aim to develop as many services as we can for the network that we deploy,” says Rein. “At the end of the day, an autonomous aerostat is a platform and its potential applications are only limited by the creativity of our customers.”

We’re taking a look at the IPOs of tech’s biggest players — firms we call the Big 5. We started with Amazon and Google. Today, we’re taking a look at Microsoft. 
Microsoft went public in 1986 for $21 per share, a price that was both higher than what many expected it to command, and a figure that was reportedly higher than Bill Gates wanted.
The firm was profitable, had money in the bank and was not under pressure from external investors to go public. Essentially, Microsoft was the complete opposite of what we often see in the current tech cycle: unicorns limping across the finish line, nursing haircuts, thirsty for cash.
Our series of brief looks at the IPOs of tech’s biggest players have thus far included Amazon, which booked shocking growth and comparatively slim losses, and Google, which, before it sprouted a parent company, was merely a profitable juggernaut. Microsoft, debuting just over a decade before the bookstore, went public in a different era.
1986, after all, was the year Metallica released Master of Puppets. By 1997, when Amazon went public, Metallica was busy putting out Reload — short hair and all. If that doesn’t illustrate the different periods in which the firms went public, nothing will.

For Microsoft, we’ll start with a look at the company’s roots. We’ll then look at its IPO numbers and wrap up with notes. Let’s go!
A short pre-IPO preamble
The first milestone Microsoft lists in its IPO prospectus comes in 1975 when the firm built and sold a “BASIC Interpreter.” In 1980, the document later noted, the firm began to build for IBM’s “Personal Computer.” In 1981, the IBM Personal Computer came out with Microsoft’s MS-DOS.
In 1983, Microsoft sold its first mouse and released Word. In 1985, it started selling Excel. And, later that same year, the company started “shipping Microsoft Windows, a graphical operating environment that runs on the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system.”
In 1986, Microsoft went public.
A coda on IPO timing, venture capitalists and control
That Microsoft waited 11 years from its founding date to go public is notable. It smacks a bit of the modern unicorn, a cohort that can take far longer to go public than the prior median of 7.4 years for a software company.
But Microsoft held a couple of cards in its hand that helped it avoid going public: it never lost money on an annual basis, and it was never materially beholden to venture capitalists to help it grow (mostly). Therefore, its path to IPO was devoid of the normal pressures of falling cash reserves and impatient investors.
On the first point, a 2013 Q&A with Bill Gates that took place at Harvard is worth our time. A slightly cleaned excision of a Gates’ remarks is illustrative. Here, Gates discusses the company’s history of operational profit:
We didn’t have to build any factories, we were cash positive and we didn’t have a year where we lost money.
So that’s the profit point. Gates did also note, in the same answer, that there was a time when he was not paid by the company. Therefore, we should take the profit point with some salt. But the fact that the company could self-fund is fair, either way.
To our second point, Gates continued:

We eventually gave away, or sold, 5 percent of the company for a million dollars at a 20 million dollar valuation, just to get a venture capital company to join our board and give us some adult advice about various things, which was quite helpful. We picked one in the Valley, a guy named Dave Marquardt came on our board and did a fantastic job.
That money sat in the bank, and it’s still in the bank today, so it was not for anything to do with capital, but rather just to join the team.

To the credit of the company, I initially thought that its Crunchbase profile was wrong. It lists a single, million-dollar investment from Technology Venture Investors. And that’s what Microsoft took on before its IPO.
In short, Microsoft grew, made money, launched Windows and then went public. Let’s get to that last bit.
Private growth
In the following paragraphs, listed dates and time frames hew to Microsoft’s fiscal calendar, which ends at the close of June. In short, Microsoft’s fiscal fourth quarter of any given year is the same as the calendar second of the same. Similarly, the third calendar quarter of any year is the first quarter of Microsoft’s next fiscal year. If you don’t like it, join the club.
Heading into its IPO, Microsoft’s revenue grew quickly in the 1980s. The firm booked just under $25 million of top line in 1982, which roughly doubled in 1983, and doubled again in 1984. The firm’s growth slowed to around 40 percent in 1985.
Through all of that, and per our prior Gates notes, the company booked profit. Its net income grew from $3.5 million in 1982 to $24 million in 1985. In the six months (calendar) that closed out 1985, the firm netted a stronger $17 million.
According to its IPO prospectus, the firm had $38.2 million in cash on hand at the time it debuted, similar to the proceeds it expected to garner in its IPO ($39.4 million, before certain expenses). If those figures sound small, recall that this was the era of Master of Puppets, not Reload, and especially not St. Anger (one year before Google’s own IPO).
So what is a company worth that just broke through the $100 million revenue threshold with a long track record of profits?
Prepare to be wrong.
Public pricing
Microsoft’s IPO process has a storyline worth repeating, as it will underscore our point about the difference in eras. Microsoft did not command a Snap-esque revenue multiple in the dozens of dozens of dozens. Instead, it went for something closer to what unprofitable current-era SaaS companies would be content with.
According to a paper published in the Journal of Case Research in Business and Economics, Microsoft’s path to IPO entailed one of its founders working to depress its initial pricing. It didn’t work, really, but observe the following:
A bull market had been in progress during this time, and now the underwriters were suggesting a price range of $17-$20 per share, but the preliminary prospectus indicated a possible offer price of $16-$19 per share. (New York Times, 1986) In an unusual move for corporate executives, Gates insisted on and got the lower price range. He felt secure with a minimum price of $16, believing that at this price, there was little risk of having to lower it, and he was uncomfortable with the $20 price because it would push Microsoft’s market value above a half billion dollars, which he believed was too high.
Microsoft eventually did price above $20, landing at $21.
The company’s post-IPO valuation seems laughable compared to its then-current revenues, and, naturally, to its value today. But let’s be precise at what is funny. 1986 Fortune has the data:
Its shares, offered at $21 on March 13, zoomed to $35.50 on the over-the-counter market before settling back to a recent $31.25. Microsoft and its shareholders raised $61 million. The biggest winner was William H. Gates III, the company’s co-founder and chairman. He got only $1.6 million for the shares he sold, but going public put a market value of $350 million on the 45% stake he retains.
Just using Fortune’s rough math, 45 percent of some whole worth $350 million implies that the full canoe is worth around $777 million. At that sort of multiple, Snap wouldn’t be able to afford a Snapple.
Afters and laters
Regardless, Microsoft’s IPO did well, kicking off the public life of the third most valuable tech company in the world, and the third most valuable company in the world.
All that was to come: From the Netscape saga, to antitrust, to the dot-com excesses, to Windows XP through Windows 7, 8, and 10, Zune, Azure, Windows Phone’s failure and the success of Outlook.com and its commercial cloud, the road ahead was long.
Regardless, its foundation was already in place. Microsoft had shown that making money off software was a pretty good business.

Earlier this month, reports confirmed a Spotify app for Microsoft’s Xbox One was in internal beta testing. Today, that app is becoming publicly available. The new Spotify app for the Xbox One is now launching in 34 markets worldwide, Spotify announced, allowing gamers to play songs, albums and playlists directly from their console, including while in a gaming session.
The app, which is available for download from the Xbox Store, works both for free Spotify users as well as those who pay for the Premium version of the service.
To get started, you’ll need to either login with your Spotify credentials or create a new account directly in the app. Gamers can then choose to browse in Spotify to its “Gaming” section, where there are a number of pre-curated playlists to choose from, like “Epic Gaming,” “Power Gaming,” and a playlist created by Xbox’s own Major Nelson.
Because you’ll want to be able to control the music without having to interrupt your game, the app experience on Xbox will also work with the Spotify app on your phone, tablet or laptop through Spotify Connect. That means you can do things like pause or skip tracks or select new tunes from another device, which are then streamed to your Xbox while you’re still in your game.
“Music continues to be essential when creating the ultimate gaming experience”, said Mikael Ericsson, Product Director, Platform & Partner Experience at Spotify, in a statement about the launch. “Starting today, we’re really excited to offer Xbox One gamers the ability to choose their own unique soundtrack while enjoying their favorite games.”
The launch of Spotify on Xbox One is long overdue, given that it’s been available on PlayStation 4 since 2015. But Microsoft had its own music service with Groove that it clearly wanted to prop up. Perhaps the company has at last comes to terms with the fact that not having Spotify available to gamers gave rival Sony a competitive advantage.
The console makers themselves have largely failed to find success with their own music services. Sony shut down its Music Unlimited service in 2015, leaving Spotify to power the music for gamers on its platform. And Microsoft’s Groove Music (previously Xbox Music) has far less demand compared with Spotify and its footprint of 140 million users worldwide.
Spotify will be available on Xbox in the following markets: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the U.K., and the U.S.

The launch of Spotify on Xbox comes alongside a larger update for the gaming platform, rolling out to Insiders on the Alpha Ring today. This release includes updates to Home, Guide and Community sections on the platform, while updates to Avatars, Game Hubs, Profiles and more will arrive this fall.
When Andrew Ng announced Deeplearning.ai back in June, it was hard to know exactly what the AI frontiersman was up to. In his time since departing as Baidu’s chief scientist, Ng has been developing a sequel of sorts to his popular introductory machine learning Coursera class. This go around, he is focusing specifically on deep learning.
Coursera’s new Deep Learning Specialization Certificate will feature five courses. These classes, a collaboration between Ng and Stanford grad students Kian Katanforoosh and Younes Mourr, will teach neural networks, backpropagation, convolutional nets and recurrent nets in addition to other core aspects of deep learning.
Students who enroll will also be able to participate in applied deep learning projects to address real-world problems in healthcare, music generation and language understanding. Some of the lectures will include interviews with deep learning developers. Three of the five courses are launching today.
“Demand for deep learning vastly outstrips supply,” Ng explained to me in an interview. “It’s concentrated in a few labs, a few leading universities and technically lots of knowledge is in ARXIV.”

Ng’s initial machine learning class became Coursera’s first class back in 2011. Since then, more than 1.5 million students have taken the class. His goal is still helping to create the easiest way for students to contribute to the growth in the field of AI and its applications in addressing global challenges.
“With the rise of electricity, we saw the rise of the electrical engineering discipline,” Ng explained. Ng has long been a proponent of comparing AI to electricity.
A few companies will be providing tools and resources to students, but the aim was to ensure the class didn’t end up over-branded. In recent months, data science communities like Kaggle, which was acquired by Google, have drawn a lot of attention from cloud service providers.
It doesn’t benefit anyone in the long run if students only get exposure to a single deep learning framework from a large tech company because of a sponsorship agreement. But Ng is clear that he’s here to teach the most useful material to learners. In this case, that means teaching deep learning in a low-level language like Python before even thinking about frameworks.
Students interested in taking the new courses should look to the Coursera site here. The only prerequisite is basic programming knowledge, a proficiency in Python and ideally a general understanding of machine learning.
Ng told me that he is working on three distinct projects. While he opted not to specify details, he did say the others would be more specific AI products. And as to funding — Ng thus far didn’t want to get into details.

Advertisers on Facebook’s Audience Network will no longer have to worry that they’re paying for users who accidentally clicked on their ads.
I’m betting we’ve all had moments where we were scrolling or swiping or clicking through a website/mobile app and we ended up clicking on an ad without really meaning to. (Those moments probably outnumber the times I’ve intentionally clicked on an ad.)
So Product Marketing Manager Brett Vogel said Facebook won’t be charging for those clicks in its Audience Network (where Facebook runs ads in other apps), and those clicks won’t be included in the metrics shared with advertisers and publishers.
Facebook is sorting out unintentional clicks by discounting instances where a user bounces back after two seconds or less. After all, if you clicked on an ad and then immediately clicked back, you probably didn’t care about the ad.
Still, Vogel said the two-second threshold is a “starting point” that Facebook can adjust if necessary.
Publishers may worry that this change could hurt their bottom line, but Vogel said the “vast majority” will not be affected, because their ads aren’t driving a significant number of unintentional clicks. He added that Facebook is making the change for the good of the ecosystem.
“Unintentional clicks end up delivering really poor experiences for people and advertisers,” he said. “It’s not a good path for publishers to build sustainable businesses.”
In addition, Facebook is also announcing that it’s making new ad metrics available (it’s been making a broader push around this).
Those metrics including gross impressions, a number that combines billable impressions with non-billable impressions — advertisers aren’t paying for things like non-human traffic, but some of them have still asked to see the numbers. Facebook is also adding auto-refresh impressions (those are ad impressions for banners on the right-hand side) and gross auto-refresh impressions.
Everyone should be saving for retirement, but not everyone has an employer that offers a 401(k) plan. Guideline wants to change that, and the company has raised $15 million to grow its base of small business customers making retirement more attainable for employees.
Founded in 2015, Guideline wants to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to offer 401(k) retirement accounts. It does this with a SaaS-based offering that includes a small $500 fee for setup and monthly charges based on the number of employees that participate.
Unlike legacy 401(k) providers, Guideline doesn’t make its money off a percentage of its assets under management. As a result, the company is not incentivized to ignore SMBs, which typically don’t have enough employees (or assets) for most financial institutions to justify winning their business.
This was a key insight founder Kevin Busque had in building the business. He got interested in the problem while at his previous company, TaskRabbit, when he began offering retirement accounts as a benefit to employees.
Even after introducing the plan to employees, he noticed that the company had a very low participation rate. After digging in, he realized that was due to lack of education and understanding on the part of employees around which funds to pick and how much they should be putting aside for retirement.
In 2015, Busque decided to build Guideline not just to make it easier for employers to offer 401(k) plans, but also to increase employee participation. Part of that stems from integrating with payroll providers that SMBs already use, including Gusto, OnPay, BambooHR and Xero.
And part of it comes from just offering a better product to the end user — the employee — in helping them set up and manage their retirement accounts. By answering a few questions about their age, salary and risk tolerance, Guideline can provide a recommended plan for them.
Since going live last summer, the company has grown to attract nearly 2,000 employers who offer plans using its platform and amassing more than $120 million in assets under management. And Guideline has another 3,000 companies in its backlog that could convert into paying customers.
As a result of that growth since launch, Guideline today is announcing a $15 million round of financing led by Felicis Ventures. Along with the funding, Felicis managing partner Aydin Senkut will join Guideline’s board.
The company plans to use the funding to grow its engineering and customer success teams, which it plans to drive more partnerships and hopefully more customers signing up over time.
Prior to this round, Guideline had raised $9 million from investors that include Propel Venture Partners, NEA, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, SV Angel, Red Swan Ventures, BoxGroup, Xfund and 500 Startups.
Swarm has been through a lot of changes since it launched in May 2014.
The app, which originally debuted as a social utility to let people check-in to locations and meet up with their friends, has since shifted to a gamified location-sharing app. Today, the company is looking to revamp the app once again, with a new focus on lifelogging.
So much of our lives is now contained within searchable data. We store our memories in Instagram and Facebook, revisit our years-old micro-thoughts on Twitter, track our health with apps like Clue and FitBit, and the list goes on and on. Swarm, with the launch of version 5.0, wants to be the best at telling you about where you’ve been in the real world.
That starts with a brand new home page, simplifying the app considerably. The old Swarm launched you into a page with five tabs at the bottom and two tabs at the top, offering the ability to look at your own check-ins as well as the check-ins of your friends.
Now, the home screen has just three tabs: Me, Check-in, and My Friends.
“Historically, our biggest challenge has been to make things simpler as opposed to more complex,” said Foursquare cofounder and Executive Chairman Dennis Crowley. “It’s very easy to continue adding features, but we challenged ourselves to remove 70 percent of the complexity from the app so that users can understand it right away.”
Swarm 5.0 launches directly into the Profile (Me) tab, with an interactive map at the top showing you exactly where you’ve been. At a glance, I can see that I’ve been to 671 places across 77 categories, making up a total of 1,277 check-ins.
Below the map, you’ll find your own timeline of events, including who was there with you and how many coins you received. More importantly, however, the profile page offers a fantastic search tool. Users can search by friends they checked in with, city, category, or even the type of restaurant.
This should make it easier for users to remember where they’ve been no matter how much time has passed.
At the top of the Profile page is your profile picture. Clicking into it will take the user to their personal insight page, letting users check on their mayorships, their top categories, sticker progress, photos, and friends.
Speaking of, the Friends feed is also somewhat simplified, integrating the old “Games” tab into the friend timeline to show where you stand on the leaderboard. And, as expected, users can follow along chronologically with their friends check-ins from this page, which is also searchable.
Notifications on friend requests and incoming direct messages can also be found on the top right of the Friends page.
The check-in screen is the most familiar in the new Swarm 5.0. The app automatically decides where you are instead of sending you into a search page, with easy options to change location quickly.

All the same accoutrements, like stickers, text, friend-tagging and photos, are all available in their usual spots. However, alongside the Twitter and Facebook share buttons, Swarm has now added an Off-The-Grid button for folks who want to check-in without broadcasting their location to their friends.
“We were seeing a lot of people ask ‘what the heck is this thing?’,” said Crowley. “Super users stuck with the app but we were losing a lot of new users in the meantime. This version of the app is designed so users can really understand the story behind it and hopefully fall in love with it.”
Swarm has seemingly come full circle from its origins within the old Foursquare, letting users log their locations in a searchable fashion. After ditching mayorships and leaderboards in the first iteration of Swarm, those things are now alive and well. After trying and failing to introduce a social utility that lets friends meet up in the real world, the core of Foursquare check-ins has remained.
In short: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
Facebook is paring down its collection of standalone apps. The company’s experimental “teens-only” app Lifestage, designed to counteract Snapchat’s threat, has been pulled from the App Store. Its disappearance was first spotted by Business Insider, and Facebook confirmed its removal. However, Lifestage isn’t the only Facebook app that’s being killed off as of late – the company is also closing down its Groups app, first launched in 2014 to help users better discover, search and connect with their various Facebook Groups.
In its announcement about the Groups’ app’s closure, Facebook said it believed the team could do more for the community by working on improvements to Groups within the main Facebook app.
It seems that’s been the case for some time, however. The Facebook Groups app had grown to be very buggy in recent months, often to the point of becoming unusable. And it didn’t look like Facebook had any interest in fixing those glitches, much less continuing to roll out improvements to the Groups app overall.

Groups, I’d argue, ultimately failed because it didn’t address the problem with using Groups on Facebook at all. There was no News Feed in the app where you could browse just Group posts without Page updates and status updates from friends mixed in; there was no universal search across your Groups; and there was no way to organize Groups into collections for easier access, among other oversights.
The app itself has already been removed from the App Store, and will stop functioning for existing users on September 1st, Facebook says.
While Facebook Groups is still a key focus for the social network going forward – if not as its own, separate mobile experience – it’s not as surprising that Facebook shutting down Lifestage.
That app, by design, targeted a limited user base – only those 21 or younger could even sign up. Launched last year by then 19-year old product designer Michael Sayman, Lifestage put a heavy emphasis on video and on getting to know your friends through a Q&A type experience.
But Facebook no longer needs a direct counterpoint to Snapchat. It has Instagram. In April, Instagram’s Stories feature hit 200 million users, surpassing Snapchat’s user base of 161 million. As of this month, Instagram Stories has 250 million daily users compared to Snapchat’s 166 million.
The company has blatantly ripped off some of Snapchat’s best features, like its augmented reality and selfie filters. Its ability to clone Snapchat’s features is speeding up, TechCrunch’s Josh Constine also recently noted. Though it took nearly three years to launch its version of Stories, Instagram was able to copy the “create your stickers” feature in four months.
That leaves little need to continue to focus on an app like Lifestage, which never became an App Store success. At the beginning of August, it was ranked #1,392 on the iOS’s free charts in the U.S., and unranked on Google Play.
This is not the first time Facebook has cleaned house of under-performing apps. A couple of years ago, it closed down its internal incubator Creative Labs, along with several of its apps, including photo-sharing app Slingshot, anonymous chat app Rooms, and collaborative video app Riff.
The launch of iOS 10 and its iMessage Store has launched emojis and stickers into mainstream communication. In fact, 6 billion emoticons are sent every day. And a new startup called MojiLaLa is looking to capitalize, both figuratively and literally.
MojiLaLa is a marketplace that lets artists submit their sticker packs to the iOS store with zero hassle, for free.
The company has just raised $1.5 million in seed funding from Great Oaks Ventures and betaworks ventures, and IVP partner Dennis Phelps.
Founder and CEO Dana Loberg, a former artist, says that the process of submitting art to the App Store requires learning XCode, owning a Mac and iPhone, and $99. MojiLaLa does all the heavy lifting for artists for free, letting them focus on their artwork instead of their business development.
MojiLaLa lists these sticker packs within iOS on behalf of the artists, and splits revenue 50/50. Loberg says that, eventually, the company plans to expand artist revenues to an 80 percent share once the visual communication revolution is in full swing.
Alongside listing sticker packs for artists, MojiLaLa also has its own app (MojiLaLa Unlimited) that lets users subscribe to get complete access to over 25,000 stickers. Users pay $1.99/month to get access to these stickers, and artists who opt-in to list on MojiLaLa unlimited get an extra level of visibility for their work.
As we advance closer to mainstream AR/VR experiences, a relationship with artists become incredibly important. Artists are the ones who create the face filters we use in Snapchat, and the virtual objects we’ll interact with in Facebook Spaces, and that list will only continue to grow.
MojiLaLa wants to position itself as the over-arching representative of those artists in the tech world, handling all the back-end expertise and heavy lifting while giving artists the opportunity to put their work on the platforms we use the most.
MojiLaLa has integrations with platforms like Kika Keyboard, Baidu, Giphy, Line, Facebook Messenger, Microsoft, Skype, Gfycat, and Telegram, with more than 2,000 artists on the platform.
Eventually, the company wants to start brokering partnerships between brands and artists for branded sticker packs. For now, however, MojiLaLa is focused on scaling the platform and expanding the engineering team.
Verizon Ventures and R/GA are kicking off the first round of their digital media “venture studio” and unveiling the first lineup of startups.
The program was announced back in March, with the goal of helping Verizon find innovation in media and advertising. The company says startups will be connecting — and potentially partnering with — its teams at Oath (the digital media organization that owns TechCrunch), Go90, FiOS and elsewhere.
The venture studio will operate out of Verizon’s new Alley co-working space in New York City. The startups will receive $100,000 in funding, and will participate in a demo day when the program ends in November.
Here are the companies:


Ad Lightning offers monitoring software that notifies publishers of potentially harmful advertising.


cognitiveVR helps brands and marketers record and analyze their virtual reality content, and to poll their users about the experience.


GankStars is a mobile-first esports organization, with teams in  Vainglory, Critical Ops and other titles.


Imposium uses dynamic rendering to create marketing videos that are personalized to each user.


ScoreStream is a platform for crowdsourced content around high school and local sports. 


Streamroot offers distribution tools to large online video broadcasters.


Transmit.Live allows customers to send live video to multiple destinations and to promote their livestreams.


Vidrovr is a video search startup focused on helping news organizations surface relevant content in their video libraries.

“We look forward to bringing R/GA’s award-winning services together with Verizon Ventures to help the chosen startup companies achieve meaningful scale,” said Stephen Plumlee, R/GA Global Chief Operating Officer and Managing Partner of R/GA Ventures, in the announcement.

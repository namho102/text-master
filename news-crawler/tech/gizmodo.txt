All things must come to an end, including human civilization. Whether it’s a superbug pandemic tomorrow or a supernova sun in billions of years, one day, somehow, the apocalypse will arrive. You and loved ones plan on being ready for it, and ready for what comes after.
Here are eleven damn useful holiday gifts to ensure that you not only survive the End Times but rebuild and prosper, zombie hordes be damned.
Living in an apocalyptic wasteland, you’re naturally going to be concerned about nuclear radiation. That’s where Quatra-Rad’s RADEX 1503+ high accuracy geiger counter and radiation detector can help. This handheld device can be used to measure beta, gamma, and x-ray radiation, so you’ll never have to wonder if that meal you just scrounged up is going to make your insides explode. It’s got an easy-to-use interface, and an audio and vibration alarm that’ll go off when you venture too close to an area bathing in radioactive waste. It takes a pair of AAA batteries, so you’ll need to stock up on those too before armageddon hits. (RADEX by Quarta-Rad, $158)
Speaking of radiation, you’re also going to want to load up on some high-potency potassium iodine. Known as KI to chemists, this chemical compound prevents radioactive iodine from being absorbed by the thyroid gland, which is a very good thing seeing as your thyroid plays critical role in metabolism, growth, and development.


When a person ingests potassium iodine, the thyroid gland becomes “full,” preventing radioactive iodine from filtering in for 24 hours. Pop one of these suckers if you’re at risk of being zapped by some gamma radiation, and you can rest with ease. Do yourself a favor and grab a bunch, but pay attention to those expiration dates. (Relentless Improvement, $17)
The apocalypse may sound dark, but your survival bunker shouldn’t be. Provided this isn’t a Matrix-esque robots-blacking-out-the-sky situation, MPOWERD’s solar-powered LED lantern will keep your long nights illuminated, lasting up to 12 hours on a single, seven-hour charge. And if you’re planning to go backpacking through civilization’s wreckage, don’t forget to bring it along, too. The lantern is collapsible, waterproof, and weighs just 4.4 pounds. (MPOWERD, $6)
Of all the ways civilization could end, a bio-apocalypse has to be of the scariest. After all, survivors are just one contaminated drink away from agonizing death (followed by re-animation as a zombie, obviously). To survive, you’ll need a water purifier that can remove all sorts of deadly bugs, from anthrax spores and bubonic plague to tiny, genetically modified superviruses. Available in 5 and 12 liter sizes, LifeStraw’s gravity-fed water filter is rated to remove 99.99+ percent of biological contaminants, and has a lifetime capacity of 18,000 liters. (LifeStraw, $130)
You’re going to have a lot of new skills to learn once armageddon hits. With a good fire starter, at least, you can ensure your meat is properly cooked until you master the art of striking flint against knife. This handy survival device ignites in rain or shine, and is good for up to 4,000 strikes—which gives you plenty of time to figure out how to make fires the old fashioned way. (Ultimate Survival Technologies, $13)
Rated to keep astronauts warm during space exploration—provided you also have a decent spacecraft—TITAN’s emergency sleeping bag is a must-have for apocalypse survivors seeking to weather the most extreme environmental changes. (Remember Snowpiercer? A climate apocalypse doesn’t necessarily mean global warming.) Best of all, this extra warm sleeping bag packs into a nylon drawstring bag that’ll fit comfortably in your survival pack. (TITAN Survival, $18)
Described as one tool with “a couple thousand uses,” Leatherman’s Signal multi-tool won’t solve all of your problems in the apocalypse, but it’ll solve a lot of the little ones, from cutting through barbed wire fences to picking locks to opening all of those canned rations you’re going to be eating. The multi-tool features two kinds of pliers, wire cutters and strippers, a combo knife, a saw, a hammer, a box wrench, and more. The only tool I can’t imagine getting much use in the apocalypse is the safety whistle. (Leatherman, $100)
Eventually, you’re going to have to get used to a low-tech lifestyle after civilization collapses. But with a little care and a sun-powered charger, your beloved smartphones, tablets, and laptops might last a long time—definitely long enough to memorize every movie and TV show you downloaded back to front. Anker’s 15 Watt USB charger is compact, lightweight, and rated to convert about 20 percent of the sun’s energy into sweet, sweet electricity, enough to charge two devices simultaneously. Of course, if nuclear winter forces you to migrate underground, get used to reading paper books again. (Anker, $80)
One of my favorite apocalypse writers, Paolo Bacigalupi, thinks a lot about the future of food. In his hit science fiction novel The Windup Girl, aggressive genetic modification of the global food supply renders our staple crops susceptible to horrific diseases. Only after generations of ecological destruction do scientists realize the error of their ways, and begin hunting for lost genetic diversity to fortify the world’s dwindling food supply.


Whether or not we’re in for a GMO-trigged ag-pocalypse, the ability to grow a variety of foods will be critical to our long-term survival after collapse. With 32 varieties of fruits and vegetables from corn to kale to cantaloupe, this 15,000 seed survival garden is going to be your lifeline, so keep it somewhere safe. (Open Seed Vault, $18)
Nothing like an actual armageddon to make violent fantasy realms seem pretty relatable, am I right? Entertainment is a must in the post-apocalyptic future, and if your people can’t get their kicks from stories, they’re going to start torturing animals. With this 5-box set of George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones series, you can relive the exhilarating adventures of Starks, Targaryens and Lannisters long after HBO’s dead.


Let’s just hope our buddy George gives this series an ending before the End Times hits. (Amazon, $30)
Surviving the apocalypse isn’t just about fighting off zombies and cannibalistic road warriors, although those bits are important and exciting. Eventually, once you and your fellow survivors establish a secure base, you need to think about rebuilding civilization. Lewis Dartnell’s The Knowledge will help you get started.


We take for granted the centuries of accumulated learning, in everything from mining to medicine, that’s enabled countless technologies and consumer goods to permeate our lives. But after the global supply chain and industrial-scale production collapses, we’re going to have to learn how to do a lot of things from scratch. Want to build a radio? First, you’ll need to extract metals from the ground, produce electricity, and learn to solve problems like an engineer. Dartnell’s apocalypse guide is a brilliant primer on all of this and more.

On December 5th, 1952, a veil of fog rolled over the city of London. It was the start of the deadliest air pollution disaster in British history, and more than sixty years later, an international team of chemists has figured out why.
Locals paid little heed to the fog at first—after all, foggy days have been a hallmark of life in Britain for thousands of years. But by late afternoon, the sky had taken on a yellowish hue and was beginning to smell like rotten eggs.


The next day, the air was the color of pea soup and reeked of foul garbage. As the hours  wore on, visibility got poorer and poorer, and breathing outside became painful. This torture went on for five days. By the time the fog lifted on December 9th, 150,000 people had been hospitalized. Experts now estimate that over 12,000 men, women, and children died from exposure to the befouled air.
London’s Great Smog, as the disaster is now known, was immediately (and correctly) blamed on coal. But the details of what exactly happened remained elusive for decades. Now, through laboratory experiments and atmospheric measurements in two pollution-prone Chinese cities, Xi’an and Beijing, a team lead by Texas A&M’s Renyi Zhang has worked out a likely explanation for the Great Smog and other deadly air pollution events around the world. Their work is published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.


One of the hallmarks of the Great Smog was sulfate, particles of sulfuric acid that not only contributed to its hue and odor, but its toxic effects on humans. In their study, Zhang and his team demonstrate that under naturally foggy conditions, sulfate will build up inside water droplets due to chemical interactions between sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide both come out of coal-fired chimneys, and to a lesser extent, out the tailpipes of automobiles.


“People have known that sulfate was a big contributor to the fog, and sulfuric acid particles were formed from sulfur dioxide released by coal burning,” Zhang said in a statement. “Our results showed that this process was facilitated by nitrogen dioxide, another co-product of coal burning, and occurred initially on natural fog.”
Sulfate, in turn, helps promote the formation of other particles, including nitrate and organic matter, exacerbating the development of severe haze. Eventually, as the water in fog dries up, the acid becomes concentrated, leaving corrosive, gross looking haze particles that coat every surface they come in contact with, from sidewalks to human lungs.
The study found that similar chemistry is responsible for smoggy skies in Beijing and X’ian, although in these cities, agricultural chemicals like ammonia can play a role, too. While it took a certain combination of chemicals and unfavorable weather for  the Great Smog to develop, overall, the study suggests that the conditions behind this deadly event can, in theory, develop all over the world.
If there’s one silver lining to the Great Smog, it’s that it kickstarted an environmental movement that led to the passage of some of the first clean air laws. Now that we’ve worked out more of the finer details, the impetus for ridding the world of coal seems stronger than ever.

A new machine designed at Stanford University sends digital messages without electronics, using common household chemicals. Eventually, similar systems could allow tiny devices to communicate inside the body, or be adapted to environments in which traditional electronics break down.
This intriguing chemical-based communication system was developed by Nariman Farsad, a post-doctoral fellow at Andrea Goldsmith’s electrical engineering lab. Though unorthodox,  chemical communication opens up many new possibilities in the way we transmit and receive information. In addition to being wireless and cheap, it can work without the benefit of electronics. Consequently, it could be used in environments typically out of reach for electronic systems, such as under water or in places where metal is abundant.


In a nutshell, the system turns pH changes into code, using pulses of an acid (vinegar) and a base (household glass clear) to create zeros and ones. These yin-and-yang chemicals are enough for a small sensor to detect a change in pH, and encode that change as a zero or one. Voila, instant binary code—albeit one driven by liquids instead of electronics.
When using the system, the researchers type a desired message on a small computer. A signal goes out to a machine that pumps out the corresponding “bits” of chemicals, i.e. either a spurt of vinegar or the glass cleaner, which travels through plastic tubes to a small container containing the pH sensor. The changes are then transmitted to a computer that deciphers the encoded message.

Farsad used these particular chemicals because they’re easily obtainable, and because they cancel out at the receiving end of the system.


The potential for this system is limited only by the imagination. Scenarios proposed by the researchers include sending secret messages that others aren’t aware of, having robots message each other with chemical trails, or even substituting for conventional communications in the the event that the electric grid (or an electronic device) is knocked out by an electromagnetic pulse or terrorist attack. Excitingly, the system could even be adapted to work in the human body, in which nanobots could communicate with other tiny machines via liquid text.
This concept is still very much in its early stages, and several limitations still need to be sorted out, including finding ways to transmit the signals over longer distances, figuring out how to separate the signal from the noise at the end of the system (residue is a problem), and ways to power the system.
Here’s to hoping that Farsad and Goldsmith solve these issues—this idea is simply too cool to be allowed to die on the vine.

Scientists have learned that upwards of 25 percent of all people who become infected with Ebola show none of the typical symptoms. The finding suggests the recent West African Ebola Epidemic was more widespread than previously thought, and that new methods need to be developed to diagnose and contain the dreaded virus during an outbreak.
Typically, Ebola produces a panoply of symptoms, including fever, unexplained bleeding, headache, muscle pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing. As is well documented, this virus is particularly deadly, killing between 10 to 80 percent of people who exhibit these symptoms (the statistical spread reflects the divide between those who have access to intensive care and those who don’t).


But as a new study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases shows, a significant portion of people who contract Ebola don’t show any of the typical signs, meaning they’re asymptomatic, or their symptoms are relatively mild and not wholly reflective of how the virus affects most people. In other words, they have “minimally symptomatic infections.”
Prior to the new study, scientists suspected that Ebola, like many other viruses, might not always manifest in the same predictable way. The new study, led by Gene Richardson, a PhD candidate in anthropology at Stanford University and a former fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, now confirms this suspicion, while providing an actual estimate for the rate of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic infections in Ebola patients.


Following the recent West African Ebola Epidemic, Richardson and his colleagues went back to the rural village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a major hotspot for the outbreak. The village, which is home to 900 residents, recorded 34 cases of Ebola during the epidemic, including 28 deaths. Working with a local physician, Richardson’s team tested 187 men, women, and children from Sukudu who had likely been exposed to Ebola, either because they lived in the same household or shared a public toilet with a person known to have had the disease.


Of these, 14 were found to carry an antibody to Ebola—a sure sign that they were infected at some point. A dozen of these villagers said they had no symptoms of the disease, while two recalled having a fever at the time of the outbreak.
It’s now certainly possible that some of these villagers had full-blown symptoms but were fearful of admitting the truth to doctors. Consequently, more research with a larger sample pool will have to be performed. However, Richardson and his colleagues think they’re onto something, and that the villagers were probably telling the truth.
Importantly, the researchers aren’t sure if an asymptomatic person with Ebola can transmit the virus. “They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea,” noted Richardson in a statement. “It’s unclear if they can pass it along it sexually.”
Much like their human hosts, some deadly pathogens just can’t let go. That’s apparently true of the …
More research is needed to determine if Ebola can be spread by a person who shows no or very few symptoms, but it’s a very distinct possibility. A person with an infection still has Ebola particles in their body, which could find a way to “jump” to another person. But without the typical symptoms, it’s certainly much more difficult. As Richardson noted, the virus might be transmitted sexually, though that still needs to be proven in an asymptomatic individual.


Richardson and his colleagues are now working in other villages in Sierra Leone to get a better handle on the true number of people affected during the crisis. But if the figure of 25 percent is correct—and if Ebola can spread via asymptomatic people (that’s still a big if)—that presents a massive headache for health officials.
Adding insult to injury, the Ebola virus mutated into a deadlier form during the last outbreak, showing an ability to quickly adapt to human biology and become even more virulent. Taken together, these new findings show that Ebola spreads more rapidly and more broadly through a population, highlighting the need for new detection and containment techniques for when the next outbreak hits.

On Sunday’s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, doctors told Kim that a third pregnancy would be risky and even life-threatening owing to a potential complication known as a “retained placenta.” Here’s what that means, and why Kim is now seriously considering getting a surrogate mother.
During the episode, Kardashian visited two doctors, both of whom advised her to avoid a third pregnancy given the particular complications she experienced during her first two pregnancies.


“You never know if you might have the same type of problem that could be more serious this time,” said Dr. Paul Crane. “You’re always taking a little bit of a chance. There are situations where retained placenta could be life or death.” To which Kris Jenner added, “You could bleed to death.” A fertility specialist echoed these sentiments, advising: “Using a surrogate is not an unreasonable option. If our goal is to grow your family like you want to, then a surrogate makes sense.”
As noted by the doctors, a retained placenta is serious business. It’s when all or some of the placenta stays inside a mother’s womb after birth. The placenta is an organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, and it removes waste from the baby’s blood. Normally, the placenta, which is attached to the wall of the mother’s uterus, is expelled during the “third stage” of labor, and that usually happens about a half hour after the baby is born. (The next time a mother is pregnant, a new placenta forms.) But in a small number of cases, the placenta, or parts of it, gets stuck leading to some serious complications.


When the placenta or portions of it remain in the womb, the mother can experience symptoms such as heavy bleeding (post-partum hemorrhage, or PPH), stomach cramps, fever, and an inability to produce breastmilk. In some cases, the bleeding can be severe enough to threaten the life of the mother. If any fragments of the placenta remain, a mother may have to be readmitted to hospital to have them removed. The surgery is serious enough that the mother is put under anesthetic, and it needs to happen a few hours after birth to prevent bleeding. Antibiotics are typically prescribed to avoid infection.


Kardashian had preeclampsia during her first pregnancy, which involves high blood pressure, fluid retention, and placenta accreta, which is a form of retained placenta. In Kardashian’s case, her placenta grew too deeply into the uterine wall, and it failed to detach after birth. (Placenta accreta also happens when the placenta embeds itself over a previous caesarean section scar. A retained placenta can also happen when a womb stops contracting, or doesn’t contract enough, to separate the placenta from the wall of the womb (a condition called uterine atony). And it some cases, the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus, but it becomes trapped behind a semi-closed cervix (trapped placenta).
There’s virtually nothing that can be done to prevent a retained placenta, and the risk increases with each passing pregnancy. The condition happens in about two percent of all deliveries, and has a mortality rate of nearly 10 percent in rural areas; complications tend to happen when active management of the third labor stage is lacking, including home births. A retained placenta, with its associated hemorrhaging, is a leading cause of maternal mortality. In addition to preeclampsia, other risk factors for a retained placenta include having a previous surgery on the uterus, and being over the age of 35. Kim Kardashian, who is now 36, has already given birth to two children, and she had surgery after her first pregnancy, hence the doctor’s warnings.
Placenta accreta can be diagnosed prior to labor through blood and imaging tests, and if detected, can prompt a cesarean section when the time comes. Alternately, and as advised by Kardashian’s doctors, a prospective mother at high risk should avoid pregnancy and consider surrogacy instead. And indeed, Kim seems to be taking this possibility very seriously. “I’ve come to the conclusion in my mind that I can’t carry another one,” Kim told her mother at the end of the episode. “So now I want to explore surrogacy.”
Which sets up some serious drama for the Kardashians, not to mention reality television as well. Who gets to be the surrogate mom of Kim’s third child?

A team of biologists has just named three new salamanders in  the genus Thorius; the tiniest tailed tetrapods known to science. Smaller than a  matchstick, these creatures are as strange as they are adorable, their miniaturized anatomy pushing the boundaries of what natural selection can produce. Tragically, all three species appear to be edging toward extinction.
Thorius pinicola, Thorius longicaudus, and Thorius tlaxiacus are the subject of a new scientific paper published today in the open-access journal Peer-J. Found high in the montane cloud forests of Oaxaca, Mexico, the three new species join the ranks of twenty six other members of the Thorius genus thanks to a decades-long study that included field surveys, DNA sequencing, digital imaging, and statistical analysis of the wee critters’ anatomy.
Thorius salamanders have exaggerated, almost absurd proportions. Like other New World tropical salamanders, they’ve got enormous projectile tongues, which shoot out to a distance of up to half the length of the body  to catch insects. To make way for the tongue, the rest of the creature’s tiny head is extremely reduced in size, with some skull bones missing entirely.
Thorius salamanders are also well-endowed in the reproductive department. As Harvard University biologist and study co-author James Hanken explained to Gizmodo, adults need to maintain a minimum size of ovaries and testes in order to produce enough eggs and sperm. “As a result, the gonads occupy a relatively large proportion of the total body volume,” he wrote in an email. “In some females, much more than half the volume of the trunk is occupied by yolky eggs inside the oviducts; the rest of the visceral organs are pushed aside.”
Because of their oversized tongues, ovaries and testes, biologists have affectionately nicknamed Thorius the “tongue-flipping gonad” of salamanders.


Unfortunately, even as we continue to discover new species of this remarkable genus, Thorius salamanders are rapidly disappearing, paralleling the global decline in amphibians of all shapes and sizes. “It’s very hard to say definitively what’s causing their decline,” Hanken said, noting that habitat destruction, pesticide poisoning and climate change are all likely factors. We also can’t rule out the possibility that the deadly chytrid fungus which has decimated other amphibian populations in central and south America has infected Thorius, too.
“There is no simple solution, but there are longterm solutions: lessen and hopefully stop global warming and other climate change, preserve large tracts of forest, eliminate dangerous pesticides and herbicides,” Hanken said.
Those are big challenges—but if the plight of these tiny salamanders doesn’t make you want to help the planet, I don’t know what will.

If you haven’t read up on tardigrades, or “water bears” as they’re more commonly known, take a few minutes and familiarize yourself with the microscopic creatures that are nearly indestructible. Then you’ll understand why you must own this adorable stuffed version.
Tardigrades, also known as “water bears,” are microscopic animals capable of withstanding some of…
Available from the Japanese online store Village/Vanguard, the plush tardigrades are as anatomically correct as a stuffed toy can be, aside from the fact that at around 12-inches long these water bears are about 1,000 times bigger than the real thing.


The toy tardigrades are also available in a couple of different color options, including tan and a darker brown, and even if you find them revolting, there’s almost certainly someone on your Christmas shopping list who loves science enough to appreciate getting one as a gift.

Last night, photographers around the world turned their cameras to the sky to capture the closest full moon—also known as a supermoon—since 1948. We’ve scoured the web to bring you some of our favorite photos of the celestial event that took our minds off the current state of world affairs for a few blissful minutes.
Entire lifetimes have come and gone without the moon looking quite as large as it will this month.…
What makes a good supermoon photo? Critically, there have to be other objects in the shot, so that your brain has some frame of reference for how damn big the Moon looks. NASA has a few more tips for would-be supermoon photographers, so if you didn’t get your money shot already, be sure to read up before trying your luck this evening. (Although the Moon passed its closest point of approach—or perigee—this morning, it will still look pretty darn super tonight.)
Tonight is your chance to see the closest “supermoon” that anyone on Earth has experienced in…
If you took a great photo of the November 14th supermoon, or know of a great photo you’d like to see added to this collection, drop me a line at maddie.stone@gizmodo.com or on Twitter.
Researchers in the Netherlands have successfully tested a brain implant that allows a patient with late-stage Lou Gehrig’s disease to spell messages at the rate of two letters per minute.
The new system was tested on Hanneke De Bruijne, a 58-year-old woman in the late stages of Lou Gehrig’s disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Unable to move any part of her body aside from her eyes, De Bruijne used the wireless computer-brain interface to identify letters by imagining that she was using her right hand. She can now use the system at home to communicate with family and caregivers.


Prior to the brain implant, De Bruijne used an eye-tracking system to communicate, but it had to be recalibrated every time light levels in her surroundings changed. The new system is far more reliable and autonomous, and it can be used at home without any extra help. At a rate of two letters per minute, typing is still excruciatingly slow. But it’s an important proof-of-concept showing that patients can use the system on their own and without much technical support. In future, the system could be adapted to stroke patients or quadriplegics.
“This is a major breakthrough in achieving autonomous communication among severely paralyzed patients whose paralysis is caused by either ALS, a cerebral hemorrhage or trauma,” noted Professor Nick Ramsey, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht, in a statement. “In effect, this patient has had a kind of remote control placed in her head, which enables her to operate a speech computer without the use of her muscles.”


Four sensor strips were implanted on De Bruijne’s motor cortex (the part of the brain that controls voluntary movements). Whenever she thinks about bringing her right thumb and ring finger together, the chip detects a small electrical spike. A computer receives these signals over wireless, and interprets it as a “brain click.”
To type specific letters, De Bruijne uses a tablet display that features four rows of letters. As a red cursor moves from left to right across the alphabet (plus some functions like deleting a letter or word, and selecting words based on the letters she has already spelled), she executes a brain click when the desired letter is highlighted. The process repeats until an entire word is spelled out and spoken by the computer’s speech program.
Using the system, patients like De Bruijne can express their desires or communicate problems, such as an itch, an excessive buildup of saliva, or problems with a ventilator. Looking ahead, the researchers would like to test the system on two more patients before undertaking a large-scale trial.

Seismologists are warning that the latest earthquake to strike New Zealand could trigger other large earthquakes in the coming days and weeks, but sensationalistic claims of a devastating “mega-quake” are likely overblown.
The 2016 Kaikoura earthquake struck just past midnight on Monday November 14, with the epicenter located about 10 miles (15 km) northeast of Culverden on the South Island of New Zealand. It was the result of two separate, but simultaneous, earthquakes on multiple fault lines. The quakes, with a combined magnitude of 7.5 to 7.8, caused damage to buildings and roads, several landslides, and at least two deaths.
Disturbingly, more quakes could be on the way. In light of Monday’s event, New Zealand’s government earth scientists, GeoNet, have worked out a series of scenarios and probabilities. The scientists say there’s a 12 percent chance of a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake happening within the next 24 hours, and a 32 percent chance of one happening within the next 30 days.


“We have updated our probabilities of larger or similar-sized earthquakes,” noted GeoNet’s Sara McBride in the New Zealand Herald.  “We use probabilities as we cannot predict earthquakes. These probabilities describe the likely progression of the sequence within the next week, month and year.” She acknowledges that these predictions will be distressing for some people, saying “We recognize that while these scenarios may increase anxiety, the best thing is to be prepared.”
With these scenarios in mind, science writer Alice Klein at New Scientist warned that New Zealand’s latest earthquake could trigger a “mega-quake,” particularly along the dreaded Alpine Fault that runs along the South Island. Over the past one thousand years, there have been four mega-quakes exceeding magnitude 8 along the Alpine Fault, including tremors in 1100, 1430, 1620, and most recently in 1717. These quakes seem to be occurring at intervals between 100 and 350 years. The 1717 quake happened 299 years ago, so New Zealand could experience its “big one” at any time. But it’s not immediately clear if Monday’s quake will be the catalyst for this dreaded event.


According to GNS scientist John Ristau, an Alpine Fault earthquake would “produce one of the biggest earthquakes in New Zealand since European settlement.” New Scientist was keen to inject Ristau’s quote into its coverage, but failed to note that the GeoNet scenarios did not include any kind of triggering of the Alpine Fault. As Ristau himself admits, Monday’s earthquake is probably too far away from the Alpine fault to have a direct effect. Geophysicist Jesper Sören Dramsch told Gizmodo, “That does not mean it cannot happen, but other scenarios are much more likely.” Dramsch provided some scientific context.
“A step from a 7.0 earthquake to an 8.0 earthquake releases about 32 times as much energy,” he says. “This is the equivalent of a golf ball (about 46g) tipping over a small kettlebell over (1,450 g or 1.45 kg).”


For the kettlebell to fall in this scenario, it would have to be unstable to begin with. Going back to earthquakes, this would mean that the Alpine fault would have to be similarly unstable. Dramsch says it’s possible that a 7.0 earthquake could act as a trigger, but there would already have to be an enormous amount of stress in the fault. Which leaves open the question of whether the fault wouldn’t have ruptured within a short time anyways.
Dramsch says that measuring the level of stress in a fault is almost impossible, especially at depth, leaving us with probabilities instead of certainties of earthquakes happening.
“I find it questionable that New Scientist publishes a fearmongering article in these times,” Dramsch told Gizmodo. “I am sure the Kiwis have enough to worry about and I feel deep sympathy with them. GNS Science and GeoNet try to educate and spread scientific knowledge among their folks, I don’t think it’s necessary to take these quotes out of context like that.”

In a welcome reminder that not everything is terrible always, global carbon emissions barely grew at all in 2016. It marks the third year in a row that humanity’s carbon footprint has been stable. They’re still much higher than they should be, but at least they are stable.
The very good news comes from the Global Carbon Project, an international team of Earth system scientists  tasked with assessing how much CO2 human activity generates, and where it ends up. According to the group’s latest projections, our collective carbon footprint grew by a mere 0.2 percent in 2016. Between 2014 and 2015, the same group measured a net emissions growth of zero; a dramatic departure from the prior decade, in which emissions grew by roughly 2.3 percent per year.
Last week, the Paris climate agreement cleared its final hurdle, when the European Union formally…
Better still, the global GDP continues to grow at more than 3 percent per year. “This third year of almost no growth in emissions is unprecedented at a time of strong economic growth,” lead study author Corinne Le Quéré of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research said in a statement.


The findings, published this week in the open-access journal Earth System Science Data, indicate that the emissions growth pause is driven by a shift away from coal among the world’s two largest carbon emitters, China and the United States.
Emissions in China fell by approximately 0.7 percent in 2015 and are expected to drop another 0.5 percent this year, although there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the recent data. In the United States, emissions dropped 2.6 percent in 2015 and are projected to decline another 1.7 percent this year. By contrast, in rapidly industrializing nations like India, carbon emissions continue to grow fast.
For the last few years, the United States has been a lukewarm leader on global climate action. Now, …
While there’s reason to be cautiously optimistic about a three-year emissions growth stall, especially since the global economy continued to grow, we have to put these numbers in context. Fossil fuels and industrial activity still contributed about 36 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide to our planet’s atmosphere last year. To halt global warming, we need to bring that number down to zero.


“This is a great help for tackling climate change but it is not enough,” Le Quéré said. “Global emissions now need to decrease rapidly, not just stop growing.”
According to the study’s authors, we now have approximately  800 billion tons of carbon “left in the bank” if we want to preserve a two-thirds chance of staying below 2 degrees Celsius of warming. If we continue our present course, we’re going to blow through that budget in less than 25 years, at which point we may need to invent carbon capture technology to prevent a dangerous climate change.
And now, we’re faced with an incoming administration that denies the reality of climate change; that has promised to “unleash” American coal; that wants to drop Paris climate accord as quickly as possible; and that’ll appoint a Supreme Court justice happy to strike down Obama’s Clean Power Plan. If one thing’s clear, it’s that efforts to curb carbon emissions over the next four years are going to have to move forward in spite of America’s leadership—perhaps, in opposition to it.

This is cool. Emanuele Fornasier ran an electric current through various chemical solutions and recorded the reaction to reveal the formation of crystals. It’s like seeing the birth of a snowflake. The process definitely looks fantastic but in reality, it’s really, really slow. It can take hours or even days for the crystals to take shape.

A recent expedition to the explore marine life in the Marianas region of the Pacific has uncovered stunning new video of bubblegum coral, and the strange creatures who make these aquatic structures their home.
Researchers with the NOAA Ocean Explorer team stumbled upon the bubblegum coral, also known as Paragorgia arbore, while exploring the Marianas Region on June 17, 2016 at depths of 1,700 feet.

Stunning video captured by the Okeanos Explorer show the vibrant red coral with a panoply of strange critters slithering around and clinging to the biological structure. The science team is particularly intrigued by the green filaments on the bubblegum coral given the complete lack of light at the seafloor. The researchers figure it’s either some kind of sponge or algae that’s gotten caught on the coral.


The researchers were also intrigued by a worm-like brittle star, or ophiuroids, that’s clinging very tightly to the coral. A crab and several other strange creatures could be seen loitering around. “It’s a little oasis for all kinds of life,” noted one of the marine scientists.

Predicting the future is hard. It’s nearly impossible to know what technological marvels await in the next few years, let alone the next eight decades. Undaunted, we’ve put together a list of 10 super-advanced technologies that should be around by the year 2100.
Some of these technologies are rather “out there,” but I’m reasonably confident in making these predictions. As radical as some of the items described here appear, most—if not all—should be around by the turn of the 22nd century. The reason has to do with an innovation that doesn’t appear on this list: Artificial superintelligence. As computer scientist I. J. Good aptly pointed out in the 1960s, “the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.”


Once greater-than-human intelligence emerges in a machine—a development that could happen as early as the 2050s—all bets are off in terms of what’s technically possible. Intelligent machines will replace humans as designers and engineers, constructing the technologies of our dreams, including some we hadn’t even thought of. Here are just 10 of those technologies that could change virtually everything.
Wearable VR-enabling devices like Oculus Rift are all fine and well, but no matter how sophisticated these sorts of gadgets become, a “true” sense of existing in an alternate reality will remain out of reach. What’s required is something a bit more...invasive—and by the time we reach the 2100s we’ll have found a way to create a virtual reality experience that’s indistinguishable from the real thing. Incredibly, these experiences will be fed directly to our brain, bypassing our normal sensory inputs to make it all the more believable.
To get that intangible feeling of what it’s like to exist in our surroundings, we’ll need to go to the source of that experience: the human brain. Indeed, the brain (among other things) is a sensory processing device. All of the things we sense on a regular basis, whether it be the smell of your tacos or the glaring glow of your computer screen, are routed to your brain. As Morpheus put it so eloquently in The Matrix: “What is real?...If you’re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then ‘real’ is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.”


Futurist Ray Kurzweil, author of The Singularity is Near, explained how this could come about in a Q&A about his book.
I see this starting with nanobots in our bodies and brains. The nanobots will keep us healthy, provide full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system, provide direct brain-to-brain communication over the Internet, and otherwise greatly expand human intelligence. But keep in mind that nonbiological intelligence is doubling in capability each year, whereas our biological intelligence is essentially fixed in capacity. As we get to the 2030s, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will predominate.
Kurzweil’s time lines are probably a bit optimistic, but his concepts are sound; we’re finding new ways of breaching the blood-brain-barrier and creating microscopic machines that can travel around the body. And just as importantly, we’re creating a detailed map of the brain, including areas responsible for processing incoming sensory information.
Once implanted in the brain, Kurzweil’s nanobots would locate the brain’s various sensory inputs and shut them down (e.g. disrupting the electrical signals collected by the retina, ear, etc.), making the person completely unaware of their actual surroundings (it would be the perfect sensory deprivation chamber. In place of these signals, the nanobots, fed by wireless transmission, would replace those missing signals, feeding the brain’s cortical regions with artificial senses—and an entirely new subjective experience. To the person, it would feel like they’ve been  transported to another world.
Devised by nanotech pioneer J. Storrs Hall, utility fogs are a swarm of nanobots, or “foglets,” that can take on the shape of virtually any object, and change its shape on the fly. Storrs came up with the idea when trying to imagine a futuristic seat belt. But instead of static straps and inflatable airbags, Hall imagined an intelligent cloud of interconnected snowflake-like foglets capable of morphing along with the movements of anything around it, including the passengers of cars.
Utility fogs defy the imagination in terms of the technological sophistication required. Each foglet would measure just 10 microns across (roughly the same size as a human cell), be equipped with a tiny, rudimentary onboard computer to control its actions (which would be controlled externally by an artificially intelligent system), and a dozen telescopic arms that extrude outwards in the shape of a dodecahedron. When two foglets link up, they would form a circuit, allowing for the distribution of power and communications throughout the network. The foglets wouldn’t be capable of floating, but would instead form a lattice structure, called an octet truss, when holding hands in all 12 directions.


A utility fog would work like programmable matter, capable of moving around, enveloping, and and even transporting an object or person.  More radically, utility fogs could be used to create a virtual world around a person—and even host a person who has uploaded themselves into this nano-infused cloud (similar to the foglet beings in Warren Ellis’ Transmetropolitan).
As our civilization struggles to mitigate the effects of climate change and transition into a more sustainable energy economy, it’s tempting to think we’ll never be able to meet our seemingly insatiable energy needs. Space-based solar power—an idea that’s been around since the 1960s—could solve this problem once and for all.
Nearly 60 years ago, Peter Glaser envisioned solar powered satellites capable of transferring captured solar energy down to receiving dishes on the Earth’s surface via microwaves. A number of different schemes have been proposed since then, with Japan leading the way in terms of having an actual plan to get it done. Called the SBSP System, the Japanese orbital farm would run in a stationary orbit about 22,400 miles above the equator, where it would transmit energy to Earth using laser beams.  Each satellite would target a 1.8-mile wide receiving station that could generate an entire gigawatt of electricity, which is enough to power a half million homes. For safety, the receiving station should be positioned far from human habitation, such as a desert or island.
By the turn of the 22nd century, many humans will have opted for a purely digital existence, one free of all biological constraints. Called mind uploading, or whole brain emulation, this will involve the meticulous copying of an existing biological brain. The scans would capture every cognitive detail down to the molecular level, and include memories, associations, and even a person’s personality quirks.
Futurists aren’t entirely sure how mind uploading will happen, but a critical step will be to make sure the important parts of a brain are copied, particularly those tied to a person’s sense of identity (namely the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex). This could involve “destructive” copying, where an existing brain is sliced or otherwise taken apart in order to record a person’s brain state and memories. Alternately, a sufficiently powerful brain scanner could be used to take a snapshot of a person’s brain, and then “pasted” into a computer capable of translating that information into a functioning mind. In order for an uploaded person to function “normally,” they would have to be equipped with a virtual body and environment.
We're still decades — if not centuries — away from being able to transfer a mind to a…
An important scientific and philosophical question to ask is whether or not this represents a true “transfer” of consciousness, and not just the mere copying of a person’s brain. What’s more, it’s not entirely clear if conscious self-awareness can be replicated in digital substrate. Frighteningly, each upload could be a kind of zombie that behaves and functions like the pre-existing person, but would in reality be nothing more than a script-driven bot.
It’s unlikely that our species will be able to completely control the weather by the end of the current century, but we should be able to put a serious dent into it. We’re already seeding clouds with particles to stimulate precipitation, and California has been doing this for nearly 50 years. During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Chinese authorities fired 1,100 rockets into the clouds to trigger downpours before the storms reached the capital city. There are even efforts to fire laser pulses into thunderclouds in hopes of drawing out lightning in a controlled manner.
Looking ahead to the future, weather engineers could build massive wall-like structures to prevent devastating tornadoes from forming, or construct massive —and very strong—arrays of offshore turbines to suck the energy out of hurricanes. On that last prospect, a study in 2014 showed that a wind farm consisting of tens of thousands of individual turbines could reduce peak winds by up to 92 mph (148 km/h) and decrease storm surges by up to 79 percent. That would in effect reduce a hurricane’s power by an entire  magnitude.


More radically, we could eventually build a weather machine to create a programmable atmosphere. A particularly intriguing plan calls for a thin global cloud of small transparent balloons lifted up into the stratosphere, where it would shade or reflect the amount of incoming sunlight. A mirror would be placed inside each balloon, along with a GSP to monitor its location, an actuator to control its orientation, and a small computer. Lifted by hydrogen, the “programmable green house gas” would come to a rest about 20 miles above the Earth’s surface. When the millions of mirrors face away from the Earth, they would reflect the sunlight back into space. This system, guided by AI, could influence weather patterns around the world, and turn marginally habitable areas into temperate regions.
Think 3D printers are amazing? Just wait until the arrival of molecular assemblers, a hypothetical fabricator described by nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in his seminal book, Engines of Creation. Drexler described a molecular assembler as a device capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product. If you’ve ever seen an episode of Star Trek in which a member of the crew uses a replicator to churn out a steaming hot cup of Earl Grey tea, then you’ve basically seen a molecular assembler, which some futurists refer to as fabricators, or fabs for short.
Drexler basically argued that biological assemblers already exist, producing complex and wonderful structures like bacteria, trees, and even you and me. Using the same logic, he figures we’ll eventually be able to tap into the mechanical properties of the uber-small, and use similar principles to produce objects of any shape, form, or consistency.


Fabs could introduce the world to an era of “radical abundance,” allowing us to produce items and materials that would otherwise be impossible to build, constructing them from the ground up (or more accurately, from the molecules on up). But these devices could even be used to produce items we’re familiar with, like food. To make a steak, for example, the fabricator would take base materials, such as carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, and then arrange them into amino acids and proteins, which would then be assembled to form a steak.
Disturbingly, the effects of climate change are likely irreversible. No matter what we do from now until the year 2100, the levels of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere will continue to warm the planet.
To prevent the many environmental calamities wrought by climate change—from rising sea levels and megadroughts through to superstorms and mass extinctions—we’ll begrudgingly have to start geoengineering the planet.


Some notable geohacking proposals include cirrus cloud seeding to reduce reflectivity, stratospheric particle injection for solar radiation management, sulfur-aerosol injection to induce global dimming, and simple solutions like tropical reforestation to restore the carbon balance. Other ideas include a giant space reflector (though that might be beyond our technological capacities by 2100), ocean fertilization to spawn carbon-sucking algal blooms, and ocean alkalinity enhancement to make the ocean less acidic. Clearly, there are no shortage of ideas, and we won’t be restricted to just one.
The problem with geoengineering, of course, is that we could royally wreck our planet should something go wrong, and we may become dependent upon it. But desperate times will require desperate measures, and we’ll have little choice but to rely on complex climate models and supercomputers to ensure safety and efficacy.
Ongoing advances in communications technologies and neuroscience will transform humanity into a telepathic species.
The advent of direct mind-to-mind communication will bring us even closer together as individuals, and conceivably give rise to a “hive mind”—a vast network of interconnected minds working together over the future instantiation of the internet. In such a future, we may start to see the dissolution of the individual, and the rise of a collective mass consciousness.
Last month, researchers created an electronic link between the brains of two rats separated by…
Remarkably, this future may be closer than we think. Back in 2014, an international team of researchers were the first to demonstrate a direct and completely non-invasive brain-to-brain communication system. During their experiment, two participants were able to exchange mentally-conjured words despite being separated by hundreds of miles. A year later, a separate team of researchers transmitted brain signals over the internet to control the hand motions of another person, allowing them to collaborate on a computer game. These systems, though extremely rudimentary, point to a future in which we can simply use our thoughts to converse with one another, and “telekinetically” control smart devices in our environment.
Earlier this year, physicists in Germany used a 2-megawatt microwave pulse to warm low density hydrogen plasma to 80 million degrees. The experiment didn’t produce any energy, and it only lasted for a quarter of a second, but it was an important step forward in the effort to harness an extremely promising form of energy production known as nuclear fusion.
Unlike nuclear fission, where the nucleus of an atom is divided into smaller parts, nuclear fusion creates a single heavy nucleus from two lighter nuclei. The resulting change in mass generates a tremendous amount of energy that scientists believe can be harnessed into a viable source of clean energy. Eventually, fusion power could replace fossil fuels and conventional nuclear reactors.
The longstanding joke about fusion—that it’s the energy source of the future, and always will…
But to get there, scientists will have to figure out how to reliably and safely manage conditions typically found on the sun. The problem is that fusion plasmas do not like to be contained; these free-flowing streams of protons and electrons are tough to wrangle. Our sun holds on to its plasma with its intense gravity, but here on Earth, we’d have to rely on magnets or lasers to perform the same trick. Should a tiny fraction of the plasma escape, it would scar the wall of the machine, causing the fusion reactor to shut down.
Not content to stop at genetic engineering, scientists of the future will be able to design and create new organisms from scratch—from microscopic synthetic bacteria through to redesigned humans reminiscent of the Replicants in Blade Runner. This burgeoning discipline, known as artificial life (or Alife), is the effort to recreate biological phenomenon with the help of computers and other synthetic media.
The quest to create synthetic forms of life is already underway. Earlier this year, researchers from Synthetic Genomics and the J. Craig Venter Institute successfully created an artificial bacterial genome that, with its scant 473 genes, is smaller than anything found in nature. Further breakthroughs in this domain will help biologists explore the core functions of life, and to categorize essential genes within cells. Researchers could use “building block” cells like these to construct organisms with capacities not found in nature, including bacteria that can consume plastic and toxic waste, and microorganisms that can function like medicines inside the body.


In a related breakthrough, a new initiative co-founded by Harvard Medical School’s George Church is seeking to create a synthetic human genome from scratch. The researchers say they’re content to stop once they figure out how to power cells with synthetic human DNA, but the same technology could conceivably be used to create artificial organisms and even designer humans.
Any one of the technologies listed here has the potential to reshape our civilization. What’s less clear is how these marvels will work in tandem with one another; the convergent effects of technology are often hard to predict. For example, the convergence of brain-linked VR, mind uploading, and AI could result in a hybrid computer-based civilization consisting of real-world humans, emulated brains, and artificial intellects. Future geoengineering schemes could integrate weather control systems and engineered nanoparticles. And so on.
The more predictions we make about our future technologies, the more difficult it becomes to know what the future might actually look like.
It teased us with the possibility of a no-show this summer, but a weak La Niña has officially arrived, according to NOAA. Parts of the northern United States can expect a cooler and wetter-than-average winter, while southern California, unfortunately, can expect more drought.
After pulling us off a La Niña watch in September and then reinstating it last month, NOAA has now confirmed that La Niña conditions are here. In the simplest of terms, this means monthly sea surface temperatures in the Niño 3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific (see below) are more than half a degree cooler than average, and they’re expected to stay that way for several months. It also means we’re seeing indications of a strengthened  Walker circulation pattern, with cool air sinking more vigorously in the central and eastern Pacific as warm air rises more intensively over the western Pacific.


NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center slightly favors (55 percent chance) a weak La Niña persisting through the winter.
Like its recently-departed counterpart El Niño, the La Niña pattern causes changes in global atmospheric circulation that affect weather around the world. While El Niño tends to promote an elongated jet stream that brings extra stormy weather to the southern United States, La Niña favors below-average precipitation and warmer temperatures across the same region. At the same time, La Niña winters often feature cooler weather across parts of the northern United States and Canada, and additional rain and snowfall in the Pacific Northwest and around the Great Lakes.
NOAA’s recent winter weather outlook reflected La Niña’s influence, as you can see in the temperature and precipitation maps below:
Perhaps the biggest takeaway for the United States is that California’s drought woes aren’t going away. While northern California’s reservoirs may experience some much-needed recharge this winter, La Niña is expected to leave the central and southern parts of the state high and dry, in conditions of “extreme or exceptional drought.” It seems extra cruel seeing as last winter’s monster El Niño failed to deliver blockbuster storms.


“The weak La Niña is likely to contribute to persisting or developing drought across much of the southern US this winter,” Mike Halpert of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center said in a statement.
It’s important to note that NOAA discusses La Niña’s influence in terms of probabilities: the likelihood of warmer, cooler, wetter, or drier-than-average conditions, rather than the absolute the strength of the effect. We should also keep in mind that it isn’t certain La Niña will persist throughout the winter; at this point it’s nearly a toss-up.
But for now, at least, we can welcome the cool embrace of La Niña, and all that she promises to bring (or withhold).

A large cylindrical structure thought to be part of a Chinese rocket has fallen down into a mining area in north Myanmar, while another piece of metal tore through the roof of a nearby house.
The metal object, which measures 4 feet (1 meter)  in diameter and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in length, fell on the property of a jade mining company, and then bounced up to 150 feet (46 meters) away. Local residents in a nearby village said they heard a loud noise shortly before the metal object was found. Around the same time, another cylindrical structure measuring about an inch wide and 4.6 inches in length—and bearing Chinese script—tore through the roof of a home nearby. The roof was damaged, but no injuries were reported.

“Every local thought it was the explosion of heavy artillery,” said villager Ko Maung Myo in the Myanmar Times. “I walked over to it and saw it was part of an engine.” Myo said he thought it was an engine because he found “a diode and many copper wires at the tail of the body,” adding that “It also looks like a jet engine block.” Witnesses said the air near the object smelled acrid, as though something was burning.


Initial speculation pointed to satellite debris, a piece of missile, or an aircraft engine, but the incident is likely related to the launch of a Chinese satellite. A Long March 11 rocket blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on Wednesday night, carrying an experimental satellite. And indeed, the chunk of metal looks like a stage section of a rocket, which falls away before reaching space.
Part of a rocket engine crashes through the roof of a house in northeast China’s Shanxi province…
This sort of thing—sadly—has happened before. Last year, part of a rocket engine crashed through the roof of a house in northeast China’s Shanxi province. Seems China’s space agency—or whoever is responsible for these incidents—needs to do a better job protecting the people down below.

Landing on Mars is hard, but the European Space Agency’s first attempt—the Beagle 2 probe—came maddeningly close to being a success. In fact, a new 3D modeling analysis shows that the lander’s failure to communicate with the Earth was likely due to a single jammed solar panel.
A British space probe designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars, Beagle 2 was launched aboard ESA’s Mars Express spacecraft in June 2003. It was released from its mothership on December 19th and scheduled to land on the Red Planet six days later. But Beagle 2's Christmas day phone call home from Mars never came—and subsequent searches by Mars Express and NASA’s Mars Odyssey were unable to locate the lander.


For more than a decade, its fate remained a mystery.
In late 2014, after nearly everyone had given up on the lost lander, Beagle 2 was spotted in a series of eight images taken by the HiRISE camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The blurry, pixelated photos showed what appeared to be an intact lander, along with its parachute and heat shield nearby. But even after applying advanced image processing techniques, scientists were unable determine the configuration of the lander—the photos were simply too low resolution. The question of what the hell went wrong remained open.


But Mark Sims, a professor of astrobiology at the University of Leicester and former mission manager for Beagle 2, wasn’t about to let the mystery go, not after obtaining photographic evidence of a successful landing. “Call it stubbornness, if you like,” he told Gizmodo. “In the end, all of this is about trying to figure out exactly what happened to Beagle 2.”
An idea came to Sims one evening last fall, toward sunset, after tracing the source of a bright glimmer in his lounge to the reflection of a window down the road. “I looked at that light and thought, there’s information here about what I’m seeing,” he said. Specifically, Sims started thinking about how the appearance of an object can change drastically with the angle of the sun.
The HiRISE images of Beagle 2 were all taken at different sun angles, and in each of them, the lander reflects light in a slightly different way. And so, Sims started to wonder: if the Beagle 2 lander could be simulated under different lighting conditions, could one work out its configuration on the surface?


“It’s an old idea, in a sense,” Sims said. “But I didn’t have the knowledge or technology to do the analysis.”
As luck would have it, a friend of Sims’ introduced him to someone who did: Nick Higgett, a researcher at De Montfort University whose lab uses advanced 3D modeling  techniques to reconstruct historic sites around Leicester.
Taking Sim’s “reflection analysis” concept, Higget and his team constructed a 3D model of the Beagle 2 lander, which is shaped like a clam shell and opens in half before unfurling four solar panels on one side. They modeled the lander in several different configurations, with one, two, three, or all four solar panels deployed. The model was then scaled down to the pixel resolution of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s images, and bathed in virtual sunlight at different angles. Finally, its reflection patterns were compared with real images of Beagle 2 captured by Hi-RISE.
“We looked at a lot of different configurations in our simulations and saw which was most consistent across a number of [Hi-RISE] images,” Higget told Gizmodo. “There was a lot of trial and error.”


Eventually, the researchers determined that the best match between real and simulated reflection patterns was one in which Beagle 2 had three of its four  solar panels deployed, although a four panel scenario was also possible.
“This confirms that the Beagle 2's entry, descent and landing system worked,” said Sims, who is currently writing up the findings for publication. “It got down to the surface, and it was intact. Furthermore, it was within one solar panel of being fully deployed and fully operational.”


All four of the Beagle 2's solar panels needed to open before an RF communication antenna could pop out and send  signals back to Earth. So, if the the three-panel scenario is correct, that explains why we never heard from the lander. If all four of the panels did deploy, there must have been some other technical problem. It could have been as minor as a bad electrical wire or a loose screw.
“I suspect, given what we’ve seen from prior data analysis back in 2015, it’s the three-panel scenario,” Sims said. “But if all four panels did open, we were excruciatingly close to having a working spacecraft on the surface of Mars.”


We may never find out exactly what went wrong with Beagle 2, although Sims is keen to do more simulations if he receives the funding. Higget notes that his team’s newly devised technique could be applicable to other situations where scientists are trying to understand a highly-reflective object on the surface of a different planet or even in a remote area on Earth.


Unfortunately, reflection analysis won’t be applicable to the European Space Agency’s recently-crashed Schiaparelli lander, which impacted the surface at a very high speed and seemed to explode, leaving nothing but a dark burn mark. “That was a great disaster for the team, and I feel deeply for them,” Sims said. “But it was obviously a crash.”
Beagle 2, meanwhile, obviously wasn’t a crash. And while it may seem a bit arcane to continue puzzling over the pixelated reflections of a machine that died on Mars more than a decade ago, who knows? Maybe in those glimmers, we’ll learn something that’ll keep the next space probe alive.
British red squirrels are being afflicted by a medieval strain of leprosy that was thought to have disappeared from Europe over 700 years ago, according to a new DNA analysis. Researchers say the chances of the dreaded disease spreading to humans is low, but the discovery suggests this strain of leprosy has been lingering for quite some time.
A DNA analysis performed by researchers from the University of Edinburgh and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) has shown that leprosy in Britain’s red squirrels is being caused by the same species of bacteria responsible for human infections. Human cases of leprosy are practically unheard of in Britain, but scientists say the red squirrels could be a source for the bacteria in the UK, frustrating attempts to eradicate the disease.


Published in the journal Science, results show that samples taken from 25 red squirrels living on Brownsea Island (off of England’s south coast) were infected with Mycobacterium leprae—the variant of leprosy responsible for outbreaks in medieval Europe. The bacteria is very similar to a strain found in the skeletal remains of a leprosy victim buried in Winchester 740 years ago. It’s also quite similar to a strain found in armadillos in the southern United States.
Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease that affects the peripheral nerves, skin, upper respiratory tract, eyes, and the lining of the nose. Once rampant in Europe, the disease declined by the end of the Middle Ages for reasons that still aren’t fully understood. Leprosy in Europe disappeared about a century ago, at least among humans. Today, about 200,000 cases of leprosy are recorded each year around the world, particularly in wet areas in the tropics and subtropics. Countries with the highest prevalence include India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Brazil, and Nigeria. Leprosy can be treated with antibiotics, but the surprising number of new cases each year highlights the need to learn more about this disease and why it’s so tough to stamp out.


Like so many other zoonotic diseases, leprosy can “jump” from animals to humans. With this in mind, the labs of Stewart Cole at EPFL and Anna Meredith at the University of Edinburgh conducted tests on 110 British red squirrels from England, Scotland, and Ireland. Some of these specimens showed signs of leprosy (e.g. hair loss on the ears, muzzle, and feet), while others did not—but most were infected with leprosy bacteria.
“It was completely unexpected to see that centuries after its elimination from humans in the UK, Mycobacterium leprae causes disease in red squirrels,” noted Cole in a statement. “This has never been observed before.”
As noted, the squirrels on Brownsea Island were infected by the medieval form of the disease, but the red squirrels from the other areas were infected with the other known strain of the disease, Mycobacterium lepromatosis. This variant of the disease is known to cause leprosy among humans living in Mexico. Further analysis indicated that the two different two strains diverged from a common ancestor about 27,000 years ago.
This research shows that a pathogen can remain undetected in the environment even hundreds of years after it has disappeared from the human population. Thankfully, residents living in the UK have very little to worry about.


“The risk to people from squirrel leprosy is negligible,” Meredith told Gizmodo. “The bacteria that cause leprosy cannot survive outside the body and evidence shows that 95 percent of all people are naturally unable to get leprosy, even if they are exposed to the bacteria that causes it.” She says it’s sensible to take precautions, like avoiding physical contact with wild animals and washing hands before eating.
“Around a dozen people are treated for leprosy in the UK each year,” said Meredith. “In all cases, the disease was contracted in countries where leprosy is prevalent. The last recorded case of indigenous leprosy [i.e. contracted in the UK] dates from 1798.”
This news comes at a particularly challenging time for the British red squirrel. Their numbers have drastically declined in the UK over the past few years, and only 140,00 remain. These creatures are being threatened from habitat loss and the squirrelpox virus carried by invasive grey squirrels.


“The discovery of leprosy in red squirrels is worrying from a conservation perspective,” said Meredith. “We need to understand how and why the disease is acquired and transmitted among red squirrels so that we can better manage the disease in this iconic species.”

Scientists in the UK have developed a USB stick that can quickly and accurately measure the amount of HIV is in a patient’s blood.
The medical device was created by scientists at Imperial College London and tech firm DNA Electronics, and all it needs is a simple drop of blood to measure HIV-1 levels. It then creates an electrical signal that’s fed into a computer, laptop, or handheld device. The disposable test could be used by HIV patients to monitor their own treatment and help patients in remote regions of the world, where more standard HIV tests are inaccessible.
Published in the journal Scientific Reports, results show that the USB stick is highly accurate, and it can produce a result in under 30 minutes. Current tests to detect the amount of HIV in the blood can take as much as three days, requiring patients to send blood samples to a lab. In the latest research, the USB stick tested 991 blood samples with 95 percent accuracy, with an average time to produce a new result just shy of 21 minutes.


When blood is placed onto a spot on the USB stick, it senses the HIV-1 virus through a change in acidity levels. A mobile phone chip in the USB stick converts this information into an electrical signal, and the stick then feeds the result to an app on a handheld device or computer.
The technology is still in its early stages, but it could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels similar to the way people with diabetes check their blood sugar levels. The current treatment for HIV reduces virus levels to practically zero, but in some cases, the anti-retroviral medication stops working, typically due to the HIV virus developing a resistance to the drugs. The new USB stick can detect the rise in HIV levels, and flag a potential problem with a patient’s meds or therapy.
“[Monitoring] viral load is crucial to the success of HIV treatment,” noted study lead author Graham Cooke in a statement. “At the moment, testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result. We have taken the job done by this equipment, which is the size of a large photocopier, and shrunk it down to a USB chip.”


The team is now investigating the possibility of using the device to test for other viruses, such as hepatitis.

Behold Tongtianlong, a new species of oviraptor uncovered in China. The fossilized remains of this feathered, bird-like dinosaur were preserved with its limbs outstretched, and its head raised—suggesting it was hopelessly stuck in a patch of mud, where it eventually died.
Before we get into the details of this new study, just take a look at that glorious painting produced by Chinese artist Zhao Chuang. Interpretations like this allow scientists to visualize their findings, while also providing us dino junkies with a glimpse of what these fantastic creatures must have looked like.


This new oviraptor, called Tongtianlong limosus, is described in a new Scientific Reports study led by paleontologist Junchang Lü from Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The unique shape of its dome-like skull, and the highly convex cranial bone at the tip of its upper jaw, distinguish it from other oviraptors, signifying the discovery an entirely new species.
A farmer discovered the remains in the Nanxiong Formation of the Ganzhou area of Jiangxi Province in southern China. Unfortunately, he collected the remains and did not map the original location, making it difficult for the researchers to interpret the cause of Tongtianlong’s strange position.


Analysis of the well-preserved fossil show an unusual posture, with the oviraptor’s wing-like limbs splayed to the side, its neck outstretched, and its head raised. The researchers hypothesize that Tongtianlong became hopelessly mired in mud, where it died and was ultimately buried. The researchers describe this as one possible, “but highly speculative,” interpretation of the fossil.
This creature lived in the Ganzhou area during the late Cretaceous period some 72 million years ago, and it’s now the sixth oviraptor species to be discovered in the region. Oviraptors are an unusual group of bird-like theropod dinosaurs, featuring shortened, toothless skulls, and ranging in size from a turkey to nearly the length of an elephant, or 23 feet (7 meters).
Oviraptors are portrayed as stealthy carnivores in films like Jurassic Park, but they probably had varied diets, feasting on eggs, mollusks, plants, shellfish, and nuts. The sheer number of fossils found, along with the apparent diversity of this dinosaur subgroup, suggests they were a very successful adaptation.

All hail the Brazilian free-tailed bat, which has just claimed a new flight speed record for all mammal-kind.
According to researchers at Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, bats of the species weighing less than half an ounce each were recently recorded flying at speeds exceeding 99 miles per hour, making it the fastest horizontal flyer on Earth.


“Initially, we could hardly believe our data,” said researcher Kamran Safi, “but they were correct.”
In addition to smoking the common swift (the next fastest horizontal flyer at around 68 miles per hour) the insect-loving echolocators shattered the previous highest bat-speed. In the 1950s, researchers estimated the same species to exceed speeds of 59 miles per hour, an observation that hasn’t been replicated until now. From New Atlas:
Scientists from the Max Planck Institute attached radio transmitters to the backs of Brazilian free-tailed bats. Using a mobile receiver aboard a small aircraft to localize the signal, the team tracked the flight paths of the animals and measured their speed through the air.
[...]
After consulting local weather data, the team has ruled out the possibility that tailwinds had a part to play. It says that where birds were assumed to fly more efficiently and faster than bats, its findings suggest a re-think might be in order of how we view the flight ability of the two creatures.
When it comes to vertical flight, however, birds still have the upper hand: In 1999, a peregrine falcon named “Frightful” was recorded dive-bombing at 242 miles per hour.

Donald Trump made some pretty scary threats during the election about cracking down on abortion. Here’s a quick refresher on his campaign promises—and why women have every right to be very worried.
Trump has flip-flopped on abortion, and seems to have adopted a rather extreme stance on the issue. Back in 1999 on an episode of “Meet the Press,” Trump said he “hated” abortion, but being from New York, admitted that he is “pro-choice in every respect.” Fast forward to the recently concluded election, and it’s clear that Trump has changed his tune. In a September 2016 letter addressed to “Pro-Life Leader,” Trump made his position on abortion painfully clear, saying he’s committed to:
Earlier this year, Trump said that abortions are “not acceptable,” and that women who try to obtain them should be subject “to some form of punishment.” Following a public outcry, Trump backtracked on his remarks, saying it’s not women who should be punished for having an abortion, but the doctors who perform the procedure.


As noted in his September letter, and as he remarked during the final presidential debate on October 19th, Trump is particularly opposed to so-called “partial-birth” abortions, or what doctors call intact dilation and extraction. According to federal law, this late-term procedure is acceptable if the life of the mother is at stake. But during the last debate, Trump didn’t seem to care, saying “in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother,” adding that it can happen “as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.”
But as noted by the Guttmacher Institute, 90 percent of all abortions take place within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. A mere 1.5 percent of abortions take place beyond the 20 week mark, the vast majority of which happen before the 24 week mark. Thankfully, this issue won’t affect most women, but that’s small consolation for those whose lives might depend on it.
The Trump Administration’s approach to Planned Parenthood in particular is all but certain to be a nightmare. The organization provides services for millions of women (and men), including sexual education and reproductive healthcare. But that hasn’t done much to thwart a largely Republican effort to completely strip it of resources and power. It’s a coordinated campaign that’s been taking place at the Congressional level for some time now; a Trump administration could bring an entirely new dimension of power into the mix.


Mike Pence, in particular, has consistently positioned himself as an opponent to the organization. In October, during a speech at Liberty University, he promised that “a Trump-Pence administration will defund Planned Parenthood and redirect those dollars to women’s health care that doesn’t provide abortion services.” In 2011, the House of Representatives passed a bill co-sponsored by Pence to defund the group.
“He’s been called a one-man crusade against Planned Parenthood, and he got his start going after them earlier than most. I would definitely call him an extremist,” Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic representative for Illinois, told the Guardian in July.


Following Trump’s victory last night, pro-life activists cheered. It’s an ominous sign of what’s to come, though public opposition will be formidable. “Trump would ban abortion, and eliminate women’s ability to have birth control covered by health insurance,” noted Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a CNN article. “A Trump presidency would be a disaster for women.”
Indeed, Trump could threaten women’s procreative liberties is by making it much more difficult to acquire birth control. As it stands, birth-control pills are free under the Affordable Care Act, but Trump says he wants Congress to repeal this act as soon as possible. In the very near future, it could be more difficult for women to avoid getting pregnant and getting an abortion. It suddenly feels like the 19th century.
Unlike most countries in the developed world, the United States is still deeply mired in the…
American pro-choice women are not going to relinquish their right to an abortion without a fight. What’s more, Trump and his Supreme Court justices will have their hands full trying to repeal or find loopholes to Roe V. Wade, the precedent that upholds a woman’s right to an abortion.


Yes, women have a right to be worried, but it may be more difficult—and politically damaging—for Trump to go through with his threats. Sadly, this is a man that doesn’t seem to care about the consequences.

For the first time ever, a neural device has been used to restore locomotion in paralyzed primates. It may be years before clinical trials can begin for humans, but this latest breakthrough marks an important step in that direction.
A new study published in the science journal Nature describes a new neuroprosthetic interface that acts as a wireless bridge between the brain and the spine, bypassing the injury. Called the “brain-spine interface,” the system restored movement in the paralyzed right legs of two rhesus monkeys. The system was developed by neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine and his colleagues at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, along with help from researchers at the University of Bordeaux, Motac Neuroscience, and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV).


Back in 2012, Courtine used a chemical cocktail to “re-awaken” the damaged spinal cord of paraplegic rats, allowing them to walk, run, and evade obstacles. For the latest experiment, Courtine’s team chose a different route, one involving implants in the brain and in the area of the spinal injury. It marks the first time that a neuroprosthetic device has been used to restore locomotion in primates, and the scientists are optimistic the system can be adapted to humans.

Paralysis happens when a spinal cord lesion prevents brain signals from the motor cortex (the part of the brain responsible for movement) from reaching neurons that activate muscles. Regrettably, the nerves of the spinal cord do not heal spontaneously after injury, and scientists haven’t had much luck using various pharmacological and regenerative techniques. The World Health Organization estimates that somewhere between 250,000 to 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury each year worldwide, highlighting the extent of the problem.


The brain-spine interface overcomes a damaged connection by bridging the spinal cord injury—and it does so in real-time and via wireless technology. The neuroprosthetic device implanted in the monkey’s brain correctly interprets activity generated by the motor cortex, and relays this information to a system of electrodes placed over the surface of the spinal cord, just below the injury. A burst of just a few volts, delivered at the right location, triggers specific muscles in the legs. Monkeys implanted with the device were able to walk within six days of the spinal cord injury.
In experiments, the device allowed monkeys to walk and behave freely, and without having to be hooked up to a tangled web of wires and electronics. The monkeys, who had partial lesions inflicted to their spinal cords, showed immediate progress, and were able to spontaneously regain full mobility after three months.
“The primate was able to walk immediately once the brain-spine interface was activated,” said study co-author Erwan Bezard of Bordeaux in a statement. “No physiotherapy or training was necessary.”
The scientists are hopeful that the device will work for more serious spinal injuries, though according toNewcastle University scientist Andrew Jackson, who wrote a Nature News and Views article on the research, this will likely happen with the help of other interventions, such as chemical and electrical stimulation. Excitingly, the new system might be able to leverage the power of the brain’s plasticity; connections between two neurons are given a boost when both are active at the same time. It’s possible that this device could strengthen surviving motor pathways, further contributing to rehabilitation.
Looking ahead, the researchers say a similar system could be adapted to humans, but more work is need to address locomotion issues such as balance, steering, and obstacle avoidance—motor skills which were not addressed in the current study. On the plus side, many of the components used in the brain-spine interface have already been approved for humans. If all goes well, human trials could start in just a few years.


“For the first time, I can imagine a completely paralyzed patient able to move their legs through this brain-spine interface,” noted Jocelyne Bloch, the lead neurosurgeon on the project.
Nobody likes the idea of experimenting on animals. It seems like the definition of inhumanity,…
It’s important to point out that Courtine and his colleagues deliberately damaged the spinal column of the two rhesus monkeys, causing paralysis in the right leg. Given increasing public pressure to move away from this type of animal testing, particularly in Europe, the scientists were more comfortable doing their research in China. Jackson explains:
[The] use of monkeys for neuroscience experiments continues to be questioned in the media, and animal-rights groups are making concerted efforts to ensure that restrictions on such work are tightened in both the United States and Europe. It is notable that, although [the researchers] are based in Europe and their research conformed to the current regulations of the European Union, the experiments were conducted in China. Grégoire Courtine, the lead researcher on this study, has in the past described the challenges involved in performing such experiments abroad, and other scientists might lack the time, energy or resources to pursue their research so far from home. There is thus a real danger that the development of treatments for debilitating neurological conditions will be delayed if high-quality, well-regulated research in monkeys cannot be performed in Europe and America owing to increasingly tight regulations. Equally, as more primate neuroscience moves to Asia, it will be important for researchers to remain committed to refining techniques and improving welfare standards for experimental animals worldwide.
Jackson is right to point out that more ethical standards need to be implemented in Asia, but the scientific community should most certainly be moving away from primate experimental models. Rather than fleeing to countries with less stringent animals testing protocols, researchers should try and find alternative ways of testing their theories and systems, whether it be through computer models or recruiting human test subjects. Indeed, it’s possible that some paraplegics and quadriplegics would welcome the opportunity to participate in this sort of research, regardless of the risks.

The future of public health in the United States was a hotly contested topic during the 2016 election, with the presidential candidates making bold promises and several important ballot initiatives up for grabs. Here’s how America voted, and what a Trump presidency means to your health.
Donald Trump’s stunning upset victory was clearly the biggest story to come out of the election, but there were other notable developments as well, particularly in the field of healthcare. Last night saw impressive gains for legalized marijuana and doctor assisted death, while a proposal to release genetically modified mosquitoes in Florida is now in doubt.


What a Trump presidency means to other health-related issues, such as the status of medicare and bloated drug prices, remains unclear—though Trump now has the mandate and the power to completely upset various apple carts.
Voters in several states opted to support measures that would permit some use of marijuana. In California and Massachusetts, voters chose to legalize the recreational use of pot. Voters in Florida, North Dakota, and Arkansas approved the use of medical marijuana, while the results in Maine are still too close to call (though it looks good for pot advocates). States that already permit recreational marijuana include Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and the District of Columbia. The results from last night means that more than 20 percent of the country’s adult population can now legally spark a doobie.


Voters in Colorado approved a measure allowing terminally ill patients to end their own lives, making it the sixth state in the nation to sanction physician-assisted suicide. Known as the Medical Aid in Dying initiative, it was approved by the vast majority of voters. Similar to a suicide law previously passed in Oregon, the new bill applies to terminally ill patients who have less than six months to live. Patients also need to make three separate requests for life-ending medication, two verbal and one written. In addition to Colorado and Oregon, other states that permit doctor-assisted death include Washington, Vermont, Montana, and California.
In California, voters considered a law, known as the Drug Price Relief Act, that would have placed a cap on prescription drug prices for certain buyers (potentially forcing some pharmaceutical companies to drop their prices). The final vote is not yet official, but it doesn’t look good for this proposal. Had it passed, the bill would have placed a limit on how much California could spend on the prescription drugs it purchases through programs such as Medicaid or insurance plans for state employees. Pharmaceutical companies poured $109 million on ads in an effort to dissuade voters from saying yes.
Voters in Florida expressed uncertainty about a proposed field trial to release bioengineered mosquitoes into the environment. These genetically modified mosquitoes would be able to thwart the spread of diseases like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, but critics worry about unanticipated negative effects on the environment and public health. Voters in Key Haven rejected the idea, while residents of Monroe County approved it. This result may prevent the project from proceeding in Key Haven, but the results of the referendums are nonbinding. Board members of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District have a final say on the matter, but given the results of the public vote, it’s not clear how they’ll proceed.
In regards to the future of US healthcare, it’s difficult to know exactly what Trump will do to reshape the system. Trump could try to abolish or roll back Obama’s Affordable Care Act; this is now conceivable given that Republicans have control over both the House and Senate. It’s quite possible that Trump will hand off the responsibility to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who could help craft a new system. That said, there’s considerable disagreement among Republicans over issues such as Medicare restructuring and how to make health insurance more affordable. This is going to be a tricky area for conservatives, who may face a political backlash should 20 million Americans suddenly lose coverage.


Congress has also been working on a bill that would accelerate the approval of drugs and devices by the Food and Drug Administration (a bill that Democrats also supported). This will come as a welcome reform, as the FDA is often accused of taking its sweet time with its approvals.
Another thorny issue is the problem of rapidly rising prescription drug costs (Epipens and price-gouger Martin Shkreli come to mind). Like Hillary Clinton, Trump supports the idea of allowing Medicare to negotiate prices. He also supports price transparency for the entire health care system, and allowing consumers to buy lower-cost drugs from foreign countries. But Republican congressional leaders aren’t on board—and neither are pharmaceutical companies. A potential battle is brewing between Trump and Big Pharma, and it’s not clear who’ll win, or if Trump will even make this a priority.
EpiPen, the life-saving allergy product, is now a $1 billion a year business for Mylan, a drug…
On the issue of the ongoing opioid epidemic and substance abuse, Trump’s campaign promises are unlikely to address the direness of the situation. Trump said he’ll build a wall on the Mexican border “to stop the flow of opioids,” which he says is the “source” of America’s opioid problem. As a solution, this is a non-starter—and that’s bad news for the two million Americans addicted to opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and prescription pain relievers.

One of the most unsettling moments in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey is when it’s revealed that HAL 9000 can read lips, leaving no secrets between the astronauts and the ship’s computer. That might have been science fiction, but 15 years after the events of that film, researchers in the real world have finally taught computers how to read lips.
LipNet, developed by researchers at the University of Oxford Computer Science Department, isn’t the first software designed to predict what a person is saying by analyzing the movement of their lips. But it’s by far the most accurate, achieving an impressive 93.4 percent accuracy, compared to just 52 percent accuracy achieved by an experienced human lip reader.

So what’s the “secret sauce” that makes LipNet so adept at reading lips? Here’s how the researchers’ abstract that explains what makes their approach different, and better:
Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker’s mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). All existing works, however, perform only word classification, not sentence-level sequence prediction. Studies have shown that human lipreading performance increases for longer words (Easton & Basala, 1982), indicating the importance of features capturing temporal context in an ambiguous communication channel. Motivated by this observation, we present LipNet, a model that maps a variable-length sequence of video frames to text, making use of spatiotemporal convolutions, an LSTM recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end.
So what does all that mean in English? Based on previous research, the computer scientists realized that humans are better at reading lips, and deciphering what’s being said, when longer words are spoken. So instead of analyzing footage of someone speaking on a word-by-word basis, LipNet goes one step further by taking entire sentences into consideration, using Deep Learning techniques to then backtrack and decipher each word.


But what does this mean for those of us outside academia? Running on a smartphone, fed a live feed from a body-worn camera, LipNet could serve as an amazing tool for the hearing impaired. Even if they already know how to lip read, it could help boost their understanding while watching someone speak. And those without lip reading skills wouldn’t be frustrated when a person they’re speaking to doesn’t know sign language.

Illegal ivory comes from dead elephants. It comes from elephants that were killed recently, and if you try to argue otherwise, you’re wasting everyone’s time. Hidden ivory stockpiles are not the problem. Freshly slaughtered elephants are, and now, science can prove it.
African elephant populations are in free-fall thanks to humanity’s insatiable demand for ivory. But despite the seemingly obvious connection between fewer live elephants on the African savannah and a surge in the amount of ivory on the black market, there’s a lot of confusion surrounding where illegal ivory comes from from. There’s a persistent idea that corrupt governments are fueling the trade, through vast storehouses of ivory stockpiled long ago.


Now, the issue can finally be laid to rest. In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, a team led by Thure Cerling at the University of Utah used carbon-14 dating to determine the precise age of 231 tusks confiscated between 2002 and 2014. Their  findings? Only four of the specimens were more than five years old, and most ivory samples were from elephants killed less than three years ago.
A survey published earlier this year found that African elephant populations have declined nearly 30 percent from 2007 to 2014. That amounts to 144,000 magnificent animals killed in the name of household decorating.
“This is another method of seeing what’s happening, independent of the elephant count,” Cerling said in a statement. “It corroborates the count.”


According to the study, most ivory from East Africa hails from animals killed less than a year ago, while ivory from Central Africa tended to be more than two years old. This, the researchers say, suggests East African elephant populations—which live in more exposed savannah environments—may be easier to slaughter en masse, resulting in large shipments of fast-moving product.
That product is making its way all over the world, from jewelry shops in Hong Kong to antique stores in New York. It is even being sold as “legal” ivory. So, next time you’re imagining how attractive that “vintage carved tusk” would look on your living room mantle, just think how much better it would look on the elephant it (perhaps very recently) belonged to.

Delhi, the capital city of India and home to 25 million residents, is in the midst of an “extreme pollution event.” In other words the city has been overrun with smog—tons of it. Recent photographs show the extent of the problem, which is being blamed on everything from vehicle emissions and crop burning through to smoking and fireworks.
A noxious smog has settled over the city of Delhi, and it’s causing more than just a burning sensation in the eyes and throat. Tempers flared this past Sunday when hundreds of citizens gathered outside the Parliament buildings to protest the deteriorating conditions. It’s the worst pollution to strike the city in nearly two decades.
In response, the government has declared a pollution emergency, temporarily shutting down construction for five days, halting a power plant for 10 days, and closing the city’s 1,800 schools for three days. Should the situation not improve, city officials said they may restrict the number of vehicles allowed on the road.
The level of dangerous particles reached 700 micrograms per cubic meter on Monday. This past weekend, the level surpassed 1,000 in some places, which is 16 times the limit India’s government considers safe—and a whopping 70 times the level the World Health Organization considers safe.

Sustained exposure to these extreme levels of pollution are considered equivalent to smoking more than two packs of cigarettes a day. The fine particles, which measure between 2.5 to 10 micrometers, can enter the lungs, bloodstream, and even heart. The elderly and small children are particularly at risk.

Delhi is a miserable place to be in right now, and it’s easily the most polluted city in the world at the moment. Residents have been told to visit the hospital should they experience breathlessness, giddiness, chest pain, and constriction, and to wash their eyes with running water should they become irritated. Citizens have been clamoring for anti-pollution masks, and vendors are doing brisk business.
The cause of the pollution has been pinned on vehicle emissions, construction, holiday fireworks (Dewali just ended, but it’s a stretch to blame fireworks), and excessive smoking. But it appears that the primary contributor to the smog is the practice of crop burning. Earlier today, a government scientist said that crop fires in Punjab and Haryana contributed as much as 70 percent of the pollution load in Delhi.
Weather has also contributed to the unprecedented pollution levels in Delhi, including a change in wind direction that transported pollutants from the crop fires. Calm surface winds over the capital prevented the pollutants from dispersing, leading to an accumulation of toxic chemicals.
Meteorologists expect the pollution levels to drop today and over the course of the week as surface winds pick up. That said, air quality levels will likely stay within the “severe” to “very poor” levels this week.
Critics say the government is reacting to the pollution emergency by enacting short-term solutions, and that something needs to be done to alleviate the problem in the long-term.

It isn’t enough to halt global warming, but carbon-hungry plants are helping impede the buildup of CO2 in our atmosphere to a measurable degree, a new study has found. While this is a good thing and you should go thank a tree right now, the effect is probably temporary, speaking to how damn complicated our planet’s response to climate change is going to be.
The amount of carbon in the atmosphere is increasing every year. But while the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 climbed steadily throughout the late 20th century, between 2002 and 2014 it held flat at approximately 1.9 parts per million per year. This observation is difficult to square with the fact that humans are pumping more carbon into the air now than ever before.


When Trevor Keenan, a researcher at Berkeley Lab’s Climate and Ecosystems Division, discovered the growth rate pause while analyzing data from the Global Carbon Project last year, he realized there must be a missing carbon sink. Furthermore, he recognized that the missing sink wasn’t in the ocean, which has been soaking up carbon at a well-measured rate over the last few decades.
But on the land, climate conditions are much more variable from year to year. And changes in temperature and rainfall directly impact the amount of carbon plants draw down from the atmosphere and release back.


“We realized the land sink was increasing,” Keenan told Gizmodo. “We didn’t know where, or why.”
Seeking answers, Keenan and his colleagues combined computer models of Earth’s carbon cycle with thirty years of satellite data on land-based vegetation, in addition to data from research towers that measure the amount of CO2 and water entering and leaving forests at their canopies.
This analysis, which is published today in Nature Communications, zeroed in on two factors responsible for the apparent slowdown in atmospheric CO2 buildup. One, plants drawing down more carbon for photosynthesis. Two, plants burning  less carbon for fuel. (Like humans, plants eat carbon-based sugars, and “respire” some of the energy back to the atmosphere as CO2.)
Greater carbon uptake in a carbon-loaded atmosphere is something ecologists have been discussing for a while. They’ve even given it a fancy name: the “CO2 fertilization effect.” Countering this effect is the respiration of CO2, which tends to increase for plants as temperatures rise.


But between 2002 and 2014, temperatures over the land didn’t rise as fast as they had been rising before. This, Keenan and his co-authors argue, is key.
“A lack of warming meant there wasn’t as much CO2 going into the atmosphere [from plants],” Keenan explained. “Meanwhile, we had CO2 in the atmosphere going up, causing a fertilization effect.”
It’s an elegant solution to what, for Keenan and many others, was a vexing planet-wide mystery. “I think this is an excellent analysis, and will be very thought-provoking,” David Schimel, an Earth scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not involved with the study, told Gizmodo.


But as Keenan and others emphasize, we cannot expect plants to eat enough extra carbon enough to save our collective assess. In fact, given our recent string of record-smashingly hot months, it’s possible Keenan’s newly-identified carbon sink has already started to disappear.
“It’s quite likely this is a temporary pause in the growth rate of CO2,” Keenan said. “As warming kicks back in, we’ll see the growth rate go up again.”


Schimel agrees. “The terrestrial uptake was caused, probably, by increasing CO2, but was aided by the slower growth rate of temperature over ten years or so (the so-called “pause”),” he wrote in an email. “Since the pause had ended, we’d expect to see the more rapid growth of biospheric uptake stop.”


Of course, any research highlighting the voracious CO2 appetite of Earth’s vegetation reminds us that restoring forests is one of the best strategies we have for offsetting carbon emissions. Under the Paris climate agreement, many nations have pledged to reduce their carbon footprints by doing exactly that.
But at the end of the day, there’s only one thing that’s going to protect us from the worst consequences of climate change—and that’s to kick the fossil fuel habit entirely.

Residents of the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka had a rather rude awakening this morning when a gigantic sinkhole formed near the JK Hakata train station. Local officials are now desperately working to prevent the collapse of nearby buildings.
The road outside the train station began to collapse in two sections around 5:15am local time, and they gradually expanded and collapsed into one gigantic hole (check out the dramatic video below). The hole now measures nearly 100 feet across and 50 feet deep.

Flowing water from a drain filled the opening like a bathroom sink, raising concerns that it could expand further and topple buildings nearby. Evacuations were ordered, and electricity was cut off for fear of igniting a gas leak (some 800 households are now without power). No injuries have been reported.

City officials admitted that work to bore a tunnel for a subway extension was the cause of the cave-in. Construction workers were digging about 80 feet below the surface when they noticed groundwater starting to flow into the tunnel. Realizing that something was askew, the workers monitored the tunnel while regulating traffic on the surface. Over the course of the next few hours the hole got increasingly larger. By the early afternoon, the city government decided to fill the hole as a stopgap measure to prevent buildings along the road from collapsing.

A drilling survey found that groundwater flowed into areas deeper than 10 to 16 feet below the surface. Workers tried to discharge the water with pumps, but were unable to prevent the cave-in.

NASA’s Juno mission is not exactly proceeding according to plan. Last month, an engine burn that would have brought the Jupiter-orbiting spacecraft into a low-altitude orbit was delayed following a malfunction with a pair of helium valves. Now, NASA has confirmed that the next opportunity to enter “science orbit” will also be missed—and that may be the case for the foreseeable future.
On October 14th, NASA announced that Juno’s final main engine burn, intended to move the spacecraft from its current 53.5-day elliptical orbit into its 14 day science orbit, was not going to happen as planned on October 19th. Instead, the space agency flagged December 11th, Juno’s next close approach (or perijove), as a possible future opportunity to execute the maneuver.


But a few weeks later, NASA issued another statement indicating that the December 11th perijove would be a “science flyby,” wherein the spacecraft points its scientific instruments at Jupiter to collect data, as it did on August 27th. Jet Propulsion Laboratory spokesperson DC Agle confirmed to Gizmodo that this means no engine burn. “A majority—if not all—instruments would be off during such a maneuver,” he said in an email.
Agle did not speculate as to when Juno might attempt to fire its engine again. The spacecraft’s next perijove falls on February 2nd, and there’s another one after that on March 27th.
But NASA has been dropping hints that Juno may be  stuck in a 53.5 orbit for a long time, possibly for the duration of its mission—and that this might not be the end of the world. “We can do all of our science in a 53-day orbit if needed,” Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton told reporters at recent Division of Planetary sciences press conference in Pasadena.


The Juno spacecraft was originally set to perform 33 two-week science orbits, which would bring it close to Jupiter’s poles and back out again, in order to peer beneath the gas giant’s cloud tops and map its magnetic field in unprecedented detail. In a 53.5 day orbit, it’ll take a longer time for Juno to collect the same amount of data. But since the spacecraft is only exposed to intense radiation during its close polar approaches, the overall radiation dose should not change much. “It’s the number of orbits that drives radiation up,” Botlon explained.
In mid 2019, if Juno is still in a 53.5 day orbit, it starts to run into eclipse issues, passing through Jupiter’s shadow for several hours each orbit. This could cause power deficiencies for the solar-charged spacecraft.
The space agency would have to cross that bridge if and when it arrives. But for now, engineers are still trying to find a solution to the helium valve issue. At a Lunar Exploration Analysis Group meeting last week, SpaceNews reports that James Green of the Planetary Science Division described NASA as taking a “very slow” approach to the problem. Among other things, it’s investigating possible connections to a thruster malfunction with a similar engine in Boeing’s Intelsat 33e satellite, which launched in August.
“We’re going to take another cycle around Jupiter and really study what’s happening before we make a decision on what to do next,” Green said.
Incredible photographs from a beach in Nyda, Siberia, show thousands of naturally formed snowballs spread across an 11 mile stretch of coast. This is now officially the best place in the world to have a snowball fight.
The giant snowballs began to appear on the beach about a week and a half ago. Locals in the village of Nyda, which is situated on the Yamal Peninsula just above the Arctic circle, have never seen anything quite like it. The balls of ice and snow range in size from just a few inches across to almost three feet wide—and they number in the thousands.


The snowballs look as if they were meticulously crafted by hand and then strategically placed across the beach, but they formed through natural processes. As Sergei Lisenkov from Russia’s Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute explained in the Siberian Times, they’re caused by a rare environmental process in which small pieces of ice form and are rolled by the wind and water:
When the water in the gulf rose, it came into contact with the frost. The beach began to be covered with ice. Then the water began to slowly retreat, and the ice remained. Its pieces were rolling over in the wet sand, and turned into these balls.
It is a rare natural phenomenon. As a rule, grease ice forms first, slush. And then a combination of the action of the wind, the outlines of the coastline, and the temperature, may lead to the formation of such balls.
Though exceptionally rare, this sort of this has been seen before, including in 2014 when balls like these appeared on the Lake Michigan shoreline.

A  magnitude 5.0 earthquake rattled the Oklahoma prairie town of Cushing last night, damaging several buildings and threatening one of the world’s largest oil terminals. Earthquakes are now a disturbingly frequent phenomenon in the region, with all signs pointing to the practice of disposing oil and gas field wastewater deep underground.
The quake—the third 5.0-plus tremor to hit the region this year—struck at 7:44pm local time at a depth of 3 miles (5 km). It was centered about 1.25 miles (2 km) west of Cushing, about 40 km south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake struck last week, forcing a shutdown of several oil wells. Yesterday’s tremor was the 19th to hit the region in the past week. The quake was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois, and Texas.

“I thought my whole trailer was going to tip over, it was shaking it so bad,” noted a Cushing resident in an Associated Press article. “It was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground. It was awful and I don’t want to have another one.”

Some minor injuries were reported, and city officials are now eager to inspect the damage, much of it in the town’s century-old downtown area. There’s fear that some of the community’s older buildings may now be unsafe, and that the tremblor might have damaged key infrastructure. Residents have been told to stay away from damaged sites, while schools have been closed for the day.

Pipeline operators haven’t reported any problems, but the community—known as the “Pipeline Crossroads of the World”—hasn’t heard from all companies. The region is home to an oil terminal that’s one of the world’s largest. Tank farms in-and-around Cushing hold about 58 million barrels of crude oil.


It’s the largest quake to hit the region since a 5.8 magnitude quake struck Pawnee on September 3, 2016—a record for Oklahoma. Once rare, earthquakes are now a disturbingly frequent occurrence. The state has experienced 2,200 earthquakes in just the past year.

Quakes above magnitude 5.0 are still quite rare, with yesterday’s being the third felt this year. Human-induced earthquakes are on the rise in both the United States and Canada, likely the result of oil and gas industry practices. The volume of waste water that’s being stored underground has risen more than 80 percent in the past six years, a timeframe that happens to coincide with Oklahoma’s sudden tendency towards earthquakes.

Investigating a strange electrical anomaly, geologists have discovered an enormous water reservoir beneath the now-dormant Uturunco volcano in the Bolivian Andes. It’s a remarkable find that speaks to the vast amounts of water stored in Earth’s deep interior, possibly since our planet was formed.
“It’s probably somewhere between Lake Superior and Lake Huron,” Jon Blundy, a geologist at the University of Bristol and co-author on the new discovery published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, told New Scientist. “It’s a staggeringly large amount.”


As geologists probe Earth’s deep interior using new technologies, it’s becoming clear our classic depiction of volcanoes, as ruptures in the Earth’s crust that sit atop vast reservoirs of gooey rock, is a bit simplistic. In some cases, the magma source is not located beneath the volcano, but many miles away. In other instances, there’s more to the magma itself than meets the eye.
Mikael  Laumonier of the University of Bayreuth and his colleagues discovered Uturuncu’s watery secret while investigating strange properties of the Altiplano-Puna magma body, located nearly 10 miles beneath the volcano. This magma body slows down seismic waves and features a surprisingly high electrical conductivity. According to laboratory experiments that simulated temperatures and pressures inside the volcano, its properties are best explained by a water content of 8 to 10 percent.


Extrapolating this concentration to the entire size of the Altiplano-Puna magma body, the researchers infer the presence of a tremendous subterranean “lake,” of sorts. “It’s dissolved in partially melted rock at 950 to 1000 degrees Celsius, so it’s not accessible,” Blundy told New Scientist.


While we won’t be tapping Uturuncu for irrigation anytime soon, the finding could help explain anomalous electrical readings from other volcanic systems around the world, including the Cascade arc in the Pacific Northwest and the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand. What’s more, a high water content in active volcanoes may shed light on the composition of Earth’s continental crust, and  on a 4.5 billion year old mystery: how our planet got wet in the first place.
There’s a fierce scientific debate over whether the Earth coalesced from tiny, water-coated grains of dust, or whether our blue marble started its life as a dry rock, with the oceans arriving later via comets and asteroids. The answer may lie in water buried in fiery reservoirs miles beneath our feet.

Entire lifetimes have come and gone without the moon looking quite as large as it will this month. On November 14th, skygazers will witness the closest full moon, or “supermoon,” of 2016. But more excitingly, it’ll be the closest full moon since 1948—and we won’t get another one like it until 2034.
The reason the moon appears to shrink and grow in the sky is that its orbit is not a perfect circle, but  rather, a modest ellipse. As the moon swings between its closest point (perigee) and its furthest point (apogee), its distance to Earth varies by approximately 30,000 miles. This translates to a size variation comparable to the difference between a nickel and a quarter.


Full moons and new moons occur when the Earth, sun and moon all form a line, something astronomers call “syzygy.” When  the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth as the sun during syzygy, it appears full. And when this particular celestial alignment also happens to coincide with perigee, we get an exceptionally close full moon, also known as a perigee moon or a supermoon.

A full moon at perigee can appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than a full moon at apogee. But even among the elite perigee moons, there’s some variation in size. That’s because the sun and moon—being moving objects in space rather than circles on a diagram—very rarely line up exactly at perigee. And, to a lesser extent, because the Earth’s distance to the sun changes during its orbit, too.


What makes the November 14th moon so special is that it turns full at 1:52pm UTC (9:52am ET), two and a half hours after hitting perigee at 11:23 UTC (7:52am ET).  This is the closest a full moon has to come to hitting perigee on the nose since January 26th, 1948, and the closest it will come for another 18 years, until November 25th, 2034.
All in all, it’ll be the largest moon in an 86 year period, which is pretty damn cool. Although, as NASA Planetary Program Executive Gordon Johnston notes, it’ll be very hard to tell the difference between this super-dupermoon and more ordinary supermoons with the naked eye. “You’d need a ruler,” he said.
According to Johnston, if you’re on the East Coast, the best time to check out this once-in-a-lifetime supermoon is going to be early on the morning of November 14th, before the moon sets and the sky starts to lighten at dawn. Not only is pre-dawn the closest to the full moon perigee us East Coasters are going to get, but—added bonus—as the moon sets, it can appear unnaturally large, owing to the fact that your brain starts measuring it against other objects on the horizon.
So: set an early alarm for the 14th, and get ready to bask in the glory of the most brilliant supermoon the modern world has seen.

The US Centers for Disease Control has released a report in which it identifies over a dozen cases of a deadly, antibiotic-resistant fungus called Candida auris. It’s the first time this super-strain has been found in the US, and disturbingly, four of the first seven patients infected with it have died.
Scientists have known about the fungus since 2009 when it was first identified from the ear canal discharge of a patient in Japan. Since then, infections have been reported in several other countries, including South Africa, the United Kingdom, India, and others. And now, as the CDC reports, the fungus has finally made its way to the United States—and it’s likely been lurking in the country since 2013. This serves as another potent reminder that the antibiotic era is quickly coming to an end.
More and more diseases are becoming resistant to antibiotics. Within a few decades, we’ll enter the …
Candida auris causes a nasty, and often fatal infection that’s typically treated with a class of antifungal drugs called echinocandins. But some isolates of this globally emerging health threat were found to be resistant to all three major classes of antifungal medications. The fungus can trigger infections in the bloodstream, wounds, and inside the ear. Complicating matters, the organism is difficult to identify using standard biochemical methods, and it’s often misidentified as other yeasts (typically Candida haemulonii, Candida famata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Rhodotorula glutinis).


“It appears that C. auris arrived in the United States only in the past few years,” noted Tom Chiller of the CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch, in an agency release. “We’re working hard with partners to better understand this fungus and how it spreads so we can improve infection control recommendations and help protect people.”
Seven of the cases described in the new report occurred between May 2013 and August 2016. They were discovered in four states: New York, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey. All cases were found in patients, prompting the CDC to say these findings “suggest that C. auris could be spread in healthcare settings.” All of the seven patients had underlying medical conditions, so it’s not clear if the four who died were actually killed by the fungus. Sixty percent of patients who acquired the infection died, but given the small sample size, it’s not clear just how deadly this fungus actually is. The other six cases were discovered after the period covered in the report and are still being investigated.
Lab tests show that the US strains were related to strains from South Asia and South America, but none of the patients travelled or had direct links to those locations. This strongly suggests that the patients acquired their infections locally. Disturbingly, this organism can spread quite easily; a sweep of the Illinois patient’s hospital room revealed traces of C. auris in his mattress, bedside table, bed rail, chair, and windowsill.


The CDC has been warning about C. auris since 2013 when it issued a report describing antibiotic resistant threats that required prompt attention. In light of this finding, the CDC is recommending that healthcare professionals implement strict Standard and Contact Precautions to control and prevent the spread of this vile fungus.

When a droplet of water impacts a larger body of water it has a tendency to bead up and bounce. It happens constantly, but you might not have focused closely enough to consider its strangeness—and it is very strange, especially when viewed on a high-speed camera.
As Destin from Smarter Every Day discovered with some help from astronaut Don Pettit, the answer to why water bounces is air. As the droplet falls, a layer of air gets caught between the two impacting surfaces which keeps them from becoming one singular body of water. Surface tension from the standing water launches the water bead back upward, each time with less energy, until eventually enough air is forced out and the bead coalesces with the larger mass.


On a vibrating surface—a speaker cone, for instance—the droplets survive even longer. And some truly unusual things happen when water, air, and a cello get together in space. But I’ll leave the heavy science lifting to Destin.

Correction: Destin from SED reached out to inform us that Don Pettit is still very much active as an astronaut. Sorry Don!
Say hello to Dave, the largest earthworm ever discovered in Britain.
This ridiculously long specimen of the common earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) was discovered by Paul Rees of Widness, UK, who spotted the 15 3/4 inch-long (40 cm) behemoth in his veggie garden. His stepson, George, named it Dave. Knowing he had found something rather extraordinary, Rees delivered Dave to Emma Sherlock, a scientist at the Natural Museum of History.
“I was bowled over by the size of this worm when I opened the plastic box they sent it in,” said Sherlock in a museum release. “Not only is it really long, it is almost twice as heavy as any other wild earthworm ever seen, weighing the same as a small chocolate bar.”


How wonderful that she compared it’s weight to a chocolate bar. Anyway, the worm weighed in at 26 grams (0.92 ounces), which absolutely destroys the previous record for the UK—a 15 gram (0.53 ounce) earthworm discovered in Scotland just last year.
Worms the size of Dave are rare because the larger they get, the more likely they are to become some animal’s meal. What’s more, the garden that Dave lived in must have been incredibly fertile and well-drained, with decaying matter quickly recycled back into the soil.
Sadly, Dave is no longer among the living—a victim of his incredible length and girth. Much to the chagrin of some overly sensitive tweeters:


The good news, however, is that Dave will be preserved in a jar at the Natural History Museum for all time. So tweeters calm down.

Officials in south Florida have been releasing troves of sterile flies in an effort to combat a parasitic maggot that eats the living tissue of warm-blooded animals—including humans.
The New World screwworm outbreak—the first to strike the United States in over 30 years—has already claimed the lives of 120 Key deer in the Florida Keys (out of a herd of 1,000). State officials now fear that the blight could spread to livestock, causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage to agriculture. Residents are being asked to monitor their pets, while park managers have started to erect enclosures in case the deer need to be corralled for preservation purposes.
In response to the infestation—which is currently limited to Big Pine Key and No Name Key—the Florida Commissioner of Agriculture has declared an agricultural state of emergency across the entire Monroe County. Meanwhile, authorities are working to suppress the population of screwworms by releasing sterile males in vast numbers. When these sterile males mate with females, no offspring are produced, resulting in a population crash. With each passing generation, and with increasingly dwindling numbers of fertile males, the fly basically breeds itself out of existence.


The US Department of Agriculture says it has been releasing more than three million sterile files twice a week to prevent the infestation from spreading any further. Since October 11, state officials have carried out 87 releases at 25 sites in the Florida Keys. It’s not clear how long the current effort will take, or how much it’ll cost. Eradication efforts like this typically take about six months.
Much to the chagrin of farmers, the parasitic screwworm fly (Cochliomyia hominivorax) produces larvae maggots that eat the living tissue of warm-blooded animals (a condition called myiasis). When in the larval stage, the worms burrow their way into live flesh in a corkscrew-like fashion (hence its name), effectively eating the animal from the inside. The worms typically enter an animal through an open wound. Frighteningly, it can also infect humans, though cases are rare, and none have been reported during the current outbreak.


To create the sterile males, the flies are bred in vast numbers and then blasted with radiation. No genetic modifications are required. The USDA developed this technique back in the 1950s as a form of biological control. The US government spent $750 million over the course of 45 years to eliminate the troublesome fly in Louisiana, Florida, and Puerto Rico.
The screwworm is a tropical insect, so its re-appearance in the United States may have something to do with rising global temperatures. But as noted, the screwworm has thrived in the US before. More work will be needed to establish a connection, should any exist.

A new analysis of the Ebola genome shows the dreaded virus acquired several new mutations during the course of the 2013-2016 West African Epidemic, making it even better at infecting human cells.
Two teams of researchers have published papers in the journal Cell (here and here) showing that the Ebola virus emerged from the West African epidemic stronger than before. A series of fortuitous mutations (well, fortuitous for Ebola at least) increased the ability of the virus to infect human cells. The virus, which is already highly communicable, appears to mutate quickly during an epidemic, allowing it to spread quickly. The two independent studies were led by Jeremy Luban from the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Jonathan Ball, a virologist from the University of Nottingham.
The recent Ebola outbreak was unique in that it was the first opportunity for the virus to replicate en masse and infect tens of thousands of humans. Previous to this episode, Ebola outbreaks were short lived, so the virus didn’t have much opportunity to adapt genetically to its human hosts. But during the most recent widespread outbreak, the disease infected an estimated 28,616 people across 10 countries, killing 11,310.


When the virus isn’t circulating through humans, it’s moving around in an unknown animal “reservoir,” likely fruit bats. It’s possible for the virus to acquire human-specific adaptations while circulating through bats, but the chances of this happening are exceedingly slim. The West African Epidemic offered Ebola an unprecedented opportunity to use humans as a testing ground for its genetic experiments, and through the powers of Darwinian natural selection, it was able to exploit our biological defences.
For the two studies, the research teams used publically available Ebola gene sequences to track any potential mutations. Their analysis uncovered mutations in the gene that encodes for Ebola’s glycoprotein—a protein that plays an important role in cell-on-cell interactions. This alteration to its genetic constitution enhanced Ebola’s ability to infect the cells of humans and other primates. Using infection models, the researchers were able to demonstrate the virus’s newfound skills on cultured human cells.


“We believe that the mutant was selected for by the unprecedented human-to-human spread in this epidemic,” Luban told Gizmodo. “It has never been seen before in people or animals.”
The researchers say it’s possible that these mutations increased the spread of Ebola during the outbreak. And indeed, one particular mutation emerged early during the outbreak, and at a time when case numbers spiked. The new strain quickly became the dominant version.


It’s not immediately clear if the mutated form of the virus still exists.
“It might persist in some of the people found to harbor Ebola virus for long periods of time after they recover,” Luban said. “We really don’t know much about this phenomenon yet.”
Another possibility is that the updated virus leaked back into the wild, though that scenario seems unlikely given that the mutated form of the virus is now distinctly disadvantaged in non-primate cells. Luban’s research found that the mutation only increases Ebola’s efficiency in human and other primate cells, which is actually good news—these mutations did not increase Ebola’s ability to infect the cells of fruit bats, the likely source of human outbreaks.
That said, this particular strain of Ebola might arise anew in future outbreaks, or different mutants might emerge. “What our studies show is that viruses better adapted to infecting humans arise quickly, and they can acquire further mutants to improve infectivity further and...play an important role in spread and severity of disease,” Ball told Gizmodo.


Looking ahead, the teams would like to learn more about these mutations, how the virus infiltrates cells, and how diseases evolve over the course of outbreaks. Hopefully, that’ll put us in a better position when the next outbreak hits.

To address the burgeoning “loneliness epidemic” and the demands of an aging population, some think that we should deploy robotic caregivers. A new ad titled “B.E.N. (Biologically Engineered Nursing),” however, suggests that this is a dreadful idea.
This five-minute ad was produced by the Society of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul (SSVP), an international Catholic voluntary organization that provides assistance to those in need. When the short story opens, we see a woman, Claudine, dancing with her robotic caregiver, BEN. From there, we travel back to the previous day, and we come to see how the pair came to their gloomy embrace.

As the ad shows, all is not as it appears to be. BEN may be attending to his client’s basic needs—such as preparing food and ensuring she gets up in the morning—but something vital is missing in these encounters. BEN, as an algorithm-driven automaton, is clearly failing to connect with Claudine. After all, robots are still robots at the end of the day.


“Today, companion robots are being introduced to assist lonely people,” proclaims the SSVP at the end of the ad, who are clearly referring to initiatives like Japan’s PARO therapeutic robot, a seal-like robot designed to “simulate interaction between patients and caregivers.” But as this new ad shows, simulation is a poor substitute for the real thing. “We think that only human being[s] can help in fighting loneliness,” says the SSVP. “We recruit volunteers.”
It’s been well established that social isolation is a serious health risk, particularly for…
It’s been well established that social isolation is a serious health risk, particularly for the elderly. Studies have shown that spending too much time alone is just as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and that socially isolated individuals experience a 26 percent increased risk of dying, regardless of the cause of death.


Sending human caregivers into the homes of the lonely is certainly one way to address this problem, but these interactions still need to be sincere in order to be effective. (It’s worth pointing out that some human caregivers can be just as bad—or even worse—than the robot portrayed in this commercial.) At the same time, we cannot discount the potential effectiveness of caregiving robots, whether they be silly robotic seals, or something more futuristic. Psychological projection can be a very powerful thing.
Finally, physicians and healthcare professionals need to do their share by routinely evaluating their patients’ social networks, and make recommendations about reaching out and connecting with more people. You don’t want your loved ones to end up talking to the refrigerator just because that’s their only option.

Go get your freak on, because athletes can officially have sex before the big game without feeling guilty. A new study from researchers published in Frontiers in Physiology claims that there “is no robust scientific evidence to indicate that sexual activity has a negative effect upon athletic results.”
This is a huge deal for athletes. As you’ve probably heard before, famous competitors like Muhammed Ali and even entire World Cup teams have implemented no-sex rules before big matches, hoping it would make them more focused and competitive. In recent years, this myth has been called into question, with researchers noting the lack of scientific evidence to support its claims. A new study aims to close the book on this debate and finally declare: athletes can bang before the big game.


“We clearly show that this topic has not been well investigated and only anecdotal stories have been reported,” researcher Laura Stefani said in a news release about the new study. “In fact, unless it takes place less than two hours before, the evidence actually suggests sexual activity may have a beneficial effect on sports performance.”
Researchers reported their findings after sifting through hundreds of studies and whittling down the list to the nine most reliable studies that examined impact of sexual activity on performance. The new study points out that male athletes have been more frequently investigated than females, and there are no comparisons of the effects across genders.


The big takeaway: the findings mean athletes can go back to wearing dirty clothes, talking to inanimate objects, and all of the other weird superstitions they’re already doing anyways—but at least they can have sex before all that.

If you’re planning to live in the Big Apple for the foreseeable future, it’s time to invest in flood insurance and a gondola. A new study finds that nine-foot floods, like those produced by Hurricane Sandy, will be three to 17 times more frequent by the end of the century, thanks to sea level rise and shifting storm conditions.
Ever since Hurricane Sandy flooded the New York City subway, brought a record 11-foot storm surge to the Battery tide gauge, and caused billions of dollars of property damage,  scientists have been trying to understand just how extreme this disaster was in a historical context. Through detailed sea level reconstructions from 850 to 1850 AD, we’ve learned that Manhattan’s flood risk has indeed been going up steadily over the last millennia. The land is slowly sinking into the ocean, causing relative sea levels to rise at about 1.4 millimeters each year.


But then came the 20th century, and a ramping up of sea level rise to around 3 millimeters per year due to human-caused climate change. “We found that if you factor in this change in sea level that’s happened in New York [since the 19th century] that’s led to about a three fold increase in flood risk,” said Robert Kopp, an Earth scientist at Rutgers University and co-author on the new study.
Overall, Kopp says, a Sandy-like flood jumped from being a 1-in-1,200 year event at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, to a  1-in-400 year event in the year 2000.


That’s bad news, but it gets much worse when you look at changing flood risks over the 21st century. Our best models estimate that New York City will see 1.6 to 3.2 feet (half a meter to a meter) of sea level rise by the end of the 21st century, thanks to ongoing subsidence of the land, melting ice sheets, and the expansion of seawater as it warms up. Meanwhile, climate change is likely to have complex effects on storm dynamics, with the expectation that a warmer future will promote the growth of more powerful storms that can hold more rain.
Combining models of future sea level rise, shifting storm patterns, and carbon emissions—which are assumed to follow the UN’s middle-of-the-road, RCP 4.5 scenario—Kopp and his colleagues estimated that Sandy-like floods will become about four times as frequent by the late 21st century. In other words, a once every 400 year event will become a one-in-100 year event. But there’s still a lot of uncertainty, particularly depending on which storm model you look at. In a worst-case projection, nine foot floods could make a dramatic, 17-fold jump in frequency, recurring every 23 years on average by the end of the century.
“The grand answer is that things are going to get worse by 2100,” study co-author Ben Horton said in a statement.
For Kopp, the point of studies like this is not to terrify the bejeezus out of people, but to highlight the fact that we live in a rapidly changing world when it comes to flood risk. In New York, the risk is almost certainly going up, and that’s a reality which needs to be factored into all future planning decisions.
The same could be said for Miami, New Orleans, or any other major population center on the front lines of sea level rise. And by the way, the world’s coastal populations are growing fast.


“The punch line is that this basically needs to be a core part of how we make decisions about anything that’ll be around for years to come,” Kopp said.

At a distance of 4.2 light years, Proxima b is the closest potentially habitable Earth-like planet outside our solar system. New research suggests this distant orb could be completely covered in water. So when do we go?
This past August, scientists with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) confirmed the discovery of a rocky planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri—our nearest neighboring star. Little is known about this distant planet and whether it has what it takes to foster alien life, but a new study accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal posits the suggestion that Proxima b is covered with oceans, and possibly even a single massive ocean that envelops the entire planet.
Last week, astronomers announced that our nearest neighboring star hosts an Earth-sized planet in…
Proxima b is a fascinating target for study, and not just because it’s an Earth-like planet in the star system nearest to our sun. The planet has a mass around 1.3 times that of Earth, and it sits in a tight orbit approximately a tenth the distance of Mercury to the sun. That’s not necessarily a problem because Proxima b’s host star, Proxima Centauri, is about 1,000 times weaker than our sun. That places it within the  habitable zone, where liquid water can reside at the surface.


Observations of Proxima b are few and far between, so Bastien Brugger and his colleagues from Marseille University in France ran a series of simulations to get a better sense of the planet’s composition and radius. Their estimates show that Proxima b’s radius ranges somewhere between 0.94 and 1.4 times that of Earth, which is about 3,900 miles (6,300 km) on average.
If the planet’s radius is closer to the lower bound of the estimate, it should be very dense, with a metallic core making up a whopping two-thirds of the planet’s entire mass, and surrounded by a rocky mantle. Any surface water on this planet would contribute to about 0.05 percent of the planet’s total mass, which is comparable to Earth’s 0.02 percent. Vast ocean ranges could very well exist on Proxima b.


But if the planet’s radius is closer to the higher estimate, around 5,540 miles (8,920 km), things get even more interesting. In this scenario, the planet’s mass would be split evenly between a rocky center and surrounding water.
“In this case, Proxima b would be covered by a single, liquid ocean 200 km deep [124 miles],” noted the researchers in an AFP article. “In both cases, a thin, gassy atmosphere could surround the planet, like on Earth, rendering Proxima b potentially habitable.”


It’s easy to get excited about this result, but we need to learn a lot more about this planet before we jump to conclusions. The researchers based their models on the assumption that Proxima b harbors a thin atmosphere—but we actually don’t know what kind of atmosphere this planet has, or if it even has one.
For all we know, it’s a frigid and airless chunk of rock—and not anything that would remotely resemble a habitable planet. But one thing’s for sure, Proxima b is turning out to be the most interesting—and alluring—planet outside of our solar system.

At the same time that Hurricane Matthew ravages the southeastern US, a new tropical storm has appeared just south of Bermuda. Together, the two have set a new  late-season record for storms in the Atlantic. Welcome to the frightening realities of a warmer world.
This latest storm, called Nicole, achieved hurricane status yesterday afternoon, setting a new record for the Atlantic Ocean. As Hurricane Matthew’s winds approached 120 miles per hour, Nicole’s winds reached 105 miles per hour. As NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center explained, “it marked the latest in the calendar year that two storms in the North Atlantic Ocean have had winds over 105 mph simultaneously.”
There is no doubt that Hurricane Matthew is a nightmarish storm. Unfortunately, it’s exactly the…
Nicole was downgraded from a Category 1 hurricane to a tropical storm earlier today. It no longer features a tell-tale eye, and satellite images show clouds being pushed away from the center by vertical wind shear. By late morning, the storm was located about 345 miles (555 km) due south of Bermuda.
At the moment, this storm is barely moving, but it’s slowly migrating southwards. Nicole is expected to make an about-face on Sunday and start tracking north towards Bermuda. Another possibility is that the storm will start to drift westwards on Sunday.


Ocean swells produced by Nicole, along with rough surf conditions, will affect Bermuda for at least the next five days. Thankfully, the storm is expected to weaken over the coming days, and it may never re-attain hurricane status.

Unbelievable footage from Australia shows a whale calf as it desperately tries to free its mother from a sandbank.
The humpback whales were spotted near North Stradbroke Island, about an hour’s drive from Brisbane. The mother had swum on top of a sandbank and was unable to get free. Video footage of the scene shows the distressed calf nudging and pushing its mom in an attempt to free her from the bank.


In response, a team from Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services were dispatched to help rescue the pair. Fortunately, owing to incoming tides and the efforts of the youngster, the mother humpback was able to free herself and swim away. Both appeared tired and distressed after the incident, but were otherwise unhurt.
This sort of empathetic or helpful behavior is not uncommon amongst whales. Earlier this summer, a pair of humpback whales came to the rescue of a seal who was being pursued by orca whales. They’ve even saved humans from drowning. And in one fascinating incident from 2013, a group of sperm whales adopted a dolphin with a spine deformity.

Following what was likely the largest evacuation in Florida’s history, winds from Hurricane Matthew reaching 70 miles per hour slammed the state early Friday morning, leaving about 179,980 without electricity. Having claimed over 300 lives in Haiti alone, Matthew is already the deadliest storm system to hit the region in almost a decade.

“This is serious,” warned Florida Governor Rick Scott just hours before the hurricane arrived. “If you need to evacuate and you haven’t, evacuate. This storm will kill you. Time is running out. We don’t have that much time left.”


More than 1.5 million people across the state were ordered to leave their homes due to the hurricane and up to a million more are expected to lose power in its wake. The total human and economic impact of Matthew has been much harder to anticipate, but is feared to be grave.
More than two million people in coastal Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina are being told to flee …
In an advisory to Florida’s eastern counties, the National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening wind” with potentially devastating effects, including “structural damage to sturdy buildings,” “complete roof and wall failures” and “complete destruction of mobile homes.”


“Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months,” said the NWS.
UPDATE 3:15 A.M.: According to the NWS, Matthew has slightly weakened while approaching Florida and is now a Category 3 hurricane.

Update 10/7/2016 (9:03am ET): More than 300,000 people in Central Florida have experienced power outages since last night. The area is experiencing flooding, damage from debris, and tree wreckage. The good news is that the violent wind storm has weakened to a Category 3 hurricane overnight and probably won’t make landfall, according to the National Weather Service. At about 7 a.m. ET, Hurricane Matthew sat just outside Florida’s east coast, battering Cape Canaveral with winds as high as 107 mph. Overall, the conditions have been slightly weaker than what forecasters were prepared for.
A popular fertility treatment introduced in the early 1990s has been linked to low sperm counts in men born from the procedure. Scientists aren’t entirely sure why this is happening, but it’s entirely possible that fathers are passing their fertility issues down to the next generation.
A new study published in Human Reproduction has linked intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to lower sperm counts and lower sperm quality in men conceived by the popular fertility treatment. This common type of IVF treatment is used to help couples in which the prospective father has some form of infertility, leading the study’s authors to suspect a genetic link—though that has yet to be proven. It’s another case where correlation is not necessarily causation.


“These findings are not unexpected,” said André Van Steirteghem, a consultant at the University Hospital in Brussels and a co-developer of the treatment. “Before ICSI was carried out, prospective parents were informed that it may well be that their sons may have impaired sperm and semen like their fathers.” But as Steirteghem explained in a release, this information was not necessarily a deal breaker because many parents saw ICSI as a solution for their future sons.


The first person to be conceived via ICSI happened in 1992, so it hasn’t been possible to study men born from the procedure until now. During ICSI, doctors take sperm from the father and inject it directly into the mother’s egg. The fertilized egg is then placed in her womb. Many men who opt for ICSI have defective sperm, so doctors have to choose the best candidates from what’s available.
For the new study, 54 men conceived by the procedure between the ages of 18 to 22 had their sperm tested. The results were discouraging, to say the least. These men had nearly half the sperm concentrations found in naturally conceived men of roughly the same age, and a two-fold lower count of motile sperm (i.e. sperm that swim well). The men were also four times more likely to have sperm counts below levels deemed normal by the World Health Organization.


The researchers say that genetic factors may be responsible, but they’re not ruling out other possibilities. They say the results highlight the need to perform more follow-up studies on children conceived by assisted reproduction.
“For instance, paired analysis of samples from fathers and sons should be carried out, and we need to look at larger numbers of offspring,” said Van Steirteghem. “[H]ealth authorities and funding agencies should provide the means to answer questions concerning the effects of genetics, mode of conception, fetal growth patterns and birth weights on the fertility of ICSI men.”
As previously noted, ICSI and other techniques could conceivably be used to help individuals born via this technique to produce their own children. If genetics is eventually implicated, that would be insufficient reason to withhold the practice from men with severe fertility issues. What’s more, telling a man he can’t have children because he’s somehow genetically deficient  is basically eugenics. And with the eventual advent of genetic engineering, we’ll just eliminate heritable male infertility altogether.

Gallium is one of those rare metals that turns to a liquid somewhere above room temperature, allowing you to do fun experiments—like pouring it onto a vibrating speaker while playing music—without risking severe burns. Point a camera at the results and that fun science experiment suddenly feels like you’ve discovered a distant alien world bubbling to life out of the fabric of the cosmos.

Plants employ a wide variety of tactics to lure pollinators, but an ornamental plant popularly known as Giant Ceropegia takes it to another level. Its flower smells like a honeybee under attack—an odor that freeloading, meal-seeking flies find absolutely irresistible.
Around four to six percent of all plants use deception to attract pollinating insects, but researchers have never seen a trick like this before. Writing in the latest edition of Current Biology, researchers from the University of Salzburg in Austria and the University of Bayreuth in Germany describe the unique strategy employed by the Giant Ceropegia, a plant with an umbrella-like flower that it uses to temporarily imprison pollinating insects.
Evolutionary biologist and entomologist Stefan Dötterl and his colleagues show that the trap flower on the Giant Ceropegia smells like a bee under attack. But why, you ask, would a flower want to emit such a distinctive scent? Well, it turns out that this particular aroma attracts parasitic flies—and it tricks them into pollinating the flower. The flies are drawn to the smell because they like to feast on the remains of honeybees who have been killed by a spider or a predatory insect.


The Giant Ceropegia has evolved an ingenious way to attract and temporarily capture a bug that thinks it’s there to steal some food. When an unwary fly ventures inside the flower, the trap closes shut, enclosing the fly inside. The fly struggles for a bit, pollinating the plant in the process. Eventually, the flower opens up and the fly is free to move on.
“Flies are attracted to the flowers, expecting a meal, but instead of finding an attacked honeybee they are temporarily trapped in the non-rewarding flowers [there’s no food inside!] and misused as pollinators,” explains Dötterl in a release. The researchers say it’s the first example of a plant that achieves pollination by pretending to smell like a carnivorous animal’s dinner.
The researchers made the discovery while trying to figure out how the flies, a species known as Desmometopa, were so good at finding honeybees so soon after a spider attack. While observing one such encounter, study co-authors Annemarie Heiduk and Ulrich Meve from the University of Bayreuth noticed that the bees released a shot of venom. This complex compound contains “alarm” pheromones that call and attract nest mates for help. Flies have learned to recognize this smell, and react accordingly.


Studies done in the lab show that the Giant Ceropegia’s flower smells almost exactly like the compounds excreted by bees who are under attack. So this plant, through the extraordinary powers of Darwinian natural selection, has evolved a highly specialized technique for attracting flies and boosting its reproductive potential. Looking ahead, the researchers are hoping to see if other plants employ a similar strategy.

Introducing the LudusScope, a 3D-printed, open-sourced system that lets you control and play games with living microbes on your smartphone. Tormenting single-celled organisms has never been so much fun.
LudusScope was developed by Stanford engineer Ingmar Riedel-Kruse, and he envisioned it as a new way of interacting and learning about common microbes. It’s meant for use in educational settings, and teachers can easily 3D print their own LuduScope using plans downloaded from the internet. Students can assemble their own device with very little help required from their teachers.

“Many subject areas like engineering or programming have neat toys that get kids into it, but microbiology does not have that to the same degree,” noted Riedel-Kruse in a release. “The initial idea for this project was to play games with living cells on your phone. And then it developed much beyond that to enable self-driven inquiry, measurement and building your own instrument.”
The system consists of a platform for a microscope slide, and a cell phone holder with a microscope eyepiece that’s positioned up top. Riedel-Kruse’s microbe of choice is Euglena, a tiny single-celled organism that’s attracted to light. Each slide is surrounded by four LEDs, each of which can be controlled by a joystick (instructions on how to assemble the circuit that connects the joystick to the LEDs are also provided).


Once assembled, students can use the LuduScope in any number of ways. Most simply, kids can just watch their Euglena move around as they trigger the different light sources.
But this device can do much more. Riedel-Kruse and his colleagues put together a software program that can run on a mobile phone and overlay on top of the image of the cells. Some of the programs provided are purely educational, allowing students to measure the microbes and record observations of their behavior.

But the games are what make the LudusScope so interesting. Students can target a particular Euglena and try to control its movements using the LEDs. Kids can use the microbes to play soccer (above), or move it around in a Pac-Man-like maze (below). The software includes a number of other activities and games.

For those worried about the welfare of the microbes, there’s probably not a lot to be concerned about. These simple organisms aren’t likely capable of experiencing anything approximating pain or frustration; they’re basically script-driven automatons with photophilic tendencies.


The device has already been tested by some teachers and students, and the researchers are now working to improve and expand the system after receiving feedback. Teachers who are interested  can use the open source information contained within the paper, which can be found at PLOS One.

In an open letter to investors on Wednesday, Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes announced that the company was shuttering all of its labs and wellness centers, “impacting” around 340 employees—presumably by putting them out of work.
“We are profoundly grateful to these team members, many of whom have devoted years to Theranos and our mission, for their commitment to our company and our guests,” wrote the CEO of the beleaguered blood-testing startup.
It’s been almost a month since we last heard from beleaguered blood-testing startup Theranos, which …
Unfortunately for those devoted team members, federal authorities banned Holmes from operating a lab for two years this summer due to allegedly unsafe practices under her leadership. Theranos, given a choice to keep either its laboratories or its founder, evidently picked the latter.


In Wednesday’s letter, Holmes said that the company will now focus on developing its new miniLab device, a move that  allows her to remain at Theranos if the sanctions (which are currently being appealed) are upheld.
That side of the business, however, has its own problems: Last month, Theranos announced it was withdrawing an emergency application for a miniLab Zika test after the FDA discovered evidence of improper patient safeguards.
“After many months spent assessing our strengths and addressing our weaknesses, we have moved to structure our company around the model best aligned with our core values and mission,” wrote Holmes. “I look forward to sharing more with you as we progress along the way.”

Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, astronomers have found evidence of a “wandering” black hole on the outskirts of a distant galaxy. It’s too far away to cause us any trouble, but the discovery of this homeless ball of gravitational despair affirms a long standing theory about the existence of such objects.
A massive black hole that’s more than 100,000 times the mass of our sun has been detected in the outer regions of a galaxy located about 4.5 billion light years from Earth.  Astronomers suspect that this “wandering” black hole was originally located at the core of a smaller galaxy, but it became dislodged during a merger with a larger one. Now homeless, it’s settled into the outer reaches of the usurping galaxy.
If you were going to travel close to a black hole in order to study it, which type should you…
Black holes—objects so heavy that not even light can escape them—come in a range of sizes. Stellar black holes measure about 10 miles across, and are up to 20 times heavier than  our sun. Massive black holes, or so-called intermediate black holes, are 100 to 100,000 times heavier than our sun. At the top of the scale are supermassive black holes, which have upper masses ranging between 100,000 to 10 billion times that of the sun.


Both intermediate black holes and supermassive black holes are parked at the center of their galaxies, but astronomers have theorized about the existence of “rogue” black holes—objects that have been jostled away from their galactic cores following a collision with a galaxy containing its own massive black hole. The stars, dust, and gas from the second galaxy would disperse through the first one—along with its now displaced black hole.
Scientist have spotted a few black holes over the years that could qualify as wanderers, but nothing terribly compelling, and nothing quite on the scale of this latest discovery. Writing in the Astrophysical Journal, astronomer Dacheng Lin and colleagues describe a massive black hole that’s located on the outskirts of a distant galaxy called GJ1417+52.
Black holes themselves may not be visible, but we can detect the damage they do in their immediate neighborhoods. In this case, a star wandered too close to the rogue black hole, ripping it to shreds. The gaseous debris produced by this unfortunate encounter generated a tremendous amount of X-rays, which scientists on Earth were able to pick up using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA’s XMM-Newton X-ray observatory.


The extreme brightness of this object classifies it as a “hyper-luminous X-ray source,” and it features a mass about 100,000 times that of our sun. That’s 10 times brighter than the brightest X-ray source ever seen for a candidate wandering black hole. Dubbed XJ1417+52, the object measures a whopping 3.13 million light years from tip to tip. The astronomers speculate that the black hole  located within it originally belonged to a small galaxy that rammed into the larger GJ1417+52 galaxy.


At a distance of 4.5 billion years, this wandering black hole is nothing to worry about. But some scientists speculate that our very own Milky Way galaxy is home to hundreds of these massive objects, the remnants of early galaxy formation. None of these objects have ever been detected in our galaxy, but that doesn’t mean they’re not there. And even if they are, they’re probably not as big as the unusually heavy GJ1417+52.

The oldest human to have ever lived died at the age of 122—and that was nearly 20 years ago. A recent analysis of global demographic data suggests this may very well be the maximum age attainable by humans, and that it’s extremely unlikely anyone will ever live much beyond this advanced age. That is, unless we science the shit out of this problem. 
In a new study published in Nature, molecular geneticist Jan Vijg and his team from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx make the case that human lifespan has a natural limit, and that we’ll probably never exceed this maximum bound. It’s a surprising conclusion given the tremendous medical achievements we’ve made in the past 100 years, and the steady rise in life expectancy. But as this study points out, the benefits wrought by these interventions, and all the things we do to stay vibrant and healthy, only go so far. Our bodies, no matter what we do, eventually become worn out and expire.
No one has lived longer than Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at the age of 122 years and 164 days. Given the increasing number of people breaching the 100 year barrier, and considering the steady increases in life expectancy, scientists thought that her longevity record would be broken relatively quickly. This simply hasn’t happened. There’s a big difference, it would appear, between life expectancy—the average time a person is expected to live within a certain population—and lifespan, which describes the maximum age reached by a member of a particular species.


Vijg and his colleagues took a look at the Human Mortality Database, a publicly available research tool that provides global mortality and population statistics to researchers, students, and others interested in human longevity. The researchers discovered that jumps in survival rates reached a plateau around 1980. A follow-up analysis of data from the International Database on Longevity, which included demographic statistics from developed nations like the US, UK, France, and Japan, showed that the longest lived people haven’t been getting any older since the time of Calment’s death in 1997. Taken together, the researchers say this reveals a natural limit to longevity.
Models developed by the researchers show that the odds of anyone living much beyond this limit is slim. “Assuming there are 10,000 worlds like ours, then one individual will reach 125 years of age in a given year,” Vijg explained to Gizmodo. “The chance is 1 in 10,000, so it’s extremely remote.”


Sociologist and gerontologist S. Jay Olshansky from the University of Chicago agrees with these findings, saying many people are under the false belief that we can forever manufacture more survival time through medical technology.
“These researchers suggest that we will get diminishing returns from these efforts because we’re butting up against a limit,” Olshansky told Gizmodo. “Having said that, it doesn’t mean that further progress isn’t possible. To the contrary, there is still plenty of low hanging fruit available to extend life—this comes from reducing harmful behavioral risk factors such as smoking and obesity, and reducing disparities.” He cautions, however, that even these interventions won’t yield large gains in life expectancy.


Olshansky isn’t surprised by these findings, saying it’s something he and his colleagues predicted way back in 1990. But he does take issue with the concept of a “natural limit” to human lifespan. Vijg and his colleagues say this apparent limit is a fixed genetic trait that evolved under the direct force of natural selection, and that limited lifespans may be an evolutionary adaptation.
Since the time of Darwin, evolutionary biologists have wondered why the lifespans of different…
This controversial idea, called “programmed aging,” suggests that lifespans are genetically conditioned, and not wholly the result of gradual wear-and-tear. Take birds, for example. Some species live for two or three years, while others, like the albatross, can live for up to 50 years. The difference has to do with the way the lifespans of certain species are genetically controlled.


Writing in a Nature News and Views article, Olshansky says this is simply not possible:
Fixed genetic programs that directly cause ageing and death cannot exist as a direct product of evolution, because the end result would be death at an age beyond which almost every member of a species would ordinarily live. A genetic time bomb designed to kill us at older ages is equivalent to automobile manufacturers building in an explosive device that is set off only when a car reaches one million miles. Because most cars are never driven that far, such a device would be useless.
Olshansky believes that the “natural limit” can be breached, but probably not by any technology we have available today, and probably not even by curing major fatal diseases. “We will need to discover something fundamentally different that allows us to slow the biological process of aging in order to break through this barrier,” he told Gizmodo. “I’m optimistic this will happen in our lifetime.”


Another person who’s optimistic about extending human lifespans is biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey, the Chief Science Officer of the SENS Research Foundation, an organization dedicated to extending healthy human lifespan.
Responding to the question of how life extending interventions might alter this apparent limit, de Grey said, “They will obliterate it,” adding that the “limit exists because of the simple mathematical combination of three things, all related to the fact that aging is the accumulation of self-inflicted damage.”
The three things in question include the degree of damage inflicted onto the body when early life factors such as not smoking and good nutrition are in place, how rapidly the damage increases thereafter, and how much damage the body can withstand without ceasing to function. Modern medicine shows little prospect of being able to change these realities, de Grey says—the more damaged the body, the less it is capable of preventing more damage.


“But new medicine that we will have within the coming decades, and which SENS Research Foundation is racing to develop, will break that feedback loop entirely,” he told Gizmodo. “It will repair the damage, using various types of regenerative medicine, so that the ongoing creation of damage will no longer lead to the accelerated accumulation of that damage and the downstream pathologies that it causes.”
Biologists have successfully extended the life spans of some mice by as much as 70%, leading many…
The damage-repair therapies that de Grey is hoping to develop, plus all the other unknown medical interventions that await in the future, threaten to upset Vijg’s assumption about an upper limit to human lifespan. Future developments could include a dramatic reworking of human genetics using genome editing tools like CRISPR, and the introduction of artificial chromosomes to give us new ways of staving off age related diseases. Advances in molecular nanotechnology, cybernetics, and regenerative medicine could alter human biology even further.


But to be fair, this new Nature study is a normative analysis that assumes a kind of status quo as it pertains to the state of medical technologies. If de Grey and other proponents of radical life extension are correct, however, there’s no limit to how long future humans could live. He predicts that humans will eventually reach a stage of “negligible senescence,” that is, a state in which aging is so slow that it’s imperceptible.
On this point, Olshanksy pumps the brakes.
“Contrary to the futurists claiming that radical life extension or immortality is at hand—a claim that has been made for most of the last two thousand years from alchemists to modern day anti-aging charlatans—it’s not likely we’re going to live much longer than the longest lived among us,” he said.


Olshansky says it’s important to keep our eye on the prize, which is to extend healthy life. Should we succeed, the resulting increases to our longevity will be a bonus, but only if the added survival time is healthy.
“We do need to recognize that there are limits, but this should in no way stop us from developing new ways to manufacture more healthy life,” he says. “Given that healthy life is one of the most precious commodities on earth, it’s hard to imagine that we’ll stop trying—and no one is suggesting that.”


And indeed, the authors of the new study say their research is highlighting the need for scientists to develop “interventions beyond improving health span,” adding that “there is no scientific reason why such efforts could not be successful.”

Ocean-dwelling creatures like whales, seals, and walruses don’t freeze in the icy waters thanks to their thick layers of insulating blubber. But how do scrawny sea otters stay warm? Their furry coats  trap air which also works as an insulator, and researchers at MIT think that approach could help keep humans warmer under water, too.
Wetsuits are certainly an effective way for humans to venture out into the ocean without freezing, but the thick neoprene material they rely on to trap body heat can also be restrictive, making it harder to move. And if you’ve ever watched otters diving in and out of the water at an aquarium, you know maneuverability definitely isn’t a problem for them.
After running countless tests and simulations to determine just how an otter or beaver’s fur coat is able to trap pockets of warm air when they enter the water, the team at MIT came up with a formula to calculate exactly how long and dense a layer of fur needs to be to effectively trap air based on the speed of a diver entering the water.

Using this knowledge, a radically new type of wetsuit could be created. Instead of a thick layer of insulating neoprene foam, a thinner, more flexible material, covered in millions of tiny artificial hairs, could be worn making it easier for divers, or surfers, to move around in the water. Would they look like furry monsters as they dove in and out of the water? Yes, they would. But they’d be warm, without feeling like they’ve been wrapped in a bulky, soaking wet heating blanket.

The 2016 Nobel Prize for Chemistry has been awarded to a trio of scientists for their pioneering work in developing molecular machines. These gadgets measure just a thousandth of a human hair in width, and they’re poised to revolutionize everything from manufacturing and materials to medicine and the functioning of the human body.
The winners of this year’s prize are Jean-Pierre Sauvage from the University of Strasbourg, France, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart from Northwestern University in Illinois, and Bernard L. Feringa from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
As a science, molecular nanotechnology is still in its infancy, but by awarding the Nobel Prize to these three scientists, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is acknowledging the technology’s huge potential.


In his historic 1959 lecture, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” physicist Richard Feynman introduced the world to the concept of nanotechnology. He envisioned a world where we could directly manipulate individual atoms, arranging and rearranging them into useful shapes and configurations. The concept was given an added boost in 1986 with the publication of K. Eric Drexler’s seminal book, Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology. Drexler’s ideas sent shockwaves through the chemistry world, with his super-futuristic ideas of smart materials that change shape, microscopic machines that produce and deliver medicines right inside the body, and rockets built from a single seed.
Researchers from the University of California have developed acid-fueled micro-machines capable of…
But theory is one thing. Actually demonstrating feasibility is entirely another. And it’s at this critical nexus point where the work of Sauvage, Stoddart, and Feringa is being acknowledged. All three are being honored for developing molecules with controllable movements, and for creating tiny devices that can perform a task when energy is added.


Jean-Pierre Sauvage took the first major step in 1983, when he linked two ring-shaped molecules to form a chain, called a “catenane.” Typically, molecules are connected by strong covalent bonds in which atoms share electrons, but Sauvage’s chain was linked by a flexible mechanical bond. This interlocked ring sets the stage for molecular machines that are constructed from freely moving parts that can move relative to one another.
Eight year later, Fraser Stoddart developed the “rotaxane,” which he did by threading a molecular ring onto a thin molecular axle, which was able to move along the axle. His pint-sized contraption inspired further breakthroughs in nanotechnology, including a molecular elevator, a molecular muscle, and a molecule-based computer chip.
In 1999, Bernard Feringa developed a molecular rotor blade that spun continuously in the same direction, making it the world’s first molecular motor. In one experiment, he rotated a glass cylinder that was 10,000 times larger than the motor itself. Feringa is also the inventor of the nanocar—a vehicle made from a single molecule.


These breakthroughs have inspired the development of increasingly sophisticated molecular machines, including “nanofish” that swim through bloodstreams, atom-sized data storage, and cyborg sperm, to name a few. Some experts think that nanotechnology will unleash a second Industrial Revolution, which will run alongside advances in robotics, mass automation, and artificial intelligence.
As we head deeper into the 21st century, we're starting to catch a glimpse of the fantastic…
On the downside, nanotechnology holds tremendous destructive potential, possibly on the same scale as artificial superintelligence. It could be weaponized, or run amok in an accidental grey goo scenario. Regardless, with the 2016 Nobel Awards, it’s clear that nanotechnology has finally arrived.

To help understand just how destructive earthquakes can be, researchers could spend years examining the aftermath. But displaced residents need to begin cleanup, and return to their homes, as soon as possible. So researchers at Brigham Young University came up with a way to preserve the destruction caused by an earthquake so it can be studied indefinitely.
Immediately after a magnitude 6.2 earthquake hit central Italy earlier this year, a team of civil engineers and professors from Brigham Young University and the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance Association—or GEER, for short—visited the sites to document the destruction, including how ancient and modern structures were affected, before cleanup efforts got underway.


But instead of snapping a few photos, the team used a camera-equipped drone to capture over 50-gigabytes of high-res aerial footage. This data was then used to generate 3D interactive models of the affected areas which could be studied, thousands of miles away, while cleanup efforts continued in Italy.

The use of a drone allowed researchers to not only study areas that were far too dangerous and unstable to access on foot, it also allowed the destruction to be captured from multiple angles, facilitating the creation of the 3D models back in the United States. It also meant the researchers weren’t in the way of rescue and cleanup teams trying to assist the local residents as quickly as possible.
The BYU team has already completed a 3D model of one of the areas hardest hit by the earthquake, and posted the results online which can be studied right in a browser. Eventually the team hopes the data and models will give engineers a better idea of how to design structures that can better withstand the forces of an earthquake of this caliber. But to also better predict where landslides, and other devastating side effects of an earthquake, might occur, and maybe even prevent them from happening the next time the ground starts shaking

We tend to think of coral reefs as luminous, undersea jungles that pepper the shallow, scuba-friendly tropics. But deeper down, in a region about as bright as Pluto on a sunny day, there lie vast reef ecosystems unknown to science.
Richard Pyle, a zoologist at the Bishop Museum, has spent the last twenty years surveying one of these landscapes—the so-called “twilight zone” coral beds that encircle the Hawaiian archipelago at depths of 30 to 150 meters (100 to 500 feet), where light is perpetually dim. His extensive findings are summarized today in the journal Peer J, in the most comprehensive  study of low-light coral reefs ever conducted. And they reveal a world far stranger and more complex than we imagined.
Using a range of high-tech gadgets and vehicles—ROVs and submersibles, drop-down cameras and environmental sensors—Pyle and his colleagues  have documented vast, poorly-lit areas of complete coral cover, spanning tens of square kilometers at depths of 90 meters (300 feet) or more off the islands of Maui and Kaua’i. Interspersed alongside these reefs are thick green “meadows,”  home to dozens of species of never-before-described algae. Both corals and algae require sunlight for photosynthesis, leading Pyle to suspect they can only exist here due to the exceptional clarity of Hawaii’s waters.


One of the most intriguing discoveries to come out of Pyle’s survey is that mesophytic reefs are hotbeds for endemic fish—species found nowhere else on Earth. While only 17 percent of fish species in Hawaii’s shallow reefs are unique to the archipelago, that number jumps to over 50 percent when you plunge below 70 meters.
“The extent of fish endemism on these deep coral reefs, particularly in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, is astonishing,” study co-author Randall Kosaki said in a statement. “We were able to document the highest rates of endemism of any marine environment on Earth.”


One theory is that these reefs represent a refuge, where numerous lineages have have survived for millions of years even as ice ages rework Earths’ surface over and over.
Perhaps most importantly, the study highlights highlights just how little we know about life in Earth’s  dark biosphere—which is a problem, because we can’t easily protect what we don’t understand. Then again, a couple of enormous new marine national monuments is a great start.

By combining archaeology with 3D computer modeling, European researchers have digitally reconstructed a house in Pompeii, showing how lavish and colorful these structures truly were before they were destroyed by a catastrophic volcanic eruption.
When we try to conjure images of the ancient city of Pompeii, we often think about the stark and tortured casts left over from one of Europe’s worst natural disasters. Over 1,000 people were killed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, destroying several Roman settlements. As a new 3D reconstruction from researchers at the University of Lind in Sweden reveals, this ancient civilization had an eye for architecture and interior design.

The reconstruction includes a large house that belonged to a wealthy man named Caecilius Lucundus.(Lund University)


From 2011 to 2012, Italian archaeologists excavated and scanned the remains of a well-preserved city district buried after the disaster. These findings were integrated with 3D modeling technology to show what life was like for the people of Pompeii just before the eruption.

The researchers managed to reveal floor surfaces, perform detailed studies of the building’s development over time, and investigate the remains of a tavern, a laundry, and a bakery. Other architectural discoveries included aqueducts, interior pools, intricately decorated alters, statues, and stunning skylights. Many of the original color schemes could also be inferred.


In one of the many gardens discovered , the researchers uncovered evidence of a lavish water fountain that was running at the time of the eruption—that it was still gushing when the rain of ash and pumice was falling over the city.
The reconstruction also shows the Pompeii Romans’ integration of plants and trees in their dwellings, and their masterful use of color (ancient Greeks had the same proclivity).


While watching this 3D reconstruction, it’s important to remember, however, that these decadent dwellings were the homes of Pompeii’s most affluent residents, and are not indicative of how most of Pompeii’s citizens—and slaves— actually lived. If anything, it’s like an ancient version of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.

During a recent survey of trees in the Queen’s garden at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, Scotland, botanists were shocked to discover the presence of two elms thought to be extinct for nearly a half century.
The two trees belong to a species known as the Wentworth elm, and scientists thought it had gone extinct last century on account of the Dutch elm disease epidemic.
Turns out they were wrong—but what a strange place for the last two remnants of this majestic breed to be located. It’s not as if these things are tiny saplings, or trees tucked away out of sight. They’re absolutely huge and are among the most photographed trees on the palace grounds.
“Such a discovery when the trees in question are just shy of 100 feet and in plain sight does sound rather odd,” admitted Max Max Coleman of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) in a release. Coleman identified the specimens after they were flagged as being unusual during a recent tree survey. The trees have a weeping-like appearance, and feature large glossy leaves.
Speaking to the BBC, Coleman speculated that the oversight could be blamed on the fact that these trees were never common in the first place. “If you pull your tree book off the shelf to try and look them up, you won’t find Wentworth elm listed in the books,” he said. Coleman also believes that few people these days are able to identify sub-species of elms because of how rare they are. He says that somewhere between 25 to 75 million elms across the UK were lost in the 1970s on account of Dutch Elm Disease.


Coleman attributes the survival of these two trees to a conservation effort invoked nearly 40 years ago.
“It is very likely the only reason these rare elms have survived is because Edinburgh City Council has been surveying and removing diseased elms since the 1980s,” he said. “Without that work many more of the thousands of elms in Edinburgh would have been lost. The success of this program may be partly demonstrated in the way two rare trees have been preserved.”
The queen’s botanists are now trying to figure out where these elms came from, but a preliminary investigation suggests they were introduced by the RBGE during the late 19th century. More importantly, they’re also looking into ways to preserve and propagate these last two remaining specimens.

NASA’s Curiosity rover has completed its survey of “Murray Buttes,” and is now set to venture even higher along the slopes of Mount Sharp. The intrepid rover took the opportunity to snap a selfie as it proudly stood in front of some rather dramatic Martian features.
This striking image, taken on September 17, 2016, is actually a composite of 60 individual pictures taken by the rover’s Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI). The camera and the arm are not included in the composite, which is why it looks as though a Martian inhabitant took the time to snap a pic of the four-wheeled exploratory vehicle.


The dark mesa in the background is called “M12,” and upper Mount Sharp can be seen at the top right. M12 stands about 23 feet (7 meters) above the base of the sloping rocks seen just behind the rover. For the past several weeks, Curiosity has been drilling and collecting rock powder samples in the region. Many of the pictures taken during this phase of the mission have been some of the best we’ve ever seen, revealing intricate eroded rock formations.

NASA’s Curiosity rover is currently exploring the “Murray Buttes” region of lower Mount Sharp,…
With the Murray Buttes region conquered, NASA scientists have set their sights to a destination that’ll require the rover to do some further climbing. Curiosity is scheduled to make a 1.5-mile (2.5-km) uphill trek where it will explore a ridge rich in iron-oxide-rich hematite. Beyond that, the rover will investigate an exposure of clay-rich bedrock.
Both of these areas likely originated from different environmental conditions, but the mission scientists are eager to see if either of them might have once hosted a habitable environment; both hematite and clay typically form in soggy conditions.


“We continue to reach higher and younger layers on Mount Sharp,” noted Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada in an agency release. “Even after four years of exploring near and on the mountain, it still has the potential to completely surprise us.”

In addition to the selfie, NASA has also released a stunning 360-degree interactive panorama. Using your mouse, you can manually steer Curiosity’s camera and investigate the barren Martian landscape.

The extremely dangerous Hurricane Matthew continues to barrel north, with the center of the storm expected to approach southwestern Haiti by later today. The National Hurricane Center’s latest bulletin calls Matthew “life threatening,” and forecasters are making dire predictions about the how much damage Caribbean nations might suffer.
Hurricane Matthew intensified rapidly on Friday, reaching Category 3, then 4, then 5 status in a matter of hours, and becoming the strongest Atlantic tropical storm since 2007. The hurricane has since cooled back off to a Category 4, which is to say, still a very dangerous cyclone packing 140 mph (220 kph) sustained winds with even stronger gusts. Parts of Jamaica are already being swamped by the storm, which was centered some 205 miles (330 km) south of Kingston as of 11 am ET.


Given Matthew’s current speed and track—moving northward at approximately 6 mph (9 kph)—tropical storm conditions are expected to reach Haiti by the afternoon, with full-on hurricane weather unleashing a torrent over the southwest coast later tonight. The storm is then predicted to gain speed, approaching eastern Cuba late tomorrow and the Bahamas by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. While some fluctuations in intensity may occur, the NHC advises that Matthew will likely remain a powerful, Category 4 hurricane through mid-week.
Matthew’s impact on the Caribbean is looking more severe by the hour, particularly in Haiti and the southwest Dominican Republic, where as much as 40 inches of rainfall could trigger “life threatening flash floods and mudslides.” Rip-roaring winds and “large and destructive waves” will add to the danger, especially along the southern coasts and Haiti and Cuba, where water levels could swell 11 feet above the high tide line.


“It’s undoubtedly Haiti,” Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters told Gizmodo when asked which nations are going to see the worst impacts. According to Masters, Haiti is particularly vulnerable due to environmental degradation, which has left the land stripped of trees and extremely prone to erosion. “The risk is Haiti is also greater due to poverty—you’ve got 50,000 people who have been living outdoors [since the 2010 earthquake].” he said.
The Bahamas are expected to get hammered hard by mid-week, with storm surges of up to 15 feet predicted in the latest NHC forecast. Impacts on the United States remain highly uncertain, but according to Masters, Florida, North Carolina, and New England could all see heavy rainfall. “Right now, the greatest risk is for North Carolina, but that could change,” he said. “The only thing we’re sure of as far as the US goes is that we’ll see a lot of pounding waves hitting the entire east coast.”
In the Caribbean, governments and international aid organizations are scrambling to make last-minute preparations. USA Today reports that the Haitian Civil Protection agency has opened 576 temporary shelters, while the US Agency for International Development has deployed disaster response teams to both Haiti and Jamaica. But with storm’s outer bands already drenching Jamaica, the south coast of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, time is running out. “Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,” the NHC said.

Brain-training programs like the ones offered by Luminosity and LearningRx claim to boost intelligence and even offset the effects of aging. A re-evaluation of the existing scientific literature on the matter shows these claims are complete bullshit.
A new study published in Psychological Science in the Public Interest concludes that brain-training games don’t work as advertized, a finding that could make life more difficult for companies that develop such programs. Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission fined Luminosity nearly $2 million for making false claims about the effectiveness of its product, and for failing to produce supporting science. This latest study represents another serious setback for the company and others with similar offerings.
Lumosity, which created a brain game powerhouse by telling people it could make them smarter, is…
Back in 2014, a consensus statement published by more than 70 scientists claimed that brain games “ do not provide a scientifically grounded way to improve cognitive functioning or to stave off cognitive decline.” Several months later, a group of 133 scientists put out their own statement, claiming that the scientific literature is filled with examples showing the benefits of brain training for a variety of cognitive tasks and everyday activities.


As University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign psychology professor Daniel Simons and his fellow researchers rightfully asked in the preface of the new study, “How could two teams of scientists examine the same literature and come to conflicting ‘consensus’ views about the effectiveness of brain training?”
To find out what’s going on, the researchers re-investigated the existing literature, pulling up over 130 published, peer-reviewed, scientific studies that are typically cited by brain-training companies. The researchers went through each paper, scrutinizing the evidence, and evaluating factors such as sample size and the presence of control groups. Very few of them passed these sniff tests.


“Based on our extensive review of the literature cited by brain-training companies in support of their claims, coupled with our review of related brain-training literatures that are not currently associated with a company or product, there does not yet appear to be sufficient evidence to justify the claim that brain training is an effective tool for enhancing real-world cognition,” conclude the authors in the study.
Not surprisingly, brain-training can improve performance on the particular task or puzzle that’s being trained for. But there was very little evidence to show that these brain-games extend beyond that. These programs simply don’t improve everyday cognitive performance.


“It’s disappointing that the evidence isn’t stronger,” noted Simons in an NPR article. “It would be really nice if you could play some games and have it radically change your cognitive abilities. But the studies don’t show that on objectively measured real-world outcomes.”
Keep that in mind the next time you’re tempted to click on one those ubiquitous Luminosity ads.

This year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Japan’s Yoshinori Ohsumi for furthering our understanding of autophagy, the biological process wherein the body eats some of itself in order to survive.
Ohsumi won the esteemed prize for his discoveries on how cells break down and recycle biological waste that accumulates in the body. This built-in garbage disposal system keeps the body healthy, but sometimes mutations occur, resulting in diseases such as Parkinson’s and cancer. At a press conference held earlier today, Ohsumi said he was surprised to receive the Nobel Prize, but was “extremely honored.”


Autophagy sounds like something we’d rather avoid, but without it, our bodies wouldn’t be able to degrade and recycle old, worn-out, and diseased cellular components. The term literally translates from the Greek term “self eating,” and it’s a concept that first emerged in cellular biology back in the 1960s. But it wasn’t until the work of Ohsumi in the 1990s and his groundbreaking experiments with yeast cells that scientists truly began to understand the mechanisms that drive the process.
Even though we’re alive, our bodies are constantly undergoing an auto-decomposition process, which can be understood as a kind of self-cannibalism. At the same time, however, our bodies are also going through periods of rejuvenation and growth. Autophagy works as a natural defense that allows the body to survive this decomposition process, clearing away old junk and making room for new, fresh cells. Ohsumi discovered critical genes and fundamental biological processes that drive autophagy.


This remarkable recycling process provides fuel for energy and the building blocks required to create new cellular components. Without autophagy, we’d never be able to respond and survive to starvation and other types of stress. For example, autophagy can destroy invading bacteria and viruses that infiltrate cells. Cells also use autophagy to get rid of damaged proteins and organelles—a kind of quality control mechanism that helps us counteract the effects of aging. Autophagy also plays a critical role during the initial stages of life, contributing to embryonic growth and cell differentiation.


But sometimes the process goes haywire, particularly in the event of a genetic mutation. This can result in Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes, and other age-related diseases. Ohsumi’s discoveries could lead to future treatments for some of these conditions.
Ohsumi was awarded eight million Swedish kronor (~$933,000) by Sweden’s Karolinska Institute for winning the prize. Prizes for physics, chemistry, and peace will be awarded later this week.

An ugly, dangerous storm is brewing out there. After a bout of rapid intensification last night, Hurricane Matthew has now achieved Category 3 status, packing 120 mph winds. It’s first major Caribbean hurricane since Sandy, and the strongest to develop in this particular region since 2008.
According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is expected to maintain its strength and possibly intensify further through the weekend as it rumbles toward Jamaica, reaching Hispaniola and eastern Cuba by early next week. Matthew currently sits a little over 400 miles southeast of Kingston and just 85 miles north of Colombia, where a tropical storm warning is in effect.


A hurricane watch may be issued for Jamaica as early as later today.
Where exactly the storm is headed next, and whether the US will see any impacts, is not yet clear. There’s a decent chance Matthew could pass Florida to the east. Or it hit the peninsula dead on, or track west into the Gulf of Mexico.


Hurricane Matthew has meteorologists all in a tizzy on social media, remarking on its impressive strength and sudden, dramatic intensification. You can be sure they’ll be paying close attention to the storm’s development throughout the weekend, and if you live in a potentially affected area, you should, too.





Update 4:19 PM: Meteorologists are speculating that Matthew might have already intensified into a Category 4 storm, although we’ll have to wait for the next NWS update to be sure.

Update 5:21 PM: Hurricane Matthew has officially been upgraded to a Category 4 storm.


Update 8:25 PM: Matthew is now teetering on Category 5 status, according to the latest NWS advisory, which describes the storm as “extremely dangerous” with 150 mph winds. Tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect for portions of Colombia, Venezuela, and Haiti. A hurricane watch is in effect for Jamaica, with rainfall totals of 10 to 15 inches expected across the nation.

A new microscope developed at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts is allowing scientists track the position and orientation of individual molecules in living cells. It has the potential to reveal unknown aspects of molecular behavior, including those that turn cells into agents of disease.
Dubbed the “instantaneous fluorescence polarization” microscope, this new tool is being used to understand how tiny molecules move and assemble inside live cells, including human skin cells. It reveals how individual molecules—which measure just a billionth of a meter across—wiggle around a live cell, bind together to form larger cellular structures, and drive a cell’s biological functions.

Left: Fluorescent particles move along actin filaments, which allow cells to contract, in a human skin cell. Right: Pink lines show the orientation of the actin filaments. (Credit: Shalin Mehta and Tomomi Tani).


As described in a new paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists were able to determine the orientation of single molecules, and watch how an assembly of molecules came together to form a higher-order structure.
“Cells rely on a wide variety of molecular arrangements for their function,” lead author Shalin Mehta of the MBL and the University of Chicago told Gizmodo. “For example, muscles contract along a specific orientation because of the alignment of molecules. This new microscope and algorithms let scientists see how individual molecules align and interact with each other in live cells, even though these assemblies are much finer than the resolution limit of the light microscope.”
Meha and his team were able to catch a glimpse of the microscopic particles by using polarized light, a property of light that’s not visible to the human eye. After labeling DNA and actin molecules with fluorescence, the researchers tracked the movements of these tiny particles in living human skin cells.


This microscope will improve our understanding of cellular function, and potentially explain why cells sometimes go haywire, such as when they turn cancerous.

Textbook illustrations and museum dioramas could soon be even more accurate in their depiction of the rich colors of long-extinct animals like dinosaurs. An international team of scientists  used advanced X-ray imaging techniques to map out elements related to pigmentation in modern birds of prey, which they will use to reconstruct the likely color patterns of fossil specimens.
Scientists at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and the United Kingdom’s Diamond Light Source teamed up with researchers from the University of Manchester on the experiments, described in a new paper in Scientific Reports.


The critical factor here is melanin, which determines variation in skin tone in humans and plays a big role in the coloring of mammals and birds. But little is known about its exact chemistry, according to lead author Nick Edwards of the University of Manchester, because the stuff is notoriously difficult to characterize via the usual methods.
That’s where the advanced X-ray imaging capabilities come in. “These techniques are non-destructive, so they don’t destroy the samples you are studying,” SLAC scientist and co-author Dimosthenis Sokaras told Gizmodo. “And with the rapid scan imaging we have developed at SLAC, we can analyze objects ranging from a few centimeters to tens of centimeters in size in a few hours.”
This latest work builds on earlier research from 2011, when SLAC scientists used x-ray imaging to examine the fossilized remains of two birds (Confuciusornis sanctus) that lived 120 million years ago. They found traces of the pigment eumelanin, responsible for the brown eyes and dark hair found in many modern species, including humans. It would have been one factor (among many) that determined the patterns of colors for those birds.


But eumelanin isn’t the only pigment of interest to the scientists. Pheomelanin also plays a role, notably in the production of reddish/yellow hues. At the time, the team just didn’t have sufficient data to conduct a similar examination focusing on pheomelanin.
Past studies have shown that pigmented tissues are richer in certain long-lived trace elements like zinc, calcium, and copper. So it made sense to target those elements in the new experiments. It also made sense to test this hypothesis in modern birds rather than ancient fossils, since the colors and pigmentation patterns are already known.
The team collected features from four species of birds of prey, shed naturally in sanctuaries: the Harris hawk, the red-tailed hawk, the kestrel, and the barn owl. Then they used X-ray fluorescent imaging to pinpoint concentrations of those key elements  in the feathers.
This in turn enabled researchers to distinguish between the two types of melanin in samples, because there were subtle differences in he concentrations between the two. For instance, the presence of zinc bonded to sulphur compounds indicates the feather has pheomelanin, so it should have a reddish/yellow hue.
Now the Manchester researchers plan to apply what they’ve learned about those trace metal concentrations to fossilized specimens like those ancient birds, or dinosaurs. Was T. Rex predominantly black or dark brown, or did its coloration fall more in the reddish/yellow range?


“A fundamental rule in geology is that the present is the key to the past,” geochemist and senior author Roy Wogelius said in a statement. “This work on modern animals  provides another chemical ‘key’ for helping us to accurately reconstruct the appearance of long extinct animals.”

An outbreak of E. coli that caused 10 million pounds of flour to be pulled from shelves is finally over. Yet, cases continue to pop up, and the CDC says it expects to see even more. Here’s why, even when the outbreak is over, the illness still isn’t.
The flour from General Mills was originally recalled back in May, after officials linked a string of E. coli cases dating back to the end of last year to the bags of flour. Even though they knew that the flour was somehow connected, it took almost another two months before the precise spot of contamination--a single factory in Kansas City, during only a week of production--was located. As of today, the CDC has finally declared the outbreak officially over.


However, even with the outbreak over, we’re still counting cases. There were at least 17 new cases after they found the source in the General Mills factory--and the agency says that new “illnesses are expected to continue for some time.”
The problem is really down to flour’s long shelf-life. A bag of flour can easily last in a cabinet for months. Compounding the problem is that people often transfer flour from the bag to a sturdier container and then toss the bag. It’s not uncommon for a canister to hold the remains of a couple different bags of flour or for people to be unsure about the brand of flour they even have.


This means that--even months after the initial outbreak--there are still lots of bags of E. coli-laced flour lurking in cabinets, just waiting to push the final illness tally of the outbreak a little bit higher. Perhaps now is a good time to check your own.
The evidence is mounting that our solar system is rife with oceans. Last week, scientists reported that Pluto could have an insanely deep liquid water swimming pool beneath its surface, and on Monday, NASA revealed new evidence for geyser activity on icy Europa. Now, another frozen moon is poised to join the club of outer space scuba retreats: Dione.
The fourth largest moon of Saturn, Dione was first imaged by the Voyager space probes in the 1980s, and has been viewed more recently by the Cassini spacecraft, during a series of five close flybys. It’s a beautiful, cratered ball of ice and rock, home to deep canyons and towering cliffs. While early flybys offered hints of geologic activity, there’s never been a smoking gun to prove Dione is alive inside—particularly when compared with its next-door neighbor (and orbital resonance partner) Enceladus, which is spewing seawater out of enormous geysers.
But a new study, which has been accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, suggests we may have underestimated Dione. The moon could have a liquid water ocean beneath its surface, just like Enceladus. Using a geophysical model that depicts a crust ‘floating’ atop a mantle, Mikael Beuthe of the Royal Observatory of Belgium shows that gravity data collected by Cassini can be explained by a ~100 kilometer (62 mile)-thick shell of ice enveloping a 65 kilometer (40 mile)-deep ocean. Dione’s ocean, in turn, would smother a rocky core.


The first evidence for a subsurface ocean on Enceladus also came from gravity anomalies detected by Cassini, in a series of flybys between 2010 and 2012. As the spacecraft zipped past the moon, its velocity was slightly altered due to variations in Enceladus’ gravitational field. That change in velocity was measured from Earth via the Doppler effect—a shift in the radio frequency of Cassini’s transmissions.
In 2014, researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory concluded that Cassini’s radio transmissions were hinting at a south polar sea beneath Enceladus’ icy shell. But a year later, independent measurements of Enceladus’ “libration”—a slight wobble as it orbits Saturn—revealed that the ocean is probably global.
“For Dione, we did a similar gravity-topography analysis as was done for Enceladus in 2014, but with improved techniques,” Beuthe told Gizmodo. “Thus that’s the best evidence we have now for a present-day ocean on Dione.”
According to Beuthe, we won’t be able to confirm Dione’s ocean with libration measurements the way we did for Enceladus, both because Dione is more spherical and because its crust is thicker. But there are other reasons to suspect this moon’s ocean is the real deal.


For one, gravity data also tells us Dione has a rocky core, spanning approximately 70 percent of its total radius. As radioactive elements decay within the core, they produce heat, melting the overlying ice. This almost certainly caused a subsurface ocean to form in Dione’s early history—which, by the way, might not have been too long ago.
“We don’t yet know whether the ocean froze or not afterwards,” Beuthe said. “But freezing would cause global expansion which should be seen in a certain type of cracks [which have] not been observed on the surface.”
Icy cliffs and smooth terrains also hint at recent geologic activity, which again, is difficult to explain if Dione is simply a ball of ice frozen to rock. Detection of geysers, similar to those seen on Enceladus and Europa, would really seal the deal for an ocean on Dione. But we haven’t seen geysers yet, and given the estimated thickness of Dione’s crust, Beuthe isn’t so sure we will.
To confirm the ocean, he says, “we need a new mission, which won’t happen for a long time.”
If Beuthe’s hunch about Dione is correct, the astrobiology implications are thrilling. It’s likely the ocean would have been around for the moon’s entire existence, long enough for microbial life to emerge under the right conditions. Another mind boggling thought: perhaps Dione and Enceladus have been exchanging alien microbes for hundreds of millions of years.


If one thing is becoming clear, it’s that oceans are not so unusual or special in our cosmic backyard. Does that mean life isn’t, either? We’ll need to keep exploring to find out.
Have you heard? The Black Moon rises tonight! But if you’re worried about catching this “rare” phenomenon don’t be—it’s actually not that special.
A Black Moon is not an actual astronomy term and there’s a couple different definitions floating around out there. The Black Moon that people are talking about now is defined as when two new moons—the phase of the moon where it appears invisible in Earth’s sky—happen in a single calendar month. This is the first time in over two years that’s happened.


While it’s technically true that it’s rare, it isn’t all that meaningful. The new moon pops up approximately every 29.5 days and September’s cluster of two is no exception. The two new moons in September aren’t really any closer together than any other new moons this year—it’s simply that the first one happened to fall on the very first day of September and the last one on the last day of September. The gap between the two is still practically identical to the gap between the July 4th and August 2nd new moons, or the coming November 29 and December 29 new moons, or any of the other 13 new moons this year.
Getting excited about two new moons popping up together in the month of September is a little like telling everyone to celebrate your birthday extra hard this year because it won’t fall on a Tuesday again for another two years. It’s not factually wrong that it’s rare, exactly, it’s just a very weird and not very meaningful coincidence of the calendar to get excited about.


Does that mean you shouldn’t bother to look up tonight? Not quite, a new moon is always a good opportunity to see the sky at its darkest without moonlight drowning out any constellations or planets you may want to catch a glimpse of. But, if you do happen to miss it or the sky is covered in clouds, don’t fret. The exact same opportunity will pop-up again literally about every 30 days, over and over and over again.
A stunning photograph taken from the ALMA observatory in Chile shows a young star surrounded by a large disk of gas and dust. Like our very own Milky Way, this protoplanetary disk exhibits a spiral structure—a feature that could solve a lingering mystery about how planets start to form.
This baby star is called Elias 2-27, and it’s located about 450 light-years from Earth. Those spiral arms that you see in the photo extend more than 6 billion miles (10 billion kilometers) away from the center of the system, which is further away than our sun is to the Kuiper Belt. Scientists have seen this galaxy-like feature before, but never at the circumstellar disk midplane—the region where planet formation takes place. The details of this unprecedented observation now appear in Science AAAS.
The presence of these spiral arms comes as a relief to astronomers. Planets form in the disks of gas and dust around newborn stars, but it’s not clear how these tiny particles grow into objects as large as Saturn and Jupiter. When the protoplanetary disk is smooth and even, objects can only grow in a cumulative fashion as particles continually collide and clump together. Trouble is, when these bodies get a couple of feet across in width, the drag created by the surrounding gas makes them migrate towards the star. This process only takes about 1,000 years, but larger timescales are required to build considerably bigger objects, and eventually planets.


Spiral arms could actually solve this conundrum. Their presence in the circumstellar disk—and the gravitational influence they exert—could disrupt the otherwise uniform composition of the disk. In regions with increased particle density, planet formation can move at a faster pace. The regions of uneven gravitational pull creates more confined space, making collisions of grains or rocks more likely. Writing in a press release, lead author Laura M. Pérez from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy described it this way:
The observed spirals in Elias 2-27 are the first direct evidence for the shocks of spiral density waves in a protoplanetary disk. They show that density instabilities are possible within the disk, which can eventually lead to strong disk inhomogeneities and further planet formation.
These sorts of instabilities aren’t specific to planet formation. Indeed, the best examples are the density waves in disk galaxies, which produces the spectacular arms of spiral galaxies.


The presence of these arms in a circumstellar disk may help explain the formation of planets, but the next mystery to solve is the presence of the spirals themselves, and how they come to exist. A possible explanation is that a planet had already formed, but that presents a chicken-and-egg scenario. As the authors of the study themselves admit, more observations are needed.

After two years of science, the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission ended today in a gentle crash-landing. But if you haven’t been tracking this spacecraft’s movements as obsessively as we have, you might be wracking your brain this morning trying to remember what the Rosetta mission was.
It’s okay—we’re here to help. To start, you should watch this adorable new send-off movie just released by the ESA, which gives you a sense of tone the mission team has tried to cultivate throughout Rosetta’s journey. (Cutesy and anthropomorphizing? Unabashedly so. Space is still innocent.)

You can follow it up with some of our extensive coverage—links below.

The historic Rosetta mission has finally come to an end. Over the past two years, the probe’s many instruments have scanned virtually every nook and cranny of this weirdly shaped rock, unleashing a treasure trove of new information about comets in general, and 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in particular.
When Halley’s Comet paid us a visit back in 1986, the European Space Agency’s Giotto spacecraft was sent to explore the incoming ball of ice and dirt. By the time the mission was over, it became glaringly obvious that if we were ever going to learn anything about comets, we’re going to have to get a bit closer. Like, a lot closer.
So the ESA began to brainstorm a number of concepts, but the one that eventually came to fruition was the Rosetta Mission. Among the project’s many lofty goals, the mission planners sought to put a space probe in orbit around Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, or simply 67P, and then to have it fly alongside the celestial object as it made its way around the sun.


In addition to being equipped with a diverse set of measuring instruments and cameras, Rosetta was also supplied with the Philae Lander—a probe within a probe that was to land on the comet itself.
Launched on March 2, 2004, the Rosetta probe began to make its way towards the comet, passing by Mars and several large asteroids along the way. Several weeks after its launch, Rosetta used its dual imaging camera to take its first picture of the comet.


As the probe got closer, mission scientists were shocked to discover that the comet was...well...really weird. Known as a two-fold comet, it bore a startling resemblance to a rubber ducky. Follow-up studies showed that the comet merged from two separate objects.
Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P on August 6, 2014, and a flood of amazing pics soon followed. Taken from a distance of just 80 miles (130 kilometers), the first close-up images ever taken of a comet revealed boulders, craters, and steep cliffs—including an epic 3,280-foot cliff that would rival anything found on Earth.


On November 12, 2014, the Philae Lander began its slow descent towards the comet, but things didn’t go exactly as planned. Instead of securing itself to the surface with its harpoon-fired grappling hooks, Philae bounced several times, and eventually settled within a shadowed crevice.
Unable to draw solar energy from the sun, Philae went into hibernation mode. It awoke briefly a few months later, but was eventually declared dead. The lander was finally discovered on September 5, 2016.


It wasn’t exactly what the mission planners had hoped for, but the experience still managed to produce some meaningful data.
As Philae made its harrowing journey across the surface of the comet, its onboard sensors were busy collecting important data. Based on the lander’s initial contact with the comet, the researchers learned that the surface, at least at the landing site, was comprised of a soft, mushy layer about a foot thick.
Below this granular layer of regolith was a surprisingly solid layer of rock. The hardness of this layer may explain why only one of Philae’s legs was able to anchor itself to this lower surface level. Data from Philae suggests that the upper layers of the comet’s surface consist of dust that’s about 4-8 inches (10 to 20 cm) thick.


And Rosetta isn’t solid all the way through. It is filled with a surprising amount of dust. Studies of the comet’s gravitational pull suggests that its interior is not filled with caverns and tunnels, but is relatively consistent throughout.
As the data streamed in from Rosetta and Philae, scientists sought to make sense of it all. In late January 2015, a batch of preliminary findings were published in the journal Science. Among the many surprising discoveries, scientists observed ripples and dunes on the comet’s surface, which was completely unexpected given that the comet lacks an atmosphere (and therefore wind) and experiences very little gravity.
To explain the phenomenon, scientists speculated that jets of gas and dust were substituting for wind, and the particles were bound together by the van der Waals force (weak, short-ranged electrostatic forces between uncharged molecules) instead of gravity.


Mission scientists also began to paint a picture of the comet’s chemical composition. Using the Rosetta Orbiter Sensor for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA), the scientists detected water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and methanol. But the chemical cocktail didn’t stop there; ROSINA also sniffed out formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon disulfide.


Taken together, it became clear that this comet really stinks. Here’s how a mission scientist described its foul stench:
The perfume of 67P/C-G is quite strong, with the odour of rotten eggs (hydrogen sulphide), horse stable (ammonia), and the pungent, suffocating odour of formaldehyde. This is mixed with the faint, bitter, almond-like aroma of hydrogen cyanide. Add some whiff of alcohol (methanol) to this mixture, paired with the vinegar-like aroma of sulphur dioxide and a hint of the sweet aromatic scent of carbon disulphide, and you arrive at the ‘perfume’ of our comet.
Not only does the comet have a smell, it apparently also has a characteristic noise. Here’s what the “singing” comet sounds like.


And then there were the mysterious balancing boulders.
Using the OSIRIS camera aboard Rosetta, scientists caught a glimpse of a strange formation of what appeared to be three boulders balanced in an extremely precarious position on the comet surface. Similar objects appear on Earth, the result of erosion or glacial measures, but how “this apparent balancing rock on Comet 67P/C-G was formed is not clear at this point,” noted OSIRIS Principal Investigator Holger Sierks soon after the discovery.


One theory is that cometary activity caused the boulders to move from one location to another, a process that would indicate evolving exo-geological processes on the comet. Another possibility is that the rocks weren’t actually balancing, and that the shadows were playing tricks with the researchers.
Thanks to Philae, we also learned that organic molecules exist on the comet—though not necessarily the kind that can deliver the chemical prerequisites for life. Organic molecules, i.e. molecules with one or more carbon atoms within it, are abundant in the cosmos, so this discovery wasn’t all that revealing. That said, a study put out earlier this month shows that complex organic molecules—the kind that form the basis of our biology—exists in the dust around the comet. This bolsters the argument that the basic building blocks of ice may have been delivered to Earth via icy space rocks.
Comets like 67P may have peppered Earth with the building blocks of life, but they likely didn’t bring water to our planet, according to scientists who analyzed the quantity and quality of water vapor streaming from the comet. Simply put, the kind of water found on the comet doesn’t match the kind of water found on Earth. The water on the comet features a different chemical composition. This suggests that asteroids, and not comets, were the primary delivery mechanism of water to our planet.
In the months that followed Rosetta’s arrival, the surface largely remained static, but things had changed by the midpoint of 2015. A number of land features disappeared, while others suddenly popped up from nowhere. The scientists weren’t sure about the cause, but they said it might have been the result of weak surface materials, which allowed for rapid erosion.


As the comet approached its perihelion (its closest approach to the sun before heading back towards the outer solar system), it started to come alive.
Images taken in August 2015 showed jets sprouting from the comet’s surface, spewing 60 to 260 tons of cometary dust with a single shot. For the first time ever, scientists had an opportunity to witness ice as it sublimated and exploded in the form of these dramatic dust-loaded jets. Meanwhile, chunks of ice ranging from a few feet to 130 feet (1-40 meters) in diameter were thrown into space. As the intense radiation from the sun bombarded the comet, fractures splintered across its tortured surface.
Follow up studies showed that these weird eruptions happened on the edge between one geographic feature and another, and at dawn when the sun re-appeared (the comet is clearly not a morning person).


Another surprising discovery was the presence of actual weather on the comet—an unexpected phenomenon given that this rock has no atmosphere to speak of. It’s driven by the comet’s intense day-night cycle. Ice patches on the surface transform into a cloud of water vapor when the sun rises, growing again when its “neck” (the thin mid-section of the comet connecting the two lobes) rotates into darkness. This vapor is lost to space, but the discovery suggests that the comet’s surface ice, some of which is just beneath the surface, is replenished from below, probably through fissures that expand during the day.
Another shock came in October 2015, when scientists detected traces of molecular oxygen, something that had never been seen before in a comet’s coma (the cloud of dust and gas surrounding a comet). This free-floating oxygen shouldn’t have been there, prompting the scientist to speculate that the comet has an interior source of molecular oxygen to replenish the diminishing molecules on the outside. In fact, the comet may be bleeding oxygen that’s older than the sun.


Even as Rosetta made its final death plunge onto the surface of the comet, mission scientists were busy collecting data. Its final resting place—named Ma’at after the ancient Egyptian goddess of harmony, balance, and order—is a region strewn with boulders and treacherous sinkholes. By exploring this area in detail, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of how comets form.
Rosetta may be dead, and the exploratory part of the mission may be over, but there’s still plenty of work to be done, and many mysteries yet to be solved.
At 6:39 am EDT today, a spacecraft weighing over 2,000 kilograms (4,400 pounds) with a wingspan half that of a Boeing 747 crashed gently into a comet’s surface, following 13 hours of free-fall. These, my friends, are the last, fleeting glimpses of Comet 67P that Rosetta managed to capture before its instruments went dead.
They’re also some of the best photos humans have ever taken of the surface of a comet, period. So enjoy them—because we won’t get another mission like this for a long time.
On Rosetta’s blog this morning, the ESA also posted a series of screenshots showing the signal from the spacecraft fading into white noise at around 7:19 am EDT (it takes 40 minutes for communications to travel from Comet 67P to the Earth). No doubt, these images will come in handy when Rosetta truthers start insisting the comet landing was faked.
Fare thee well, Rosetta. Your watch is over.


Did Donald Trump happen to lose one of his signature hairpieces in the Amazonian wilds of Peru? Wildlife photographer Jeff Cremer snapped this image of a caterpillar sporting the Republican candidate’s signature bright orange-yellow tufts of hair while on a scouting expedition in Peru.
“I was putting on my boots and someone said, ‘Hey, check out this caterpillar hanging out,’” Cremer recalled. “Sure enough, it was Donald Trump’s hair hanging on a branch.” He’s dubbed it the “Trumpapillar.”


The locals in the Peruvian Amazon call the critter ovejillo (“little sheep” in Spanish), but its full name is Megalopyge opercularis, or colloquially, the flannel moth caterpillar. It’s tiny, just 2.5 inches long, and its fluffy tufts can be red, white, or pink, as well as that Trump-tastic Day-Glo yellow.

But don’t let that adorable fluffy exterior fool you into thinking it’s harmless. The flannel moth caterpillar is actually venomous, and the hairs have very sharp, hollow spines, akin to a hypodermic needle, the better to puncture your skin and deliver a powerful dose of poisonous toxin. Yep, just like tarantulas, which at least have the decency to look scary. They can break off and lodge in your skin, too. The result, according to Cremer, is bright red welts and rather excruciating pain.


There’s some kind of metaphor in there, maybe.

After a twelve year journey in space, the Rosetta spacecraft has less than 24 hours of life left before it crashes straight into the comet it has been orbiting. Today at 3 p.m., Rosetta team scientist Paul Weissman will be here taking your questions live.
Rosetta was originally launched by the ESA back in 2004. It was only after a journey of ten years that it finally arrived at Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko and attempted a daring touchdown by the spacecraft’s accompanying lander, Philae. Some unexpected bounces meant that Philae was almost lost in space—but it managed to hang on and send back data before powering down. Now, as Rosetta prepares to join it on the surface of Comet 67P—this time, though, with a crash—ESA scientists are looking at the end of a more than decades-long mission that has revealed more about comets than perhaps any other mission.


In addition to his work as an interdisciplinary scientist for ESA’s Rosetta team, Weissman is also a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Pasadena, California, where he focuses on the evolution of comets. He’ll be joining us here live at 3 p.m. EDT to answer your questions. So start dropping your questions—about comets, the final images we’ll see as Rosetta prepares to die, the bouncing Philae lander and anything else you want to know—right now.
Update 3:20 p.m.: We’re having a little technical difficulty, but Paul is standing by and will be answering your questions shortly.


Update 5:10 p.m.: And the Q&A has now wrapped up. Thanks again to Paul for joining us and to everyone who asked a question.
The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G, a medical device that monitors a diabetic’s sugar levels, and then automatically injects the required dose of insulin.
This first-of-its kind automated insulin delivery system was approved for people over the age of 14 who have type 1 diabetes, and it’s poised to make life considerably easier for the millions of Americans who suffer from this condition.
People with type 1 diabetes can’t produce enough insulin, a hormone that regulates the amount of glucose, or sugar, in our blood. So they must replenish their insulin stock either with multiple daily injections, or by pumping insulin through a tiny catheter. Unlike these manual techniques, Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G is a “hybrid closed system,” meaning it autonomously tracks glucose levels about every five minutes or so, and then adjusts insulin levels with little or no input from the user.


“[MiniMed 670G] can provide people with type 1 diabetes greater freedom to live their lives without having to consistently and manually monitor baseline glucose levels and administer insulin,” the FDA’s Jeffrey Shuren said in a release.
MiniMed 670G includes a sensor that attaches to the body to measure glucose levels under the skin, an insulin pump that’s strapped to the body, and a catheter that delivers the insulin. The insulin delivery site needs to be changed about twice a week.
The device has been referred to as an “artificial pancreas,” but that’s probably not the best description. The device is not an internal organ, and it’s not completely autonomous. People with type 1 diabetes still need to track their carbohydrate intake, and then enter that information into the system.


The FDA approved Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G following a successful clinical trial that included 123 participants with type 1 diabetes. During the course of the three-month trial, no serious or adverse effects—such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia (low glucose levels—were reported.
Medtronic, a medical tech firm based in Dublin, Ireland, says the device will be made available to the public in the spring of 2017. Looking ahead, the company plans to refine and further test the device in the hope that children under of the age of 14 can also use it.

File this under bad news for humanity’s climate ambitions: The dams and reservoirs we use to harness ‘clean’ hydroelectric power and irrigate our crops apparently emit carbon. A lot of it. All told, man-made reservoirs release roughly a gigaton of heat-trapping greenhouse gases each year. That’s more than the entire nation of Canada.
Scientists interested in quantifying humanity’s carbon footprint have been on the trail of man-made reservoirs since the early 2000s. Most studies to date have focused on a single type of reservoir—those used for electricity production, for instance—and just one or two greenhouse gases. Now, researchers at Washington State University have synthesized prior research to examine a wide variety of reservoirs and heat-trapping molecules. Their analysis, which appears next week in Bioscience, comes to a disturbing conclusion.


All told, reservoirs used for everything from power to flood control to irrigation account for roughly 1.3 percent of our global carbon footprint, much higher than previous estimates. The main culprit, according to the study, is methane.
“We had a sense that methane might be pretty important but we were surprised that it was as important as it was,” lead study author Bridget Deemer said in a statement. “It’s contributing right around 80 percent of the total global warming impact of all those gases from reservoirs.”


Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with 84 times the global warming potential of CO2. The reason reservoirs are such hotbeds for the stuff has to do with how they are made. When carbon-rich soils are inundated, they quickly run out of oxygen, promoting the growth of microorganisms that respire CO2 and produce methane as a byproduct. This is the same reason swamps often smell like a giant fart: they are literally filled with billions of tiny methane factories.


“We found that the estimates of methane emissions per area of reservoir are about 25 percent higher than previously thought, which we think is significant given the global boom in dam construction, which is currently underway,” Deemer told the Washington Post.
In a sense, the timing of the discovery is fortuitous, given that world leaders are on the verge of ratifying a treaty that would begin the process of decarbonizing the global economy. With one more piece of the carbon budget accounted for, we can make better decisions about how to reduce our greenhouse footprint.
The solution, of course, will not be to abolish reservoirs, but to take their carbon emissions into consideration and make more aggressive cuts where we can. Clearly, the task ahead is going to be even more challenging than we thought.

Regulators in the state of Illinois have suspended a Chicago doctor who allegedly gave patients vaccinations containing cat saliva and vodka.
The Chicago Tribune reports that the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation took the action against Dr. Ming Te Lin after hearing complaints from healthcare providers that children were being administered unapproved oral versions of childhood shots developed by the doctor.


Investigators who visited Lin’s office discovered a cluttered, unsterile office, and a “box filled with vials and tubes that [Lin] was using to make his own vaccinations.” Lin admitted to the investigators that he’s been making his own “alternative” vaccinations for over a decade—a revelation that must come as a shock to some parents. Children as young as a seven-day-old infant received the unapproved oral vaccines.
To create his custom brew, Lin added alcohol in the form of vodka. And for children with allergies, he would add cat saliva gathered by a cotton swab. Lin administered the modified vaccinations orally or in nasal form.


He also used a device called the Wavefront 2000 to detoxify vaccinations from mercury. The contraption is based entirely on pseudoscientific principles. It’s described by the manufacturer as, “an electronic device that detects the unique, subtle electro-magnetic frequency information of any substance placed in its input well and imprints the signal into a carrier fluid placed in the output well. The signal can be inverted to form an anti-allergen remedy.”


State officials are accusing Lin of signing state forms certifying that he had given children conventional, state-approved immunizations, and of failing to inform his patients of the risks associated with not following vaccine guidelines. Needless to say, none of the methods adopted by Lin are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Line will attend a hearing before the Medical Disciplinary Board on October 11 in Chicago.
It’s not immediately clear if Lin was a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner or a homeopath (Lin is not returning anyone’s calls at the moment). As noted at Doubtful News, he graduated from the Medical College of Taiwan, and was certified by the American Board of Pediatrics and the American Board of Allergy and Immunology. What’s more, he’s got some glowing reviews at Vitals.com, but clearly from patients who subscribe to the doctor’s homeopathic “natural” remedies.
For some of Lins’ patients, these recent allegations may come as a shock—but not necessarily because they felt he was doing anything wrong.

This week Elon Musk announced plans to plans to build a “self-sustaining city” on Mars. It’s a thrilling notion, although folks were quick to point out not just the technical challenges of accomplishing such a feat, but also the tremendous cost. Even living on the Moon for a year would be pretty pricey, as a new video makes clear.
Produced by Wendover Productions, the narrator runs through an itemized list of everything you’d need to send just four astronauts to the Moon for the year: notably, transportation there and back, lunar landers, housing, greenhouses to grow food (let’s hope those astronauts love sweet potatoes), water, and power. The grand total: $36 billion, or $98 million per day.

Granted, that’s assuming old Saturn V rockets. If Space X and other commercial rocket companies keep making progress in developing reusable rockets (rather than blowing them up), that could bring the cost down substantially some day.

Dr. John Zhang of Manhattan’s New Hope Fertility Center has long performed miracles for fertility-challenged couples. In a typical year, his futuristic-looking clinic (its sleek all white-interior looks like something out of a 2001: A Space Odyssey-themed spa) oversees hundreds of births.
Zhang is responsible for creating the world’s first three-parent infant—a baby produced by combining a father’s sperm, a mother’s egg, and a donor egg.


The birth of the baby, formally announced this week in New Scientist, is a big deal in fertility circles. The technology Zhang employed to produce the three-parent baby not only provides a source of hope for couples looking to avoid passing deadly genetic disorders on to their offspring, but also, Zhang says, potentially ushers in an era in which more and more women in their 40s and 50s will be able to have their own biological children. Researchers additionally speculate the technology lays the groundwork for the possibility that same-sex male partners may one day be able to have biological children of their own.
The three-parent baby—a boy—was born at a Manhattan hospital in April to a couple who had worked for 20 years to start a family. The mother, from Jordan, is a carrier of Leigh Syndrome, which is likely to affect a baby’s developing nervous system. She and her husband lost two infants to the disorder, and miscarried four more, which is why she sought Zhang’s help.


New Scientist reports that a method of three-parent reproduction called “pronuclear transfer” is already approved in the UK:
[It] involves fertilising both the mother’s egg and a donor egg with the father’s sperm. Before the fertilised eggs start dividing into early-stage embryos, each nucleus is removed. The nucleus from the donor’s fertilised egg is discarded and replaced by that from the mother’s fertilised egg.
Because the couple is Muslim and didn’t want to destroy two embryos, Zhang and his team used a different method—they removed the cellular nucleus of the mother’s egg and inserted it into a disease-free donor egg which had already had its nucleus removed. Working in Mexico, the team then fertilized the new combination egg with the father’s sperm.


The procedure, Zhang said in an interview with Jezebel, essentially replaced the corrupted “egg white” of the birth mother with the healthy “egg white,” or mitochondria, of the egg donor, without altering the nucleus, or the “egg yolk” of the biological mother, which contains most of the genetic information responsible for determining a baby’s traits. According to New Scientist, five eggs were prepared using the new technology but only one was deemed suitable to fertilize.
“This is considered one of the latest and biggest breakthroughs in the IVF [in vitro fertilization] world,” Zhang told Jezebel. “The first breakthrough in the world of IVF was the development of IVF itself, the second was the development of embryo freezing, the third is PGD, or genetic testing of embryos (where embryos are biopsied prior to transfer to determine whether they are healthy). And number four is ICSI, which enhances the ability of sperm (particularly in older fathers) to fertilize an egg.”


“This is number five,” Zhang said of the three-parent baby. “The principle we are applying is very different.”
Zhang chose to perform the controversial procedure in Mexico because the U.S. doesn’t currently authorize such reproductive methods, having deemed them potentially unsafe. After a successful embryo transfer, the couple later returned to New York, where a beaming Zhang was on hand in the delivery room, when the baby was delivered by Caesarean section this spring. The baby is being monitored closely.
“We still have a long way to go to follow up with the patient closely to ensure the safety of the procedure,” he said. But so far there are no signs of illness.
The parents, Zhang says, are overwhelmed by the media attention that the birth of their son has created and Zhang says it is now his mission to protect the privacy of the family as best he can.


“This is a very neat technique and it’s amazing and we still can’t believe we made it,” he said.


Zhang says he shies away from using the term “three parent baby” to describe the newborn, arguing that the term, while he says is “sexy” to the media, perhaps places too much emphasis on the role of the egg donor.
“A parent is someone who educates and molds a child,” he continued. “It’s a matter of opinion, but I think it’s the two parents who are raising the child who should be called parents.”


Zhang had intended to wait until late October to announce news of the three-parent baby’s arrival at a meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Salt Lake City, but on Tuesday, New Scientist broke news of Zhang’s paper which documented the birth.
Within hours, Zhang was inundated with media requests from around the world, ranging from Nature to the New York Post. Long after his office had closed Tuesday evening, Zhang—who went to medical school in China and has been pioneering IVF techniques for more than two decades—was fielding calls from the BBC as he struggled to go over patient charts.
Zhang says he is cautiously optimistic about this first “miracle” baby and what he says it could mean for infertile couples. He says it’s not inconceivable to think that three-parent babies could eventually become an offering at the nation’s leading IVF clinics.


But he says there is much more research and testing to do. The procedure won’t be regularly available to most families in the U.S. until it has undergone clinical trials to make sure it does not harm a pregnant woman and that a baby can be born safely.
Unsurprisingly, the procedure is attracting its fair share of controversy. Critics worry it continues the ongoing trend towards ‘designer’ babies, and pro-life advocates fear the procedure will result in the disposal of a growing number of fertilized embryos.
Zhang’s success is, of course, not without precedent: A U.S. based doctor, Jacques Cohen, developed a previous three-parent fertility method in the 1990s, according to the BBC, creating 17 babies using the technique. But some of the fetuses resulting from the technique were missing X chromosomes and at least one child showed signs of a development disorder, prompting the FDA to ask clinics to stop using the technique.


Still, Zhang’s development of the new three-parent-baby technology is exciting for fertility-challenged women, particularly those ages 35 and over. The leading cause of miscarriage among women of advanced maternal age is ‘aging’ eggs, in which the mitochondria is corrupted. But Zhang’s method—replacing a woman’s mitochondria with donor mitochondria—solves that problem, meaning more and more women in their 40s and 50s will potentially be able to have biological children of their own.
The new technology, as also previously mentioned, could also hold potential for same-sex couples hoping to reproduce. Using donor egg mitochondria, scientists have been able to produce offspring in mice, parented by two males, although it remains to be seen whether that can be replicated in humans.


How soon could we see the first three-parent baby produced by two male humans, with the help of a donor egg’s mitochondria?


Zhang won’t put a timeline on it. What he will say is this: “Whether it can happen with humans, you have to leave it to your imagination.”

The United Nations just announced a date for its first ever mission to space—and it’s pretty soon.
The U.N. intends to send Sierra Nevada’s Dream Chaser spacecraft, which is currently still in its testing-phase, into a 2-week, low-Earth orbit flight in 2021. Sierra Nevada signed on to partner with the UN in June, but the target date for launch was announced yesterday during a session of the International Astronautical Congress—where Elon Musk also detailed his long-game for sending a whole bunch of humans to Mars.


Exactly what the mission will accomplish remains vague. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs says that any member nation can submit a proposal for a possible payload for the flight, although it’s primarily geared towards countries with no space program of their own.
Before we get too excited about another spacecraft heading up, however, there’s still the big question of where the money to launch would come from. The countries whose payloads were selected would pay something for the flight. But UNOOSA also says it’s still looking for “major sponsors” who would be responsible for much of the overall mission cost, with no assurance that it will find them. If that money does come through, though, the first UN space mission will launch just five years from now.

Typhoons are generally associated with mass destruction, but a Japanese engineer has developed a wind turbine that can harness the tremendous power of these storms and turn it into useful energy. If he’s right, a single typhoon could power Japan for 50 years.
Atsushi Shimizu is the inventor of the world’s first typhoon turbine—an extremely durable, eggbeater-shaped device that can not only withstand the awesome forces generated by a typhoon, it can convert all that power into useable energy. Shimizu’s calculations show that a sufficiently large array of his turbines could capture enough energy from a single typhoon to power Japan for 50 years.


Given that Japan is currently dealing with an energy shortage—a problem incited by the 2011 Fukushima disaster—this comes as a very welcome solution. As Shimizu told CNN, “Japan actually has a lot more wind power than it does solar power, it’s just not utilized.”
Shimizu is not wrong. Japan has already seen six typhoons this year. Shimizu, the founder of green tech firm Challenergy, believes that Japan has the potential to become “a superpower of wind.”
The typhoon turbine differs from conventional turbines in two important ways. It works on an omnidirectional axis that allows the machine to survive unpredictable wind patterns, and the speed of the blades can be adjusted to ensure they don’t spin out of control during a storm.


Tests of a prototype yielded 30 percent efficiency, which is 10 percent lower than propeller-based turbines. The difference, of course, is that Shimizu’s turbines can actually survive a storm. Back in 2013, Typhoon Usagi destroyed eight conventional turbines, while damaging eight.
A functional prototype was installed near Okinawa earlier this summer, and the next big step is to test the device under high-wind conditions. All that’s needed now is a typhoon.
It’s not immediately clear where all the incoming energy will be channeled, whether it be sent straight to the grid or stored in large batteries (Tesla’s large battery backup comes to mind). We’ve contacted the company to learn more.

Scientists have been working on materials that change shape for a while now. But as New Scientist points out, these metamorphoses usually require external stimuli to get going—until now. New research published in Nature Communications shows that some non-living substances can be made to transform all on their own.
The secret to these remarkably lifelike polymers is that they employ two different kinds of bonds—some don’t move at all while others break and rearrange themselves. This allows for variability in the shape, as well as the speed at which it morphs. And the transformations can either be one-way or fully reversible!


This flower is the most complex of the polymer creations the team of researchers made, and they had to employ a few tricks to make it look so lifelike. Rather than create a single convoluted structure, each petal was programmed individually to maintain the illusion of legitimate plant growth. The whole thing was also given a coating that dissolved in water, which acted as a sort of time release.
Who cares about a self-blooming plastic flower? The applications for this technology go well beyond fancy tricks. Mainly the shape-changing polymers are being considered for biomedical applications, like implants that would start off small when inserted and expand to their true size once inside a patient. Scientists working on the project are even finding workarounds to allow the polymer transformation to pause, accelerate, or decelerate.

Do you think you know what “healthy” food means? Then the FDA would like to hear from you.
The FDA just requested public input on the meaning of the word “healthy,” the first step towards a new definition. The agency first announced it would be revamping the term’s definition this summer.


The decision came after a scuffle with KIND granola bars where—after being told to remove the tag “healthy and tasty” from its bars—the food manufacturer asked to keep it, arguing it wasn’t nutritional information but a “corporate philosophy.” The FDA eventually agreed to let the company keep the tag but also said it had decided to update the definition of the term.
At the time, they told Gizmodo there was no real timeline for when the new definition would be issued. But, as of today, the move towards a new definition appears to be moving forward.


The current FDA definition describes “healthy” as “an implied nutrient content claim” that suggests the food is consistent with current dietary recommendations, particularly for fat and cholesterol. The problem is that still leaves the term pretty wide open for interpretation—and, as we’ve seen with the case of “natural” that can cause big problems.


After the FDA refused to define natural—under the premise that everything we eat has been at least a little processed—people went wild with the term, in both directions. A plain bucket of oats, with nothing added, was sued for being “unnatural,” while 7-Up, fruit snacks, and Cheetos all happily touted their own “natural” benefits to customers.
Last year, the FDA started collecting definitions of what “natural” means to the public—although no actual definition has yet come out from the agency nor has it actually said it plans to write one. The case of “healthy” is a little different, because it started out with a definition, and the FDA has promised from the beginning that the process is going to result in another one. The sooner we see clear definitions of both terms out, the less room there will be for food advertisers to try and create new definitions for themselves.
Endemic measles has officially been wiped out in the Americas. That means the only outbreaks that happen are those imported from abroad. It’s the first region in the world to achieve this certification, but the battle against measles is far from over. We’re looking at you, anti-vaxxers.
The historic announcement was made yesterday at a meeting held by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), a division of the World Health Organization (WHO). The Western Hemisphere’s last case of endemic measles happened back in 2002, but it took the PAHO 14 years to declare the Region of the Americas completely free of the disease. That‘s mostly due to poor communication between departments, the large number of unvaccinated migrants, and civil strife.


“This is a historic day for our region and indeed the world,” PAHO/WHO Director Carissa Etienne said in a statement. “It is proof of the remarkable success that can be achieved when countries work together in solidarity towards a common goal. It is the result of a commitment made more than two decades ago, in 1994, when the countries of the Americas pledged to end measles circulation by the turn of the 21st century.”
This historic milestone took a lot of work and coordination, including strong political commitments from member states and mass vaccination campaigns against measles, mumps, and rubella throughout the Americas. Measles is now the fifth vaccine-preventable disease to be wiped out from the Americas, joining smallpox, polio, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome.


Prior to the introduction of mass vaccinations in 1980, measles caused nearly 2.6 million annual deaths worldwide. These days, about 96,000 people die each year from the highly contagious disease. Measles is transmitted by airborne droplets or by direct contact with bodily secretions, and symptoms include high fever, a body rash, stuffy nose, and reddened eyes. Children are particularly vulnerable.
"The Happiest Place On Earth" is ground zero for a recent measles outbreak centered in…
However, imported outbreaks still occur. Infected travelers bring the disease along with them on an all-too frequent basis, highlighting the need for constant vigilance. In recent years, the United States has experienced a batch of these highly localized outbreaks, including one in 2015 involving 189 people from 24 states. In the majority of these cases, the people who became infected were unvaccinated.


Measles can quickly spread when it reaches a community where significant numbers of people aren’t vaccinated. All of the cases in the United States were quickly contained, preventing the disease from becoming endemic in the country once more. Prior to the introduction of the measles vaccination in 1963, around three to four million cases of the disease were recorded in the United States each year.
But anti-vaxxers could destroy all of this work. A disease can only become endemic—that is, spread through a population without the need for an external source (like an infected traveler)—if most of the people in the population are vaccinated. It’s called herd immunity. According to the Oxford Vaccination Group, 19 out of 20 people, or 95 percent of the population, need to be vaccinated against measles to protect people who are not vaccinated.
The latest figures: Between January 1 and August 29 of this year, nearly 600 confirmed measles…
Unlike anti-vaxxers who voluntarily and irrationally choose to not get themselves or their children vaccinated, there are some people who can’t get vaccinated for health reasons and depend on herd immunity. That include those without fully functional immune systems, people undergoing chemotherapy, newborn babies, and the elderly, to name a few. Anti-vaxxers—and the growing number of unvaccinated children—pose a direct threat to these vulnerable groups.


As for the global battle to combat measles, that work is ongoing.
“We can not become complacent with this achievement but must rather protect it carefully,” said Etienne. “Measles still circulates widely in other parts of the world, and so we must be prepared to respond to imported cases. It is critical that we continue to maintain high vaccination coverage rates, and it is crucial that any suspected measles cases be immediately reported to the authorities for rapid follow-up.”

Just days before it was scheduled to open, a park in Rizhao, China, was severely damaged when the north slope of the mountain right next to it suddenly collapsed.
There were no casualties in the landslide which occurred earlier this month, but the facility’s new rock climbing facility was completely wiped out. Images taken after the rockslide show gigantic boulders strewn across a large section of Shandong Park, which is located in southeastern China.
After inspecting the site, local officials said the landslide was a natural phenomenon, and not the result of human activity. As Charles Liu reports in The Nanfang, local officials “did not answer questions as to why the park facilities are located so close to the mountain, or if any studies or investigations were conducted prior to the construction of the rock climbing facility.”
Geologist Dave Petley of the American Geophysical Union isn’t entirely convinced that the collapse was natural, pointing to extensive engineering work done around the area, and on the slope in particular. “The failure itself appears to have been structurally controlled,” writes Petley. “Note the very large boulder sizes.”
At a cost of 70 million yuan (~$10 million), and after two years of construction, the park was scheduled to open “later this month.” Thank goodness it happened prior to its opening, otherwise this story could have been far more catastrophic.

A team of European researchers put six highly-trained sniffer dogs to the test to see if they were any good at detecting lung cancer. The results were surprisingly bad, but the scientists say factors other than the canine sense of smell were responsible for the poor performance.
The new study, published in Journal of Breath Research, shows that dogs fare poorly when asked to sniff out lung cancer in actual screening situations—despite their uncanny ability to sniff out certain cancers. It’s not their sniffing skills that’s the problem, but canine tendencies—like distraction and boredom—that cause them to lose focus and make mistakes. Simply put, they’re not great at being clinicians.


There’s still good reason to believe that assistance dogs can be tremendously helpful in medical contexts. They’ve been used to detect low blood sugar levels in their diabetic owners, and warn of an impending hypoglycemia attack. Dogs have also displayed an uncanny ability to sniff out certain cancers, such as urological cancers and breast cancer, leading to early detection. But little research has been done to determine if they’re any good at detecting lung cancer, particularly in a real screening situation.
Hence the new study.


Researchers from Krems University Hospital and several other institutions recruited 122 volunteer patients. Twenty-nine had already been diagnosed with lung cancer (but hadn’t yet received any treatments) and 93 subjects showed no signs or symptoms of the disease. The six dogs were trained for six months beforehand, with a total of 150 training samples.


When it came time for the real test, the dogs were exposed to breath samples provided by the participants. This was done in a double-blind manner to eliminate any subjective bias. The dogs correctly detected 79 percent of the patients who actually had lung cancer, but when it came to those without lung cancer, the dogs correctly identified just 34 percent. That’s just not a good return rate, given the seriousness of the diagnosis.
“Our dogs made mistakes with both positive and negative samples, and I think that one important reason for the inferior results might be that a true double blind situation puts a lot of stress on the animals and their handlers,” said Klaus Hackner, a co-author of the study. “Success and regular rewards are important for every kind of sniffer detection work.”
Hackner believes this was a learning experience, and he hasn’t given up hope that dogs can someday be used to sniff out lung cancer. It’s just a matter of setting up effective protocols.
“This disparity is not likely to be a detection issue; dogs have been shown to have extremely sensitive noses as proven by their use in tracking, bomb detection, and search and rescue,” he said. “However, in contrast to analytical instruments, dogs are subject to boredom, limited attention span, fatigue, hunger, and external distraction.”


Still, this study points to the limitations of using dogs for such complex and psychologically-demanding tasks. It would probably be more practical to develop the much heralded “e-nose”—a sensor just as powerful as a dog’s extremely sensitive nose.

Elon Musk finally revealed his plans for a mission to Mars today. But a new set of images from SpaceX show the Interplanetary Transport System going even further in the solar system than the Red Planet.
As we speculated yesterday, the plans for the ITS do, indeed, go well beyond Mars. Musk confirmed an interest in traveling elsewhere in the solar system, especially to Europa, during his speech today—and SpaceX confirmed in a tweet and with this new artwork, as well.


In the latest renderings from SpaceX, you can see the ITS heading past Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, and also Saturn’s rings. Other destinations appear to include Titan, Enceladus, Europa, or others. But before the ITS can make it way out there, the spacecraft has to show that it can get to Mars first.
SpaceX plans to build a “self-sustaining city” on Mars, according to its founder Elon Musk. But, while we now know a lot more about how SpaceX plans to get to Mars, details about how people will actually survive up there remain sketchy.
Musk dropped the news on Tuesday during an address at the International Astronautical Congress meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he had promised to reveal how the company planned to send people to live on Mars.


“I don’t have an immediate doomsday prophecy,” said Musk, but he noted that he saw only two possible paths forward. “One path is to stay on Earth forever, and there will be some extinction event. The alternative is to become a multi-planetary species, which I hope you will agree is the right way to go.”
The plan comes less than a month after the company’s rockets were grounded following a mysterious explosion that caused a Falcon 9 to burst into flames on the launchpad. Since then, the company has released the results of an initial investigation, tracing the fire back to a breach in the rocket’s helium supply, and announced that it plans to take to the skies again by November.


Right before the presentation, SpaceX released a mini-preview of what we could expect from its new Interplanetary Transport System. The system was previously called the Mars Colonial Transporter, until just a few weeks ago, when Musk changed the name after suggesting that it could take us to other destinations in the solar system.
As noted earlier, the video gives us a pretty good idea of the sequence of events for how the system would work:
In the video, first, we see the rocket lift-off from Cape Canaveral’s Launchpad 39a with 28,730,000 pounds of thrust behind it. After stage separation, the spaceships parks in orbit while the booster returns to Earth—where it lands. A propellant tanker is loaded onto the booster to refuel the spaceship in orbit for its trip to Mars. The tanker returns to Earth and the spaceship heads for Mars. The solar arrays deploy and the ships coasts until it finally enter Mars’ orbit. The ship lands on the Martian surface and then we get a glimpse of the astronauts looking out onto the Martian plains.

What we didn’t see in the video, however, is any kind of infrastructure that would support those astronauts to keep them alive after landing. Based on Musk’s comments, it sounds like SpaceX intends to send colonizers to a permanent city on the Red Planet. With 1,000 ships and 200 people per ship, Musk estimated that it would take 40 to 100 years to achieve a fully self-sustaining civilization on Mars.


One of the big barriers to doing that is the cost, which Musk estimated at about $10 billion. The SpaceX founder detailed four ways that he believed a ticket to Mars would become a possible purchase for many people—similar to buying a house. These methods include using reusable rockets, refuelling the spaceship in space, and using a methane fuel instead of traditional rocket fuels. Finally, that methane fuel could be harvested on Mars itself.
We also learned quite a bit about the rocket and what it would be like to travel to Mars. Just like the Falcon 9, the rocket booster on the Interplanetary Transport System will land and be re-used. (SpaceX has landed a number of its Falcon 9 rockets after flight, but hasn’t yet flown one of the used rockets back into space.) A key feature of the rocket re-usage plan is to send their Mars rockets back into space, so seeing a Falcon 9 rocket successfully make a second trip will be critical to convincing people that the plan is plausible.


The new SpaceX rocket will be incredibly large, dwarfing even the company’s Falcon Heavy and the world’s last tallest rocket, the now-defunct Saturn V.
If being locked into a spaceship for months at a time with a bunch of your fellow humans sounds a little grim, though, Musk says not to worry. “It’ll be, like, really fun to go—you’ll have a great time,” he says. Key to doing that will be making the inside of the rocket comfortable for the long ride, which for initial trips will last 80 days. Musk says that he eventually believes a trip could be brought down to a single month.


But whether this is really doable depends a lot on whether SpaceX can actually get the money together. “I would say it’s going to be a challenge to fund this whole project,” Musk noted. He spent a lot of time today talking about the economics of an individual ticket, which he said could drop as low as $100,000.
Musk hinted that he would personally be devoting assets to the project. “I really don’t have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets, except to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multi-planetary,” he said. But even then, there would still need to be significant outside investment.


“I know there’s a lot of people in the private sector interested in funding a trip to Mars, hopefully there will be interest in the government side as well,” Musk said. “Ultimately this will be a huge private-public partnership.”
How quickly all this could happen would, in large degree, depend on whether that funding comes through at all. But if the money is there and all goes as planned on the technical side, Musk said we could see Mars flights begin as soon as 2023—although he cautioned that the timeline was still in-flux. He also kept to SpaceX’s original date for when we would see Red Dragon missions head to Mars in 2018 with payloads between 2 or 3 tons.
But while he described the project as a “self-sustaining city,” Musk did not go into detail about the kind of long-term infrastructure that would keep people alive once they got there.


“The goal of SpaceX is really to build the transport system,” said Musk, before suggesting that the Martian colonists themselves would do much of the building. “Who wants to be among the first to build everything, from refineries to the first pizza joint?” Musk asked.
But before we can build a pizza joint on Mars, people will need a whole lot of other things, including but not limited to clean and usable water, a space habitat capable of withstanding Martian environments, some kind of transport, and presumably some more people who would eat there. Musk also failed to explain who—if anyone—is actually going to build and maintain that basic infrastructure. Without it, the plan is unlikely to succeed.
For what it’s worth, Musk says that he’d like to make the trip to Mars himself—but only after putting together a Plan B for his company, in case of disaster. “I would definitely like to go to orbit and visit the space station and then ultimately go to Mars,” he said. “I have to make sure if something goes wrong on the flight and I die there’s a good succession plan and the mission of the company continues.”


If SpaceX’s plans to get to Mars do succeed, though, we could be looking at trips even further out. As I noted yesterday, Musk has hinted at the possibility of using this transport system to go beyond Mars—and it appears that future plans could be heading that way.
“If we have a propellent depot, you can go from Mars to Jupiter, no problem,” Musk said. “It means full access to the entire greater solar system.” He noted a particular interest in traveling to Europa.


The first step, though, would be establishing regular travel—or even a first trip—to Mars. And to see if that’s really possible, we’ll have to wait.
A new reproductive technique in which a baby is produced with the genetic material from three distinct parents has yielded its first human.
As reported in New Scientist, the baby was born five months ago in Mexico with the help of US researchers. The three-parent reproductive technique, known as mitochondrial donation or pronuclear transfer, is not yet legal in the United States, but it is under serious discussion. The method was approved two years ago in the UK, but that country has yet to produce its first “three-parent” child.

This therapy stops serious conditions from being passed down from mother to child. In this case, the five-month old boy was born to a Jordanian mother who was at risk of passing down a fatal and debilitating genetic disorder called Leigh Syndrome, which affects the developing nervous system. The mother had previously lost two children to the disorder, so she sought the help of John Zhang, a researcher at the New Hope Fertility Center in New York City. As noted in New Scientist, Zhang performed the procedure in Mexico, where “there are no rules,” adding that “[saving] lives is the ethical thing to do.”


Mitochondria are the powerpacks that fuel every human cell, and just like the nucleus, they contain DNA. Unfortunately, inherited defects in mitochondrial DNA can cause severe or even fatal results. To overcome this problem, scientists extract two eggs—one from the mother and one from a donor. The nucleus of the donor egg is removed, leaving the mitochondria intact, and replaced by the mother’s nucleus. The resulting embryo is free from the inherited defect, resulting in a potentially healthy baby—albeit it with three parents.
Zhang and his colleagues tested the baby’s mitochondria, and found that less than one percent contains the harmful mutation. It usually takes about 18 percent of mitochondria to be affected before problems set in.
The technique is considered controversial by some because of the unorthodox number of parents. But bear in mind that a scant 0.1 percent of genetic information is being transferred by the donor. This concern is basically a non-issue, and people need to get over it. Also, this is not the first time that a baby has been born with three parents; it simply marks the first time it’s been done using this new technique.


More important are the questions of safety and efficacy. Running off to Mexico to perform a procedure because it’s still illegal in the United States may push the science forward, but it’s clearly sending the wrong message.

New research shows that as many as 700,000 microscopic fibers are released into the environment each time we do the laundry. It’s a problem with no easy solution in sight.
For years, scientists and environmentalists have wondered—and worried—if the simple act of washing our clothes might be triggering the release of microscopic plastic particles. A new Plymouth University study, now published in Marine Pollution Bulletin, shows this is very much the case.


The new research shows that over 700,000 microscopic fibers are flushed down the washing machine’s drain each time we run a load in a conventional washer. These particles are tiny enough to pass through sewage treatment plants and leech their way into the environment, where they pose a threat to fragile ecosystems.
This week, Illinois became the first state in the country to ban exfoliating plastic beads. Good…
Microplastics are bad news once they enter into the environment. Measuring as small as 0.355 millimeters in size, these tiny bits of plastic cause all sorts of problems for marine organisms. Plastics absorb toxins—like PCBs, pesticides, and motor oil—like a sponge, poisoning the food chain. Easily ingested, they start to build up in an animal’s digestive tract, hindering its ability to absorb energy from foods. Earlier this year, European researchers discovered that young fish get hooked on plastic microbeads (the kind you find in exfoliants), stunting their growth and making them more vulnerable to predators.


Researchers have suspected that synthetic textiles release microscopic fibers during the wash, but no definitive proof has existed. To see if this is in fact the case, PhD student Imogen Napper, with the help of Plymouth University professor Richard Thompson, looked at the mass, quantity, and size of fibers that leech into the wastewater after synthetic fabrics are washed at standard temperatures.
For the study, the researchers washed various fabrics at 86 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (30 and 40 degrees Celsius) using various combinations of detergent and fabric softeners. The researchers sent the different batches of wastewater to the lab for analysis where a scanning electron microscope was used to determine the size, mass, and quantity of the plastic particles.
The researchers found that washing 13 pounds (6 kg) of polyester-cotton blend fabrics released (on average) nearly 138,000 individual strands of microscopic fibers. A similarly sized load of polyester produced 496,000 fibers. But it was acrylic that yielded the greatest number of fibers, spewing out a whopping 729,000 individual particles. The polyester-cotton blend shed the least amount of fibers on average, but the addition of bio-detergents or conditioners caused more plastic particles to be released.
Given that virtually all of us do the laundry on a consistent basis, that adds up to an astronomically high number of microplastic particles. It’s not immediately clear how much of these fibers eventually make their way into our aquatic environments, so more research is clearly needed to find out. Some jurisdictions have already banned the use of microbeads from personal care products, but banning the use of synthetic textiles is an entirely different—and wholly unrealistic—proposition. It’s a problem in need of a different solution.
“The societal benefits of textiles are without question and so any voluntary or policy intervention should be directed toward reducing emissions either via changes in textile design or filtration of [wastewater], or both,” suggested Thompson in a statement.


Moving forward, the researchers are hoping to understand why certain types of fabrics are releasing substantially more fibers than others—a finding that could have an impact on how our clothes are designed and manufactured. It could also influence the choices we make as consumers. More work is also needed to understand some of the other factors that are affecting the leakage of microplastics from our clothing, such as wash duration, washing machine filter designs, and spin speeds.

Our solar system is rife with geologic activity, from eruptive ice moons to mountainous dwarf planets. Still, Earth always held a special place in the hall of geologic fame. It was the only bonafide planet to exhibit tectonic and seismic activity—until now.
Mercury, a world just a little larger than our Moon that’s spent the last four billion years in a broiler, is also geologically active. That’s according to a new analysis of high-resolution images taken near the planet’s north pole in the final months of the MESSENGER mission. These images reveal numerous tiny fault scarps; offsets in the surface that form as Mercury’s interior cools and the planet’s crust shrinks.


While Mercury’s has no plate tectonics in the terrestrial sense, crustal shrinking still qualifies as tectonic activity. It could even trigger Mercury-quakes.
Since the Mariner 10 probe zipped past Mercury in the 1970s, scientists have been aware that the solar system’s innermost planet is scarred by enormous rifts and canyons. These features tell a story of of a planet whose crust has contracted over geologic time, like a raisin shriveling up in the sun.


“The biggest of these features is comparable to the San Andreas [fault],” Thomas Watters of the Smithsonian Institute, who led the new study, told Gizmodo. “They’re huge. So we know Mercury had contracted, but we didn’t know if that contraction had happened millions or billions of years ago, because large features with kilometers of relief will not disappear.”
Smaller fault scarps, however, won’t survive more than a few million years on Mercury, an airless world whose surface is bombarded by a constant onslaught of meteorites. Watters also happens to be a mission scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has spent the last few years snapping incredibly high-res images of the Moon’s surface, through which we’ve identified numerous tiny fault scarps. This tells us that the Moon’s crust is shrinking and quaking to this day.
“It was a surprise to discover that the Moon had these very young faults,” Watters said. “It made me wonder if Mercury had similar features.”
Several years back, Watters and his colleagues had an opportunity to find out. During the last 18 months of the MESSENGER mission in 2014 and 2015, the spacecraft entered a low-altitude orbit over Mercury’s north pole, and began snapping photographs at a resolution of less than 20 meters per pixel. Sure enough, a slew of kilometer-sized scarp features were quickly revealed. It also became clear that older, larger fault scarps remain active today.
Based on Mercury’s size, conventional scientific wisdom holds that its core should have cooled and solidified billions of years ago. But recently, MESSENGER’s magnetometer produced evidence of ongoing magnetic field activity. If Mercury still has a magnetic field, it implies that part of the core is still be molten and convecting. The new high-resolution imaging seems to confirm this.


One of the most intriguing implications of Watters’ discovery is that Mercury might be quite seismically active. Small fault scarps on the Moon are believed to be connected with moonquakes, which we’ve been picking up ever since Apollo astronauts installed a seismometer on the lunar surface.
“If we ever get to the point where we could put a seismometer on Mercury, there’s a very good chance it could detect Mercury quakes associated with continued contraction,” Watters said, adding that ongoing seismic activity may help tiny scarps evolve into larger features.
Until that future, Mercury quake-hunting mission arrives, Watters remains preoccupied with another mystery: how in the heck this tiny world has managed to hold enough core heat to stay geologically active for 4.5 billion years.


“MESSENGER has opened up a new door into this question of how Mercury has evolved,” Watters said. “We’re starting to see this picture that, in my mind, is going to change the way we think about terrestrial planets. We are going to have to think a little differently about how [they] are losing their interior heat.”

We’re finally going to hear Elon Musk’s plans for a mission to Mars. You can watch along to find out what it is at 2:30pm EDT. In the meantime, here’s some of what we expect to hear—and what it means to finally put a person on Mars. [Update: And here’s some video concept art of the system at work.]
Musk will deliver an address this afternoon explaining the plan to the International Astronautical Congress titled “Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species.” SpaceX describes the speech as a “technical presentation [which] will focus on potential architectures for sustaining humans on the Red Planet.” Beyond that, details are sketchy, although there are some things we expect to hear today.


Yesterday, Musk finally revealed the Raptor engine that will power his Martian flights in action. He also shared some specs for the engine. Today, we’ll almost definitely hear follow-up details and specs for the spaceship and rocket Musk intends to ferry people to the Red Planet. When we can expect to see them in the skies is also likely to be revealed.
Musk had previously sketched out a loose timeline for SpaceX’s trip to Mars. The private space company has said it wants to send a Red Dragon space capsule to Mars in 2018 aboard one of its Falcon Heavy rockets, which hasn’t actually yet had a test flight. That’s all a prelude, though, to Musk’s stated plan to send a person (or people?) there in 2025—at least five years sooner than NASA plans to even reach Mars.
After SpaceX’s big rocket explosion (complete with its satellite payload) just this month, however, the company is currently grounded, pending the full investigation of what caused the flame-up. SpaceX intends to be back in the air by this November, but the delay is going to push back some of the milestones—particularly the debut of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which we were originally probably going to see make its first test flight this year. That flight will be pushed back until next year.


Besides the hardware of how to get there, we can also expect Musk to tell us his plans for how SpaceX intends to keep a Martian crew alive once they hit the surface of the planet. Right now, that’s the part of the plan we know the least about. What kind of structure will the colonists live in? How will they be protected from the Martian elements? What will they eat up there? Before anyone steps foot into a capsule, we need to answer all these questions—and more.
Much of what we’ll see and hear today remains a mystery. Will Musk rip through his skin suit to reveal the alien lizard-person inside? (No.) Will he show off the scale model he’s been building in his basement of Martian city, New Elonsberg? (Perhaps.) Will he finally reveal SpaceX’s plan to colonize Mars—and, maybe, even beyond? (Probably!)
But, we’ll have to wait till 2:30pm EDT to see for sure. You can watch along with us right here.

Update 1:55 p.m. SpaceX has released a teaser video featuring concept art of the Interplanetary Transport System in action.


In the video, first, we see the rocket lift-off from Cape Canaveral’s Launchpad 39a with 28,730,000 pounds of thrust behind it. After stage separation, the spaceships parks in orbit while the booster returns to Earth—where it lands. A propellant tanker is loaded onto the booster to refuel the spaceship in orbit for its trip to Mars. The tanker returns to Earth and the spaceships heads for Mars. The solar arrays deploy and the ships coasts until it finally enter Mars’ orbit.
The ship lands on the Martian surface and then we get a glimpse of the astronauts looking out onto the Martian plains. Crucially, there’s no extra infrastructure in view. We’ll have to wait a little longer to learn how the astronauts can expect to live once they reach the Red Planet.

Update 2:11 p.m: And Musk has also added a few more details about the size of the Interplanetary Transport System. (Hint: Big.)

Researchers working in Africa have uncovered 3.8 million-year-old protein fragments encased in an ostrich eggshell. These biological building blocks are millions of years older than the oldest DNA ever found, highlighting the possibility of recovering ancient proteins from extinct animals—and even the remains of early humans.
The new study, published in eLife, represents an important breakthrough in paleontology and ancient proteomics. Proteins are expressed by our DNA, and they represent the basic building blocks of life, forming everything from our teeth and toenails to our skin and vital organs. The researchers, led by Matthew Collins from York University, recovered the protein fragments in a 3.8 million-year-old ostrich eggshell that was found in Laetoli, Tanzania.


These protein sequences are significantly older than the oldest DNA ever extracted from fossils, which only go far back in time to about 700,000 years ago. This opens up the tantalizing possibility of recovering similar proteins from the earliest human fossils; traces of human habitation in the Laetoli region date back to 3.75 million years ago. Proteins may not yield the same information as DNA, but they can still reveal much about an organism.
“Ancient proteins derived from the enamel of fossil teeth have the potential to yield important clues to the evolutionary relationships, species identity, sex, and migration patterns of early human ancestors,” said Terry Harrison, an anthropologist at New York University and a co-author of the study.


Recovery of the “entrapped” proteins in the eggshell was possible due to the way they were protected by surface minerals. The researchers were actually testing a theory to see if it’s possible to extract full sequences of proteins from hard surfaces, such as egg shells, bones and enamel—and it turns out their suspicions were right. Using a computer model, the researchers demonstrated that protein sequences do in fact survive longer when they’re stabilized by strong binding to the surface of minerals found on a hard shell or bone.
We can all blame Jurassic Park for getting our hopes up that we could bring the dinosaurs using…
Excitingly, the researchers say their findings could translate to older fossils. “Even dinosaur eggshells will now be of interest [for chemical analysis],” noted study co-author Kirsty Penkman in the BBC.


Proteins have the potential to reveal genetic information up to 50 times older than DNA, which tends to degrade relatively quickly. By finding and isolating entire protein sequences, rather than a single instance, the researchers stand a better chance of determining biological function. Moreover, by studying these coherent sequences, the researchers can make educated inferences about the DNA that encoded for those functions. It’s basically virtual DNA .

Fire up the grill and invite me over, friend. Today, we feast in celebration.
The latest USDA meat production projections are out, and they predict that, after years of domination by chicken, beef will become the fastest growing meat category over the course of the next decade. Beef isn’t just going to be more available, though. It’s also going to be cheaper than it’s been in years.


Beef and pork consumption have been on a steady decline in the United States for the last decade, while the amount of chicken America eats has been steadily rising over the same period. This isn’t due to people losing—and then finding—their taste for steak, however. It’s because beef has been getting progressively more expensive.
You may have noticed something a little odd happening at your meat counter. Most meat prices,…
In 2015, with ranchers hit hard by both high feed prices and drought, America’s beef production hit an all-time low, right as global demand was spiking. This pushed beef prices to skyrocket by over 50 percent in the course of a decade, while chicken (which was already considerably cheaper than beef) held mostly steady. The end result was that, Americans ate considerably less beef over the last decade and quite a bit more chicken. Now, the USDA is not only forecasting that the decline will end but that beef will become the fastest growing meat category for the next ten years.
The USDA anticipates a price decline thanks to changing conditions on the ranch. High feed prices are dropping, and the drought, although it’s still ongoing, has eased up slightly. This means that ranchers’ cost of raising cows is falling. With cheaper herds, ranchers can raise more cows and send more beef out to the market. This will increase the amount of beef we eat, and it should lower the cost of beef by about 10 percent, the USDA predicts.


Chicken and pork fans shouldn’t be too worried, though. While beef had the sharpest projected gain, every single category of meat saw a predicted rise in supply throughout the next decade. By 2025, the average American will be eating 219 pounds of meat a year, compared with this decade’s 211 pounds—with no end to the upward trend in sight.
For years, scientists have speculated that morning sickness is connected to a lower risk of miscarriage, but the evidence was lacking. A new analysis involving nearly 800 pregnant women shows there may be some truth to this claim.
As many expectant women know all too well, the first half of a pregnancy is often mired by bouts of nausea and vomiting. Morning sickness tends to go away after about four months, but some women are stuck with these symptoms for the entire duration of the pregnancy. Scientists aren’t entirely sure what causes it, but it may have something to do with the way the body protects the fetus against toxins and dangerous microorganisms in foods and beverages.


Many expectant women also know that friends and family are apt to point out that morning sickness—which happens in about 80 percent of all pregnancies—is a good sign that the pregnancy is going well. Trouble is, much of this is anecdotal, and there hasn’t been a lot of high-quality evidence to support the claim. A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine by researchers from the NIH’s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have finally addressed this shortcoming, but more research will be needed to make a definitive confirmation.
“Our study evaluates symptoms from the earliest weeks of pregnancy, immediately after conception, and confirms that there is a protective association between nausea and vomiting and a lower risk of pregnancy loss,” noted Stefanie N. Hinkle, a researcher at NICHD and a co-author of the study, in a statement.


For the study, Hinkle and her team pulled data from previous research—a 2014 study that looked into the effects of aspirin on pregnancies (known as the EAGeR trial). The 797 women enrolled in this study kept daily diaries of whether they experienced nausea and vomiting from weeks two to eight of their pregnancies, while also answering a monthly questionnaire about their symptoms up to week 36 of their pregnancies. Prior studies failed to acquire such detailed reports in the early stages, and they typically asked women about their symptoms after they experienced a pregnancy loss.


Of these 797 women, a total of 188 experienced a pregnancy loss (23.6 percent). By the two-month mark, around 57 percent of women experienced regular bouts of nausea, while another 27 percent reported both nausea and vomiting. This latter group of women was 50 to 75 percent less likely to have a miscarriage compared to those women who didn’t deal with any sickness. The same results also applied to women who had a prior history of miscarriage.
This study is an important step forward, but it doesn’t mean that pregnant women who don’t have these symptoms should be worried. No two pregnancies are the same, and no two women are completely alike. Looking ahead to future research, it would be good to see scientists draw data from elsewhere, and not just a study that focused on the effects of aspirin on a pregnancy. Finally, this study was purely correlative—and we all know that correlation does not imply causation. With this in mind, the researchers are already planning to do more research to find out if they can figure out the connection.

Jupiter’s moon Europa is on the shortlist of places we might discover alien life in our solar system. And today, the prospects for finding extraterrestrial microbes on this little ice moon got a lot better, when NASA unveiled new evidence for water geysers near Europa’s south pole. The discovery strengthens the case for a geothermally-heated, subsurface ocean.
“Today, we are presenting new Hubble evidence for water vapor plumes being expelled from the ice surface of Europa,” William Sparks, an astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a NASA press briefing this afternoon. “Observations indicate a global, saline liquid water ocean engulfs the moon at the present time. If there are plumes emerging, it is significant because it means we may be able to explore that ocean... without having to drill through miles of ice.”
The discovery, which will be published this week in the Astrophysical Journal, came about after a 15 month-long Hubble Space Telescope observational campaign, which saw Europa transit in front of Jupiter in the far ultraviolet on ten separate occasions. During three of those transit events, Hubble observed spectral features that could be plumes, mostly emanating from Europa’s south polar terrain.
Today’s announcement marks the second time that astronomers have discovered signs of geyser activity on Europa. The first evidence came in late 2012, when a separate UV imaging analysis by Hubble revealed elevated levels of hydrogen and oxygen near the moon’s south pole. That data was taken to indicate two enormous plumes of water, jettisoning skyward to a height of 125 miles (200 km).


But the finding was never replicated—not by Hubble, nor in data captured by several Jupiter-bound spacecrafts—until now. This prompted speculation that Europa’s geologic activity is quite intermittent, perhaps only occurring during specific parts of its orbit around Jupiter, when the gas giant exerts a powerful tidal strain on the moon.

Hubble’s latest exciting clues—UV absorption features that could indicate water—seem to support this picture. “If the features are real, they have to be intermittent, because we did not see anything on seven occasions,” Sparks said.


Europa isn’t only the eruptive moon that might be sheltering warm, life-friendly waters beneath its frozen exterior. A little further down the cosmic street lies Enceladus, whose south pole plumes spew seawater full throttle all the time, offering free samples to any spacecraft that happen to be in the neighborhood. Cassini’s discovery of activity on Enceladus has prompted some astronomers to propose a dedicated astrobiology mission to the moon, which could sample that seawater for signs of life.
An Enceladus life finder mission has not yet been greenlit by NASA—but a mission to Europa is already in the works for the 2020s. Not only are the latest signs of activity sure to generate excitement for that mission, they could help us design it for the best possible results.


“I think one of the biggest unknowns we have [regarding the plumes] is understanding their timing,” a spokesperson for the Europa mission said during the press briefing. “The more observations we can get with Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope, the better we can develop a schedule to search for these plumes [when we’re] close.”
“We know that Europa is a special place,” Amanda Hendrix, an expert in icy moons and satellites with the Planetary Science Institute told Gizmodo. “The upcoming Europa mission will be awesome in how much it reveals about Europa as a world and its potential for habitability.”
A team of researchers rode a roller coaster more times than they probably care to remember, just to figure out why roller coasters trigger the passage of small kidney stones. With the further help of a 3D-printed model of a kidney filled with urine, they think they’ve solved the puzzle.
In the new study, published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, urologist David D. Wartinger and his colleagues at Michigan State University College present evidence to support widespread claims that riding a moderate-intensity roller coaster can help people pass small kidney stones. The results, though still preliminary, could assist in the development of a rather unconventional therapy for patients.
Kidney stones are a mass of chemicals and salts found in urine. Passing kidney stones can be an excruciating experience, particularly when the stones are large. Getting them out early before they get too large is key to reducing much of the discomfort and risk.


Prior to the new study, virtually no one took the time to figure out what prompts a kidney stone to pass through the urinary canal, though urologists are familiar with some common triggers.
Pregnant women often pass kidney stones, the result of increased vitamin intake. Physical labor will sometimes loosen it, as will bungee jumping, bouncing on a trampoline, dirt bike riding, and even a violent sneeze. The fact is, scientists haven’t been able to isolate a single trigger—but roller coasters seem to play an important, and even reproducible, role.
“When a series of patients returned from spring break with stories of passing a kidney stone after riding the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disney World in Orlando, I started to wonder if we had a unique opportunity to help patients,” Wartinger told Gizmodo. “The moment one of my students and I realized we had to move forward was hearing from a patient who rode the ride three times and after each consecutive ride he passed a stone.”
Wartinger and study co-author Marc Mitchell used 3D printing to create a clear silicone anatomical model of this particular male patient’s kidney. They filled the model with the patient’s urine, and placed three kidney stones of various sizes in the upper, middle, and lower passageways of the simulated kidney. After sealing the model, the researchers set off for Disney World.


With the permission of park officials,the researchers placed the model of the kidney in a backpack. Then they hopped on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride, holding the kidney model between themselves at approximately the position of a real kidney to stimulate the forces that would be felt by a real person. They repeated this 20 times, collecting important data with each run. Then they repeated the experiment on Space Mountain and the Walt Disney World railroad, for a total of 60 rides.
“As far as having to ride the coaster repeatedly, honestly, the first five to six times were great,” said Wartinger.”By the end we were just gritting our teeth and wishing to be done.”
At least for this patient’s simulated kidney, the data showed that sitting in the back of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad resulted in a stone passage rate of nearly 64 percent. Front seat rides produced a passage rate of nearly 17 percent. The researchers say that powerful and random forces jarred the stone lose, guiding it through the passageway.
“A kidney looks like a tree with branches,” said Wartinger. “The forces move the stone from being positioned where a leaf is located, down through the branches and out through the trunk—and onward to the bladder. It’s not surprising that the model we used passed kidney stones on this coaster because it’s based on a gentleman that passed three stones on this exact roller coaster.”
Wartinger believes this can be replicated, but not everyone will respond to the same ride. Like a fingerprint, each person has a unique kidney passage pattern, so everyone is going to have their own “ideal” kidney stone-jostling roller coaster ride. And for some, other activities may prove to be more effective.


The researchers believe that these findings can translate to preventive care, and be of help to three distinct groups.
“If you have a stone smaller than four millimeters it can help you pass it before it becomes obstructive or large enough to become stuck in the tube,” said Wartinger. “When stuck it may require emergency surgery and will cause extreme pain.”
Indeed, many have compared the pain of passing a large stone to natural childbirth. He says it could also help people who have a procedure that smashes a big stone into smaller stones, who can then pass the smaller fragments with the help of a thrill ride. Finally, it can help young women clear small stones before they become pregnant (it’s not advised that pregnant women ride roller coasters).


Looking ahead, the researchers would like to test more models on a range of other coasters, assuming they can get access to additional theme parks. And to make these findings truly helpful for patients, the researchers would need to conduct ultrasounds of individuals before and after each ride.
The study is also pertinent to space exploration. The effect of gravity normally helps with the passage of kidney stones, which is why so many astronauts suffer on the International Space Station. “Kidney stones will truly be a challenge for people on Mars 1,” said Wartinger.

SpaceX has been talking up its Martian travel plans for a while now, but we still don’t know how it intends to get (or survive) there. As of today, however, it’s cleared a major hurdle: the rocket engine it will use to get to the Red Planet just fired-up for the first time.
Company founder Elon Musk announced that his company’s Raptor engine had its first successful firing test and included a few pictures of the mysterious engine in action:


Musk also revealed a few specs for the rocket engine, including its thrust capabilities of over 300 metric tons, a specific impulse of 382 seconds, and chamber pressure of almost three times greater than that of the Merlin engine in SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. In other words, the Raptor engine is really big and really powerful. These details may also hint at some of the private spaceflight company’s upcoming plans.


The Raptor engine’s firing test is a good sign, but a successfully-firing rocket engine is still a long ways away from a fully operational spacecraft and launch system. Tomorrow afternoon, Musk is due to give a speech at the International Astronautical Congress. There, he’s expected to reveal details about his plan to get people to Mars and the spaceship—part of his Interplanetary Transport System—he wants to use to get them (and the supplies to keep them alive) to the Red Planet.
Two weeks ago, the Interplanetary Transport System had a different name, though: the Mars Colonial Transporter. Then—after tweeting “Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars, so will need a new name…” and bandying a few name suggestions—Musk switched up the name to the Interplanetary Transport System. The key word in the new name, of course, is “interplanetary.” Musk might just be hinting that we could soon hear about travel plans that go not only to Mars but also even further in our solar system.
Cone snails employ a fast-acting venom to paralyze their prey. But what is bad news for fish is good news for diabetics. New research suggests the “weaponized insulin” produced by these sea critters is far more efficient than conventional medicines used to treat high blood sugar.
While hunting, some cone snails secrete insulin, along with other toxic compounds, into the water. When an unsuspecting fish swims by, this poisonous brew causes its blood sugar to plummet, sending the fish into a hypoglycemic trance. Stunned, the fish is easy prey for the cone snail, who engulfs and consumes it. That’s why marine biologists refer to this as weaponized insulin.


In a new study published in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, a research team from the United States and Australia show that this undersea weapon could inspire the development of fast-acting medicines to treat diabetes in humans. A molecular analysis of the cone snail venom revealed its potency; it’s much faster than the best rapid-acting therapeutic insulin, and it can begin working in the body in just five minutes. Compare that to the 15 minutes it takes the fastest-acting insulin to kick in.
“You look at what venoms animals make to affect the physiology of their prey, and you use that as a starting point,” noted University of Utah biologist Helena Safavi, a co-author of the paper, in a press statement. “You can get new ideas from venoms. To have something that has already been evolved—that’s a huge advantage.”


Like cone snails, humans also produce insulin. But instead of using it as a venom, our bodies use it to regulate the amount of glucose in our blood. When the body can’t produce enough insulin—a condition known as diabetes—it can result in high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia. To prevent this from happening, diabetics receive synthetic insulin injections. (Natural insulin is produced in the pancreas.)


Safavi and her colleagues discovered that cone snail insulin is different than human insulin and synthetic insulin in one very important way: it lacks a molecular segment that causes it to stick to other insulin molecules. This allows it to act fast in the body. Tests on insulin receptors show that snail insulin isn’t quite as good as human insulin, but its ability to quickly get to work makes it an attractive candidate for future therapies. More experiments are needed to measure how snail insulin works in the human body, and whether it’ll function the way the researchers hope it will.
“People think it’s easy to make drugs,” said Safavi. “But where do you start? You have to have some kind of idea of what a drug should look like, what kind of properties the drug should have, so it’s very difficult to design novel drugs.” And as her colleague and study co-author Danny Chou aptly put it, “It’s really about learning from nature.”

As Arctic sea ice flirts with its lowest levels in recorded history, polar scientists are taking the opportunity to remind us that it isn’t just humans who are screwed because of melting ice caps. Remember polar bears, global warming’s first darling poster child? They’re still around, and they’re not happy with what we’ve done to the planet.
Across the Arctic, nineteen separate polar bear subpopulations head out onto the ice in the winter and spring to hunt seals, their main source of calories. All nineteen groups have seen hunting season dramatically shortened because of climate change. That’s according to a new analysis published today in The Cryosphere, which drew on 35 years of satellite data to show that dwindling sea ice is bringing an earlier spring thaw and later fall freeze-up to all regions of the Arctic inhabited by polar bears.
On average, the researchers found that in polar bear-populated regions, spring ice melt has been starting three to nine days earlier per decade since 1979, while fall freeze up has been arriving three to nine days later. Over 35 years, this amounts to a reduction in hunting season of up to seven weeks, which is a lot of time that mamma bears could be packing on the seal blubber and feeding it to their young.


“These spring and fall transitions bound the period when there is good ice habitat available for bears to feed,” study co-author Kristin Laidre, a researcher at the University of Washington’s Polar Science Center said in a statement. “Those periods are also tied to the breeding season when bears find mates, and when females come out of their maternity dens with very small cubs and haven’t eaten for months.”
At the rate sea ice is dwindling, the researchers say that polar bears can expect to see their hunting season reduced by another six to seven weeks by mid-century. This, of course, will leave the enormous Arctic predators with one option: terrorizing the very scientists who want to save them. So unless we’re willing to let human-polar bear relations descend into chaos, we might want to do something about all that carbon being added to the atmosphere.

An arctic research mission claims that it’s discovered the HMS Terror, one of two Franklin Expedition ships that sunk during a doomed attempt to traverse the Northwest Passage. Incredibly, the 168-year-old wreck would probably not have been found if it weren’t for information provided by an indigenous crew member.
As reported in the The Guardian, the Arctic Research Foundation discovered the HMS Terror in Nunavut Bay. “Resting proud on 24 metres [78 feet] of water, we found HMS Terror—203 years old, it is perfectly preserved in the frigid waters of the Northwest Passage,” noted Arctic Research Foundation spokesperson Adrian Schimnowski.
Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper was absolutely gushing yesterday when he announced the…
Underwater footage shows the ship in excellent condition, with all three masts still standing and nearly all hatches closed. A pair of wine bottles, tables, a desk (with its drawers open), and empty shelving were seen inside the wreck.


The ship was abandoned in sea ice in 1848 during a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean to Asia. All 129 crew members were lost, nearly three years after the Franklin Expedition set out from England. Two years ago, it’s companion ship, the HMS Erebus, was discovered by underwater archaeologists from Parks Canada. Inuit oral history helped researchers narrow its location.
The HMS Terror was finally located 60 miles (96 kilometers) south of where archaeologists thought it had been lost. Finding nothing, the Martin Bergmann-led crew decided to take a detour to Terror Bay after hearing a story from an indigenous crew member named Sammy Kogvik. He told the crew that he noticed a large piece of wood sticking out of the Terror Bay’s sea ice while on a fishing trip several years ago, and that it resembled a ship’s mast. It turned out to be one hell of a tip.
The archaeologists had assumed that the HMS Terror was trapped in ice somewhere between King William Island and Victoria Island, but its location much further to the south is altering our understanding of what happened during the doomed mission.


Now that both Franklin Expedition ships have been found, there’s still one lingering mystery: the final resting place of Sir John Franklin himself. And once again, it’s here where oral tradition can help; legend has it that Franklin was buried in a vault somewhere on northern King William Island. Probably a good place to start.

After demonstrating the miraculous protective capabilities of Line-X spray on a watermelon, YouTube’s How Ridiculous wanted to what else the wonder material could protect from a 150-foot drop. Surprisingly, eggs, one of Mother Nature’s most fragile creations, simply bounced off the pavement after the plunge.
The amateur scientists also tried the same experiment with a lightbulb, which ended up completely shattering inside its protective coating as it happened to land right on the screw cap. They also covered a bowling ball in the Line-X spray, but it was promptly destroyed when it made contact with a vertically-mounted axe instead of just flat pavement. Why couldn’t high school science have been this fun?

While working at a remote weather station in the Russian Arctic might sound like a lot of fun, the reality is apparently far grimmer. In addition to the cold, the isolation and the possibility of literally falling off a cliff thanks to climate change, researchers have to deal with unruly locals, like the dozen or so polar bears currently “besieging” scientists on Troynoy Island in Russia’s Great Arctic State Nature Reserve.
On a tiny island at the end of the world, a lonely weather station is slowly tumbling off a…
According to Russian news agency TASS, the weather station’s five workers have been stuck inside since running out of flares to frighten the bears that arrived late last month, including one that has begun sleeping under their windows.


“We have issued a recommendation for the station’s personnel to use extreme caution, not to leave the station without a serious need and continue only with possible meteorological observations,” Vassiliy Shevchenko, head of the agency that runs the station, told TASS.


To address the crisis, Shevchenko says a research vessel has been instructed to bring the scientists additional flares and some dogs “as one of the station’s canines was killed by a bear.” Fortunately, the ship is only a month away. Shevchenko, however, remains optimistic about the situation.
“At the end of October, or in the beginning of November the near-shore waters will freeze and the bears will leave the island in search for food,” said Shevchenko. “Things like this have happened before.”
In two weeks, the European Space Agency will crash-land its prized Rosetta spacecraft, marking a dramatic end to the whirlwind two-year science mission that saw humanity’s first-ever comet landing. It’ll be 48 action-packed hours as Rosetta descends to its ultimate resting place on Comet 67P—and to get you properly excited for that event, we wanted to share the fascinating reason this site was chosen.
Recently, the European Space Agency released images of the Rosetta spacecraft’s planned impact site, located near the top of Comet 67P’s smaller lobe. The site has been named Ma’at after the ancient Egyptian goddess of harmony, balance, and order—perhaps in the hope that Rosetta’s slow-mo crash landing will channel some of these qualities. A more accurate name for this region might have been Mordor.


Littered with goosebump-like boulders and deep, treacherous sinkholes, Ma’at is a rugged and inhospitable place, prone to violent outbursts of gas and dust.


But the very same features that give Rosetta’s landing pad a frightening appearance also make it a scientific gold mine. In fact, it’s possible this spot could hold the key to understanding how comets form.
“The pits on Ma’at have unusual structures inside their walls—it’s like the edge of the walls are made of three meter balls clumped together,” Rosetta mission scientist Laurence O’Rourke told Gizmodo. “We believe these are remnants from the formation of the comet itself.”


“An important question for Rosetta is, how does a comet become a comet?” Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor added. “How do small particles of ice get stuck together, coagulate, and aggregate? Getting better resolution of imagery these features—we call them goosebumps, but I think they look a bit like lizard skin—will help answer that question.”
As Rosetta descends on the evening of the 29th, it’ll be angling its OSIRIS camera to get a good look at several pits, capturing some insanely detailed glamor shots before it loses communication with the Earth.


“We’re trying to cram as much [data] collection as possible into this final section, and we hope to get the highest resolution images of the entire mission,” Taylor said.
Ultimately, the lander will be targeting the side of a 130 meter-wide pit known as Deir el-Medina, an appellation that once again pays homage to ancient Egyptian culture. (Deir el-Medina was home to artisans who worked on tombs in the Valley of the Kings.) Rosetta isn’t going to be entering the pit—at least not on purpose. Rather, it’ll be side-eyeing Deir el-Medina from an angle that offers good illumination as it aims for the pit’s rim. “Everything looks better by doing it this way,” Taylor said.
Of course, Rosetta’s other scientific instruments aren’t just going to sit tight while OSIRIS has all the fun. As the spacecraft dives through Comet 67P’s hazy coma, it’ll use its mass spectrometer to sniff out a variety of molecules within the gas, which early scientific reports have likened to cat piss. Rosetta will also be tasting Comet 67P’s airborne dust, and using plasma measurements to study how the solar wind interacts with the surface. “Really, this is a massive bonus for us in terms of science,” Taylor said.


There’s one other thing to know about the Rosetta spacecraft’s final resting place. Ma’at is located on the same chunk of Comet 67P—the head—as the recently rediscovered Philae lander. The two spacecraft will be just a few kilometers apart. So, even as humanity’s favorite icy rock plunges into the frigid void of the outer solar system and our communications go dead forever, sentimental space nerds can console themselves with the knowledge that neither Rosetta nor Philae will ever truly be alone.
This is probably going to terrify you, but you’ve got a ticking time bomb in your lap, or your purse, or nestled into your back pocket. If you have a consumer electronic device powered by a rechargeable battery there is a very good chance it is a lithium-based battery. Which means when you toss your kid your phone, you’re tossing them a firebomb too.
Of course the likelihood of that device actually exploding is pretty small. “Something like 1 in 10 million,” Ken Boyce, a battery expert and principal engineer director at UL, told Gizmodo. And as Boyce notes, there are currently billions of lithium batteries out there. Two decades of improvements by engineers and material scientists, assisted by safety science gurus like those at UL, have made the nearly ubiquitous lithium battery safer. Yet the fundamental nature of lithium batteries means the potential for a weenie roaster is always there.


That was a rude awakening for consumers back in 1995. Apple launched its Powerbook 5300 that year, and was one of the earliest adopters of lithium batteries. But when the Powerbook 5300 started catching on fire and a recall was launched, it cost the company millions and tech pundits started ringing the apocalypse bell. Fortunately the tech has now improved to the point that, when Apple batteries started swelling (and sometimes catching fire) in 2007, it was merely a cause for a quiet recall.
That’s why the current Samsung Note 7 fiasco is so fascinating. Following many, many explosions, the Note 7 is the subject of a giant global recall. It’s been banned by multiple airlines, and US officials have told people to  turn of the phone and stop using it forever. It certainly isn’t the first phone to go boom, but a confluence of new tech, and the inherent failings central to battery technology, improved the odds of Samsung’s current firestorm.


Indeed, the central cause of the explosions isn’t new. Heat is the enemy of the lithium battery. Heat degrades the battery’s potential to hold a charge, which is why your phone runs down faster in the heat of the summer or when you use it for an extended period of time. And on rare occasions there can be too much heat. That’s when you get thermal runaway.


“Thermal runaway is the technical term for the popular term of explosion,” Professor Yang Shao-Horn, the W.M. Keck professor of energy at MIT, told Gizmodo with a chuckle. Then she clarified. “It’s not actually an explosion, just a fire.” Thermal runaway is a chemical reaction where heat grows exponentially—which isn’t good when the chemicals getting heated rapidly, like those in a lithium battery, are also highly flammable.
Lithium batteries are nothing more than a mess of very flammable chemicals smooshed together and exposed to an electrical charge via electrodes. There are two primary electrodes in a lithium battery, the anode and the cathode (think the plus and minus sign on your AA battery). Energy goes in through the anode and out through the cathode and the two components are separated by an organic material that holds lithium salts—which is a fantastic element for efficient energy containment and transfer.
If the anode and the cathode experience contact with one another, then a thermal runaway can occur. Early lithium batteries were contained in flimsy looking bags which led to them easily being punctured, the anode and cathode touching each other, and the whole thing going poof. But later batteries aren’t immune either.

In the video above, you see a standard lithium ion battery (18650) like those found in a vape or bundled together in the battery pack of a Tesla Model S. As soon as the nail punctures the battery, the anode and cathode touch and thermal runaway occurs.


The potential for explosion due to a puncture can be mitigated with better battery construction—which is why you generally don’t have to worry about your Tesla Model S turning into charcoal after a car crash.
From what Samsung is currently reporting, the Note 7's flaming failure was something akin to the above nail example. A failure in the production of a number of Note 7 batteries meant undue pressure was being exerted on some of the battery packs, and in turn, increasing the likelihood that the anode and cathodes would come into contact.
It’s a plausible conclusion, according to Shao-Horn. But she doesn’t rule out another potential thermal runaway cause: overcharging. That’s when the positive electrode on the battery becomes so juiced up it begins to create oxygen inside, which wrecks the delicately balanced chemical composition of the hermetically sealed battery and leads to thermal runaway.


“These processes can happen even in a perfect battery,” Shao-Horn said, referring to overcharging and anode on cathode contact. Manufacturing defects like the ones reported in the Note 7 failures and those linked to the explosions of cheap vapes, “only make these two processes much worse.”
And they’re not the only processes. Even a bad USB cable can harm your device! The charging process in a phone or laptop or vape is delicate, and the batteries we use, are potentially dangerous—a ticking timebomb if managed incorrectly. That’s why the FAA always tells you to carry all your lithium batteries in the cabin. That way if they catch fire the crew can respond quickly. It’s why Apple quietly replaced swollen laptop batteries nearly ten years ago, and why Samsung, despite the massive loss to its bottom line, is currently replacing defective Note 7s.


It’s also why the UL exists. People like Ken Boyce work very hard to build out the safety science they then disseminate to vendors. If you follow UL’s guidelines to a T you’re less likely to see your hoverboard destroyed or your vape setting a pocket aflame. Because there exists, within every lithium battery, the potential for thermal runaway. So protect your batteries, keep them out of the heat, and make sure you don’t overcharge them or use the wrong cable or powerbrick.


And if the company starts a recall on your product return it ASAP. Otherwise it could be your hotel room going up in flames.

The US Air Force has declassified a harrowing video showing the heads-up display of student pilot who passed out during a tight maneuver. Mercifully, his F-16 was equipped with a ground collision avoidance system, saving him from certain death.
It’s called the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, or Auto-GCAS for short. It took nearly 30 years for the USAF to develop this system, requiring the help of NASA, Lockheed Martin, and its own Air Force Research Laboratory. The USAF introduced Auto-GCAS into its F-16 fleet in late 2014, and it’s already saved at least four pilots, including the one in this video.


Auto-GCAS works by continuously comparing a prediction of the plane’s trajectory against a pre-existing terrain profile. If the system predicts an imminent collision with the terrain profile—as it does at the 26-second mark of this video (you can see the two chevrons come together)—the autopilot kicks in. Writing in Aviation Week, Guy Norris explains what happened:
In this instance, an international F-16 student pilot was undergoing basic fighter maneuver training with his USAF instructor pilot in two separate F-16s over the U.S. southwest. The student rolled and started to pull the aircraft but experienced G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) as the F-16 hit around 8.3g. With the pilot now unconscious, the aircraft’s nose dropped and, from an altitude of just over 17,000 ft., entered a steepening dive in full afterburner.
After only 22 sec., the F-16 was nose-down almost 50 deg. below the horizon and going supersonic. The shocked instructor called “2 recover!” as the student passed 12,320 ft. at 587 kt [675 mph, 1,086 kph]. Two seconds later, with the nose down in a 55-deg. dive, altitude at 10,800 ft. and speed passing 613 kt [705 mph, 1,134 kph]., the worried instructor again calls “2 recover!” In a little less than another 2 sec., as the now frantic instructor makes a third call for the student pilot to pull up, the Auto-GCAS executes a recovery maneuver at 8,760 ft. and 652 kt [750 mph, 1,207 kph].
And that’s when the student pilot finally woke up, pulling back on the stick. The radar altimeter suggests a minimum altitude of about 2,940 feet which, at that speed, isn’t a whole lot of breathing room.


A close call indeed—and kudos to the USAF for developing such an amazing system. It probably won’t be much longer before these high-speed fighter jets become fully autonomous, replacing us feeble humans.

Using a brain implant, Stanford researchers have developed a mind-machine interface that allows monkeys to text at the very reasonable rate of 12 words per minute. Eventually, the system could be used to help people with movement disorders to communicate more efficiently.
The new technology, developed by Stanford researchers Krishna Shenoy and Paul Nuyujukian, allowed monkeys to move a cursor across a keyboard and select letters without having to lift a finger. The animals transcribed passages from the New York Times and Hamlet at a rate of 12 words per minute.


This isn’t the first time that scientists have used a brain-computer interface (BCI) to enable thought-controlled typing, but the new technique, described in the latest edition of the Proceedings of the IEEE, improves upon earlier techniques more than three fold.

Other techniques, which rely on eye tracking or facial movements, tend to be tedious (just ask Stephen Hawking), while previous versions of BCIs have resulted in slow and imprecise typing among paralyzed human test subjects. The new system improves upon these earlier efforts, enabling “a typing rate sufficient for a meaningful conversation,” in the words of the researchers.


For the experiment, the researchers implanted a multi-electrode array into the brains of two rhesus macaques. The device reads signals from a brain region that normally controls hand and arm movements. “The interface we tested is exactly what a human would use,” noted Nuyujukian in a statement. “What we had never quantified before was the typing rate that could be achieved.”
Importantly, the monkeys were tested in ideal conditions—and with “cheat sheets” (the monkeys were simply copying the text being shown to them—there’s no actual comprehension). The researchers expect that human subjects will likely text a bit slower than the monkeys, but not by much. That said, this system doesn’t have auto-complete functionality which would most assuredly be used in a human version.
Encouragingly, multi-electrode arrays, though invasive (they have to be surgically implanted), are proving safe and durable in both non-human and human test subjects. It won’t be long before this technology enters into the real world. And who knows, it may eventually be used by anyone who wants to text with their brains instead of their thumbs.

For the first time ever, scientists have produced live mice without a fertilized egg cell. The potentially revolutionary technique could one day allow gay men to produce biological offspring, or—even more radically—allow both men and women to self-fertilize.
Researchers from the University of Bath injected sperm directly into a modified, inactive mouse embryo. The resulting mice appeared to be normal, and were even able to reproduce. The new study, published in Nature Communications, challenges nearly two centuries of conventional wisdom, showing that it’s possible to produce healthy mammalian offspring without first having to fertilize an egg.


In 1827, biologist Karl Ernst Ritter von Baer became the first scientist to knowingly observe mammalian eggs (in dogs), concluding that all animals develop from eggs. This has largely informed our understanding of reproduction ever since, and until now, no one has been able to show that any cell other than an egg cell can combine with sperm to produce offspring.
It’s not as if scientists haven’t tried. Previously, researchers have “tricked” eggs into developing into an embryo without fertilization, but the resulting embryos (known as parthenogenetic embryos) died after just a few days.


“In some vertebrate species, like geckos for example, parthenogenetic embryos can develop fully to produce healthy live young, but there are no examples of parthenogenetic mammals known to science,” lead author Tony Perry told Gizmodo. “Instead, development peters out after a few days.”


Perry says this has a lot to do with the need for two distinct sets of genomes—one from the mother and one from the father—which, for mammals, is essential to get the right balance of gene expression.
Basically, mammalian sperm can only transform into a mature sperm cell capable of dividing and producing to form a complex organism within an egg—or so we thought. That’s why this new study is so significant. The Bath researchers have shown that a non-egg cell can kickstart this process and completely “reprogram” a sperm cell, resulting in live birth.
Perry and his colleagues exposed mouse eggs to a chemical bath containing a salt called strontium chloride (SrCl2). As previous research has shown, this compound prevents the parthenogenetic embryos from going into a state of arrest. “Essentially, for the egg to be ‘tricked’ into initiating parthenogenetic development, one has to remove the activity that keeps it arrested in the meiotic cell cycle, and that, in effect, is what the SrCl2 does,” explained Perry. (By meiotic cell cycle, Perry is referring to the stage in reproduction when a “mother” cell starts to divide into “daughter” cells, resulting in reproductive cells, namely sperm and eggs.)


Next, the researchers injected sperm nuclei into these chemically modified mouse embryos, kickstarting the reprogramming process. The resulting embryos were then implanted into surrogate mothers.
“As far as we can tell, the [resulting] baby mice were normal and healthy,” said Perry. “We checked how long they lived, and their life expectancies were similar—in some cases longer—to those of controls. We found that the mice reproduced efficiently...and had similarly healthy offspring.”


The researchers aren’t entirely sure how the sperm genome was reprogrammed, but preliminary results suggest a different route than what occurs during conventional fertilization. Future research will be needed to fill in these gaps.
There’s no evidence to suggest the same thing applies to human embryos, but it’s very likely. “Yes, the cells are special—a parthenogenote and a sperm—but imagine if any mitotic cell could reprogram a sperm in the same way,” Perry said. “Then there would be no need for eggs.”


Clearly, many technical and ethical hurdles will have to be sorted out if this is to ever to be used to enable gay men to reproduce (with the help of surrogate mothers), or men and women to self-fertilize. Until then, it could be used to treat infertility and other reproductive issues. This process could even apply to conservation efforts and the assisted reproduction of endangered species.


More philosophically, this research further teases our notions as to when life begins, and how it’s defined. Some individuals believe that life begins at the union of sperm and egg, but this newly developed process would seem to violate that sensibility.
Moving forward, the University of Bath researchers are hoping to learn if their modified embryos can reprogram other cell types and not just sperm, and conversely, whether other cell types can reprogram sperm.

Quadrotors need outside help to navigate and perform their remarkable stunts, whether it be a human behind the controls or an array of complex sensors placed around a room. But not this one. Developed by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, this drone is practically autonomous—which means it’s an actual drone. The future is finally here.
As tech writer Evan Ackerman writes at IEEE Spectrum, Vijay Kumar’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania has succeeded in getting quadrotors to make aggressive maneuvers using only onboard sensing and computing, “meaning that no window is safe from a quadrotor incursion. None. Anywhere. You’ve been warned.” Indeed, it’s an achievement that takes quadrotor flight to the next level.

Normally, external motion-capture systems are what allow quadrotors to zip and flit through the air, guiding them as they dodge obstacles and navigate through hoops. These systems, like the Vicon motion-capture system, records boatloads of information about a given room, and then transmits that critical information to the drone. In essence, the drone is “dumb,” and it’s the external system that’s actually guiding it.


That’s all fine and well for a university lab, but the inability of a drone to fly on its own is clearly a huge limiter. Without their fancy navigation systems, quadrotors are unable to do many of the things we actually expect autonomous drone to do in the real world, like fly through a window.
Now, after six years of tedious work, the Vijay Kumar Lab researchers have developed a small quadrotor that’s equipped with a single camera, a computer, and an IMU (intertial measurement unit) which allows it to know where it is in space, and then perform trajectory calculations as its executes a planned path. Essentially, the researchers took a room’s worth of external technology and packed it all onto a 250-gram quadrotor. That’s amazing.
“This is the first time that aggressive maneuvers are solved with such a small footprint vehicle using only onboard sensors and without relying on external motion-capture systems,” note the researchers.


But as Ackerman explains, there is a caveat: “the location of the obstacles relative to the starting position of the quadrotor are provided to the robot in advance.” This is because its front-facing stereo camera can’t perform the dense mapping required for such a feat, but the researchers say they’re going to resolve this limitation fairly shortly.
Still, what this machine is doing is extraordinary. While in flight, the quadrotor is estimating its location and orientation in space 500 times a second. It can reach speeds of 4.5 meters per second, accelerate at 1.5 g, and roll and pitch at angles of up to 90 degrees.


A few more tweaks by these developers and we could finally start to see these tiny drones in the real world. You may want to keep your windows shut.

Instead of just working on improving what 3D printers are capable of, researchers at the Hasso-Plattner-Institut are also finding ways to make everyday objects more 3D printer-friendly, including those that rely on moving parts that can’t be reproduced during the printing process.
So how do you replicate an object that moves when you’ve eliminated all of its moving parts? By using something called metamaterials which rely on an internal grid of cells, aligned in specific patterns, to give them mechanical properties. The Hasso-Plattner-Institut researchers took things one step further by developing metamaterials that allowed for repetitive and pre-defined directional movement, in order to replicate specific motions or movement.

For example, 3D-printing a door handle and latch isn’t impossible, but it would require you to replicate every last moving part and then assemble them all when complete—a time consuming process. But by using metamaterials, where turning the handle causes the inner cell structure to collapse in a domino effect which then causes the latch to retract, the mechanical object can be 3D-printed in one pass saving time, money, and materials.
The door handle example is a little impractical, since you probably don’t want to use a frail plastic mechanism to secure your home, but the researchers have also designed more useful tools that can be 3D-printed on demand. You might one day have the need for a pair of needle-nosed pliers of a very specific length, and with a 3D-printer you could churn out the exact tool you need, ready to use, without requiring a run to the hardware store.

The moon is our almost constant frenemy in space, lighting our nights and spoiling our star-views in equal turns. But now, new measurements from Apollo-era moon rocks suggest that the moon and Earth had a much more savage past than we knew.
A new paper out today in Nature says that the moon formed as a result of a more violent space collision than previously believed. Since the 1970s, many researchers have championed a theory in which the moon was created from thrown-off debris when a Mars-sized body grazed Earth in a relatively low-contact collision. Instead, the researchers say new evidence shows that the impact was more “like a sledgehammer hitting a watermelon.”


The old theory of the moon’s origin—in which it formed from debris from a grazing collision—neatly explains both the moon’s size and orbital position. But a test on some lunar rocks from the Apollo mission revealed something odd which that theory couldn’t explain.
“We’re still remeasuring the old Apollo samples from the the ‘70s, because the tech has been developing in recent years. We can measure much smaller differences between Earth and the moon, so we found a lot of things we didn’t find in the 1970s,” Kun Wang, an assistant professor at Washington University who is the lead author of the paper told Gizmodo. “The old models just could not explain the new observations.”


If the four-decade old theory were correct, then researchers would expect to find that well over half of the moon’s material had come from that Mars-sized body that scraped Earth to form the moon. But the researchers weren’t finding signs of that in the samples; instead, chemical analyses on the samples were returning isotopic compound readings that were nearly identical.


They started to do more and more advanced tests to try and pinpoint any differences in the signatures. They finally found one—but one that suggested that the samples’ origins were even more tightly connected than previously expected.
The isotope signatures were the same, except for more of a heavy-potassium isotope in the lunar samples which would have required incredibly hot temperatures to separate out. A violent collision between the Earth and the Mars-sized impactor could have caused those incredibly high temperatures. In this model, the temperatures were so high and the force so powerful that the impactor and even much of Earth vaporized on contact. That vapor then expanded out over an area 500 times the size of the Earth before finally cooling and condensing into the moon.
“We need a much, much bigger impact to form a moon according to our study,” explained Wang. “The giant impact itself should be called extremely giant impact. The amount of energy required isn’t even close.”
This new data doesn’t just change our conception of how the moon was formed, though. It also suggests an early solar system that was much more volatile than we knew—and it could be just the beginning of what new analyses on old lunar samples could teach us.


“Everything we know about the early solar system is from our study of meteorites and lunar samples, all those really really old rocks,” said Wang. “It has changed our understanding of the early solar system, it’s much more violent than we thought.”
The researchers will continue to study the Apollo lunar samples to try and pull yet more clues from them. Even now, they suspect that these samples that we’ve been holding on to for decades could have more secrets to reveal.
Attention, moon-fearing humans: your long-held suspicion that the full moon can interfere with life on Earth seems to have a scientific basis after all. No, the moon still doesn’t make you crazy, horny, or murderous. But it seems it can help trigger large earthquakes.
Since the 19th century, scientists have debated whether the gravitational tug of the Moon and the Sun influence seismic activity here on Earth. In recent years, evidence has been mounting that the ocean’s twice-daily high tides can result in small, slow-moving tremors. But to date, this relationship has been restricted to specific environments and parts of the world, such as the the San Andreas fault in California.


Now, we have the first strong evidence for a global relationship between the larger, monthly lunar cycle and powerful rumbles within the Earth. Examining three separate seismic databases, a team of geologists at the University of Tokyo has found an overlap between some of the largest quakes in recent memory (magnitude 5.5 or above), and periods of high tidal stress, when the Sun and Moon are aligned to yield the strongest gravitational tug on the Earth. Those events include the 2004 Sumatra quake (magnitude 9.3), the 2010 Maule quake in Chile (magnitude 8.8) and the 2011 Fukushima quake in Japan (magnitude 9.0).
While the details of how large earthquakes form and evolve haven’t been fully worked out, the process is thought to involve a number of small ruptures cascading to form a really big one. Based on the new analysis, it would seem that such a cascade is more likely at the full or new moon, when the Sun and Moon are exerting the maximum amount of strain on the Earth. The authors also found that the fraction of large earthquakes compared with small earthquakes increased as tidal stress increased.


“[The study] suggests that the small additional encouragement from the tides can actually make an earthquake grow a bit larger than it would have otherwise,” Nicholas van der Elst of the U.S. Geological Survey told Gizmodo. “This is surprising, considering how small the tidal stress is, compared to thestresses generated by the ongoing earthquake.”
Don’t expect this to be the final word on the matter—many factors are involved in triggering earthquakes, and within the geologic community, there’s a wide spectrum of viewpoints on the importance of the Moon’s role. Still, the new results could be valuable to those in the earthquake prediction business, because, as the authors note, they “suggest that the final earthquake size can be estimated probabilistically.”
More generally, the discovery could lead to new paradigms for understanding Earth’s most epic shakeups.
“If the observation can be confirmed,” van der Elst said, “this sort of tidal triggering could teach us something pretty fundamental about how earthquakes start, grow, and ultimately run their course.”

Hillary Clinton has been diagnosed with pneumonia, fueling ongoing concerns about the Democratic presidential nominee’s health. Here’s what you need to know about this common illness, and why Clinton will quickly bounce back.
Video taken yesterday during the 9/11 ceremony in New York showed Mrs. Clinton being taken to her car by security aids. She approached the car with wobbly legs, finally collapsing just as she was about to enter the vehicle.


Clinton, as we now know, has pneumonia, and she’s currently on antibiotics. Her diagnosis may sound bad, but this illness is quite common and very treatable. The next few days and weeks might be rough as she battles a nasty cough and some fatigue, but she’ll likely bounce back fast.

Clinton was apparently dehydrated and “overheated” at the 9/11 event, which in conjunction with the pneumonia caused her to fall ill. Soon afterwards, her physician, Lisa R. Bardack, said Clinton was re-hydrated and “recovering nicely.” That said, the presidential nominee has canceled a trip to California.


The timing is bad. Not only is Clinton in the midst of a heated presidential campaign against Republican nominee Donald Trump, there’s been rampant speculation about the 68-year-old nominee’s health. Clinton has been uncharacteristically tight-lipped about her health, fueling speculation that she’s not as fit as she claims to be.
But Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis is hardly Earth-shattering. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute estimates that four million Americans contract the illness each year, the vast majority of whom make a full recovery. Clinton will likely be no exception.
Simply put, pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. It’s caused by many different germs, including bacteria, viruses, and even fungi. When microbes reach the lungs, the body’s immune system reacts by dispatching cells to attack them. But sometimes, these immune cells cause air sacs to form in the lungs, known as alveoli, to become inflamed or fill with fluids and pus, causing the symptoms of pneumonia.
Clinton’s doctors didn’t specify the exact type of pneumonia that she’s dealing with, but she likely has bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinton’s doctors prescribed antibiotics, which suggests she doesn’t have viral pneumonia—otherwise she would have been put on antiviral medicines.
Symptoms can vary from mild to severe, and depend on a number of factors, such as the type of germ causing the infection, and the age and overall health of the individual. They include high fever, shaking, chills, a persistent cough with phlegm, shortness of breath, chest pain while breathing or coughing, and suddenly feeling worse after a cold or flu.


Older people sometimes experience sudden changes in mental awareness, such as temporary confusion. Around one in five people with pneumonia will require hospitalization. Most can be treated at home.
The key to getting over pneumonia is treatment and rest. Adults typically start to feel the effects of the medicine within about three days, and it usually takes about three weeks for a person starts to feel like themselves again, although sometimes it can take about a month to get over feeling fatigued.
This bout of pneumonia isn’t likely to pose a long-term problem for Clinton, given that the vast majority of cases can be treated. There’s little reason to expect complications, as well, since Clinton doesn’t have a serious pre-existing health condition that we know of. The illness may slow Clinton down for the next several weeks while she recovers, and some rest might do her some good.


As for concerns that this illness will somehow affect her ability to campaign and govern as president, that’s completely unfounded. But this episode should send a clear message about the need to communicate clearly. If Clinton is truly healthy, then people should know about it. Otherwise, the conspiracy nutters will fill in the information gaps with all sorts of nonsense.

After promising biblical rains and instead giving California crabs, El Niño passed away quietly last spring. But while early data suggested La Niña would rise to fill the chasm El Niño’s departure had left in our meteorological newsfeeds, NOAA is now starting to think La Niña might not happen at all.
As early as last winter, climate forecasters told us they were “reasonably confident” La Niña conditions would emerge by late 2016. As the spring wore on, our confidence in the anti-El Niño climate pattern grew stronger, bolstered by the expansion of a telltale, cold water undercurrent in the equatorial Pacific. When that cold water mass started to breach the surface last May, ending the reign of El Niño’s hot blob once and for all, climatologists forecasted a 75 percent chance La Niña would be here by the end of the year.
But late last week, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center poured some cold water on our hope that lots and lots of cold water would spread across the Pacific’s midsection, perhaps even making a temporary dent in our global, carbon emissions-fueled heat wave. Last week, the La Niña watch was officially taken down. Forecasters are now placing their bets on ENSO-neutral conditions (aka, neither El Niño nor La Niña) persisting through the winter.


What changed? As a blog post by NOAA explains, we’re still measuring cooler-than-average temperatures across the so-called Niño 3.4 region of the tropical Pacific, which are considered typical for La Niña. But that temperature dip hasn’t been accompanied by the La Niña atmospheric response. By this point, we should be seeing an amping up of the Walker circulation pattern, meaning cool air should be sinking more vigorously in the central and eastern Pacific as warm air rises more vigorously over the western Pacific.
An intensification of Walker circulation would strengthen westerly winds across the tropical Pacific, leading to more rainfall over places like Indonesia. “So far, there have only been some very weak indications of this intensification,” NOAA writes. And without these atmospheric acrobatics, the cool subsurface waters in the Niño 3.4 region are likely to fizzle out.


La Niña could still happen—it might just be a late bloomer. But the probability that we’ll be welcoming a La Niña into the world this winter has been downgraded significantly to about 40 percent.
As disappointing as this is, it’s worth remembering that El Niño, too, was a bit of a let-down. Despite having virtually tied the 1997-98 El Niño in terms of strength, our planetary party guest didn’t end California’s drought, although that may have been an unreasonable expectation. It sorta figures that El Niño’s alter ego would be a no-show.

In a breakthrough that will appeal to both spies and those who work with priceless but frail historical documents, researchers at MIT have developed a camera that uses terahertz radiation to peer at the text on pages of a book, without it having to be open.
Terahertz radiation falls somewhere between the microwave and infrared spectrums, and the research team, including Barmak Heshmat, Ramesh Raskar, and Albert Redo Sanchez from MIT, and Justin Romberg and Alireza Aghasi from Georgia Tech, chose that particular flavor of radiation because of how it reacts with different chemicals. Different chemicals produce a distinct frequency as they react with different terahertz frequencies, which can be measured and distinguished. In this instance, it allows the researchers to tell the different between ink and blank paper.
Complex algorithms and software is required to translate the frequencies being bounced back to the camera, allowing it to distinguish letters on a page. But it also relies on how far the short bursts of terahertz radiation are traveling, by precisely timing how long it takes to reach the 20-micrometer-thick air gaps between pages of a book, it’s able to calculate when it moves from page to page.

In its current form the terahertz camera can accurately calculate distance to a depth of about 20 pages, but it can only distinguish characters on a page to a depth of about nine pages. The device also requires the paper used to have some degree of transparency. However, as the detectors and emitters used are further refined, the researchers feel their system could be a fantastic tool for museums or other facilities who want to explore and catalog historical documents, without actually having to touch or open them, and risk damage.

It’s been called “the worst infectious disease ever recorded among vertebrates.” The devastating effect of the chytrid fungus on frog populations around the world has contributed to the extinction of at least 200 species and no one knows where it came from. But now scientists are hoping to tweak the amphibian’s evolutionary development by bulking up their bods with small doses of the very thing that’s killing them.
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been wreaking havoc on frogs for 20 years now. The amphibian skin fungus causes the disease chytridiomycosis. When a frog is infected, its skin ceases to function properly. Because frogs breathe underwater and absorb key nutrients through their skin, a chytridiomycosis diagnosis is most certainly terminal.


Jessie Bushell, director of conservation at the San Francisco Zoo, is part of a search-and-rescue mission that is focused on saving the mountain yellow-legged frog by immunizing it against the chytrid fungus. This particular species has seen more that 90 percent of its population disappear as the fungus spreads across the Sierra Nevada. She explained to NPR just how quick and vicious this problem is, “when it hits, it’s within weeks that they’re just gone, just literally gone.”
For twenty years, the deadly fungal disease Bd has been wiping out amphibians across the world. But …
Last Summer, Federal biologists found dozens of the mountain yellow-legged frog dying and decided to attempt to save the species by collecting their young. The biologists then handed over the hundreds of tadpoles to Bushell’s team to start experimenting.


Using a treatment that originated at UC Santa Barbara, the conservationists at the San Francisco Zoo began immunizing the young frogs with small amounts of the chytrid fungus in an attempt build up their immunity. “Their bodies identify it and can already be primed to fight off that infection, at least to keep it under control because they’ve seen it before,” she says. After infecting her test subjects, Bushell gives them an anti-fungal treatment that pulls them back from the brink of death. Once healthy, the frogs are released into the wild.
This is the third year that Bushell’s team has conducted the experiment. Roland Knapp, a biologist with UC Santa Barbara says, “they seem to be surviving pretty well.”
Evolution takes its time and it will be a while before we know if this approach can build a generational resistance. Knapp says that we are facing “what could be the extinction of a significant fraction of the world’s amphibians,” and “if we can do something to reverse that, even for a few species here and there, we should try to do that.”
Scientists have been arguing over the authenticity of an ancient document called the Grolier Codex for 50 years. A new analysis published in a special section of the journal Maya Archaeology has concluded that the codex is indeed genuine, making it the oldest surviving manuscript from the pre-Colombian era.
Perhaps you’re not familiar with the Grolier Codex. It’s the surviving pages of a 20-page book, made of stucco-coated bark paper folded into an accordion shape. The pages are painted with typical Maya iconography—gods, warriors, slaves, and hieroglyphs, for instance—and include a calendar charting the movement of the planet Venus.


Legend has it that looters ransacking a cave in Mexico came across the badly damaged pages in the 1960s, along with a turquoise mask, a sacrificial knife, and some blank pieces of fig-bark paper. That’s according to a Mexican collector named Josue Saenz, who claimed he was contacted by the looters and taken by plane to a remote airstrip to collect the items—although at least one archaeologist, Donna Yates, has called this account “fantastical.”
Saenz’s questionable account and subsequent actions cast doubt on the authenticity of the fragments from the start, even though the other artifacts have since been shown to be genuine. Scientists tested the codex in 2007, but couldn’t decisively settle the matter of its authenticity, partly because while many of the materials used were pre-Colombian, some of the wear and tear in the pages seemed artificial. It was possible a gifted forger may have used materials from the right period to throw off archaeologists. And radiocarbon dating revealed the blank pages of bark paper found with the codex pegged them to around 1230 AD.
“It became a kind of dogma that this was a fake,” co-author Stephen Houston of Brown University said in a statement. “We decided to return and look at it very carefully, to check criticisms one at a time. Now we are issuing a definitive facsimile of the book. There can’t be the slightest doubt that the Grolier is genuine.”


Along with Harvard University’s Michael Coe, and Mary Miller and Karl Taube of the University of California, Riverside, Houston reviewed all the known research on the codex.
That included assessing the manuscript’s origins, the carbon dating results, the various deities depicted, how the bark paper was made, the Maya blue pigments, and thin red sketch lines underneath the paintings, among other aspects. The team concluded that a forger in the 1960s simply could not have known all the details required to create such a forgery. Many of the deities shown in the codex hadn’t even been discovered then, for example, and scientists didn’t successfully make Maya blue in the lab until the 1980s.
There are three other known (authenticated) ancient Maya manuscripts, known as the Dresden, Madrid, and Paris Codices, in addition to the Grolier Codex. There are variations among them, but all include astronomical calendars tracking the movements of heavenly heavenly bodies. And radiocarbon dating shows the Grolier predates the other three.
“A reasoned weighing of evidence leaves only one possible conclusion,” the authors wrote. “Four intact Mayan codices survive from the Precolumbian period, and one of them is the Grolier.”

New research from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln shows that a widely-used class of nicotine-based insecticides is causing queen bees to lay substantially fewer eggs than normal. This particular class of insecticides—the most popular in the world—has also been linked to colony collapse disorder, a mysterious phenomenon in which the majority of worker bees suddenly abandon the hive, leaving immature bees and the queen behind.
Previous research has shown that neonicotinoid insecticides have a detrimental effect on bees, resulting in impairments to foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. But few studies have looked at the effects of neonicotinoids on the queen bees in particular, who are the mothers of most—if not all—bees in a beehive.


In the latest study published in Scientific Reports, lead author Judy Wu-Smart and colleagues found that queen bees in colonies who were fed a sweet syrup laced in Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, laid substantially fewer eggs than normal. Depending on the dose, the queens laid anywhere from one-third to two-thirds fewer eggs compared to queens in unexposed colonies.
“The queens are of particular importance because they’re the only reproductive individual laying eggs in the colony,” Wu-Smart said in a statement. “One queen can lay up to 1,000 eggs a day. If her ability to lay eggs is reduced, that is a subtle effect that isn’t (immediately) noticeable but translates to really dramatic consequences for the colony.”


With the help of Marla Spivak from the University of Minnesota, Wu-Smart evaluated colonies populated by 1,500, 3,000, and 7,000 honey bees. The control colonies received untainted syrup, while the test hives received samples with insecticide doses of 10, 20, 50, and 100 parts per billion. This was done over a three-week period, resulting in a number of adverse effects to the queens and their broods.


In addition to an impaired ability to lay eggs, the queens also exhibited poor locomotor activity. Workers experienced impairments to foraging and hygienic activities, and the colony as a whole experienced poor development overall (e.g. poor brood production and reduced pollen stores). The larger the colony, however, the lesser the effect, suggesting that larger populations act as a buffer to offset pesticide exposure.
These results are a strong indication that neonicotinoid insecticides are contributing to the global decline in bee populations. Growers typically apply insecticides or sow insecticide-treated seeds during early spring, when bees are at their most vulnerable. But Wu-Smart says that banning neonicotinoids is not the solution. Rather, she advocates for regulating insecticide-treated seeds the same way that sprays and other application techniques are regulated, and recommends that farmers be smart about when they conduct their aerial sprays (i.e. not on windy days).
“In many of these cases, we want to figure out why these colonies are dwindling when they should be at their peak production,” said We-Smart. “[Our study] is providing some of that insight. It’s not answering all the questions, but it’s definitely something to consider.”

Secretly gloating over the misfortunes of others (a.k.a. schadenfreude) might not be the most noble of human traits, but it’s certainly universal—so much so, that it was memorably immortalized in the hit musical Avenue Q. Neuroscientists may have just identified the brain cells associated with that feeling.
Discovering these so-called “schadenfreude neurons” was serendipitous—a side benefit of the main study, whose key findings were focused on neurons associated with observational learning. The gory details of both conclusions are outlined in a new paper in Nature Communications.


Human beings often learn by watching how other people succeed or fail at specific tasks. That’s the essence of observational learning. “Observational learning is the cornerstone for our ability to change behavior,” senior author Itzhak Fried of the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a statement. “It’s human nature to want to learn from other people’s mistakes rather than commit your own.”
For the study, ten epileptic patients who had electrodes implanted deep in their brains—standard procedure for epileptic studies—were asked to play a card game in which they would draw a card from one of two decks. The odds were stacked against them in one deck, so that they only had a 30 percent chance of winning. The other deck was rigged in their favor, giving players a 70 percent chance of winning. By comparing their own results with those of two other players, each participant was able to figure out which deck gave them the best chance of winning.


The researchers noticed a change in the firing of brain cells deep in the frontal lobe—specifically in a brain area associated with decision-making, emotion, and social interactions—that corresponded to whether the players thought their opponents would win or lose. Furthermore, the cells responded differently after players learned whether their prediction was correct or not. They concluded that those brain cells were learning from those cues and using that information to calculate which of the two decks to draw from next.
This may sound similar to mirror neurons—special brain cells that fire not only we perform a particular action, but also when we watch someone else do the same. But there is a key difference. Granted, both types of neuronal response relate to social interactions and learning. According to lead author Michael Hill (now based at the Swiss National Science Foundation), however, the specific activity of these neurons (encoding errors of observational prediction) is quite different from mirror neurons.
The most surprising observation was that those cells also showed increased firing activity whenever a player won, or his or her opponents lost, and decreased activity when a player lost and the opponents won. That’s the basic definition of schadenfreude: we experience pleasure when we win, but also when others lose.

But how can we know for sure that the increased activity observed in these neurons is truly an indication of the emotion we call shadenfreude? Hill is quick to clarify the oft-repeated adage that correlation doesn’t necessarily imply direct causation.


“What we are actually seeing is that the activity correlates with schadenfreude; within the limits of this study, we cannot know what the causal relationship is,” he told Gizmodo. “It might be that these neurons simply differentiate between winning and losing, and between self and other, even if we personally are not actually feeling any schadenfreude at all.”
That’s a much more difficult question to answer. “Making the jump from neuronal activity to a feeling that we experience is one of the hardest problems we face in science today,” said Hill. “It boils down to the question of how does the matter of the brain lead to the experience of the mind, and is actually referred to as ‘the hard problem’ in neuroscience.”

Actual lab tests have revealed that the commonly-cited five-second rule doesn’t hold up. And yet, they still can’t stop me from eating this piece of floor candy! Who’s in charge now, Science?
The five-second rule—which says that you can still happily snack on fallen food as long as you scoop it back up within five seconds—has been the subject of some disagreement among scientists. Previous lab tests have suggested that there might actually have some backing behind it, but although the tests took place in a lab, they didn’t come with an accompanying published study. The only published study on the subject had found that bacteria transfer did indeed start happening from the first moment your food hits the floor.


Now, a new study published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology by researchers at the University of Rutgers confirms there is no grace period of five seconds for your food to spend on the floor. More bacteria can get on your food the longer it’s on the floor, but, just like in the previously published study, they found that contamination had already started at initial food-to-floor contact.
Researches also found that the type of food that’s fallen down and the type of surface it fell onto matters. Falling on stainless steel may sound like the cleanest option, but carpet was actually the best floor surface to eat off of—beating steel, ceramic, and wood—probably because its rough texture minimizes contact with the floor. Additionally, the higher the moisture content of the food, the more quickly it picked up bacteria. Of the foods tested, a watermelon sample picked up the most bacteria, while a gummy candy picked up the least. So, perhaps that floor candy is, if not good-to-eat, better than the other options.

Many DUI offenders revert back to drunk driving once their car breathalyzers have been removed, making these gadgets useless from a rehabilitative perspective. But a new pilot project shows that these devices, when used in conjunction with rehab, are effective in preventing future DUIs.
A car breathalyzer, more formally known as an alcohol ignition interlock device, measures a person’s blood alcohol content and prevents them from starting the vehicle if they’re impaired. Depending on the nature of the offense, drivers must use these devices for a mandated period of time, typically a few months through to an entire year.


While installed, car breathalyzers reduce re-arrests for DUIs by nearly 70 percent. But once these devices are removed, drivers typically revert back to their old ways. Re-arrests for DUIs are similar to those offenders who never had interlocks installed. Car breathalyzers, therefore, are good at reducing DUIs while they’re installed, but they don’t really serve a rehabilitative purpose.
At least not on their own. In a new study published in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, researchers showed that car breathalyzers, when used in conjunction with a rehabilitation program, resulted in a dramatic decrease in DUIs even after these devices were removed.


The study, led by quantitative sociologist Robert Voas from the UCL Institute of Education, followed the results of a 2008 Florida policy mandating alcohol abuse treatment classes for DUI offenders with car breathalyzers. Drivers who committed three or more interlock violations—that is, two failed attempts to start a car with a blood content level greater than 0.5 percent within a four-hour period—were mandated to attend rehab for eight to 12 weeks.


To gauge the effects of this policy, Voas, with the help from the US Centers for Disease Control, the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, compared two groups: drivers who received treatment while their interlocks were installed and those who just had the interlocks installed. Results showed that the 640 individuals who went to rehab experienced a 32 percent decrease in re-arrests during the 12 to 48 months afterward compared to the non-treatment group.
The researchers say that the resulting decline in impaired driving probably prevented 41 re-arrests, 13 crashes, and nearly 9 injuries in crashes following the interlock removal.
This study shows that alcohol ignition interlock programs should include alcohol abuse treatments to prevent future DUIs. More obviously, it suggests that all multiple DUI offenders should be sent to rehab anyway, and that these interlock gadgets are basically useless at preventing future indiscretions behind the wheel.

A disturbing new report shows that 1.3 million square miles of the Earth’s wilderness has been lost since the 1990s—an area half the size of Australia. The researchers say this “catastrophic loss” highlights the need for an international agreement to protect our planet’s invaluable forests.
Our planet has lost a tenth of its global wilderness in just two decades, according to a new Current Biology study authored by researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society and the University of Queensland. In a statement, lead researcher James Watson described his team’s findings as “staggering and very saddening,” adding that the findings “underscore an immediate need for international policies to recognize the value of wilderness and to address the unprecedented threats it faces.” Watson says we have about 20 years to “turn this around.”


No doubt, further losses to the Earth’s forests could prove disastrous. Wilderness areas perform a number of important functions, such as providing fresh water, food, and medicine. Forests are gigantic carbon sinks, sucking up greenhouse gasses and expelling precious oxygen. They also stave off the effects of erosion, reduce extreme weather, and even work to support many of the planet’s most politically and economically marginalized communities. But as Watson points out, our forests are “completely ignored in environmental policy.”
For the new study, the researchers mapped wilderness areas around the globe, with “wilderness” being defined as an area with biologically and ecologically intact landscapes free from significant human disturbance. The updated map shows that 11.62 million square miles (30.1 million square kilometers) still remain as wilderness, which is approximately 20 percent of the world’s land area. The majority of these areas are in North America, North Asia, North Africa, and Australia.


But then the researchers compared their new map to one produced by a similar method back in 1993. The researchers saw that about 1.3 million square miles (3.3 million square kilometers) of wilderness has been lost since the early 1990s, with a 30 percent loss of wilderness in South America, and a 14 percent loss in Africa.


“You cannot restore wilderness. Once it is gone, the ecological process that underpins these ecosystems are gone, and it never comes back to the state it was,” said Watson. “If we don’t act soon, it will be all gone, and this is a disaster for conservation, for climate change, and for some of the most vulnerable human communities on the planet.”
Leading drivers of deforestation include the conversion of wooded areas to farms, ranches, and urban use, but forest management policies and environmental laws are failing to prevent developers from taking these efforts too far. Tropical forests are currently experiencing the worst levels of deforestation, yet they’re home to more than half of the planet’s land and plant species.
Deforestation is clearly a serious problem, but it’s not immediately obvious how or if a global consensus can be reached on the matter. Just look at how difficult it’s proving to get an international agreement on climate change—a crisis that’s staring us right in the face.

NASA’s asteroid-skimming spacecraft just blasted off into space without a hitch, completing the first step in a seven-year journey that will eventually bring us back several spoonfuls worth of dirt from an asteroid.
With lift-off taking place in Cape Canaveral, not too far from the site of SpaceX’s exploded rocket, there was some concern that residual damage from the destroyed rocket could delay OSIRIS-REx’s trip up today. But after a review, NASA pronounced the capsule ready and capable of launching on schedule.


The Atlas V rocket carrying the craft blasted off seamlessly at the very start of its two-hour launch window, which you can watch right here.

With a successful lift-off behind it, the journey is still far from over. The spacecraft is scheduled to separate itself just after 8 p.m. Then we’ve got seven more years to wait before the return capsule brings back a few scoops of asteroid dirt—and, perhaps, some answers to our questions about how life started here on Earth.
Until then, there will be quite a bit to tide us over, including the results of a 2-year long mapping mission, which NASA scientists say will give us such a high-resolution map that we would be able to spot a penny on the asteroid. We’ll update you on its progress as the craft continues outward on its journey.


Update 8:04 p.m. And at just after 8:04 p.m. as scheduled, OSIRIS-REx successfully separated from its configuration to continue on its journey. NASA still has a confirmation check coming up later tonight to ensure that the spacecraft is healthy, but all indications are that everything is looking great for the trip to Bennu.
Update 9:30 p.m. NASA reports that the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is communicating with ground control as expected and everything went according to plan for the launch, which principle investigator Dante Lauretta described as “just exactly perfect.”
Now, the wait begins—first for the spacecraft to make its way out to the asteroid and then for the data (and dirt) to come back here.
By building a gigantic petri dish, researchers from Harvard Medical School and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology have produced a jaw-dropping visualization showing bacteria as it mutates to become resistant to drugs.
The new study, published today in Science, is the first large-scale demonstration showing how bacteria react to ever-increasing doses of antibiotics, and how these relentless microbes exploit Darwinian selection to adapt to—and even thrive within—the very medicines meant to kill them.


“What surprised me most about it was that we could actually see evolution happening in front of us,” co-author Michael Baym, a postdoc at the Kishony lab at Harvard Medical School, told Gizmodo. “Here were the abstract diagrams we’d been drawing for years, come to life.”
An 18-month review into antimicrobial resistance warns that superbugs will kill upwards of 10…
Each year, around 700,000 people die around the world from untreatable bacterial infections, and antibiotic-resistant superbugs could kill upwards of 10 million people each year by the mid-21st century. Just today, the UN announced a high-level meeting to discuss possible strategies and countermeasures.


Baym worked with Roy Kishony of Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School on the experiment. They call their giant petri dish the Microbial Evolution and Growth Arena, or MEGA for short. It’s a rectangular platform, two feet wide and four feet long, filled with a gelatinous substance known as agar, a seaweed-derived substance that’s commonly used to facilitate microbial growth. Using the MEGA-plate, the researchers were able to watch antibiotic resistance develop in Escherichia coli.
They divided the MEGA-plate into several sections, each of which was saturated with varying doses of antibiotics. The ends of the platform contained no antibiotics, allowing the bacteria to thrive; these areas represented the starting line. But the adjacent inner sections contained a small amount of antibiotic—just enough to kill the E. coli. Moving inward, each subsequent section of the MEGA plate was treated with a ten-fold increase in the dose of antibiotics. At the very core of the dish, there was 1,000 times as much antibiotic compared to the areas with the lowest dose.

For the next two weeks, the researchers watched—and filmed—as the bacteria died, survived, and adapted to the increasingly poisonous conditions located at the borders of their immediate perimeters. The resulting timelapse video literally shows Darwinian processes at work—a process that would normally remain invisible to the human eye.


As the two-week experiment progressed, the bacteria spread until they reached a potent concentration of antibiotics beyond which they could not grow. That is, until mutants—armed with the specific set of traits required to fight off the poison—finally emerged. This often didn’t take long. At each concentration level, a small segment of bacteria adapted to the hostile conditions, the result of successive accumulated genetic changes.
Once settled in the new section of the MEGA-plate, these tiny populations of antibacterial-resistant mutants were able to grow. When they reached the next section of the platform, the pattern repeated itself. The descendents of this initial group of mutants were able to move to areas filled with higher concentrations of antibiotics. Eventually, multiple lineages of mutants competed for the same space, with winning strains moving on to areas with higher drug doses.
By the eleventh day, the bacteria had migrated all the way to the highest drug concentration in the center. These hardy mutants were capable of surviving an antibiotic known as trimethoprim at a dose 1,000 times greater than the one that killed their ancestors. And some bacteria acquired a 100,000-fold ability to fend off ciprofloxacin, another common antibiotic.


“We were able to evolve over a thousand-fold wild-type resistance to trimethoprim in 11 days— that’s very nearly the saturation limit of the drug,” said Baym. “Put simply, there was no way to dissolve enough drug to kill these bacteria.” Importantly, all bacterial mutants were contained and all materials decontaminated after use.


Observations showed that initial mutations led to slower growth. That suggests bacteria aren’t capable of growing at optimal speeds while in the midst of developing adaptations. But once they stumble upon a fortuitous immunity, it’s all systems go, with growth proceeding at normal rates.
Also, the fittest mutants weren’t always the fastest growers. The most successful bacteria remained behind while the weaker strains were forced to deal with the intense drug doses at the front lines.


“Thanks to the the bacteria needing to migrate to survive, we saw a surprising dynamic by which the strongest weren’t necessarily winning, rather those that were good enough and close enough to the new area would beat out nominally superior mutants just by being faster,” Baym said. “Nevertheless, in every case we saw that this successive accumulation of mutations was able to evolve extremely high levels of antibiotic resistance in a relatively short time.”
Looking ahead, the researchers would like to use the the MEGA-plate to predict the future evolutionary potential of specific pathogens. Armed with this knowledge, future clinicians will be able to tell which antibiotic a pathogen is resistant to, and how it might evolve resistance if certain antibiotics are used.

Throw some dye into milk, add a drop of soap and suddenly the whole thing turns into a psychedelic mess of shapes and colors. Sound familiar? You probably did this science experiment in the 5th grade and felt astounded by it.
Now you’re an adult, and the only way to recapture that magic is to film the same messy process with a gorgeous macro lens. Up close a plate of gross colored milk looks more like a new universe being born. Hell yeah.

Astronomers have discovered a new asteroid—just in time to catch it as it hurtled past us at less than a tenth of the distance between us and the moon. It’s the second time that’s happened in two weeks. What have we done to anger you, space gods?
This most recent asteroid, 2016 RB1, was both slightly smaller and slightly closer than 2016 QA2, the other undiscovered asteroid that brushed by us at the end of August. Still, their specs are pretty similar. 2016 RB1 measured in at somewhere between 25-50 feet and came by us at a distance of 25,000 miles yesterday. 2016 QA2 was around 50,000 miles away and measured over 50 feet.
Despite their close approaches, neither asteroid was actually on-course to hit Earth at all. Still, the fact that they are so close—and we had no idea until they were practically on our doorstep—is a little surprising.


Part of it is due to the classic space problem: Space is very big and it’s easy to miss things even when they are about to fly right through our orbit. The other problem is that it gets much harder to predict what asteroids are going to do once they get closer to us, because of a curious effect of nearing the sun on the paths of asteroids.
Asteroids rotate and, as they come closer to the sun, the side closest starts to heat up. This built up heat can then push the asteroid miles into a different and sometimes hard-to-predict path.
Tonight, NASA is going to be launching their first mission to capture some dirt from yet another near Earth asteroid, Bennu. But they also hope the trip will give them a chance to get a better idea of how these sun-powered pushes, called the Yarkovsky effect, work. If they’re successful, we could get a whole lot better at predicting where nearby asteroids are going to go, before they’re right next to us.
Doctors have this nasty habit of asking a lot of questions, many of which make us uncomfortable or self-conscious. So we bluff. A lot. Here are 10 typical lies we tell our doctors, and why these seemingly innocuous fibs are hazardous to our health.
No, you’re not. Sure, it’s difficult to take medications routinely. It’s awkward to fess up to your GP that you don’t. But now, you’re not just skipping out on prescribed treatment, you’ve given your doctor a dose of misinformation which could result in further adverse effects.


“I need to know whether the patient is taking the meds. If they aren’t, and I assume the drug isn’t working, it may cause me to switch to a different second choice med,” Dr. David B. Agus, the Director of the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine, told Gizmodo. A doctor might also unnecessarily adjust your dosage, since your current one (the one you’re not actually taking) isn’t apparently having its intended effect.
Dosage boosts come with their own set of consequences, such as increased heart rate, dizziness, and fatigue. So now you’re actually undermining your health, which is the opposite outcome of why you went to the doctor in the first place.


Often, the doctor can tell if you’re not taking specific medications—if you show up with elevated blood pressure, or your blood tests indicate high cholesterol. Ultimately, however, it’s really on you. “Be honest about the meds you are taking or not taking,” Agus says, “and then together we can make the right decisions.”
Oh, really? This seemingly minor omission could seriously derail your health. As Agus explains, when his patients don’t tell him about all of the medications they’re taking, he may miss an important interaction or potential side effect. This includes prescription drugs like blood-thinners, antibiotics, antidepressants, and heart medications, as well as supplements and over-the-counter drugs, such as aspirin, minerals, amino acids, botanicals, and vitamins.
“Supplements are drugs and need to be treated as such,” he told Gizmodo. “They should be listed on a patient’s record of their medications.” The nature of drug-on-drug reactions depend on the particular mixture and the unique physiology of the patient, but some drugs pack a bigger punch than others.
Car accidents are no longer the leading cause of accidental deaths in the United States. According…
“These may be painkillers, benzodiazepines, and so on,” Dr. Gail Saltz, an associate professor of psychiatry at The New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornel School of Medicine, told Gizmodo. She says it’s unfortunate when people lie to their doctor about addictive medications they’re taking, or have been prescribed by another doctor. “These medications interact with others and can have an additive effect, which can be dangerous.”


Problematic drug-on-drug interactions can include a dangerous drop in blood pressure, a fast-paced irregular heart beat, a build-up of toxins that damage the liver, and less serious symptoms such as nausea, upset stomach, and headache.
Patients may lie, says Saltz, because they want more of these medications, or because they feel embarrassed. They may also fail to tell their doctor that they are on antidepressants because they feel uncomfortable sharing that psychiatric treatment information with another doctor, or feel that it’s not important.
“Drug interactions make it important for your doctor to know.” says Saltz, “A diagnosis of depression or anxiety is also important to know because some medications can, as a side effect, cause depression or anxiety—and particularly in someone who has already been experiencing that.”
A patient comes in for surgery and the anesthesiologists asks, “When was the last time you had anything to eat or drink?” The patient responds, “Oh doc, I haven’t had anything all day.” It may sound like a harmless fib, but according to M. Fahad Khan, assistant professor of anesthesiology at NYU Langone Medical Center, it could result in disaster.


“It is very important for patients to be honest about that last oral intake of food or drink as it can have significant consequences with regards to their anesthetic plan,” he told Gizmodo. “Patients presenting for elective surgery are assumed to have an empty stomach, because they are prepped to do so.”
Trouble is, when a patient is put to sleep via anesthesia, their lower esophageal sphincter (the valve that connects the esophagus to the stomach) relaxes. During this period of relaxation, says Khan, food contents from the stomach can dangerously regurgitate up into the patient’s mouth and snake their way into the patient’s trachea (windpipe) on their way to the lungs. Once in the lungs, this regurgitated acidic food material can start to cause inflammation and may even lead to the development of a pneumonia.
“Lying to your anesthesiologist about the last time you had anything to eat prior to surgery can have devastating consequences and in a worst case scenario can land you in the ICU,” he says.
Many of us are guilty of this one. Dr. Harriet Hall, editor of Science Based Medicine, says our failure to tell the truth about alcohol consumption is counterproductive. “Underreporting the amount of alcohol you drink will only delay diagnosis and treatment,” she told Gizmodo.


Health experts say that you shouldn’t have more than two-three drinks a day (10-15 per week), adding that’s okay to indulge on special occasions. Health problems can arise when we exceed these limits, including raised blood pressure, abnormal blood-test results, and digestive issues. So if you lie to your doctor about your alcohol intake, and you exhibit these symptoms, you’re potentially leading your doctor down the garden path. What’s more, alcohol—like any other drug—may be influencing the effectiveness of medications you’re taking, and your doctor needs to know.
For those with a more serious alcohol issue, this is a kind of lie that could actually kill them, according Dr. David Juurlink from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. “I’m referring specifically to patients who are admitted to hospital, and who subsequently develop alcohol withdrawal,” he told Gizmodo. “It’s a potentially lethal—and sometimes hard to diagnose—disorder.”


In a hospital, if doctors have been truthfully told about a patient’s alcohol history, they know to watch for withdrawal and treat it accordingly. But if they’re not told or misled about a patient’s alcohol consumption, and the patient goes into withdrawal, health practitioners often look for other disorders that can cause similar findings (e.g. fever, agitation, confusion, etc.), and may forgo what can be lifesaving treatment for alcohol withdrawal.
“Seriously, people shouldn’t worry about being judged by their doctors,” says Juurlink. “Plenty of doctors drink more alcohol than they should.”
Around 13 percent of smokers keep their habit a secret from their doctors. Taken as a whole, that means about six million smokers in the United States are withholding this very important information.


“When I ask them if they’re a smoker they often say they’re an ex-smoker,” says Dave Hepburn, a general practitioner in Victoria, British Columbia. “When I ask how long, some will admit five days or similar.” Needless to say, that does not make one an ex-smoker, particularly if that person has been smoking regularly for years.
People are afraid to tell their doctors the truth because of the social stigma surrounding cigarette use, and because they’re afraid to admit to themselves that they’re engaging in an extremely risky health habit. What’s more, patients may be hiding their habit from their families (who often share a GP) or their employers.
A new British report concludes that e-cigarettes are a blessing rather than a curse, arguing that…
Nonetheless, it’s important to tell the truth. If your doctor knows you smoke, they can recommend further screenings and evaluations, and assign a more stringent schedule of check-ups to catch smoking-related diseases, such as cancer, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and heart disease. It’s also important to remember that your doctor can help you kick the habit before it’s too late.


“Smoking is one of the most important lifestyle changes that can be made that affects health dramatically in many areas ranging from stroke and heart attack to cancers of all types,” Hepburn told Gizmodo.
Given that most recreational drugs are illegal, we’re obviously uncomfortable about sharing these habits with our doctors. Dr. Ramin Manshadi, an Associate Clinical Professor at UC Davis, feels that the vast majority of people who take recreational drugs lie to their doctors about it, yet the truth often shows up in their urine.


Failure to disclose the drugs we’re taking, especially hard drugs, can seriously impede a doctor’s ability to diagnosis a health condition. Marijuana, an increasingly socially and legally acceptable recreational drug, can interfere with other drugs, such as antidepressants, aspirin, blood thinners (e.g. warfarin and heparin), antiplatlet drugs, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. ibuprofen). It can also affect blood sugar levels and cause low blood pressure.
Importantly, if you’re being taken to the hospital for a drug-related reason, or if you’re on some kind of drug when a health emergency happens, you should tell your doctor or the ER so they know exactly how to treat you and save you from something potentially much worse than a bad trip.
“It’s very important to disclose your drug use to your doctors specially if you are having a heart attack,” says Manshadi. “If a patient is having a heart attack and they have used cocaine for example, then we cannot give them some beneficial meds that we normally give heart attack patients,” adding that the combination “can cause worsening of heart attack and possibly death.”
“If your cholesterol is up, blood glucose is high, as is your blood pressure, don’t just say you’ve been going through a bad period when your life has been bad for as long as you can remember,” says David Jenkins, professor of Nutritional Sciences and Medicine at the University of Toronto. “You need help. You need a change in lifestyle. And if that’s not sufficient then you need a change in meds.”


Dr. G. John Mullen says that too many patients try to sound perfect for their doctors, but lying about exercise in particular only hurts the patients. “We all know diabetes and heart disease are major problems in developed countries,” he told Gizmodo. “Exercise and diet are the best methods for beating these diseases, so don’t lie about it! Overlooking the daily necessity of nutrition and exercise is a big problem. Be honest and get some helpful tips from your doctor.”
A patient may tell their doctor that they’re only taking about 1 to 2 tablets of Tylenol once in a while, but in reality they’re taking about two tablets every four hours around the clock, seven days a week. As Dr. Khan explains, acetaminophen toxicity is real and can be deadly.


“Doctors need to know an accurate record of how much over-the-counter acetaminophen a patient is actually taking in order to prescribe them a safe pain management plan,” he says. “Several pain medications (i.e. Percocet, Vicodin, Norco, Ultracet) are combination pills that include a strong acting opioid medication in addition to acetaminophen.”
Khan says a patient’s liver doesn’t know where all the acetaminophen is coming from, nor does it really care. It’s just trying to figure out a way to metabolize the copious amount of medicine safely and effectively.


“The most recent guidelines for the use of acetaminophen have suggested that no more than 4,000 mg (some even cite 3,000 mg) as the upper daily limit of allowable intake,” says Khan. “So now if a doctor is under the assumption that a patient is only taking a small amount of over-the-counter acetaminophen on their own, he/she may unknowingly prescribe a combination pain medication—one that that also contains acetaminophen—that will put the patient at risk for potentially developing liver failure.”
Some of us go to the doctor and under-exaggerate our symptoms in hopes that the doctor won’t find anything wrong with us, or to feed our inflated egos in regards to how much discomfort we can handle. This is obviously a huge no-no.


As an example, Dr. Mashadi points to patients who have had stents implanted to treat blockages in their arteries. “They downplay their symptoms because they do not want to end up getting another stent,” he explains. “This is dangerous since the sooner we find out there are issues, the better the outcome.”
On the other hand, Manshadi says there are patients who have financial hardships and downplay their symptoms so they don’t have to pay their deductibles and/or co-pay. “This is also dangerous,” he says. “The advice is to always the truth to your doctors. As much as legally possible, I would discount patients that can not afford to pay or refer them to free clinics. Health comes first.”


Similarly, Dr. Mullen says he has patients who come in and downplay the amount of aches and pains they’re feeling, saying they keep quiet about neck, shoulder, or low back pain. “Unfortunately, these painful areas may be more problematic than they think,” he says. “Many systemic diseases refer pain to other areas (i.e. referral pain). If it isn’t a referral pain, it doesn’t mean it isn’t serious. Regular joint pain should be addressed early and referred to a physical therapist, as pain can increase risk for joint degeneration and replacement later in life.”
As Dr. Hall pointed out to Gizmodo, about 40 to 80 percent of medical information provided by doctors is forgotten immediately, and much of what is remembered is remembered wrong. “Get the doctor to provide written information, read it carefully at home, and prepare questions for the next visit,” she recommends.


Clearly, our ability to understand and remember our doctor’s instructions and admonitions is critical to getting better and staying healthy. When we don’t comprehend something our doctor says, we might not take our medications correctly, or we might engage in risky habits if we don’t truly understand the implications of a concussion or an x-ray.
We need to stop pretending and nodding our heads in agreement when our doctors start talking gobbledygook. As patients, we’re the non-experts, so we need to check our egos at the door. It’s okay to ask your doctor for clarification. Remember—that’s their job, and just like you, they want to see your health improve.
With only a few days left before it’s scheduled to crash-land on the surface of Comet 67P, the Rosetta spacecraft is still yielding amazing discoveries. And I’m not just talking about lost comet landers.
Scientists now report that Rosetta detected complex organic molecules in the dust surrounding its comet. This strengthens the argument that the building blocks of life itself may have come from icy space rocks.


Complex organic molecules—mixtures of mostly carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen that form the basis of our biology—have been hinted at on comets before, most notably during fast flybys of Halley’s comet. But Rosetta is the first mission to actually catch dusty organic particles escaping the surface of such a body, affording scientists a detailed look at their composition.
Two of those dust grains, curiously nicknamed Kenneth and Juliette, are the subject of a scientific paper published this week in Nature. Captured in May and October of 2015 and analyzed with Rosetta’s on-board mass spectrometer, each of these wee grains contains carbon-based molecules bound together in very large structures, similar to the organic matter found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites here on Earth.


“Our analysis reveals carbon in a far more complex form than expected,” Hervé Cottin, a co-author on the new study, said in a statement. “It is so complex, we can’t give it a proper formula or a name!”
The finding is significant for a few reasons. For one, it builds off early discoveries made by the Philae lander in the hours before its batteries went dead on Comet 67P’s surface. While Philae only sniffed very light, gaseous organic compounds known as volatiles, the new analysis focused on large, solid particles, which indicate more complex organic chemistry.


Second, scientists have long debated whether the organics found in meteorite samples come from space, or whether these rocks were contaminated after crash-landing on a biological planet. The discovery of similar molecules in space itself strengthens the argument that the carbon-based stuff we see in meteorites came from beyond Earth.
Finally, Rosetta’s discovery offers a tantalizing glimpse of what’s to come from NASA’s OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. A first-of-its kind attempt to grab a scoop of dirt from a space rock and bring it back to Earth for analysis, OSIRIS-REx is expected to give us a detailed look at the makeup of the rogue bodies buzzing our planet’s backyard. That mission launches today, by the way—so even as we say goodbye to Rosetta, expect plenty more on whether all of the Kenneths and Juliettes out there are your distant ancestors in the years ahead.

Extreme, catastrophic flood events like the one that swamped Louisiana last month are becoming more likely because of climate change, according to a hot-off-the-press analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
The study found that the record rainfall responsible for last month’s epic floods—the worst natural disaster to hit the United States since superstorm Sandy—was made at least 40 percent more likely by global warming. The researchers arrived at that conclusion by applying a new but increasingly popular statistical approach called “weather attribution.” Details of the analysis, which is currently under peer review, can be found in the open-access journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences.
“We found human-caused, heat-trapping greenhouse gases can play a measurable role in events such as the August rains that resulted in such devastating floods, affecting so many people,” NOAA geophysicist Karin van der Wiel said in a statement. “While we concluded that 40 percent is the minimum increase in the chances of such rains, we found that the most likely impact of climate change is a near doubling of the odds of such a storm.”


The no-name storm began around August 11th when a low-pressure air mass rumbled up the Gulf of Mexico, stalling out over the Louisiana coast for several days. As I explained at the time, a combination of high air and sea surface temperatures fed an incredible amount of moisture into this system—moisture that was then hauled inland and unleashed over neighborhoods from Baton Rouge to Livingston. Over several days, the storm dumped three times as much rainfall as Hurricane Katrina, with some locations receiving 20 inches of precipitation in just 48 hours. Rivers overflowed and flooding ensued.
By August 17th, flood waters had claimed 13 lives, more than 30,000 people had been rescued, and over 60,000 homes suffered damage.


For some, it’s easy to look at an event like this and pinpoint the fingerprints of climate change. After all, records show that the frequency of heavy downpours has increased along the Gulf Coast since the mid-20th century, which makes sense because a warmer atmosphere can hold and dump more water. And yet, the majority of meteorologists are still reticent to discuss climate change in their reporting, due to a combination of cultural and political factors, and the relative novelty of scientific research tying planet-wide changes to weather.
That’s why the attribution studies now being done by NOAA and others are so critical. They are building a foundation that legitimizes the connection between extreme weather and climate change through statistics.
In the new study, scientists at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and elsewhere examined the risk of devastating, three-day flood events along the central Gulf Coast from the early 20th century to the present. Observational data told the researchers that the frequency of extreme flooding had indeed increased in this part of the country. Using climate models, they were able to reproduce a similar uptick in flood frequency by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That’s the attribution part.
According to NOAA’s models, the odds of a Louisiana-like downpour drenching the central Gulf Coast have increased by at least 40 percent since 1900. It’s worth noting that changes in the frequency of heavy downpours are unlikely to be limited to the Gulf Coast. Climate models show that while some areas, notably the southwestern United States, are expected to become drier this century, others, including the midwest and Pacific Northwest, will likely see an uptick in the number of extreme rainfall days.


The point of doing all this is not to arrive at some arcane statistical conclusion. It’s to help emergency responders, planners, and the public understand how weather risks are changing so that we, as a society, can be better prepared.

A blue-ribbon panel commissioned by the Obama administration has released a report describing 10 transformative research strategies designed to increase the speed at which cancer research is conducted—but it’s not clear if US Congress will commit the necessary funds.
The 28-member Blue Ribbon panel presented its report to the National Cancer Advisory Board earlier today. To come up with its recommendations, the committee organized several working groups involving some 150 experts, who focused on such topics as pediatric cancer, improved data sharing, and clinical trials.

In total, the panel made 10 recommendations which it believes represents the “most compelling” opportunities available to speed progress against the disease; the ultimate goal of the Cancer Moonshot initiative is to make “a decade’s worth of research progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in just five years,” and to “bring the most promising science and clinical developments to cancer patients in the near term.”


The 10 recommendations are as follows (a full description of each item can be found here, along with accompanying summary videos):
It’s a diversified strategy, one that recognizes the need to merge science, technology, advocacy, social science, and big data.


Vice President Joseph Biden, who lost a son to brain cancer more than a year ago, is leading this campaign, pledging, “I plan to do two things: increase resources—both private and public—to fight cancer, and break down silos and bring all the cancer fighters together—to work together, share information, and end cancer as we know it.”
A groundbreaking new therapy in which white blood cells were reprogrammed to attack cancer cells is …
Importantly, the recommendations stress the need to create a clinical trial network dedicated to immunotherapy—a revolutionary new line of research that leverages the body’s own immune system to to fight cancer. The proposal to increase testing for hereditary cancer syndromes is likewise prudent, as these conditions are known to increase risk for breast, colon, and other cancers.
The proposals are appropriately ambitious given that cancer claims 600,000 American lives each year, but as the Washington Post makes clear, the recommendations come at an uncertain time:
Many of the ideas would require millions—if not hundreds of millions — of dollars in additional funding, but Congress has not yet approved any extra spending for the moonshot effort. And within the cancer community itself, federal officials are still struggling to overcome skepticism that the moonshot will result in breakthroughs against [the disease]....
And with the election just a few months away, time is ticking on the Obama administration to put these recommendations in action, lest it drop the ball on its promise to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the war against cancer.

Researchers from the UK and Spain have shown that spiders are capable of tuning their webs, allowing these eight-legged critters to receive specific information about their environment, including the presence of prey, potential mates, and the structural condition of the web.
Similar to the strings of a finely tuned instrument, each strand of spider silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies, which propagates throughout the web. This allows spiders, who don’t see very well, to sense the integrity of their webs, and to detect the presence of prey and mates.


Scientist have known about this for years, but they weren’t entirely sure about the precise characteristics of these vibrations, or if spiders had any control over this cool architectural feature. To learn more, researchers from Oxford University and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid explored the links between the material properties of spider webs and how vibrations propagate through the silken strands. Their study, which now appears in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, demonstrates that spiders can in fact tune their webs to transmit specific messages.

Above video: The web, in addition to catching prey, signals vibrations to the spider—who reacts almost instantly upon impact.


Using high-powered lasers to measure the ultra-small vibrations, the researchers isolated three particular web features that allow spiders to turn their traps into data transmitters: web tension, silk stiffness, and overall web architecture. Importantly, spiders are able to manipulate all three of these characteristics.
For example, both transverse waves, i.e. waves that vibrate at right angles to the direction of its spread, and longitudinal waves, i.e. waves that vibrate in the direction of propagation, can be adjusted, or tuned, by the spider when it adjusts the web’s tension and the stiffness of the web’s outer rim and spokes, known as the dragline. In fact, spider webs are so customizable, the researchers hypothesize that specific features of silk evolved for this very purpose.
“[We] propose that dragline silk [features] may have evolved as a control mechanism for these multifunctional fibres,” write the authors in their study. “The various degrees of active influence on web engineering reveals the extraordinary ability of spiders to shape the physical properties of their self-made materials and architectures to affect biological [i.e. data transmission] functionality.”
So when a spider builds its web, it’s not just constructing a trap and blindly hoping its design will lend itself well to the propagation of specific vibrations. Rather, the spider is working like a diligent engineer, building a stable web that performs its primary trapping function, while also optimizing the web’s ability to relay critical information. It’s essentially constructing—and then fine-tuning—its web to be a multi-function device.
At the same time, the spider has to constantly balance trade-offs between the structural integrity of the web and the web’s ability to transmit signals at specific frequencies.


Wow. Spiders are truly amazing.

We already know that spider silk is something of a wonder material, but scientists are still…
Tomorrow night, an asteroid-bound mission will launch towards a shadowy space rock, Bennu. There, it will scoop up a bit of dirt and deliver it back to us, all without ever attempting a landing. It’s not just any dirt, though. Bound up in these grains could be the answer to how life first emerged here on Earth.
Researchers have long theorized that comets or asteroids could have been responsible for delivering the first specks of organic materials or perhaps water that got things brewing on our planet. We have even found organic materials and chemically-bound water in meteorites that may have come from carbonaceous asteroids like Bennu.


The problem is that these meteorites have spent so long on Earth that there’s no way of knowing whether organic compounds inside them came from asteroids, Earth itself, or somewhere else along their journey. This will be the first time that we ever have the opportunity to check that profile directly from the asteroid.
“The reason we go to an asteroid like Bennu is we believe it’s a pristine remnant of the very early solar system,” Ed Beshore, the project’s deputy principal investigator, told Gizmodo. “It’s important because we want to answer questions about the rise of life on Earth.”


It will take two years until OSIRIS-REx even arrives at Bennu, and another two years before the sample is taken. The samples will get back to Earth in 2023.
Still, there are several things that the mission can teach us even before we bring a little piece of the asteroid back. For one, it could help us better predict which asteroids are going to come close to us, and how close they’ll get.


Bennu belongs to a category of close-by asteroids called Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs). In fact, this proximity was one of the reasons it was chosen for the mission. But, as we’ve seen lately, the orbit of those NEAs—even when they buzz right next to us—can be hard to predict. This is due primarily to something called the Yarkovsky effect, which happens when asteroids are heated by the sun.
“Asteroids get hot,” explained Beshore, “like how asphalt streets get hot on the Earth. They rotate like the Earth does and that re-radiated heat acts like a tiny rocket thruster which can actually move the asteroid around.”


Since 1999, NASA has seen Bennu shift its trajectory over 99 miles from this effect. By studying Bennu’s movements up-close, researchers hope to get a better idea of just how—and how much—the Yarkovsky effect is moving asteroids around.
The real prize from Bennu, though, are the four tablespoons of asteroid dirt that will be scooped up by the spacecraft at the mission’s conclusion and packed into its return capsule. How it will accomplish this collection is one of the trickiest aspects of the mission.
Before any sample-taking is even attempted, scientists will first make a painstakingly complete map of the entire asteroid, a process that could take up to two years. From that first map, they’ll identify a dozen or so potential sampling sites, then create even more refined maps to choose the spot most likely for success.
“By the end, we’ll be able to see an object the size of a penny on Bennu,” said Daniella DellaGiustina, the mission’s lead image processing scientist. Once they’ve selected a spot, though, things get even more harrowing.


While the craft buzzes the asteroid, a 10-foot-long “pogo arm” comes forth—like a boxing glove on a spring—to grab the sample. It’s not just a simple scoop, though. The arm uses puffs of nitrogen gas to swirl some dirt from the asteroid up into a storage compartment in a matter of seconds. If the sample collection isn’t successful the first time, engineers have made plans to do a couple loop-backs, but as soon as the compartment has a full sample, the craft will immediately depart back to Earth.
“It’s a safe, slow, smooth high-five to collect that sample and bring it back to Earth” explained Christina Richey, the mission’s deputy program scientist. The entire collection will take just five seconds, she noted, but in those few seconds and approximately 60 grams of dirt, scientists are hoping to find answers to some of their oldest questions about life on Earth.


“We’re fairly confident that there’s going to be some of these organic compounds but until we get it back down to earth we won’t know for sure,” Richey said.
Getting the samples back to Earth also presents a significant challenge. The spacecraft will take the dirt most of the way back, but it’s not equipped for a landing. Instead, it will eject the capsule four hours above Earth at a speed of 27,000 mph. A parachute will help it descend safely in Utah and, after seven years, researchers will finally be able to get their hands on those bits of dirt from an asteroid.


“This is really an opportunity to bring back a piece of the very early solar system,” Beshore said. “These samples can be analyzed for decades, just like the moon samples returned over 40 years ago are still being analyzed using tools we didn’t even know would exist, and of course the same will happen on the samples from Bennu.”
The launch takes place Thursday night from Florida’s Cape Canaveral station, aboard one of the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rockets. It’s the 13th major NASA mission to use that rocket.
There was some concern that last week’s fire from a SpaceX rocket—which also took place at the Cape Canaveral station, but from a different launch pad—might delay the launch. But after a full assessment, NASA said there was no damage to facilities for this launch or any elevated risk from the blazing Falcon 9 rocket.


OSIRIS-REx is expected to leave on-schedule in a 2-hour launch window starting at 7:05 p.m. EDT. From then, it will be a wait of seven years before we start to get answers about what’s really up on Bennu—and, perhaps, even how life on our planet really got started.
On April 10, 1940, British submarine HMS Tarpon and its crew of 50 were sent to Norway to intercept Nazi merchant vessels. They were was never heard from again. Now, after 76 years, the sub has finally been found. An investigation of the remarkably well preserved vessel shows it didn’t go down without a fight.
The wreck was discovered earlier this year by Gert Normann Andersen, who runs a Danish war museum, and Innes McCartney, a British marine archaeologist. The shattered remains of the vessel, a 275-foot (84 meter) T-class submarine of the Royal Navy, was found in the Danish section of the North Sea, about 50 miles (80 km) from the harbor town of Thyborøn.


The discovery solves a longstanding mystery as to the exact location of the wreck, but historians know exactly what happened to the HMS Tarpon.
The submarine was dispatched from Rosyth, Fife, in order to attack German merchant ships that were supplying arms to Nazi-occupied Norway. German war records show that the British sub attacked the Q-ship Schiff 40/Schürbek, but its torpedoes missed their mark. The German ship then managed to pick up the Tarpon on its sonar, and its periscope was spotted. The Schürbek dropped batches of depth charges in a sustained attack that lasted the duration of the morning. Finally, a calculated series of depth charges struck the ill-fated submarine, causing debris to float to the surface. 50 British crewmen were killed in the attack.


Remarkably, the wreck of the Tarpon still bears witness to this account. Danish divers who recently visited the site observed open hatches, shattered glass in the periscope, and severe destruction below the tower where the depth charge struck. McCartney said the damage was so severe behind the conning tower that “it would have flooded in seconds.” Also, two of the sub’s torpedo tubes were empty, showing that the Tarpon did in fact engage the Schürbek in battle. And incredibly, the divers observed a crater on the seabed, which was formed by one of the powerful depth charges.

Today, the Tarpon sits almost upright under 130 feet (40 meters) of water. The challenge now, say its discoverers, is to protect the historic site from threats, such as fishing trawlers and illegal metal reclaimers. In respect for the dead, no further diving missions are planned.

An incredible 19,000 light years away, in the Sagittarius constellation, lies a brilliant star cluster unlike any other. A new analysis indicates that Terzan 5 is a “fossil relic” from the formation of the Milky Way—and it could help us piece together our cosmic origin story.
For 40 years, Terzan 5 was taken for a globular cluster, a brilliant region of gravitationally-bound space that packs thousands of stars into the distance between our Sun and Alpha Centauri. But after scouring data on this patch of sky collected with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope and space-based companions, an Italian-led team of astronomers has learned it’s like no globular cluster ever studied before.
Globular clusters are ancient—nearly as old as the galaxy itself—and their stars tend to form in a single, brief burst of cosmic time. Terzan 5, however, contains two distinct populations of stars. The dominant population formed some 12 billion years ago, consistent with the age of most known globular clusters. But a second population didn’t form until seven billion years later, around the same time as our Sun.


The higher metal content of the younger generation indicates these stars were polluted with heavy elements generated during supernovae explosions from the older generation. “No genuine globular cluster was able to retain the gas ejected by supernovae,” lead study author Francesco Ferraro told Gizmodo in an email.
As Ferraro and his colleagues write in a new scientific paper, this unusual situation makes Terzan 5 an ideal representative of a key stage in the formation of our galaxy and many others—the assembly of a densely packed, central core known as the “galactic bulge.”


Theory indicates that the formation of the Milky Way’s bulge, some 12 billion years ago, relied on the interaction between enormous clumps of gas and stars, which merged and dissolved in the process. Astronomers have observed this interaction taking place in faraway galaxies at high redshifts.
The size of Terzan 5's second population of stars tells us that a tremendous amount of gas was present in this patch of space during bulge assembly. What’s more, the supernovae explosions required to infuse the younger stars with heavy metals would have ejected a large amount of material out of the system entirely. Taken together, the evidence indicates that when the Milky Way’s bulge was forming, Terzan 5 would have been 500 to 1,000 times heavier than it is today. It was a monster in the sky, laden with primordial gas.


“[Terzan 5] is the relic of a structure that was much more massive in the past: a fossil of the epoch of the galaxy formation,” Ferraro said. “Such galactic fossils allow us to reconstruct an important piece of history of our Milky Way.”
Ferrano and his co-authors are now conducting an extensive search for other stellar systems similar to Terzan 5, which could help us learn more about how our galaxy, and others like it, assembled. Like archaeologists sifting through dust to unearth clues about past civilizations, astronomers are now sifting through layers of information encoded in starlight. The history books are going get a lot longer as a result.
Despite the name “canned air,” computer duster isn’t oxygen at all. It’s actually 1,1-Difluoroethane kept under pressure in its liquid form and released as a freezing cold gas. It can cause moderate frostbite. It can get you high if you huff it (but don’t do that—it’s a truly awful idea.) And it makes boiling water explode. Wait, what?
The easy hypothesis is that the temperature difference between boiling water and liquid 1,1-Difluoroethane causes the duster to rapidly and violently covert into its gaseous state. But TheBackyardScientist gave the same experiment a shot with liquid nitrogen and liquid butane. No dice. To make matters stranger, butane has an even lower boiling point than duster.


So what gives? The Backyard Scientist speculates it has something to do with duster and water both being polar molecules, while nitrogen and butane are not. I’m no scientist, backyard or otherwise. All I know is that if I were planning on making boiling water explode, shorts wouldn’t be my first choice of clothing.
Feel free to speculate on matter scientific and otherwise in the comments.

After 172 days in space, three astronauts are heading back to Earth tonight. For NASA astronaut Jeff Williams, this brings his total days in space to 534 days across his four missions, the most an American astronaut has ever spent in space.
The previous record holder, NASA’s Scott Kelly had spent 522 days in space when he returned to Earth last year. In addition to Williams, Roscomos Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka are also on their way back from the ISS tonight.


The return-bound Soyuz spacecraft will land at 9:14 p.m. EDT tonight in Kazakhstan. But if you turn in early at 8:21 pm, you can also watch the de-orbiting burn of the craft right here.

Hurricane Newton is currently making landfall near Baja California in Mexico. The Category 1 tropical storm—the fifteenth of the season—is churning winds up to 115 mph (185 km/hr), and has already resulted in flooding along the Pacific west coast.
Earlier today, a Hurricane Warning was issued along a swath from Cabo San Lazaro to Mulege, including Cabo San Lucas, and from Guaymas to Bahia Kino, Mexico. At 11:00 am EDT/8:00 am PDT, the hurricane was located about 110 miles (180 km) northwest of Caba San Lucas and 50 miles (80 km) west of La Paz, Mexico.

Newton is expected to produce heavy rainfall over a long distance—from Baja California, Mexico all the way to the US southwest. The National Hurricane Center is predicting total rain accumulations of eight to 12 inches over the Mexican state of Baja California Sur, and five to 10 inches over Sinaloa, Sonora, western Nayarit, and Jalisco.
The outer rainband of the hurricane has already wreaked havoc in Mexico. In Guerrero, nearly 700 homes were flooded and 12 communities isolated, resulting in the mobilization of 817 troops to help with the clean-up. At least three deaths are being blamed on the storm system.
Newton is expected to weaken once it makes landfall later today, but officials warn of life-threatening flash floods and mud slides, particularly in mountainous areas. Americans living in Arizona and New Mexico could also feel the effects of Newton, and are being advised to stay tuned to local weather conditions.

Add this to the growing list of reasons to never go outside again: the human brain is apparently a sponge for toxic magnetic waste found in smog.
That’s according to research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, which examined the brain tissue of 37 individuals age three to 92 living in the UK and Mexico City. The study found that extraordinarily high levels of magnetite, an iron nanoparticle that has been indirectly linked to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s. While biologically-produced magnetite crystals were also found in the patients’ brains, small, perfectly spherical iron particles outnumbered natural magnetite roughly 100 to one.
By carefully examining the particles using electron microscopy, atmospheric scientist Barbara Maher and her colleagues discovered they are precisely the same form of magnetite found in air pollution. It’s the first time this common air-borne pollutant has been directly associated with the human brain.


“These are tiny, tiny little particles—they’re only about the size of a virus,” study co-author David Allsop, a biologist at Lancaster University told Gizmodo. “If you breathe them up through your nose, they’re going to bypass the blood brain barrier and enter the brain quite readily.”
Magnetite nanoparticles are emitted to the air via car exhaust, power plant smokestacks, and pretty much any other industrial, fossil fuel-burning process. “Most fuels will have a bit of iron as an impurity,” Maher explained. “When you have enough heat and a source of iron, you get these very distinctive molten droplets. If they cool quickly enough, they keep that shape.”
According to Maher, the particles are found everywhere: “I haven’t made any measurements of a roadside where they haven’t shown up,” she put it. And at less than 200 nanometers in diameter, they’re far too small to be filtered by a breathing mask, making it nigh impossible for urban residents to avoid some level of exposure.


How much of a danger magnetite nanoparticles pose has yet to be determined, but there is reason to be concerned. They are part of a family of metals that produces reactive oxygen species on contact with organic tissues. “Reactive oxygen species damage the brain,” Allsop said. “There’s already evidence for this specific type of damage in Alzheimer’s, possibly very early in the course of the disease.”
Allsop added that some of the young brains examined in the study showed changes that look like the early stages of Alzheimer’s, supporting the notion that magnetic nanoparticles can cause cellular damage consistent with what we see in dementia. “This is not the last word at all, but it does mean we have to progress the research now,” Maher said.


Of course, we already knew that air pollution is terrible—it accounts for some 5.5 million premature deaths each year by contributing to asthma, heart and lung diseases. Whether or not magnetic waste on the brain should be our top concern as far as dirty air goes, the discovery offers a timely reminder that cleaning up our atmosphere won’t just help the planet, it will save lives.

Researchers at the University of California San Diego have taken a significant step forward in the effort to develop a vaccine against the bacteria responsible for strep throat, toxic shock syndrome, and flesh-eating disease.
Group A Streptococcus, or group A strep, are nasty breed of bacteria that can cause an assortment of infections. Most group A strep infections are relatively mild, such as strep throat and the impetigo skin infection, but occasionally these bacteria go on to cause more serious and even life threatening conditions, such as toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, or “flesh-eating disease.” According to the CDC, around 500,000 people die each year from this bacteria, prompting researchers to find novel ways of staving off these dreaded germs.
You first notice a bump — a tender, cherry red bruise. Over the next 12 hours, the center of this…
In a new study published in Nature Microbiology, a group of researchers from the University of California San Diego have detected previously unseen patterns in the outer protein coat of group A strep. These hidden sequence patterns, called the M protein, limit the body’s immune response against these bacteria. It’s an important piece of insight that shows why the human body is so vulnerable to this bacteria—and how we might be able to develop a vaccine to compensate.


“When we become infected with a particular strain of group A Strep, we generally mount an immune response against the particular M protein displayed by that strain,” explained lead researcher Partho Ghosh in a statement. “But this immunity works only against the infecting strain.”
Ghosh says the bacteria mounts a disguise, leaving us vulnerable to infection by other group A strep strains with other types of M proteins. “This is because the antibody response against the M protein is almost always specific to the sequence of that M protein, and M proteins of different types appear to be unrelated in sequence to one another,” Gosh said.
Insidiously, strep A bacteria uses our own body against us, recruiting a human protein called C4BP which tricks the body into calling off an immune response. But practically all M proteins can bind to C4BP, so if the researchers can develop an antibody that does the same thing, they will have found a way to destroy the otherwise invisible bacteria.


To see if this is indeed possible, the researchers conducted an experimental computational study. The biochemists recreated four crystal structures of four different M proteins—and like lego blocks, each of these structures attached themselves to human C4BP.
“The idea now is to have antibodies do the same thing as C4BP—that is, recognize many different M protein types,” said Ghosh. Assuming this can be done, the researchers will engineer an antibody response that’s not limited to one M protein and one strain of group A strep. And in fact, it could extend to practically all M protein types and strains of group A strep.


It may be years, if ever, before we see this vaccine reach the market. Until then, we can do some practical things to help prevent group A infections. The CDC recommends hand washing, especially after coughing and sneezing, and before preparing foods or eating. People with sore throats should visit their doctor, and if the tests reveal strep, they should stay home from school or work at least 24 hours after starting antibiotics. As for wounds, they should be kept immaculately clean and observed for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, drainage, and pain. Should any of these signs appear, it’s advised that you see a doctor immediately.

Isabelle Dinoire, the woman who received the world’s first partial face transplant with a new nose, chin and mouth, has passed away.
Dinoire suffered catastrophic injuries to her face in May 2005 after her Labrador attacked her while she was sleeping. Less than a year later, she received a partial face transplant—the world’s first and a procedure that drew international attention and acclaim. The surgeons declared it a success but Dinoire struggled over the years as her body never fully accepted the new nose, chin, and mouth, which came from a donor.


Dinoire had been taking powerful immunosuppressant drugs for years, but she became ill last winter after her body rejected a new skin graft, causing her to lose some function in her lips. What’s more, the anti-rejection treatments appeared to have triggered two different cancers. She died on April 22, 2016 at the age of 49, but her death was only announced by the hospital in Amiens, France, earlier today. It’s not entirely clear why it took hospital officials so long to make the news public.
Dinoire’s death is a significant setback in the effort to help people who have lost portions of their face to disease or injury. Some critics contend that such “non-elective” surgeries are wasteful and dangerous.


“From the day of the operation I have a face like everyone else,” said Dinoire after her operation. “I can open my mouth and eat. Recently, I feel my lips, my nose and my mouth.”
A firefighter from Mississippi whose face became disfigured during a rescue attempt is the…
Undoubtedly, Dinoire’s death won’t come in vain. It’s through pioneering work like this—and those who are brave enough to be on the receiving end—that progress is made in the medical sciences.

We eat fish and throw away the scales. But now researchers have figured out a reason those fish scales might be worth saving.
A new paper out in Applied Physics Letters today details a method for transforming fish scales into an energy harvester. Researchers processed the raw scales to make them flexible and then attached two electrodes to each scale before laminating it. The resulting cell could then harvest energy from movement around it, including motion as simple as just vibrations or even a heartbeat. This has researchers suggesting that they could one day use it to power things like pacemakers.


“In the future, our goal is to implant a bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator into a heart for pacemaker devices, where it will continuously generate power from heartbeats for the device’s operation,” co-author of the paper Dipankar Mandal of Jadavpur University explained in a statement. “Then it will degrade when no longer needed.”
That particular application is fairly far off, but the research is an important reminder that there may be a better use for the incredible amount of food waste we’re generating—140 trillion calories  every year in the US alone. A lot of that wasted food is readily-edible stuff that just gets tossed. But there are also inedible byproducts like fish scales and orange peels that could be put to productive use with a little creativity.


“The fish scale is available in large quantity in our society because it is basically bio-waste component and thrown away in food processing,” co-author Sujoy Kumar Ghosh told Gizmodo. To get the scales they used, the researchers simply collected them from a local fish market. Not only is figuring out how to use non-edible food waste for other purposes cost-effective, it gives us a way to use even the parts of food we don’t eat.

Researchers from Rice University say that around 4.4 billion years ago, a Mercury-like planet smashed into Earth, seeding our primordial planet with life-giving carbon. Had this never occurred, it’s an open question as to whether or not life could have ever emerged.
Geoscientists have struggled to explain how life was able to arise on Earth given that most of the planet’s carbon—an important prerequisite for life—should have either boiled away during the planet’s earliest stages or become trapped within the Earth’s core. By conducting high-pressure and high-temperature experiments in the lab, researchers from Rice University have concluded that virtually all of our planet’s carbon likely arrived when a Mercury-like planet smashed into the young Earth some 4.4 billion years ago.


Scientists aren’t entirely sure how Earth’s volatile elements, such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur, were able to remain outside the Earth’s core and stay locked within the mantle. Models show that most of our planet’s carbon should have vaporized into space, or ended up in the metallic core of our planet, sucked up by its iron-rich alloys.
Prior to the new study, many scientists speculated that these volatile elements came to Earth after our planet’s core finished forming. As Rice University geoscientist and study co-author Yuan Li pointed out in a statement, “Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the solar system formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point.” Trouble is, there are no known meteorites capable of producing the required ratio of volatile elements.Three years ago, Li and his colleagues began to take a different approach to the problem. They conducted a series of experiments to assess how carbon’s affinity for iron may have been altered by other compounds present in the Earth’s early environment. Importantly, they considered the potential role of other celestial bodies with characteristically different chemical compositions.


“We thought we definitely needed to break away from the conventional core composition of just iron and nickel and carbon,” noted study co-author Rajdeep Dasgupta. “So we began exploring very sulfur-rich and silicon-rich alloys, in part because the core of Mars is thought to be sulfur-rich and the core of Mercury is thought to be relatively silicon-rich.”
Their experiments recreated the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions found deep inside the Earth and other rocky planets. Results showed that carbon could be excluded from the core and relegated to the Earth’s mantle, provided that the iron alloys in the core were rich in either silicon or sulfur. One scenario that explains this particular ratio is that an embryonic planet—one that already formed a silicon-rich core—slammed into Earth, and was absorbed by Earth.


“Because it’s a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth’s mantle,” said Gupta.
The researchers say this collision likely happened about 4.4 billion years ago, which is only about 150 to 200 million years after the Earth formed. With carbon locked within the crust, and with the planet settling down to produce habitable conditions, life soon emerged. Indeed, the most recent estimates suggest that microbial life formed approximately 4.1 billion years ago.
Researchers working in Greenland have found traces of microbial life in our planet’s most ancient…
It’s important to point out that evidence for this primordial collision is circumstantial as best. The researchers agree that more work is needed to support this theory, including analyses of abundant elements other than carbon. If true, however, it could mean that Earth only became a habitable oasis only after this tremendous cosmic smashup. Carbon forms a key component of all known life on Earth; complex molecules are comprised of carbon bonded with other elements, such as oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.


Regardless, the theory makes you wonder about life on other planets, and how specific the conditions need to be for life to finally emerge on dead, rocky worlds.

Hordes of lionfish have been roaming the Atlantic for several decades now, and their voracious appetite—and lack of natural predators—has seriously upset the ecological balance of those waters. Now there’s a new foundation devoted to building robots to hunt them down—a Terminator for lionfish.
The prototypes under development are technically cousins to robotic vacuum cleaners, because iRobot CEO Colin Angle is one of the founders of Robots in the Service of the Environment (RISE). He and his wife, biochemist Erika Ebbel, were visiting friends in Bermuda, and the group went diving one day, along with a marine specimen collector named Chris Flook. It was Flook who regaled the group with stories of the invasive lionfish, and RISE was born.


Lionfish have been dubbed “Darwin’s nightmare” because of their tremendous adaptability. They are flexible in what they eat, they can thrive in many different environments (salt water or fresh, cold water or warm), and they reproduce like crazy, all year round, rather than having a particular breeding season. Plus they have venomous spikes, discouraging potential predators from eating them in turn.
That makes lionfish a particularly problematic invasive species. Originally from the Indo-Pacific region, the bright stripes and frilly fins of the lionfish made it a popular choice for exotic pet owners. Those same owners likely dumped adult lionfish into public waters in the mid-1980s, and the species reproduced like gangbusters, with devastating ecological results.
In the Bahamas, for instance, lionfish devoured parrotfish and other smaller species that consume plants, the better to keep algae growth in check. Without them, algae bloomed freely and choked the coral reef ecosystems.


“The only thing that we can do is try to eat them,” marine biologist Christie Wilcox—author of a new book called Venomous: How Earth’s Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry—told Gizmodo. Because they are venomous—as opposed to poisonous—they are perfectly edible. “Lionfish venom is largely proteins, which are easily denatured [when cooked],” said Wilcox, and you can even eat them uncooked, as in a ceviche. “As long as you don’t stab yourself along the way, you can theoretically swallow a spine freshly cut from a lionfish and be fine.” She’s sampled lionfish herself, in various preparations. “It’s a flaky, white, sort of sweet fish,” she said.
There’s definitely a growing market for lionfish: Whole Foods sells fillets in certain geographical areas, as do several sea-to-table restaurants in Florida and North Carolina, in particular. But lionfish have to be speared by hand; they lurk in coral reefs, avoiding dragging nets, and they don’t fall for the old bait-on-a-hook trick of pole fishing, either. Spearing them one by one is the only option-and that’s a tedious and time-consuming process.
That’s where RISE’s prototype robotic harvesters can help. The first model uses a pressure-powered spear gun to humanely hunt lionfish, which should start field tests this month. A second prototype is designed to zap the lionfish with electricity, thanks to a robotic arm rigged out with two metal electrodes. “When the probes get to either side of the fish, you basically zap it,” RISE executive director Joe Rizzo told PBS Newshour.
The two prototypes include video cameras, so that pilots can guide the robots through the water, but the ultimate goal is to build autonomous underwater robots to hunt lionfish.

The European Space Agency lost contact with its Rosetta mission’s plucky little lander, Philae, in May 2015. Now the orbiter’s high-resolution camera has found Philae wedged into a dark crack on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Landing a small craft on a moving comet was always an incredibly ambitious mission, but the Rosetta team pulled it off in November 2014, with a few hiccups that ultimately resulted in losing contact with Philae. As Gizmodo’s Maddie Stone reported in January:
When the lander touched down in November of 2014, it bounced twice, and wound up in the dark shadow of a cliff. Without enough sunlight to charge its solar panels, Philae quickly exhausted its power supply. Within 57 hours, it had fallen silent.
Six months later, as Comet 67P approached the sun, Philae briefly woke from its slumber and phoned home. Then, it went quiet again. The DLR’s Philae team hasn’t heard a peep since.
Rosetta’s scientists could only narrow the range of Philae’s final resting place based on radio ranging data from its final transmissions. But while they found a few possible locations, the images were not of sufficiently high resolution to confirm with confidence that the lander had been found.


On September 2, Rosetta’s orbit passed sufficiently closet the comet’s surface for its Osiris narrow-angle camera to capture a high-resolution image of the lander’s body and two of its three legs:
As Comet 67P/C-G heads away from the sun and towards the orbit of Jupiter, there will be less and less solar energy available to power Rosetta and its instruments. So mission planners will crash the probe into the comet in a slow, controlled descent on September 30th. All the while, Rosetta’s instruments will be feverishly collecting and transmitting data, hopefully giving up some spectacular close-up shots of this extraordinary comet.

Lasers are behind so much of our cutting-edge technology. Now scientists at the University of Michigan have successfully shown that is possible to build a working laser with blood, the better to spot tumors in the human body.
A laser is technically defined as any device that creates and amplifies a narrow, focused beam of light whose photos are all traveling in the same direction, rather than in every direction at once, like the light emitted by, say, a flashlight. There are many different types of lasers, from the semiconductor lasers found in laser pointers and DVD players, to CO2 lasers capable of melting through objects. (These were no doubt the type coveted by Dr. Evil when he demanded “sharks with frickin’ laser beams” on their heads in the first Austin Powers movie.)
All you need to build a laser is an empty cavity holding two mirrors on either end—one of which should be half-silvered, so that it reflects some light but lets other light through—and a lasing medium. The latter medium can be a crystal, like ruby or garnet, or some kind of gas or liquid. Really, almost anything that can be made to emit light will do. Pioneering laser scientists Theodor Hänsch and Arthur Schawlow even created the first edible laser out of Jell-O around 1970, trying out 12 different flavors before finding just the right one.


Zap the medium with light or electricity boosts the atoms to higher energy levels—an “excited” state. Then photons are pumped into the cavity. If one strikes an excited atom, that atom will drop back down to its ground state, releasing a second photon of the same frequency and direction. These in turn strike other energized atoms, releasing even more photons. The end result is a sudden burst of coherent light—the laser beam—as all the atoms discharge in a rapid chain reaction. It’s called stimulated emission, and yes, we’ve heard all the dirty jokes before.
In recent years, scientists have figured out how to turn individual cells into functioning lasers, injecting fatty cells in pig skin with fluorescent dye and zapping them with lasers to get them to emit light. In 2011, Harvard scientists built a laser out of a human kidney cell injected with DNA coding for a green fluorescent protein typically found in jellyfish. And the same team of Michigan scientists figured out how to turn the light-sensitive chlorophyll in plants into laser beams earlier this year.
Now Xudong Fan and his Ann Arbor colleagues are back with a new study using a fluorescent dye commonly injected into the bloodstream for medical imaging: indocyanine green (ICG). It’s the combination of the dye binding with proteins in blood plasma that results in the blood emitting light—essentially amplifying the emission and turning your blood into a lasing medium.


Because the dye accumulates in blood vessels, and tumors usually have lots of them, the technique should make it easier to spot tumors in the body. Just inject a bit of ICG and shine a laser onto the skin, using an infrared camera to capture any resulting glow. Fan and his colleagues still need to test the concept in animal tissue. But so far, the blood laser seems promising.

Until Hermine blew through the Florida Panhandle and up into Georgia, Florida had experienced a pleasant, hurricane-free few years. In fact, as The Weather Channel noted, Florida went nearly eleven years without a single hurricane making landfall.
The last hurricane to set foot in Florida was Hurricane Wilma, a Category 3 storm that made landfall in south Florida back on October 24, 2005. Since then 68 Atlantic-based hurricanes have skipped the Sunshine State—more than twice the previous record of hurricanes.

That’s alarming as, according to the National Hurricane Center, 40-percent of Atlantic and Gulf-based hurricanes from 1851-2010 affected Florida. The state has more coastline than any other state touching the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic, so the odds were never in Florida’s favor.


Yet there’s no precise reason why Florida’s hurricane drought lasted so long. Each case of a hurricane skipping the state was entirely unique.
While the hurricane drought lasted a record shattering 11 years, Florida was not without its storms. Nine different tropical storms have touched down in Florida sense Hurricane Wilma.

If you’re taking advantage of the long holiday weekend to visit your favorite theme park, take a moment to learn a little about the underlying physics of roller coasters, via the latest video from the folks at SciShow.
All roller coasters basically involve Newtonian physics 101: inertia, gravity, acceleration, and friction. The higher the train rises, the greater the distance gravity must pull it back down, and the greater the resulting speeds. A roller coaster is constantly shifting between potential and kinetic energy, and the constant variation in forces is part of what makes riding a roller coaster so exhilarating.


This is pretty familiar ground. But SciShow host Michael Aranda also goes into some cool details about the hydraulic launch systems used in today’s coasters, as well as the permanent magnets used in cutting-edge braking systems (as opposed to the standard friction braking).
Just something to ponder when you’re momentarily hanging in free fall at the top of your favorite coaster.

Oklahoma was hit with an earthquake yesterday, its second 5.0+ quake this year. The increased number of earthquakes have been linked to the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking—specifically the underground disposal wells where the run off from fracking is stored. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has taken note of the relationship between the quakes and the wells and has ordered the shutdown of 35 disposal wells.
“This is a mandatory directive,” Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin told CNN.


In February, after a large earthquake shook the state in January, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission cut back on the planned number of wells produced via fracking. Clearly that did not seem to do the trick, which is why Fallin and company are instituting this new shut down.
Fracking is inextricably linked to Oklahoma, which was the site of the first test of fracking back in 1968. But in the last twenty years fracking has become increasingly common. In 1998 a new fracking technique was developed in North Texas that allowed companies to extract natural gas from shale very cheaply.


Since then use of the technique, which shoots water and chemicals into the shale to forcibly move natural gas up and out into containers above ground, has exploded. From Canada to Texas it is the preferred method of natural gas extraction.


But shooting all that water into the shale makes normally very stable rocks very slippery. And slippery rocks means a lot of movement. That’s where Oklahoma’s recent rash of earthquakes are coming from.

Yeah, we know, your CrossFit gym has completely changed your life, you’ve never looked/felt better, and all other exercise programs pale in comparison. But you may want to ease off the intensive workouts now and then. All that over-exertion can actually impair your immune system, according to a new study just published in Frontiers in Physiology.
CrossFit, for the uninitiated, is a grueling exercise program combining high-intensity cardio workouts with strength training, organized into circuits. The idea is to complete as many reps as possible in the allotted time, with little to no recovery time, and to vary the workouts constantly so your muscles don’t become too accustomed to any particular exercise.
It’s attracted a reasonably sized, extremely vocal and enthusiastic—and sometimes annoying—fan base since its introduction in 2000. Even Game of Thrones’ Jon Snow (and world’s worst dinner guest) is a confessed fan: “The high intensity interval training keeps me in shape for fighting wildlings, while the increased muscle mass helps me defend the seven kingdoms against 55-foot giants.”


But there’s a dark side to CrossFit. Too much exercise can be just as harmful to your health as too little. That hardcore culture of “deplete-endure-repeat” can lead to a rare condition known as Rhabdomyolsis (“rhabdo” for short). Basically, extreme exertion can cause muscle cells to explode, leaching proteins into the bloodstream—a place they really shouldn’t be. The kidneys have to work overtime to remove those proteins, and can become badly damaged.
Even if your kidneys recover, your muscles might not ever be the same, because the damaged muscle tissue has been replaced by fatty scar tissue. Do all the military pushups you want, your triceps will still be flabby.
The good news is that relatively few CrossFit enthusiasts train hard enough to develop rhabdo. But a team of Brazilian researchers has identified another health risk of over-training: a weakened immune system.


The scientists recruited a group of experienced CrossFit enthusiasts to perform two consecutive days of intense workouts, finishing in the fastest time possible. Afterward, they assessed the participants’ muscle power, and levels of metabolic markers and anti-inflammatory proteins produced by white blood cells.


They found that too many consecutive CrossFit workouts, with no rest periods, can significantly reduce the number of anti-inflammatory proteins, resulting in a suppressed immune system. On the plus side, the workouts didn’t appear to have much of an adverse effect on overall muscle power.
What do these findings mean for your CrossFit habit?
“For non-athlete subjects who want to improve their health and quality of life through CrossFit training, we recommend that they decrease their training volume after two consecutive days of high-intensity training to prevent possible immunosuppression,” lead author Ramires Tibana of the Catholic University of Brasilia said in a statement. “A rest day is important for recovery for subsequent training sessions.”
So put down that kettle bell and give yourself a break from your Crossfit regime this weekend. Your body will thank you. And you can hit the gym with renewed gusto the day after.

Eat them while you can, people. Pistachios are about to become a whole lot less available.
The USDA recently released a report showing that the United States, one of the world’s two main pistachio producers, would cut the number of pistachios it harvested by nearly half this year, due mainly to California’s punishing drought. This means a loss of over 100,000 tons of pistachios in the U.S. alone—an amount equal to nearly a fifth of the world’s entire 520,000 ton pistachio crop for this year.


Now, a worsening drought in Iran, the other top producer of pistachios in the world, has farmers there predicting that their pistachio harvest is also going to continue to fall dramatically—perhaps even further than the 20,000-ton drop that was already predicted for this year.
USDA says worldwide we’re going to lose 86,000 tons of pistachios this year. That figure sounds unsettlingly big, but the losses would look heavier yet if Turkey hadn’t had a surprise bumper crop which nearly tripled its expected harvest. Even that anomaly, though, still wasn’t enough to offset the loses.


Pistachios join chocolate, red wine, IPAs, salmon, coffee, almonds, and so much more on the list of foods that are going to get harder to come by in our hotter and drier world. On the plus side, however, the world market for edible insects continues to grow.
Sometimes in life, you get lucky and end up living in a normal ant colony. But sometimes, you find yourself shit out of luck, living out your days in a cold, dark abandoned Soviet bunker.
Such is the case for a “colony” of wood-ants in Western Poland. According to research recently published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, using the term “colony” is even a bit of a stretch, because the demonstrated characteristics of the gathering—a lack of offspring, no queens, barely any food—“is a far cry from a fully functional colony.”


The ants were accidentally discovered in 2013 while researchers were busy looking for bats. The colony, the intrepid explorers realized, was actually a kind of ant underworld—it was populated by ants who had fallen through a hole in the middle of another, more normally-functioning colony above. While the ants were able to crawl around the bunker, they weren’t able to escape back up into the hole from which they came.
Down below, in an abandoned chamber of the bunker—originally built to house nuclear weapons—the bizarro ants had constructed an “irregularly shaped” earthen mound. All around the mound, the researchers reported, was a “carpet” of an estimated two million dead ants.


Given the brutal conditions of the bunker—pitch black, freezing cold, isolated from the natural world—it’s not surprising that a bunch of these poor suckers didn’t make it. The researchers haven’t yet managed to pinpoint a definite food source for the ants, though they hypothesized that bat poop and small mites might help. Either way, it’s not nearly enough to sustain an entire colony—but that’s where the lucky ants above come in.
“The continued survival of the ‘colony’ through the years is dependent on new workers falling in through the ventilation pipe,” researchers wrote. “The supplement of workers more than compensates for the mortality rate of workers such that through the years the bunker workforce has grown to the level of big, mature natural colonies.”
“The wood-ant ‘colony’ described here ... is an example of survival of a large amount of workers trapped within a hostile environment,” the researchers conclude.
The whole thing sounds like the skin-crawling plot to a horror movie, but if and when the apocalypse ever comes, you can bet they’ll manage to survive for a little while.

We’ve all been frustrated by city traffic, waiting in a long line of cars for the light to change at an intersection. And then the stupid light turns red again before we can make it through because the cars ahead of us took so long to get going.
A new video by CPG Grey deftly explains what’s going on. Basically, intersections are bad for traffic because they inevitably lead to so-called phantom traffic jams

The problem: densely packed cars become “highly correlated,” meaning that they move in unison. This creates a feedback mechanism in which a tiny perturbation—a single driver braking unexpectedly—will send little ripples of corresponding slowdowns through the entire chain of cars behind him/her. CPG Grey colorfully likens it to a “traffic snake slithering down the road eating incoming cars at one end and pooping them out the other.”


There’s a simple solution: if every driver makes sure he or she maintains the exact same distance between the cars in front and back—no tailgating like a big old jerk!—those tiny fluctuations smooth out and that phantom jam is less likely to develop.
Alas, human beings are basically “monkey drivers with slow reaction times and short attention spans,” not to mention stubborn creatures of habit Getting everyone to change their behavior and coordinate with each other so precisely is pretty much impossible.


A better solution, per the video, is self-driving cars, programmed to maintain those ideal distances between other vehicles at all times. They could even communicate with others wirelessly, removing the need for traffic lights altogether.
That’s right: ban humans, not cars. In Grey’s words, “No more monkeys driving cars.”

The star system Eta Carinae has puzzled astronomers for centuries because of its oddly variable brightness—as bright as a supernova explosion at one point in the 19th century. Now astronomers from the University of Arizona have determined that there were at least two earlier explosions in the star’s long history, making this a very strange star system indeed.
A star can go supernova in a couple of ways. If it’s massive enough, when its fuel runs out—i.e., the nuclear reactions at its core stop—there is no longer sufficient internal pressure to keep the star from collapsing in on itself. When the outer layers hit the core, they explode outward, spewing debris into the surrounding space. Alternatively, matter can pile up onto a white dwarf star, until it gets so dense it triggers an explosion.


Eta Carinae doesn’t fit either scenario. In the mid-1800s, Eta Carinae got so bright it outshone most of the other stars in the night sky, before fading away. That’s the hallmark of a supernova, and the gas and debris produced in that so-called Great Eruption formed the Homonculus nebula. Except Eta Carinae didn’t stay “dead.” It got brighter around 1890, and again in 1953, and abruptly doubled in brightness in 1998-1999.
What the hell is going on?


“Eta Carinae is what we call a supernova impostor,” Megan Kiminki, a graduate student at the University of Arizona, said in a statement. “The star became very bright as it blew off a lot of material [in the 1800s], but it was still there.” She is a co-author of a new paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society detailing these new findings.
Along with her professor, Nathan Smith, and Megan Reiter, a postdoct at the University of Michigan, Kiminki pored over images of the star system taken by the Hubble Space Telescope over the last two decades.
At first they were just measuring the motions of streams of matter being ejected from new stars forming in the Carina nebula. Then they realized the same approach could be used to measure how fast the debris ejected by the star system itself was moving. All those glowing gases of the surrounding nebula make it tough to really see what’s going on. By measuring how fast those gassy clouds are expanding, the team could ferret out valuable clues about the star system’s history.
Specifically, they tracked the movement of around 800 blobs of gas by aligning various images taken at different time periods, and calculating a likely date for the eruption that produced each one. “This is a bit like reconstructing the eruption history of a volcano by discovering ancient lava flows,” said Smith.


It turns out to be quite a violent history. The Arizona team found evidence of two earlier eruptions: namely, the gas that was further away from the Homonculus nebula was moving more slowly than the debris closer in. That means it must have been produced by earlier eruptions, in the 13th and 16th centuries, respectively.
They also determined that Eta Carinae seems to be a binary system, with two massive stars orbiting each other every five-and-a-half years or so—and the larger of the two seems to be in the last throes of life. “We found one of the prior eruptions was... at a totally different angle from the axis of the Great Eruption,” said Kiminki. “The oldest eruption was very one-sided, suggesting two stars were involved, because it would be very unlikely for one star to blow material out onward just one side.”


Exactly what caused the Great Eruption in the 1800s remains a mystery, but the fact that it wasn’t an isolated event adds an important piece to the puzzle. And this discovery is consistent with a subclass of supernova explosions, whereby massive dying stars experience a series of violent eruptions before finally going supernova. In fact, Eta Carinae may have done so already—it takes 7000 years for light to reach us from that region of space.

Scientists working in British Columbia have uncovered the fossils of a small Cretaceous-era pterosaur, showing this extinct flying reptile came in travel size.
Pterosaurs are an extinct group of flying reptiles that were extremely well adapted to flight. Most featured impressive wingspans, extending to between 13 to 36 feet (4 to 11 meters). Incredibly, the largest pterosaur was the size of a giraffe, boasting a wingspan of a small plane.
But the recent discovery of a tiny, cat-sized pterosaur in British Columbia shows that these flying reptiles also came in a pint-sized version. A new study published in Royal Society Open Science describes a rare, small-bodied pterosaur that had a wingspan measuring just 5 feet (1.5 meters). That’s smaller than some condors and pelicans.
Paleontologists don't always speculate about the existence of gigantic, winged reptiles living …
The newly described pterosaur was pieced together from just a few fragments, including a humerus and several fused vertebrae. The researchers, led by Elizabeth Martin-Silverstone from the University of Southampton, categorize it as an “azhdarchoid” pterosaur—a group of short-winged and toothless flying reptiles that represented the final phase of pterosaur evolution.
“The specimen is far from the prettiest or most complete pterosaur fossil you’ll ever see, but it’s still an exciting and significant find.” noted study co-author Mark Witton in a statement. “It’s rare to find pterosaur fossils at all because their skeletons were lightweight and easily damaged once they died, and the small ones are the rarest of all. But luck was on our side and several bones of this animal survived the preservation process.”


The new study shows that flying reptiles were more diverse than previously thought, and that small pterosaurs hadn’t yet been outcompeted by birds during the late Cretaceous some 100 to 66 million years ago. It adds to a growing body of evidence showing that this era wasn’t dominated by large or giant species, and that smaller pterosaurs were well represented during this epoch.

A Hungarian-born man is found ranting in the street that he is “king of the Puerto Ricans.” A perfectly healthy woman feels compelled to undergo over a dozen operations. A man in a straightjacket somehow manages to commit suicide while inside a locked psychiatric ward.
These are just a few of the compelling stories in Mark Rubinstein’s new book, Bedlam’s Door: True Tales of Madness and Hope. (You can read an exclusive excerpt here.) Rubinstein is a former practicing psychiatrist turned novelist who has drawn on his years of clinical experience to follow in the nonfiction footsteps of Oliver Sacks, shedding light on the complexities of the human mind with real stories about real people. Gizmodo sat down with him to learn more.


Gizmodo: What drove you to write this nonfiction book, after years of clinical practice and novel-writing?
Mark Rubinstein: It all came down to my wanting to tell the general public a little bit more about mental illness. When someone has a physical illness, people feel some kind of empathy, but they still respond to an obviously disturbed person with fear. It’s not just your heart, lung, or liver that’s sick—it is you. That is very threatening to people. And people don’t really understand the mental health dilemma, and the issues that mental health practitioners face.
Q: You brought a novelist’s sensibility to these stories, with composite characters and reconstructed dialogue. How much is fiction and how much is nonfiction?


Rubinstein: It is kind of a combination of fiction superimposed on a nonfictional layer of things that really happened. These were all real people and real cases—sometimes a composite of more than one person to protect their privacy. Oliver Sacks was accused of unwittingly giving away the identities of some of the people he wrote about in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.
I never wanted to be accused of anything like that, so I changed everything: times, places, people, venues, even races. I didn’t even use a real hospital. Of course, I couldn’t remember all the dialogue from 30 years ago, but I created dialogue consistent with the story line. But these were all real stories and real people from people I had treated. There isn’t a story in there that isn’t true.
But the overarching theme running through most of the stories is that even with the most bizarre cases, if time is taken to listen to these people and understand their stories and background, perhaps we can offer them help. It’s all about storytelling. That’s what novelists do, and in a sense that’s what patients do when they come to see a psychiatrist: they tell a story.
Q: I was struck by your statement that even people who suffer from the same diagnosed condition can have very different stories.
Rubinstein: [Mental illness] can affect almost anybody, given certain circumstances. Some of the most successful people on the planet have a touch of hypomania. I know physicians and attorneys who don’t have full-blown manic episodes but they are filled with boundless energy. They are restless. They feel bored and unhappy unless they are facing a challenge. And they are highly successful. Take that to a more severe degree, however, and it can be completely disabling. And 100 different people can have 100 different pathways to the same diagnosable psychiatric disorder.
You contrast two very different examples of PTSD in the book, for instance.


Rubinstein: In one case, a police officer was shot while sitting in his patrol car outside a store near Tompkins Square Park in New York City. A bullet smashed through the windshield and hit him in the armpit, ruining his brachial plexus—a complicated series of nerves that serves the entire arm. He almost bled to death in the ride to the hospital, and he was crippled for the rest of his life. The depression, the PTSD, the pain he felt in his right arm—the pins and needles and tingling—was directly related to the psychic impact of that half-second of impact.
Then there is the man I call Nathan, found ranting on Delancy Street that he was the king of the Puerto Ricans. He was a carpenter, born in Hungary, and that skill saved his life at Auschwitz. He watched people disappear into the gas chambers—his family, his entire village. He was the sole survivor. But his PTSD didn’t develop until 40 years later, when he was in America and fell off the ladder while working on a roof, breaking some vertebrae in his back. He could no longer work and began having horrifying nightmares. It’s called delayed onset PTSD. So these two men came by totally different pathways to the same condition.
Q: In both your preface and conclusion, you talk about how mental illness has always been stigmatized throughout history. Is it really any different today?


Rubinstein: Well, today we don’t torture people. As recently as the 1950s, they were lobotomizing psychotic patients. They removed a good portion of the white matter of the frontal lobes of the cortex, and turned those people into—for lack of a better term—the walking dead. They became blunted and unresponsive to most emotional stimuli. It was done to try to improve their lot in life, but it shows how primitive things used to be.


When I was in resident psychiatry, the cops would drag a guy in and tell me, “This guy belongs in the loony bin, doc.” Even if the person was just drunk, they wanted to dump these people off in the psychiatric emergency room rather than take them to the precinct. They didn’t want to be bothered with an agitated, fulminating individual who was obviously disturbed.
What’s really changed is there is a much more scientific and compassionate approach. The popular conception of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) still exists from a famous scene in the 1974 movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest—Jack Nicholson with the bulging eyes and convulsions and coming out of it like a vegetable.


But they now use unipolar leads, and very low, slow pulse electricity. They administer muscle relaxants, so there is no convulsion. There is hardly any retrograde amnesia and what little there is resolves with a matter of days. It doesn’t take 12 to 18 sessions anymore, it only takes between four and six.
Q: You end on a somewhat surprising note of optimism, given that these are such very sad stories. I am curious about why you see hope for the future.


Rubinstein: No matter what kind of progress we make, there will always be people slipping through the cracks. There will always be people who either don’t want to be helped, or can’t be helped for some reason. But transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive new treatment that, so far at least, according to preliminary findings, has tremendously good effects—with no side effects or ingestion of chemicals.
Then there is the promise of gene therapy. At some point in the not too distant future, neuroscience will advance to the point where blood can be taken from a newborn child, and based on that baby’s genome, scientists will be able to predict what mental dysfunctions or illnesses that individual will have a predisposition for. Imagine if you could do that for people with a high risk of schizophrenia or severe bipolar disorder, based on the genome analysis of a two-day-old baby? It would put every psychiatrist out of business.
So in the long run, if the human race survives as a species, I think the prognosis medically [for mental illness] is very good. I am not sure that I am optimistic about the survivability of the human species, but I am optimistic in that limited way.
“How dare you treat me this way!” boomed a husky voice with a thick Eastern European accent. “I’m king of the Puerto Ricans,” came the roar from the packed waiting room.
It was a warm, humid June evening, about eight p.m. Although I’d been a resident for only a few months, my instincts told me this would be one of those nights when the emergency room would earn its moniker as Bedlam’s Door, a revolving carousel of psychosis, with one disturbed person after another being steered to the facility by the police, family members, or friends. “King of the Puerto Ricans,” bellowed the man, his voice reverberating through the corridor. The claim was utterly absurd—from his self-proclaimed royalty to his non-Hispanic accent. It was bizarre, even for the environs of Manhattan Hospital’s emergency room. Another leonine roar of Slavic-sounding speech brought me to my feet. Peering into the reception area, I saw a burly man bound securely to the confines of a high-backed wooden wheelchair. Despite his raging, the man—appearing to be in his sixties—had a cherubic-looking face, with round, rosy cheeks and bushy, dark eyebrows. A huge mane of white hair crowned his head. Highly agitated, he struggled against the canvas straps binding him to the wheelchair. Though his ankles were secured to the contraption’s front rigging, he managed to kick and stomp his feet on the footrest. “Let me go. I have work to do,” he roared. His words were barely comprehensible, partly due to his agitation, but also because he lapsed into a foreign language—perhaps Polish, or some other Slavic-sounding tongue. He shook the wheelchair violently, attempting to break free. A woman wearing a drab housedress tried to quiet him, but he kept shouting. A police officer I knew saw me and approached. “What’s up, Officer Romano?” I asked. “He was running down Delancey Street, tossing trash baskets and shouting. We couldn’t control him. He’s as strong as an ox. You hear what he’s yelling?” Romano shook his head. Over the years, he’d brought his share of patients to our doors, but this one clearly perplexed him. That week I’d already encountered the putative son of God, an enraged Moses, and Satan himself. But I never imagined meeting the king of the Puerto Ricans. “Who’s the woman?” I asked. “His wife. She said his name’s Nathan . . . Nathan B.” “Any previous history you know of?” I asked. “Nope. The neighbors say he’s always been a quiet guy and a hard worker. A carpenter.” A carpenter? Why doesn’t he think he’s Jesus? Romano looked at me with raised eyebrows. “You’re not gonna give us trouble with this one, are you, Doc?” He knew I’d sent the police packing scores of times with drunken and disorderly miscreants they dragged to the emergency room, trying to avoid tossing them into the precinct’s drying-out tank. The cops hated babysitting drunks almost as much as they loathed the paperwork involved. But Nathan B. was a man lost in the throes of madness. “Looks like you’re safe on this one, but let me talk to his wife.” Mark RubinsteinSarah B.’s pale face sagged. Her gray hair was tied back in a bun. She dabbed at her reddened eyes with a handkerchief. In the housedress, she looked like a Russian or Polish peasant woman from a bygone era. “Mrs. B., how did this start?” “It was maybe two weeks ago, Doctor,” she said with a thick accent. “After Nathan hurt his back.” “What happened?” “He’s a carpenter and was working on the roof of a house. He fell down onto a pile of wood. He’s lucky to be alive,” she said, again dabbing at her eyes. “He broke a bone in his back, and now he can’t work. Maybe never . . . Only if it heals, the doctors said. And they don’t know—a man his age. He’s sixty-four. And, all he knows is work.” “What happened after the accident?” “After he got out of the hospital, he was very quiet. He talked to no one—not even me. He just looked out the window. He wasn’t my Nathan anymore.” “What do you mean?” “He seemed so sad, so depressed,” she said, brushing away a tear. “Did he ever have an episode like this before?” I asked, wondering if Nathan B. might be suffering from bipolar disorder. “No. Never. But after he got hurt, he began talking to himself—strange words. And then came dreams, terrible dreams. He would cry out in his sleep. And when he woke up, he would shake and be covered in sweat. He was so wet, I had to change the sheets. He would pace all night, like a wild beast. And talking to himself—under his breath, in Hungarian. I tell you, Doctor, we never talk in that language . . . only English. “I asked him, ‘Nathan, what’s wrong?’ and he said, ‘I have nightmares.’ But he would tell me nothing more. He said, ‘Sarah, you would not want to know.’ “It got worse. He would never leave the house.” Her lips trembled. “When he heard sirens, he shook. He thought they were coming for him.” “The police?” “Yes. He said, ‘They’re coming for me.’” “Did he tell you why?” “He wouldn’t say. He never did a thing wrong in his life.” Tears spilled from her eyes. “I know it’s from his life in Europe.” “What happened?” I asked, fairly certain of the events to which she was referring. “The Nazis,” she murmured, as her hands went to her face and she sobbed. “Mrs. B., where are you from originally?” “We’re from Hungary.” “When did you come to the United States?” “We came in 1947, after the war.” “Where were you during the war?” “Nathan lived through Auschwitz. But he never talks about it.” “And what about you? Were you in the camps?” “No. I lived with a family on a farm. And I met Nathan after liberation.” “In a displaced persons camp?” She nodded. “And we came here. We made a good life together.” When Nathan was wheeled into the office, his eyes bulged and his face shone with sweat. His shirt was soaked with perspiration. He was restless and his eyes darted from the walls to the ceiling. I introduced myself, saying, “I’d like to talk with you.” No response. He seemed lost in some inner world. He wore work pants, heavy boots, and a short-sleeved work shirt. His chest was broad and powerful-looking. His hands, large and roughly calloused, were those of a man who’d done carpentry all his life. His forearms, strapped to the wheelchair’s armrests, looked as though cables were bundled within them. A series of blue-black numbers was tattooed on his left forearm—a remnant of Auschwitz. “Mr. B.?” “How can you do this?” he growled. Suddenly, his eyes crawled over me. Spittle formed at the corners of his mouth. “Do what?” “How dare you tie up a king!” he shouted hoarsely. “How did you become king?” “God made me king. Do you question his word?” His chin quivered. I said nothing. “Answer me,” he demanded. “Do you question God’s word?” He trembled so intensely, the wheelchair shook. “No. I don’t question God or his word,” I said. “But why king of the Puerto Ricans?” “Such a poor people . . . and persecuted. They must go to their own land.” His eyes roamed about the office once again. “What is this place?” he demanded. “You’re at Manhattan Hospital.” “What am I doing here? I’m not crazy.” “You were running down the street, throwing trash cans . . .” “I was calling my people . . . my subjects.” “What did you have in mind?” “We must leave before the SS gets here.” “What makes you think they’re coming?” His face tightened, and sweat dribbled from his hairline. “Can’t you see? There’s no time left.” “Before what happens?” “We’ll be taken away . . . to the camps. They want to kill all of us.” “Kill who?” “My people. All the Puerto Rican people. It will be a holocaust.” “Why now?” “The time has come.” His eyeballs rolled upward and he fixed his stare at the ceiling. He began muttering a goulash of English, German, and Hungarian. Nathan B.’s mane of white hair, coupled with his upward gaze, reminded me of Renaissance paintings depicting ancient prophets—maybe something by Caravaggio—painted in dusky colors with ethereal light radiating from some godly presence. “Mr. B., I understand you began feeling bad a few weeks ago . . .” His garbled muttering continued. He was lost in a world of messianic revelation. The extent to which deluded thinking could seize a person never failed to amaze me. I tried again to get him to talk. “I’m king of the Puerto Ricans” was all he would say in English. “Mr. B., I’m going to admit you to the hospital,” I finally said. His incantations stopped. He turned to me, his eyes burning with pious fury. “You want to make me a slave, so I will work for you.” “You won’t be a slave,” I said. “You’ll be here until you calm down.” “You Nazi. God will make you pay for this.” I’d tapped into his past—and the source of his madness.

A 5.6 magnitude earthquake shook parts of the US Midwest earlier this morning, rattling homes from Nebraska to North Texas. The unusually strong quake will likely draw further scrutiny to the practice of disposing oil and gas field wastewater deep underground.
The US Geological Survey recorded a 5.6 magnitude earthquake at 7:02 am this morning in north-central Oklahoma. It was centered about nine miles (14 km) from Pawnee, Oklahoma. A second quake was recorded less than an hour later, measuring 3.6.

Initial reports indicate that the earthquake was felt as far north as Nebraska, and in large metropolitan areas such as Dallas and St. Louis. No major damage or injuries have been reported, but officials in the city are meeting to form a plan to assess damage and determine potential next steps.


This earthquake is similar to one that struck the region five years ago, but quakes of this magnitude are exceptionally rare. Oklahoma has experienced many quakes in recent years, but the vast majority have been under 4.0. This is already the second 5.0+ quake to hit the region this year. Back in January, a swarm of 32 quakes struck northwest Oklahoma in a 24-hour period.


Experts say the quakes are related to an increase in the disposal of waste water from oil and natural gas drilling. A Tulsa World analysis has shown that the volume of waste water that’s being stored underground has jumped more than 80 percent over the past six years, which also happens to coincide with the state’s sudden proclivity to earthquakes. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has already imposed restrictions on the amount of water that can be injected in certain areas, but this latest quake could prompt revisions.

In what’s being seen as a huge step forward in the effort to curb climate-warming emissions, the United States and China have ratified the Paris global climate agreement. Other countries are now expected to follow suit.
Earlier today, US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping submitted their written commitments to join the Paris agreement at a meeting in Hangzhou, China, that included UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The joint ratification, which involved the world’s largest two economies, could inspire other countries, such as Canada, India, the UK, and Brazil, to do the same.
After two weeks of marathon negotiations, 195 countries approved an accord that would wean the…
“The signal of the two large emitters taking this step together and taking it early, far earlier than people had anticipated a year ago, should give confidence to the global communities and to other countries that are working on their climate change plans, that they too can move quickly and will be part of a global effort,” said senior Obama adviser Brian Deese in a meeting with reporters. Both the US and China hope to see the pact put into force by the end of the year.


The Paris agreement is a global pact to slash greenhouse gases and limit the rise in temperatures to well “below two” degrees Celsius. It was forged by nearly 200 countries last December, but has yet to go into effect. In order for it to become legally binding, 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of global emissions need to formally ratify the treaty.
Prior to today’s announcement, only 23 nations had ratified the agreement, collectively representing a meager 1.08 percent of all global emissions. With the US and China now officially joining in, this figure jumps up quite substantially; China represents about 20 percent of global emissions, while the US accounts for about 18 percent.
The joint pact is considered a big victory for President Obama who hopes to see the pact put into place before the US election in November. US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is a supporter of the accord, but her rival, Republican nominee Donald Trump has said he’d dump the Paris agreement if elected, saying climate change is an elaborate hoax.

A new report from Australia’s Climate Institute predicts that by 2050, global warming will make at least half of the land currently used for coffee production unable to produce quality beans. By 2080, it cautions, hot temperatures could make wild coffee plants completely extinct. Although this report is projecting what will happen to supplies in decades to come, the coffee shortage isn’t really off in the distant future. It’s already started to fall.


Brazil—the source for over a third of the world’s coffee—has seen its coffee stores dip dramatically in the last two years as the result of a long drought. So far, unusually large harvests in other world coffee markets helped to make up most of the difference. But we can hardly expect these big harvests to continue. In fact, their trend may actually reverse. Much of Brazil’s latest shortfall was made up for by a record-breaking coffee harvest in Honduras—which is a coffee-growing area that this new report will probably be hit particularly hard in the coming decades.
Even the relatively smaller shift from Brazil’s shortage in the last couple years resulted in a price surge and a jump in counterfeit coffee beans (which pretend to be fancier coffee varieties than they are). With the spread of the shortage, we can only expect to see rising coffee prices and counterfeiting show up as even more of a problem in our daily cups.
Astronomers using the RATAN-600 radio telescope in the Russian Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia have detected an unusual signal emanating from a star located about 94 light-years from Earth. It’s not clear if the signal is being transmitted by aliens, but the researchers say we should keep a close watch on this intriguing new extraterrestrial candidate.
As reported by Paul Gilster at Centauri Dreams, the anomalous signal was detected by an international team of astronomers back on May 15, 2015. The researchers, led by N. N. Brusilov, describe a “strong signal in the direction of HD164595,” a planetary system located in the constellation Hercules. The finding is set to be discussed at a meeting of the IAA SETI Permanent Committee on September 27, 2016.
It’s still too early to tell if the signal is coming from an extraterrestrial civilization, but the researchers say it’s serious enough that scientists should now permanently monitor this new target. HD164595 is practically the same size and age as our own sun, it shares a similar chemistry, and it’s less than 100 light-years away. What’s more, it hosts at least one known planet, a warm Neptune in a circular orbit. It’s very possible that other planets reside within this system.


Looking at the signal, the researchers say that if it came from a multi-directional, isotropic radio beacon, it would have to be produced by a Kardashev Type II civilization, i.e. an alien civilization that has tapped into nearly 100 percent of its host star’s energy potential. If the signal was targeted directly at our solar system, then it would be of a power available to a Kardashev Type I civilization, i.e. an alien civilization capable of exploiting nearly all of its home planet’s energy potential.
We have yet to make contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. If they're out there — and…
Another possibility, of course, is that the signal is a natural anomaly, such as background noise. French astronomer Jean Schneider is considering the possibility that HD164595 is amplifying a background radio source through a process known as gravitational microlensing.


To move forward, scientists will need to confirm the quality and integrity of this signal and rule out other possibilities. And by focusing their radio dishes onto this planetary system, scientists may detect new signals, and possibly even patterns. Like the intriguing Tabby’s Star, and the rampant speculation that it’s home to an alien megastructure, more data is needed before we jump to conclusions.
Update: Turns out not everyone is impressed with this anomalous signal. Here’s what Daren Lynch from SETI@home has to say about it:
I was one of the many people who received the the email with the subject “Candidate SETI SIGNAL DETECTED by Russians from star HD 164595 by virtue of RATAN-600 radio telescope.” Since the email did come from known SETI researchers, I looked over the presentation. I was unimpressed. In one out of 39 scans that passed over star showed a signal at about 4.5 times the mean noise power with a profile somewhat like the beam profile. Of course SETI@home has seen millions of potential signals with similar characteristics, but it takes more than that to make a good candidate. Multiple detections are a minimum criterion.
Because the receivers used were making broad band measurements, there’s really nothing about this “signal” that would distinguish it from a natural radio transient (stellar flare, active galactic nucleus, microlensing of a background source, etc.) There’s also nothing that could distinguish it from a satellite passing through the telescope field of view. All in all, it’s relatively uninteresting from a SETI standpoint.

Pharmaceutical company Mylan has announced plans to launch its first generic EpiPen. But at a cost of $300—which is half of the branded product’s list price—it’s still a heap of money for this critically important medicine.
Mylan is taking a lot of heat these days for boosting the price of its EpiPen by more than 400 percent. Just eight years ago the auto-injection epinephrine pens, which are used to stave off the effects of potentially life-threatening allergic reactions, were priced at just $100 per pack. Today the branded product costs about $600. The company has subsequently been accused of price gouging, attracting the ire of consumers, lawmakers, doctors, and at least one disgruntled celebrity endorser.
Sarah Jessica Parker has cut ties with Mylan, the company that makes EpiPen, after it was…
In response to this growing wave of criticism, Mylan will launch a generic version of its EpiPen. The product should be available “in several weeks” and will retail for about $300 per shot. At the same time, the company said it still intends to market and distribute its exorbitantly priced branded EpiPen.


The announcement comes just four days after Mylan said it would offer patients a coupon and expanded financial assistance—a move referred to by some politicians and insurers as a superficial “PR fix.” Mylan is clearly benefiting from its virtual monopoly position and the inability of competitors to produce a rival product. Mylan is also the beneficiary of patent protections and laws requiring allergy medications in schools.
Mylan’s decision to produce a generic product at half the cost is a smooth move, but it likely won’t stave off the mounting criticism. At $300, and for something so important to those who suffer from severe allergies, it’s still stupidly overpriced.

One year ago, six volunteers—an astrobiologist, a physicist, a pilot, an architect, a journalist, and a soil scientist — entered a 36-by-20 foot dome, located near a barren volcano in Hawaii, to simulate what living conditions would be like on Mars. Today they re-emerged from their year-long isolation.
The NASA-funded project is called HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation), designed to test the effects of isolation in confined conditions of a human mission to Mars. This is the third such simulation, and the longest; the two prior missions lasted for four and eight months, respectively. The Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii was chosen as a location because it’s most similar to the red, barren Martian terrain.
The six participants could only communicate with the outside world via email, and those transmissions were delayed by 20 minutes to mimic how long it would take for such a signal to travel between Earth and Mars. Resources were limited: anything they needed, they had to bring into the dome with them at the outset, right down to duct tape. Food was replenished every four months, and water every two months.


The crew were allowed to leave the dome, but only if they donned heavy space suits. And there were simulated emergencies: everything from power outages and broken tools, to a forced evacuation to avoid a harsh radiation wave.
When the HI-SEAS crew finally emerged today, a documentary film crew was on hand to capture the moment for posterity. The film-in-progress is called Red Heaven, and it’s the passion project of indie filmmakers Lauren DeFilippo and Katherine Gorringe. Their goal: to provide a “raw and intimate look into what life on Mars might really be like.”
The two women were there when the crew entered the dome last year, snagging exclusive interviews and a peek inside the dome itself before the members went into isolation. And they left the crew with their own cameras so they could film themselves going about their daily life. “We would give them a shot list [via email] and they uploaded the footage throughout the year,” DeFilippo told Gizmodo.

DeFilippo and Gorringe met as graduate film students at Stanford University, and something about Silicon Valley’s fascination with futurism and technology rubbed off. “We realized the stuff sci-fi dreams are made of was becoming reality, and we kept wondering, what would be actually be like to live on Mars?” said DeFilippo. When they heard about the HI-SEAS program, they immediately wanted to be part of it. And the Red Heaven documentary project was born.


Now the filmmakers will be doing follow-up interviews and hopefully following each member as they re-acclimate to life in their hometowns. Then they’ll head into post-production on Red Heaven, processing the hundreds of hours of footage they’ve collected, with a projected release date of 2018.
All of that will cost money, of course. So DeFilippo and Gorringe have launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for the final phase of their documentary project. So far they’ve racked up over $23,000 of their $40,000 goal, with 23 days left to go in the campaign.
As for NASA, its researchers will now begin the laborious process of analyzing and comparing data from the three HI-SEAS simulation missions, focusing on the psychological effects of isolation on the crew members. There will two more HI-SEAS missions under the dome, starting in January 2017. NASA’s goal is to send humans to Mars by 2030.
An earlier version of this post included a photo of crew members from a prior HI-SEAS simulation. It has been updated with a new photograph of the current crew.
In May 2013, a bridge spanning the Skagit River along Interstate 5 in Washington state catastrophically collapsed, after an oversized trailer clipped one of the bridge’s cross beams. A new analysis by engineers at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign confirms the many factors that contributed to the collapse, and offers recommendations for how to prevent similar failures in the future.
They published their analysis in the Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities. “The bridge repair costs exceeded $15 million, and that doesn’t account for the economic losses that the area felt because they and visitors no longer had access to the interstate,” co-author Tim Stark said in a statement. “Even though this accident occurred three years ago, it’s still very important because many bridges have this same design, not only in Washington but in other states.”


An entire section of the bridge fell into the water, taking two other cars with it. Fortunately there were no fatalities, although three people suffered minor injuries. Built in 1955, the bridge was a crucial link between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle, with more than 71,000 vehicles crossing every day. After the collapse, people naturally scrambled to explain how it could have happened, including Mike Lindblom, a reporter from the Seattle Times:

A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board attributed the failure to the bridge’s so-called “fracture-critical” design, whereby a small crack in just one essential part can trigger a chain reaction of even more failures. That’s what happened in 2007, with the collapse of the similarly designed I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis. There are more than 10,000 aging through-truss bridges in the U.S.


The Illinois team suggested ways to reinforce such bridges to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure in the future. “[T]he initial damage of where the truck hit was not a primary support, it was a cross beam, and the damage cascaded, causing the entire collapse,” co-author Jim LaFave said. “We can selectively add supports so there are ways to redistribute the impact load, so the structure can remain stable and stay standing even if there’s damage to a particular area.”
And then there was human error. The truck with the oversized load was erroneously driving in the outside lane, where the clearance was lower, in part to give space to another passing truck.. The state’s Department of Transportation rubber-stamped an oversize-load permit to the trucking company without verifying clearance limitations along the proposed route. And the driver underestimated the height of his load by a critical two inches.
Stark and his colleagues attribute much of this to poor record-keeping. “The key issue in this case is the variable vertical bridge clearance,” he said. “Many bridges have a square opening, so the clearance is the same across all lanes. The problem with this bridge was that it curved down over the edge lanes. The oversized trailer was 15 feet 9 inches tall. The database said the bridge was 17 feet 3 inches, which was in the center – almost two feet higher than the edges, which is where the oversized trailer was traveling.”
The authors recommend changing policy to report the lowest vertical clearance for bridges, rather than the highest—and periodically verifying that data with LIDAR measurements.


There was a pilot car traveling ahead of the truck, outfitted with an antenna to detect any possibility of too-low clearance. But the driver of the pilot car admitted to using a cell phone (albeit with a hands-free device) while crossing the bridge. Even if the pilot car had alerted the truck driver, there would not have been time to avoid a collision. The driver was following the pilot car too closely: more than half the recommended distance for adequate response (400 feet, or a five-second response time, instead of the recommended 865 feet, allowing for a 10-second response time).
“In this case, the pilot car either did not impact the bridge or the driver didn’t hear the impact. They never called the truck, so that part of the safety mechanism failed,” Stark said. “One solution we suggest is a sensor at the top of the pole that automatically contacts the oversized vehicle if it hits an object. This eliminates the drivers having to communicate quickly so the oversized vehicle can change course. Also, the pilot car antenna was not straight, so it was not accurately measuring the full height.”


It will never be possible to eliminate human error entirely. We are fallible creatures, and sometimes all those tiny lapses in judgement—typically harmless on their own—combine in disastrous ways. But the lessons learned from the 2013 Skagit River bridge collapse could make catastrophic failures just a bit less likely in the future.

You forgot to buy milk. Naturally, it’s all the big bang’s fault.
Cheeky video essayist exurb1a uses human forgetfulness to explain the concept of determinism. Essentially, it’s the idea that because the universe and everything in it follows rules, we all exist in a highly complicated chain reaction that governs everything from the movement of planets to the release of specific chemicals in our brains.


Free will? “Bah!” says determinism.

It’s been an exciting week for planet hunters with the discovery of the nearest exoplanet yet found, orbiting a star called Proxima Centauri. Now you can get a closer look at that star system via a live broadcast tonight, courtesy of the robotic telescope service Slooh. The fun starts at 8 PM ET/5 PM PT.
Proxima Centauri is a small red dwarf star located just 4.25 light years away, slightly closer to Earth than the famous binary pair of Alpha Centauri A and B. The newly discovered exoplanet has been dubbed Proxima b, and the ESO team pegs its mass as being roughly 1.3 times that of Earth.


According to Slooh team member Paul Cox, when collaboration launched its new telescopes in Chile back in 2007, Proxima Centauri was one of their first observational targets of its global network. Since getting a heads-up on the new exoplanet, the telescopes have been imaging the star every night.
“It’s amazing to watch that small red dot live in the online telescopes every night, and imagine the earth-like world that we now know orbits the star,” Cox said in a statement. “With the possibility that liquid water exists on Proxima b, who knows, there may be some Centaurian amateur astronomers gazing back at us every night.”


You can share the wonder and watch the Live stream embedded below, or watch on the Slooh website. Broadcast host Eric Edelman will be joined by the University of Texas, Austin’s Michael Endl—part of the ESO team that discovered Proxima b—and Lisa Kaltnegger, director of Cornell University’s Carl Sagan Institute, who will address the implications of this discovery for extraterrestrial life.

Astronaut Scott Kelly returned from a year-long sojourn in space in June. His slightly older astronaut twin, Mark Kelly, stayed home as a control—part of NASA’s twin study to monitor the effects of space on the human body. But there’s a physical change that NASA might not be able to measure that easily. Mark is now even older (by about 5 milliseconds) than his space-faring twin, thanks to special relativity.
It’s due to a quirky little thing called time dilation: time can slow down for one person, but not for another, because there is no such thing as a fixed frame of reference against which all motion can be measured. Two people who are moving relative to each other, wearing identical watches, will measure time differently, depending on how fast each is moving.


This isn’t just a mathematical oddity. It’s been experimentally verified over and over again with pairs of atomic clocks, although on human scales it’s a pretty tiny effect. It’s only when you reach speeds close to the speed of light that time dilates significantly. This new video from Minute Physics will give you a visual sense of how time dilation works:

Why does this happen? Well, the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time are merged in Einstein’s theory to become a single four-dimensional spacetime. That means motion through time and motion through space are connected, and light is the link between them.


Since the speed of light in a vacuum is always constant (670 million MPH), time and space must adjust with motion to ensure that two people moving relative to each other will always measure the same speed for light. So as an object speeds up as it moves through space, time must pass more slowly. (Also, lengths contract.) But from your perspective, nothing would seem amiss.
And that brings us to the Twin Paradox, or why Mark Kelly is now technically even older than his twin, Scott Kelly. Here’s Minute Physics again with the solution to this famous paradox:

To put it another way, time passes differently for the hypothetical twins in the video because they haven’t had equivalent experiences. One stayed home in an inertial frame of reference. The other accelerated out to space, then decelerated, turned around, and accelerated home of the return trip. So the symmetry between them is broken.
And as you may recall from Interstellar, time also passes more slowly in proximity to a black hole because of the strong gravitational effects. It’s just one more challenge to be overcome if humans are ever going to travel deep into space.
A group of scientists at Lancaster University in England are constantly monitoring geomagnetic activity, to get a heads-up for the spectacular night sky display known as the Northern Lights. So a couple of days ago, they were thrilled to get a strong reading that an aurora was likely imminent.
Alas, it turned out to be a false alarm. The culprit? A ridable lawn mower.


Auroras happen when solar winds disturb the Earth’s magnetosphere. When that happens, charged particles—mainly electrons and protons—pour into the upper atmosphere, colliding with oxygen and nitrogen atoms. As the atoms get excited or return to their normal state, they emit visible energy. When it is an oxygen atom, the light emitted is either green or brownish-red, depending on the energy level absorbed by the molecule. Blue happens when nitrogen gets ionized, and red when it returns to ground state.
The Lancaster scientists with Aurora Watch have magnetometers in place to monitor geomagnetic activity around the UK, including Lancaster, Aberdeen, and the Faroe Islands. The group sent out a red alert to members on its email list on Tuesday afternoon, after readings of magnetic field data from their Lancaster magnetometer showed a sharp spike.


Usually this is a sign of a burst of geomagnetic activity, heralding the onset of the aurora phenomenon. The spike was strong enough that it probably would have been visible through the United Kingdom, had it been real. Instead, the group retracted the red alert four hours later, after noticing no similar spikes from their other sensors.


“It appears that some local interference set off a massive spike in the data,” the group’s cancellation notice read, adding, “No, it wasn’t the intern.” Rather, it was university staff, namely a groundskeeper who got a bit too close to the magnetometer while cutting the lawn. The folks at Aurora Watch said they’ll be coordinating with the maintenance staff to avoid this kind of mix-up in the future.
This is why it’s important to get readings from multiple sensors. Maybe next time, the signal will be real. Because the Northern Lights really are an impressive display.

This is a barren time in the sports calendar. We are in a desolate trough between the international intrigue of the Olympics and the drama and nonsense of football season. I’m goddamn bored. Coincidentally, the National Parks Service turns 100 years old today. Unlike late August, the National Parks are good, and as the only member of the Deadspin staff with a geology degree, I am slightly more qualified to write about the natural wonders of our nation than anyone else.
The summer is drawing to a close, and maybe you want to visit a National Park. Which one should you go to? Do you wanna see cool rocks? What about bears? Please consult these airtight rankings. (I’m not going to rank American Samoa National Park or Virgin Islands National Park for various reasons we don’t need to get into.)
Yellowstone National Park’s geothermal features are the products of a caldera, which is a recharging supervolcano with over 6,000 times the eruptive potential of Mt. St. Helens. Basically, magma from the Earth’s lower mantle travelled up through the upper mantle and the crust, and it feeds the Yellowstone caldera. It’s like Hawaii, but on land. As the Earth’s crust shifts over the hotspot, the location of the Yellowstone magma has changed. It erupted 2.1 million years ago, 1.2 million years ago, and 630,000 years ago. Astute readers will note that that recurrence interval indicates that another explosion could be approaching in the immediate future. When it explodes again, it will cover the Western United States in ash.


Anyway, Yellowstone is also very large, stocked with buffalo, and features a series of naturally heated rivers you can swim in.
By the time the last glaciers carved their way through the Yosemite Valley 12,000 years ago, they’d managed to smooth over almost every peak in the region. Unlike the Lake Tahoe area, the Eastern Sierras are full of granite, and other felsic rocks. Harder mineral compositions means that famous hanging walls like Half Dome and El Capitan are able to stand up more or less perfectly straight.


All that said, the cooler part of the actual park is the less-visited eastern half. If you hike Cloud’s Rest, you can stare down at the little line of ant people scurrying up Half Dome, 2,000 feet below you. You are their queen. Look at those doofuses.

Look at this shit.
As established in the Yosemite segment, glacial geomorphology is the shit. Glacier has the actual benefit of actual, uh, glaciers. Near-dead as they are, alpine glaciers are much weirder than glaciers that calve into the ocean. Experts estimate that the remaining glaciers in the park will all be gone by 2030, so go see them before these last remnants of the Ice Age die forever. Glacier NP has the additional benefit of a big grizzly bear population as well as mountain goats.
Bryce Canyon looks like an alien civilization tried to carve a long, complicated message to humanity via orange spires of rock. In fact, these hoodoos only exist because of a very specific confluence of circumstances. Most of the body of each column consists of soft layers of limestone and siltstone, capped off by a thinner, harder layer. The Bryce Canyon area was a paleo-lake, but it’s a very arid and cold climate now. Because there’s precious little rainfall in the area, conventional erosion is not the dominant regime. Instead, frost wedging contributed to much of the separation within rock columns that leads to hoodoos. Higher layers are more chemically resistant to weathering, allowing them to resist.
I usually think of rainforests as a rather equatorial biome, but there are several temperate rainforests on Washington’s Olympic peninsula. This is where people think Bigfoot lives. If I was him, I would hang here too.
The only problem with the Grand Canyon is that there’s too much of it to comprehend at once. When you look down into it, there are simply too many incredibly detailed ridges and sub-valleys to take in to truly grasp its size in one go.
Here’s a fact: This National Park is named after boobs.
Because Hawaii is so volcanically active, many words for lava come from the native Hawaiian, like A’a and Pāhoehoe. If you look at the islands on a map, you can chart the course of the hotspot that created them over time. The islands furthest to the northwest are older and more degraded, while the big island is still actively growing on its southern margin. There is a chain of fallen, crumbled Hawaiis to the north of the existing island chain. Twenty two miles off the coast of the big island, the Lōʻihi Seamount has been slowly forming, and it will become the newest Hawaiian island. Sadly, it won’t breach the surface for at least 10,000 years, so we’re stuck the islands we’ve got.
I respect and fear the power of mighty Denali.
More fun than it sounds! Every 10 or so years, Death Valley experiences a “super bloom” as long-dormant seeds sprout en masse, covering the once-desolate landscape in a carpet of life. It’s weird as hell.

Nobody goes here, because it’s off in a strange pocket of northeastern California, but nowhere else has so many different types of magmatic systems packed into one area. The Gorda Plate, a fucked up old tectonic plate, has been subducting into the west coast for a long long time, and has produced some strange inland volcanism. Lassen Peak is the southernmost of the active volcanos in the Cascade Range, but the park also has a perfect cinder cone and some sulfuric hot spring action.
Sequoias are redwoods, but with modesty.
Nice glacier.
West Texas has a National Park and somehow it’s pretty good.
The Channel Islands were inhabited by a species of pygmy mammoth until about 10,000 years ago, when the ice age ended. A group of mammoths must have swam over to the islands and set up shop, gradually evolving into smaller and smaller animals to adapt to their island biome.
Mammoth Cave is easily the longest cave in the world, about 405 miles of tubes and such under Kentucky. It’s so big they keep finding stuff in it, and it’s probably not fully explored.
Pretty canyon.
They gave poor Teddy, who set the National Park system up, a very pretty but unspectacular park in North Dakota. Also, it’s split up into two unconnected segments, which, really, makes it two parks.
Using a super-absorbing chemical compound called sodium polyacrylate, you can turn boring old H2O into a magical blob-like substance. There’s a lot of fun you can have with these water beads, including deep frying them, but watching them turn invisible when submerged is easily the best trick.
Self-billed chemist and science enthusiast Andres Tretiakov posted a brief demonstration to Twitter showing how water beads seem to turn invisible when submerged, because they have the same refractive index as the water that surrounds them. When held in hand, light is able to reflect and create visible distortions while passing through the water beads, but in a bowl filled with H2O they blend in and appear to completely disappear. Science!

For decades, tin foil fashionistas have attributed a number of sinister happenings to the atmospheric research program known as HAARP, including hurricanes, earthquakes and even the destruction of the Space Shuttle Columbia. After this week, however, it will be a lot harder to entertain those claims: On Saturday, the supposed weather-altering secret weapon is holding an open house.
Can a facility that has inspired global conspiracy theories be designated a World Heritage Site? If …
“We hope that people will be able to see the actual science of it,” a spokesperson from the University of Alaska, which now operates the facility, told Alaska Dispatch News. “We hope to show people that it is not capable of mind control and not capable of weather control and all the other things it’s been accused of.”


According to KTVF, the university expects both scientists and conspiracy theorists to show up at the event. With any luck, that will include former Minnesota governor and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, who questioned whether HAARP was being used for mind control in 2009 after being turned away at the facility’s gates.


“This thing can knock planes out of the air,” said Ventura at the time. “It can control the weather. And it’s a very dangerous, dangerous weapon.”
Ventura and his ilk should find themselves more than welcome: According to the university, children of all ages are invited and refreshments will be provided.

By now you’ve heard the exciting news that astronomers have discovered an Earth-like exoplanet a mere four light years away. It’s a promising candidate for harboring life, and it’s close enough to Earth to make a robotic exploratory mission feasible within a generation.
We’re sure you have questions—lots and lots of questions—about this potentially momentous discovery, the hunt for exoplanets more generally, the prospects for future exploration (or even colonization), and the tantalizing possibility of extraterrestrial life. Harvard University astronomer Dr. Abraham (Avi) Loeb, who chairs the advisory committee for billionaire Yuri Milner’s Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, is with us today to answer them.


UPDATE 2:43 PM: And we’re done! Thanks to Dr. Avi Loeb for joining us today, and to our readers for asking such great questions.

In what’s being hailed as one of the biggest astronomical discoveries of the century, scientists with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) today confirmed the discovery of an Earth-like exoplanet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri—our nearest neighboring star. Details of the team’s discovery were just published in Nature.
Rumors of a possible Earth-like exoplanet first surfaced on August 12 in the German weekly Der Spiegel. Citing an anonymous source with the La Silla Observatory research team, the magazine claimed the rumored planet “is believed to be Earth-like and orbits at a distance to Proxima Centauri that could allow it to have liquid water on its surface—an important requirement for the emergence of life.”


Now we know those rumors were true: There is clear evidence for a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, a small red dwarf star located just 4.25 light years away, slightly closer to Earth than the famous binary pair of Alpha Centauri A and B. It’s been dubbed Proxima b, and the ESO team pegs its mass as being roughly 1.3 times that of Earth.
Its orbit is 4.3 million miles from Proxima Centauri, just 5 percent of the distance between Earth and our own Sun. But the star is also much cooler than our Sun, so Proxima b still lies within the so-called “habitable zone” for exoplanets, with temperatures sufficient for water to be in a liquid state on the surface.


Since the first exoplanet was discovered in 1995, astronomers have identified more than 3000 such bodies orbiting distant stars. “We live in a universe that is teeming with terrestrial planets,” Pedro Amado of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalalucia said during a press conference this morning. Red dwarf stars like Proxima Centauri in particular are believed to be rife with small, rocky Earth-sized planets.
According to lead author and project coordinator Guillem Anglada-Escude of Queen Mary University of London, the first hints of this new planet appeared in 2013, but there was insufficient evidence to claim discovery. The latest observation campaign is called Pale Red Dot (because Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf), inspired by Carl Sagan’s famous description of Earth as a pale blue dot.
The team of 31 scientists from eight countries relied on the Doppler effect to detect a faint wobble in Proxima Centauri’s spectrum of light, which approaches and recedes from Earth every 11.2 days at around 3 MPH. Such a wobble could be caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. By combining data from the Pale Red Dot campaign with earlier data collected between 2000 and 2014, the astronomers confirmed a sharp peak—well above the threshold for discovery—in the Doppler shift data indicative of an Earth-sized exoplanet.
The technology to detect Proxima b has been around for at least ten years, so why has it taken so long for astronomers to make the discovery? It’s because Proxima Centauri is pretty active as stars go, and its natural brightness can mimic the signal of a possible planet. The team relied on observations with two other telescopes to chart how the star’s brightness changed over time, enabling them to exclude the possibility of a false positive. There is just a 1 in 10 million chance that this signal is a false positive, according to Anglada-Escude.
It’s not yet clear whether this new exoplanet has an atmosphere. Because Proxima Centauri is a fairly active star, Proxima b suffers x-ray fluxes approximately 400 times greater than what we experience here on Earth, and this could cause any atmosphere to blow away.


But Ansgar Reiners of the University of Gottingen in Germany said that it really depends on how and when the exoplanet formed. Did it form further out, with water present, and then migrate closer to its star, or did it form very close to Proxima Centauri? The former scenario would make an atmosphere more likely.
“There are many models and simulations that produce very different outcomes, including possible atmosphere and water,” said Reiners. “We have no clue, but the existence of [an atmosphere] is certainly possible.” That would bode very well for the possibility of the planet harboring life. And the relative closeness to our solar system makes robotic exploration feasible within a generation.
“The lifetime of Proxima is several trillion years, almost a thousand times longer than the remaining lifetime of the Sun,” Harvard University’s Abraham (Avi) Loeb, who chairs the advisory committee for billionaire Yuri Milner’s Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, told Gizmodo. “A habitable rocky planet around Proxima would be the most natural location to where our civilization could aspire to move after the Sun will die, five billion years from now.”
Announced to great fanfare in April, the Starshot Initiative is a $100 million research and engineering program seeking to lay the foundations for an eventual interstellar voyage. The first step involves building light-propelled “nanocrafts” that can travel up to 20 percent the speed of light. Such a spacecraft would reach the Alpha Centauri star system just over 20 years after launch. Currently, the project’s scientists are trying to demonstrate the feasibility of using powerful laser beams to propel a lightweight sail.


According to Loeb, the discovery of a potentially habitable planet around Proxima Centauri provides an excellent target for a flyby mission. “A spacecraft equipped with a camera and various filters could take color images of the planet and infer whether it is green (harboring life as we know it), blue (with water oceans on its surface), or just brown (dry rock),” he told Gizmodo. “The curiosity to know more about the planet—most importantly whether it hosts life—will give the Starshot Initiative a sense of urgency in finding out more facts about the planet, especially those that cannot be inferred with existing telescopes from our current vantage point on Earth.”
“We certainly hope that within a generation, we can launch these nano probes,” Peter Worden of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation said during this morning’s press conference—perhaps by 2060. “We now know there’s at least one very interesting target that’s within range of our proposed system. We can get the images to see if there is life there, possibly advanced life. Those are the great questions, and I think they’re going to be answered this century.”
Note: Avi Loeb will be joining Gizmodo today from 2:00 -2:30 PM ET. He’ll answer all your questions about this exciting new discovery, the hunt for exoplanets in general, and the Breakthrough Starshot initiative.

Maddie Stone contributed to the reporting for this story.
It’s one of those numbers that I’ve got in the back of my head for no reason: 2.75 seconds. That’s how long it takes a car dropped out of a plane to accelerate to 60 miles per hour. When I saw the hilarious new Tesla Model S P100D did 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds it was a reminder that Elon’s electric sedan was now faster than gravity.
I tweeted about this and it led to a bunch of fun questions and retweets, so I thought I’d expand a little on what it actually means to be “faster than gravity.”

There are a lot of caveats but let’s get into the simple math. Everyone knows that an object in a vacuum accelerates at 32 feet per second squared (ft/s2). What many people may not know is that 60 mph = 88 ft/s. Thus, an object gets to about 47 mph in two seconds and by the time it gets to 60 mph it’s been approximately 2.75 seconds (88/32 = 2.75).
Of course, 60 mph is a somewhat arbitrary measure created to test cars and it comes from a time when 60 mph was much harder for a car to achieve. Now these numbers are suspect because that’s what automakers are aiming at with their launch modes. We should really be talking about 0-to-100 mph times, but I’ll never get my way with that.


Where it gets more complicated is when you add in wind resistance and other factors. As we learned in the Mythbusters episode below (where they sped the car up to its top speed), a car will tend to stay nose down so wind resistance on an aerodynamic car means that it probably has a pretty high terminal velocity.

We’d have to figure out the terminal velocity of a Tesla Model S falling from the sky, which, despite being very slippery in the air, will still contend with atmosphere at some point (as does the car driving on the ground, but that’s already factored into its acceleration time.)


Again, in a vacuum, this paper from amateur physicist Mark Virag has a helpful chart:

Because the Model S P100D is electronically limited at 155 mph that means that you could drop one from about 3400 feet and it would hit the ground roughly at the same time as an identical car on the ground would travel the same distance. So a Tesla Model S P100D is faster than a car dropped from more than half a mile in the air. But what’s the fun in that?


Using this calculator you can try and figure out what the terminal velocity of a Tesla Model S really is. We know cars tend to point down when they’re dropped (although those are usually front-engined cars and the Tesla has a good weight balance) so we’re using this work from Car And Driver to determine the slipperiness of a Tesla and hoping it will apply even though the new Tesla seems a little sleeker.
Assuming the typical density of air at ground level, a coefficient of drag of 0.24, a mass of around 5100 pounds (it has more batteries), and a frontal surface area of 25.2 square feet you get a terminal velocity of 520 mph, which seems high to me, but there’s the math. If you assume that the car, which has a nice weight balance and a low center of gravity, would fall with its wheels pointing down towards the earth, it reaches a much lower terminal velocity closer to 110 mph.


There’s no way that a Model S even totally uncorked is going to get anywhere near its terminal velocity so at some point gravity will win, but it’s fun to think that a vehicle is capable of hitting this faster-than-gravity measure, which I shall call the “Hardigree Line” because I’m vain.
According to manufacturer times here are other regular production cars below the Hardigree Line:
Notable here is that the Tesla Model S is a sedan and the other cars are high performance exotics or near-exotics. Also worth noting is that a Model S is going to run out of juice pretty quickly if you keep testing this.


I do think we should test this, though, and I call on Elon Musk to offer us two Tesla Model S P100Ds, a helicopter, and a wide open space in order to do so. With the autopilot system in a Tesla we don’t have to worry about anyone getting harmed.
Special thanks to mathematician Galen McQuillen for his assistance.
Rubber bands can become colder than room temperature through sheer mechanical force. Stretching one heats it up (duh) but letting it contract cools it below its starting temperature. Let that weirdness sink in for a moment.
Most people would leave that odd bit of science at “Woah...” and that would be that. But the folks at Applied Science thought, “Hey, someone could scale this up and build a tiny fridge—and that someone is me!”


Of course the thermodynamic gains of such a simple system are minimal. Wood is far from the best insulator, and rubber bands are a less than ideal coolant. What’s neat is that this actually works at all, and we might see a more efficient version of this prototype down the line. Stay weird, science.

His blue face and blank stare suggest a look of despair or simply disbelief. Yet, the snub-nosed monkey above and 37 other similar species just got their genomes sequenced. This one monkey, though. He seems sad as hell about it.
His family seems chill, though.

Is it possible to find trace evidence of supernovae from millions of years ago in the sediment lining the ocean floor? One astrophysicist has spent the better part of a decade trying to find the proverbial smoking gun to prove that it is. And now, it seems, he has succeeded.
Shawn Bishop, an astrophysicist at the Technical University in Munich, Germany, has been investigating the fossils of ancient bacteria on the ocean floor for several years now, in hopes of finding traces of an iron isotope produced in a supernova explosion some 2.2 million years ago. He presented promising preliminary findings at a physics conference in 2013. He has now confirmed those early findings, according to a new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). “The signal is definitely there,” he told Gizmodo.


The isotope in question is iron-60 (60Fe), just one of the heavy elements produced by supernovae when they explode, scattering those elements into space. Because of 60Fe’s short half life, there shouldn’t be any of it on Earth, but traces have nonetheless been detected in the ferromanganese crust on the ocean floor. And that means there could be traces of the isotope elsewhere as well.
Bishop thought the best candidates were tiny microfossils of ancient bacteria that scientists have found in ocean floor core sediment samples. Back in 1963, Italian microbiologist Salvatore Bellini noticed these types of bacteria could orient themselves towards the North Pole—that is, they could sense magnetic fields to help them navigate their way to favorable low-oxygen environments.


In technical terminology, they are “magneto tactic,” thanks to the presence of chains of magnetite crystals inside the critters. The bacteria likely picked up the crystals from sediments along the sea bed. As I wrote at Scientific American in 2013:
Bishop thinks it’s possible that fine-grained debris from a supernova explosion could pass through Earth’s atmosphere, rapidly oxidizing in the process so that they are broken down into tiny nano-oxides.
These would rapidly dissolve in oxygen, form rust, and eventually settle in the sediment along the ocean floor, where the bacteria would suck them up for their crystal chains. When the bacteria eventually die, those chains remain behind in the sediment, and 60Fe would be locked inside. So any traces of 60Fe found in that sediment would constitute a kind of biogenic signature of a supernova event, preserved in the fossil record.
Detecting those traces is, needless to say, very tricky, but Bishop figured out a way to do so using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to analyze the grains of bacteria contained inside core samples from the floor of the Pacific Ocean. And then he counted, one by one, each individual atom of 60Fe. In his preliminary results, he found strong peaks in the concentrations of 60Fe in one of the cores that could be linked to a supernova explosion some 2.2 million years ago. He even identified a couple of candidate stars in the Scorpio Centauri cluster.
It was pretty exciting stuff, inspiring Anton Wallner of The Australian National University to assemble an international team to conduct its own research, in hopes of finding even more traces of 60Fe. As described in a pair of papers published in Nature in April, they did indeed find evidence for a series of nearby supernovae explosions that lit up the sky several million years ago, raining radioactive particles down onto Earth. The nearest of the explosions probably occurred in an aging star cluster some 326 light years away.


Between that result and Bishop’s new confirmation of his preliminary 2013 findings, this constitutes some pretty strong evidence. And at least one of the events coincides with the onset of the Pleistocene, ushering in a period of major global cooling. Astronomers have long suspected that nearby supernovae can affect Earth’s climate, most notably by burning up the ozone layer. Maybe one such explosion triggered the Pleistocene.
“We don’t have any concrete evidence that any one event is tied to a supernovae,” astronomer Adrian Mellott of the University of Kansas told Gizmodo’s Maddie Stone back in April. “But the odds are, one or more are.”

It’s a scorching midsummer day, and the sawgrass is still under a pale blue sky. Waist-deep in water and sinking slowly into the muck, I fend off mosquitos as a man from South Florida’s Water Management District mixes a bag of salt into a hot tub-sized bucket on the side of the road. Thirty feet away in the marsh, another city official wearing waders and a bug hat stands on a narrow steel walkway, dangling the end of a long hose over a plexiglass chamber.
The experiment seems innocuous enough. Seawater is being added to a freshwater wetland, and scientists are observing what happens. The grim subtext is that this same experiment is about to play out in real life and on an enormous scale, from here in the southern Everglades, to Miami forty miles east, to the Florida Keys due south. If scientists are correct, much of South Florida will be underwater by the end of the century.
Standing next to me, pulling strands of what looks like a moss-covered scarf out of the water, is Viviana Mazzei, an ecology PhD student at Florida International University. It’s a periphyton mat, she explains, a unique symbiosis of algae, bacteria, and other microorganisms that forms the base of the Everglades’ food chain. When the saltwater comes, it’s expected to die, with profound ecological consequences.


“The urgency for doing this work has never been greater,” Tiffany Troxler, the FIU ecologist leading the experiment, told me later that week over the phone. “The Everglades is a world treasure, and we’d like for people to continue coming here to enjoy it for a long time.”
Today, the Everglades is fighting a war. Its adversary—rising sea levels brought on by man-made climate change—is relentless and merciless. It’s coming faster than we think. And unlike an earlier war between man and the so-called river of grass, this fight will have no winners.
The first war on the Everglades began over a century ago, when European colonists arrived in South Florida intending to grow crops and build cities, and instead found themselves wading through a mosquito-infested swamp. It was a dreary, dismal, abominable place, “suitable only for the haunt of noxious vermin, or the resort of pestilential reptiles” according to an early government report.


In other words, it was America’s last frontier, and man’s God-given right to conquer it. And so, men conquered, or at least they tried. For decades, efforts to tame the wetlands proved futile. The tides turned in 1928, when a devastating hurricane flooded Lake Okeechobee—the enormous freshwater reservoir that fed wetlands to south—sending nearly three thousand Everglades pioneers to a watery grave. That disaster prompted the US Army Corps of Engineers to erect an enormous dike around the lake, cutting off the Everglades’ lifeblood and draining hundreds of thousands of acres for agriculture. East, west, and south of Lake Okeechobee, the Army Corps dug thousands of miles of levees and canals to move water around in a more orderly fashion.
Fast forward to 2016. The Miami metropolitan area is home to nearly six million people and hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of real estate. It’s a popular travel destination, a gateway to Latin America, and headquarters to major multinational corporations including Burger King and Office Depot. The gentle creep of freshwater down a hundred-mile-long, sixty-mile-wide river of grass is no more—it’s been replaced by the largest flood control structure in America.


A quick drive inland reveals what subjugation of the Everglades has wrought: an ecosystem in shambles. Reduced to less than half of their former extent and receiving only a third of the freshwater that they used to, most of the remaining wetlands are far too dry. Populations of native birds, fish, and reptiles have declined precipitously; invasive species are rampant. Toxic algae blooms are now a summertime tradition. So-called “white zones”—vast expanses of dead vegetation—speckle America’s largest wetland like canker sores.
Still, all of the ecological problems triggered by development and artifical drainage pale in comparison to the existential threat now posed by too much carbon in the atmosphere: sea level rise.
Since 1930, sea levels in South Florida have risen nearly a foot. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change conservatively predicts another three feet of global sea level rise this century, as polar ice caps melt and warming seawater expands. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, meanwhile, projects up to six and a half feet of rise.
Hal Wanless, a geologist at the University of Miami who’s spent 50 years documenting the past 18,000 years of sea level changes in South Florida, thinks the highest government projections are too low. “The important thing we have learned from studying the past is that sea level rises in pulses,” he told me when I met him in his office on campus. These pulses, which have caused as much as thirty feet of sea level rise per century in the recent geologic past, are tied to periods of “rapid ice sheet disintegration” on Greenland and Antarctica.


Wanless believes we’re entering another such period now. And the evidence is certainly mounting. In the late 1980s, scientists were talking about how Greenland might start to melt due to global warming; by the mid 1990s it was already happening. Now, that melt is accelerating. A recent study in Geophysical Research Letters estimates that Greenland lost a trillion tons of ice between 2011 and 2014, contributing twice as much to global sea level rise as it did during the prior two decades.
All of this is just the beginning. A recent study in Nature Climate Change concludes that if every nation aggressively reduced its carbon emissions now, we’d still be locked into nearly 100 feet of sea level rise over the long term.
And when it comes to vulnerable coastlines, South Florida is at the top of the list. Not only is the region very flat and very low, it sits on a porous limestone bedrock built of ancient reef structures. “The analogy most commonly used is Swiss cheese,” Doug Yoder, deputy director of Miami Dade’s Water and Sewer Department, told me. Over thousands of years, acidic rainwater has eaten holes through the limestone, allowing the ocean to bubble up from below.


“You can’t build dikes or sandbars to keep it out,” Coral Gables’ mayor Jim Cason said. As mayor of a city that would have been underwater just a few million years ago, Cason is acutely aware of his community’s tenuous relationship with the sea. He has a saying about South Florida: “Our future is what happens to ice.”


“Many people still don’t get it,” Wanless said, describing an instance when he was called out to Miami Beach’s Public Works Department in 2009. At the time, the city’s now-infamous tidal flooding was just starting to garner attention. Wanless recalled a group of men in suits and ties saying, “Dr. Wanless, we’re having a problem. We need to know where to put the water.”
“I said, you can put it anywhere you want,” he told me. “It’s the ocean. It’s arrived.”
The battle against rising sea levels is conspicuous at Miami Beach, which is already spending hundreds of millions of dollars raising its roads and building pumps to divert the invading saltwater into Biscayne Bay. But along South Florida’s wilder coastlines, a more dramatic siege has garnered comparably little attention.


Take Cape Sable, a lonely expanse of marsh, mangrove swamp, and white sand beach at the southwest toe of Everglades National Park. Wanless has been trekking out here for decades, and he’s watched the shoreline fall back hundreds of feet. “This is a very dynamic area, and it gives us an inkling of the kinds of changes we’re going to see,” he said.
Cape Sable’s troubles began in the early 20th century, when settlers cut canals to the ocean to drain the inland swamp and gain access for cattle pasture. The land was eventually abandoned, but the canals remained and broadened over time, channeling saltwater into the sawgrass marsh, a freshwater ecosystem. Today, this is causing the marshes’ thick peat soils to collapse.


“You have to understand that these highly organic peat soils we have in the Everglades are a balance between the production of plant matter and the forces breaking that plant matter down,” Steve Davis, an ecologist at the Everglades Foundation, told me. “As these soils become exposed to salt, you strongly tip the balance toward a more rapid breakdown.”
Peat collapse is now being observed at freshwater-starved inland marshes, too, and as seawater continues to invade, the problem will get worse. “The more we look, the more evidence we see,” Davis said. “The rate of elevation loss we could be looking at is potentially dramatic.”
According to Erik Stabenau, an oceanographer with the National Park Service, the issue of whether or not to restore Cape Sable’s collapsed marshes—now open lakes of seawater—is complicated by sea level rise. “We can shut down the flow through the canals so you don’t get saltwater in there,” he said. “And we might be able to manage it for a generation or two. But we’re in the forever business.”


Further east, the ecosystems of Florida Bay are also suffering, thanks to historic drainage problems and modern climate change. Covering 800 square miles between the southern coastline and the Florida Keys, the bay is home to a stunning variety of plants, fish, and birds, endangered manatees, bottlenose dolphins, loggerhead sea turtles, and American crocodiles. Like a thirstier version of parklands to the north, it receives far less freshwater than it used to.
If there are too many hot days and not enough rain, salinity levels in Florida Bay skyrocket—which is exactly what happened last fall following a severe drought. The consequence? Tens of thousands of acres of seagrass wilted and died, blanketing the estuary in a plume of yellow sulfide.


For now, the die-off appears to have ended. But as miles upon miles of dead seagrass stews in the summer heat, it’s being gobbled up by jellyfish, which excrete nitrogen and phosphorus-rich waste. This, ecologists fear, could trigger an enormous algae bloom, choking out sunlight and sucking the remaining oxygen out of the bay. “It’s sort of a chain reaction that causes the die-off to persist over a long time,” Davis said.
One way or another, it’ll take the seagrass years to recover. In the meantime, Florida Bay will continue to fight storm surges and rising sea levels at half-health. Whether this means the ocean will plow further inland faster is unclear.
Eventually, the seawater will push inland, and if Wanless is right, eventually is coming soon. This adds urgency to the research of Troxler and her students. After watching a freshwater wetland get hosed down with brine, Mazzei and I drive south to a brackish site, where the same treatment is being applied. Here, the dearth of freshwater caused by recent drought and so many dikes up north has taken a toll. In some places, tufts of sawgrass stand nearly a foot above the peat; their long white roots exposed like teeth with receding gum lines.
Ben Wilson, an ecology PhD student from Alabama, is out in the muck taking measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, and other invisible gases from the saltwater addition plots. These chemical fingerprints, he explains, will help scientists understand how important ecological processes like carbon sequestration will be impacted by rising sea levels.


I ask Wilson if studying a doomed ecosystem gets him down at all. Not really, he says. “If we can learn anything that helps us preserve these ecosystems a little longer, to me that’s worth it.”
One could dismiss the plight of the swamp as trivial compared with the annihilation of entire cities along South Florida’s coastline, but the two are inextricably linked. The millions of people living in the Miami metro area drink from the Biscayne aquifer, a vast freshwater lens underlying much of South Florida. If the Everglades becomes too salty, so will Miami’s water supply. “The extent that these wetlands can hold together is the extent that we get water quality protection,” Troxler said.
Freshwater flows through the Biscayne aquifer in a southeasterly direction, mixing with seawater when it arrives at the coast. But as sea levels rise, the saltwater front is advancing. Already, this has caused a handful of drinking wells at Hallandale Beach to become contaminated. With another eight inches of rise, more than half of the flood control structures built to keep the seawater at bay could become useless. “Gravity is just not going to work as well as it used to,” Yoder said.


There is, however, a way to buy the communities of South Florida time: by restoring the flow of freshwater from the north to push back against the rising seas. And that’s exactly what Everglades conservationists have been fighting to do for decades.
A dozen miles west of Miami, the strip malls peter out and give way to expansive meadows of sawgrass, marking the edge of Everglades National Park. If you want to cross the park to catch a boat tour out of Everglades City, there’s only one direct route—the Tamiami trail.


Cutting straight across the park like a pencil line etched into a pastel landscape of muted greens and browns, the Tamiami trail was considered a feat of engineering when it was laid down in the 1920s. Now, as with many other legacies of South Florida’s development boom, it’s clear the highway has inflicted untold harm on the Everglades.
A canal roughly the width of the highway itself rims the Tamiami’s north-facing side, catching freshwater and diverting it east, to aquifers along the coast. “The Tamiami trail has become an obstruction to north-south water flow—it basically acts as a dam,” Julie Hill Gabriel, director of Everglades policy for Audubon Florida, told me. “One of our big challenges is, how do you get that obstruction out of the way?”


For now, the solution lies in raising parts of the road so that water can flow underneath. A one-mile section of the so-called Tamiami bridge was completed in 2013, and construction of another 2.6 mile segment could begin this fall. Eventually, federal government plans to extend the bridge up to 6.5 miles.
It’s a major symbolic victory for conservationists, but in reality the Tamiami bridge is a small piece of what’s needed to solve the Everglades’ water problems. The fundamental issue is that not enough fresh water comes south from Lake Okeechobee anymore—and that problem calls for more complex and costly engineering solutions.
That’s where the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) comes in. Formally launched in 2000, this multi-decade, Army Corps-led effort to restore the Everglades by putting the water back where it needs to be was initially pegged as a $10.5 billion project. Nearly twenty years in, it’s been plagued by delays and budget cuts, fought by agricultural lobbies, and remains nowhere near completion. Meanwhile, the estimated cost of CERP has soared.


One of the biggest challenges facing Everglades restoration is simply acquiring land south of Lake Okeechobee, in what’s known as the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). “We need big, engineered wetlands,” Zack Jud of the Florida Oceanographic Society told me. “Instead of flowing billions of gallons of water [from Lake Okeechobee] to the coast, we need to send it through filtration marshes, so that by the time it gets to the south, it’s clean enough to give to the Everglades.”
But most of the land that could store water to send into these wetlands is owned by several politically powerful sugar companies, who like South Florida’s plumbing the way it is.


In 2014, after a large parcel of land south of the lake went on the market, Floridians voted overwhelmingly in support of Amendment 1, which earmarked hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars for its purchase. Instead, the state took that money and used it to purchase anything and everything else in the name of conservation. They even gave some of it directly to farmers. Environmentalists place the blame squarely on the sugar lobby.
“Amendment 1 was misappropriated, and we did not get the opportunity to buy land south of the lake,” Jud said. “The governor sided with the sugar industry.”


Despite recent setbacks, proponents of Everglades restoration are encouraged by the public support their cause has garnered. It’s now widely agreed that moving more freshwater south is our best (and perhaps only) shot at revitalizing the Everglades—stopping peat collapse, preventing seagrass die-offs, and allowing more natural ecological transitions to occur as climate change progresses.


What’s more, with rising sea levels threatening to wipe South Florida off the map, a healthy Everglades could be the last line of defense. “You could say Everglades restoration is a waste of money because it’s all going to be drowned anyhow,” Wanless said. “But if you can have a more reliable, higher level of freshwater running through the Everglades, and the wetlands can build up peat again, you can keep the saltwater encroachment at bay better. And that’s worth it’s weight in gold.”
“Putting that water back certainly buys us time,” Stabenau said. “It certainly buys us environmental resilience. Does it solve the problem forever? I don’t think sea level is going to come up just a few inches and stop. But if it turns out down the road that we have engineering solutions to climate issues and water problems, we’re buying ourselves time to figure that out.”
On my last day in the Everglades, I took a tour of Ten Thousand Islands, a swampy archipelago rimming Florida’s southwest coast. For thousands of years, Native Americans lived here like kings, feasting off oysters, crabs, lobsters, and fish. Peregrine falcons soared overhead as our airboat navigated tufts of land held together by twisted mangrove roots. The silhouettes of sausage-shaped manatees appeared and faded again. A bottlenose dolphin caught our boat’s wake and followed it, leaping in and out of the water as my tour guide made sharp turns to kick up surf.
In this tattered mosaic of water and land, the Everglades is still wild. The existential threats I’d spent the last week learning about seemed to fade into irrelevance. It was difficult to imagine how humans could destroy something so vast.


My guide seemed to share this view. The rise and fall of the sea, he said, was something that city folk in Miami worried about. Out here, the will of the ocean was inevitable, as much a part of the fabric of life as the rise and fall of the sun.
Florida will be underwater again someday, probably no matter what we do. But right now, on timescales that matter to people, it is people who will decide its fate.
As black-bottomed storm clouds rolled in, we hurried back to the shore.
Obviously, in order to answer this super-silly thought exercise, you’d have to make it a little bit more manageable to calculate. That means in this scenario, the Earth is perfectly round, has the same density all throughout, and won’t, like, scorch your bum when you fall through the core. Life Noggin explains the math behind how long it would take, giving consideration to all that gravity nonsense, and comes up with a shockingly small number.
It’s 42 minutes. Let’s start digging a hole.

Bagpipes and other wind instruments produce beautiful music, but they can also be prime breeding grounds for molds and fungi. Players then regularly breathe in those creatures, and can develop inflamed lungs as a result—or even a fatal lung disease.
That’s the conclusion of an unusual case study just published in the journal Thorax by researchers at the University Hospital South Manchester in England. They’ve dubbed it “bagpipe lung,” because that was this particular patient’s instrument of choice, but the same risk applies to any wind instrument, the authors caution.


We’ve all experienced that annoying nagging cough that lingers on after we catch a cold or the flu. Now imagine coughing for seven years. That’s what happened to the 61-year-old man in the case study. He was diagnosed with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP)—essentially chronic inflammation of the lungs usually brought on by inhaling dust, fungus, mold, or chemicals—which can lead to severe lung disease.
It can be difficult to pinpoint whatever triggered the onset of HP. This particular patient had none of the usual risk factors: there was no mold in his home, he hadn’t been exposed to pigeons or other birds, he didn’t smoke, and he didn’t work with chemicals.
But he did play his beloved bagpipes every day, despite having trouble breathing because of his inflamed lungs. Coincidentally, the only time his symptoms improved during those seven years was when he spent three months in Australia and left his bagpipes behind.


When samples were taken from the bag, neck, and reed protector of the instrument and placed in a petri dish, several different varieties of fungi bloomed.
It seems that yeast, mold, and other microbes really flourish in the moist environment provided by the bagpipes. The man had been breathing in these fungi every day when he played, triggering his HP.
Alas, the man did not respond to treatment and died from all the damage to his lungs. Granted, it’s a single isolated case, but there have also been reported (non-fatal) cases of HP in people who played the saxophone and the trumpet. There are no established guidelines on the best way to clean wind instruments, but lead author Jenny King and her colleagues advise regularly swabbing them with disinfectant after use, the better to keep the growth of microbes in check.
The case also illustrates just how vital it is to take a detailed, thorough case history, including patient hobbies. If doctors and musicians become more aware of this particular health risk, maybe the next bagpipe player with a chronic cough won’t have to wait seven years to pinpoint the trigger.
UPDATE: 8/23/16 12:45 PM: The fine folks at the Piping Live! Glasgow International Piping Festival have recorded a helpful video at the National Piping Centre to show musicians how to properly clean their bagpipes.

Generally, if scientists want to see how a living thing functions in high resolution, they need to slice it into tiny pieces first. Now, there’s scientists a powerful and bizarre new tool in researchers’ arsenal.
According to research published in Nature, a new technique called ultimate 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (uDISCO for short) makes mice look like glow-in-the-dark gummy bears.
uDISCO isn’t completely new, but it was recently perfected by Ali Ertürk of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. It uses genetic modification to make a specimen’s proteins glow green, making them easy to identify by laser scanning. As for the “solvent-cleared organs” portion of the name, therein lies the gruesome bit: water and fat are chemically stripped and dehydrated out of the specimen over the course of several days, shrinking it by as much as 65 percent. The process even turns bones transparent.


The result, in this case anyway, is a small, nearly transparent mouse whose nerves and organs can be viewed with terrific detail. The essential parts of the mouse are exactly where they normally are, with the extraneous stuff is removed or made see-through.
Chief among uDISCO’s potential applications is the possibility for mapping the human brain, as well as learning about diseases that affect it like Alzheimers and Parkinson’s. The level of detail achievable through the technique is best illustrated by the video below, which includes a fly-through of a mouse’s nervous system. (Which let’s not even pretend that isn’t the coolest shit you’ve seen today.)

The “coffee ring effect” is that pattern you get when a single liquid evaporates and leaves behind a ring of previously dissolved solids. In the case of coffee, that would be the coffee grounds. A new paper in Physical Review E. demonstrates that we still have a lot to learn about this seemingly simple everyday occurrence.
Physicists know that the ring occurs because the liquid evaporates more quickly at the edges of the drop than at the center. So the remaining liquid at the center will flow outward to the edges to fill in the gaps, dragging particles like coffee grounds with it. Those particles stick to the surface at the edges of the ring—hence the dark outline around the stain.


The more you know about the various forces at play during this process, the better you can predict where those grounds will end up. So physicists engaged n fluid dynamics research are naturally keen to lean more about the coffee ring effect. It doesn’t just appear in coffee. Whiskey will also leave telltale rings, as will any other liquid with tiny particles suspended in it: blood, paint, and ink, for instance.
Lehigh University graduate student Baiou Shi accidentally spilled her coffee one morning in the lab, and just as she was about to clean it up, her advisor, Edmund Webb, stopped her: “Don’t do it!” That inspired them to run their own computer simulation of how a drop spreads out on a flat surface.


They didn’t simulate coffee, however, but a drop of lead filled with tiny copper particles on a copper surface, which simplifies the physics just a bit—the better to calculate all the forces involved. And they used surfaces with different crystal structures to get a better idea of how the spreading of the drops can vary, and what impact this has on if and how the particles eventually stick to the surface at the outer edges of the resulting ring.
Shi and Webb’s simulation showed that a very thin film will form on the surface, just ahead of the spreading droplet, and unlike the drop, it doesn’t stop spreading once the dark outer ring has formed. They’re not sure why; more experiments and simulations will no doubt be in order. But if physicists can crack the mystery, they’ll be able to manipulate these kinds of liquids at the nanoscale, opening up a host of potential applications in medicine and high-tech manufacturing.

Remember that time Stephen Colbert brought physicist Brian Greene on The Late Show to demonstrate the concept of gravitational waves with green lasers? Yeah, that was pretty awesome. Now there’s a handy DIY demonstration for those of us without access to that kind of technology, courtesy of science presenter Steve Mould.
For those who haven’t been following the biggest science story of the year, gravitational waves are light-speed ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by such epically violent events as exploding stars and black hole mergers. They’re incredibly tiny and difficult to detect, but the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) did just that, announcing the first direct detection in February. They announced a second detection in June.


But Mould felt something was missing in the deluge of explainers, graphics, and animations spawned by the discovery. “In all the graphics that I’ve seen, there’s a kind of disconnect between the objects and the waves that they produce,” he explains in the video. “There’s no way to see how one causes the other, and I think we can fix that with an actual physical demonstration of gravitational waves.”
First, build your own spacetime warping demo with stretched spandex lycra, marbles, and weights. Then mount a couple of little wheels onto a wooden plank to simulate a pair of binary black holes, and use a drill to set them rotating at the requisite 18 times per second. Voila! Ripples in the fabric of your two-dimensional spacetime.

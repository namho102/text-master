MADRID Britain's Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund made it through to the second round of the Barcelona Open on Monday.
Evans recovered from a set down to defeat Brazilian qualifier Thiago Monteiro 6-7 6-2 7-6 and will play Mischa Zverev, the German 14th seed who knocked Andy Murray out of the Australian Open in January, in the second round.
Edmund sailed through in straight sets 6-3 6-4 against world number 70 Jeremy Chardy and will face fourth seed Dominic Thiem of Austria.
Local favorite Tommy Robredo lost 6-4 6-3 to Yuichi Sugita of Japan. However, there was better news for the home crowd as Nicolas Almagro beat Canada's Steven Diez 6-3 6-4.
The line-up for the second round will be confirmed on Tuesday, with Dustin Brown versus Bernard Tomic the pick of the day's action. The winner will face Murray.

BERLIN Russian Olympic heptathlete Tatiana Chernova was stripped of her 2008 Beijing Games bronze medal on Monday after she tested positive to banned substances in re-tests of her sample.
Chernova's 2008 sample tested positive for anabolic steroid turinabol as did the sample from the 2012 Olympics of fellow Russian Maksim Dyldin, who was fifth with the 4x400m relay team at the Games in London.
Cheronova initially finished fourth in Beijing but was upgraded to bronze after Ukraine's Liudmyla Blonska tested positive in 2008.  Britain's Kelly Sotherton, originally fifth, is now in line to be promoted to the bronze medal position.
More than 100 athletes have had positive results in re-tests of samples taken during the London 2012 and Beijing 2008 Olympics conducted by the IOC.
The re-testing program is part of the IOC's efforts to catch cheats using newer testing methods or looking for substances that were not known at the time of past Olympics, and to prevent them from competing in future Games.
Samples are stored for a decade, and for the 2008 and 2012 re-tests Russia has had the most positive cases per nation.

BERLIN Romania Fed Cup captain Ilie Nastase will have to wait for at least two weeks to discover if he is to face further action after he was provisionally banned from all ITF events following his verbal abuse of British players last weekend.
The 70-year-old former French and U.S. Open champion, who earned a reputation for controversial behavior during his playing days, was excluded from the tie on Saturday for unsportsmanlike conduct, with an investigation under way.
"(The investigation) is ongoing. At this point, one of the principles that is important is that we want a rigorous process that is fair," International Tennis Federation (ITF) President David Haggerty said on Monday.
"We will also hear Nastase’s side of the argument. It will be a thorough process conducted in an efficient manner. I do not think you will be hearing any final decisions in the next two weeks."
Saturday's second singles rubber between Romania and Britain was briefly suspended with world number seven Johanna Konta in tears after the remarks made by Nastase.
Konta recovered her composure to finish off a victory over Romania's Sorana Cirstea and level the tie at 1-1 but Romania went on to win it and Konta and Heather Watson both lost on Sunday.
Britain's captain Anne Keothavong also said she was made to feel uncomfortable by "inappropriate comments" made by Nastase at the official pre-match dinner.
Nastase had already run into trouble during the World Group II playoff tie in Constanta, Romania, after allegedly making a derogatory comment about American world number two Serena Williams's unborn child.

LONDON Serena Williams returned to the top of the WTA world rankings on Monday and immediately shared the news with her unborn baby.
The American, who is skipping the rest of the year after announcing last week that she was pregnant, took to social media to offer her first public thoughts on impending motherhood.
"My Dearest Baby, You gave me the strength I didn't know I had. You taught me the true meaning of serenity and peace," the 35-year-old who owns 23 grand slam titles, said on Instagram.
"I can't wait to meet you. I can't wait for you to join the players box next year," she continues.
"But most importantly, I am so happy to share being number one in the world with you... once again today. From the world's oldest number one to the world's youngest number one. - Your Mommy."
Williams set off a day of frenzied speculation last Wednesday with a selfie posted on social media -- posing for a photo in a yellow one-piece swimsuit on Snapchat -- with the caption "20 weeks".
She deleted the post shortly afterwards but her Los Angeles-based publicist Kelly Bush Novak later confirmed that the player, who is engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, was indeed expecting her first child.
It seems likely she was several weeks pregnant when she won this year's Australian Open to move to within one grand slam title of matching Australian Margaret Court's record of 24.
Her message on Monday appears to underline her resolve to return to action next year.
Despite not having played since January when she moved ahead of Steffi Graf as the most successful tennis player in the professional era by beating sister Venus in the Australian Open final, she replaced Germany's Angelique Kerber as world number one in the rankings on Monday.

MELBOURNE The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) is to hold a "crisis meeting" this week after allegations of bullying were leveled against a senior executive, local media reported on Monday.
Former CEO Fiona de Jong, who departed the AOC in December, confirmed to local media she had made a formal complaint against the AOC's media and communications director Mike Tancred.
Tancred declined to comment when contacted by Reuters about the allegations, which have emerged three weeks before the AOC's presidential election at the annual general meeting on May 6.
State media ABC reported on Monday the AOC's board would meet this week after a number of its members expressed concerns about "significant reputational damage" to the Committee.
An AOC spokesperson confirmed the meeting to Australian Associated Press but provided no details.
Tancred is a long-serving lieutenant to AOC President John Coates, who will contest the election for one of Australia's top jobs in sport against board member and Olympic hockey gold medalist Danni Roche.
The election marks the first leadership challenge to Coates since he assumed the role in 1990.
An International Olympic Committee vice president and one of the most powerful sports administrators in the world, Coates has been embroiled in a public feud with the Australian Sports Commission, a government agency that disburses sports funding.
De Jong complained that the AOC was dragging its heels on an investigation into her complaint.
Ryan Wells, another former AOC staffer, detailed a separate allegation of bullying against Tancred when working in its media department in 2004.
He said he was made redundant six months after making a complaint.
In a Monday editorial, the Sydney Morning Herald called for change at the AOC.
"The allegations of a bullying and toxic culture under Mr Coates' watch at the organization have reached a critical mass," it said, adding that in any other field "the doubts over Mr Coates would destroy his chances" of extending his reign.

With no question marks over his health or motivation, former champion Wladimir Klitschko has no plans to bring the curtain down on his 21-year professional career and is relishing the pressure ahead of his title fight against Briton Anthony Joshua.
Klitschko, who went unbeaten for 11 years before losing to Tyson Fury in 2015, has 64 wins against four defeats and will be hoping to seize Joshua's IBF heavyweight crown as well as the vacant WBA and IBO titles also up for grabs.
"Hopefully, I have a couple of years left in me," the 41-year-old Ukrainian told British media.
"I was always saying health and motivation is very important. If one of those things is missing then it doesn't make sense to continue."
Klitschko will face Joshua on April 29 in front of a 90,000 strong crowd at Wembley, one of the largest crowds in British boxing.
"In regards to pressure, it's just enjoyable. Anthony Joshua is a great fighter, I'm taking on the best out there to be the best. It's challenging... My next stage is bigger than my last," Klitschko said.
"The attention for the previous fight was less compared with this. It is an upgrade, it is a winning upgrade. I love it."

Canada survived a scary moment in the heats before going on to deliver a stunning win ahead of the United States and Jamaica in the men's 4x200 meters at the IAAF World Relays on Sunday.
Germany produced another surprise an hour later when they won the women's 4x100 after U.S. leadoff runner Tianna Bartoletta slipped and fell.
Despite that disappointment, the Americans still ended the two-day competition in Nassau with the most gold medals, five.
A strong leg by Olympic silver medalist Andre De Grasse and a solid exchange with anchor Aaron Brown put the Canadians out front in the men's 4x200 and Brown raced home for the year's best time of 1:19.42.
Brown said the team had been determined to make up for a dropped baton that knocked them out of Saturday's 4x100.
"It did not go well yesterday," said Brown. "But I'm glad we were able to break the curse, get the monkey off our backs and show the world what we are able to do in the relays."
The win, the first in the event by a non-U.S. or Jamaican team at the World Relays, came after Canadian leadoff runner Gavin Smellie was called for a false start in the heats.
“There was maybe a little twitch, but I didn’t move,” said Smellie. “I was asking the officials to watch the video to see there was no false start.”
The officials agreed and the red card was withdrawn.
The United States, running without Justin Gatlin, were second in the final in 1:19.88 and Jamaica took third (1:21.09).
In the women's 4x100, anchor Rebekka Haas held off Jamaica's Sashalee Forbes to give Germany their first World Relays victory in 42.84 seconds
"We were just hoping to get a medal, but we got gold," said German leadoff Alexandra Burghardt.
The United States won three of Sunday's other finals.
Olympic bronze medalist Clayton Murphy outdueled Kenya's Ferguson Rotich in the men's 4x800 as the United States came home in 7:13.16 with Kenya running 7:13.70.
Olympian LaShawn Merritt anchored the Americans to a narrow victory over Botswana in the men's 4x400, the Americans winning in 3:02.13, just 0.15 seconds ahead of Botswana.
There was no such drama in the women's 4x400 where the Americans came home in 3:24.36, nearly four seconds ahead of Poland.
"These ladies blew that thing open for me," said American anchor Natasha Hastings.
Host Bahamas finally struck victory in the finale of the night, the mixed 4x400, in 3:14.42.
The top eight finishers in the 4x100 and 4x400 for men and women automatically qualified for the IAAF world championships in London in August.

(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Sunday's National Basketball Association games:

Cavaliers 106, Pacers 102
LeBron James scored 33 points, including the go-ahead three-pointer with 1:08 remaining, and Cleveland completed a four-game sweep of Indiana in their NBA playoff opening-round series.
Indiana, which never had been swept in a seven-game series, took a 102-100 lead on Thaddeus Young's tip-in with 1:31 to play, but the Cavaliers scored the game's final six points to advance to the second round of the Eastern Conference.
For James, it was his 21st consecutive first-round playoff game victory, breaking Magic Johnson's record of 20 set in the mid-1980s.

Rockets 113, Thunder 109
Nene scored 28 points and Eric Gordon and Lou Williams added 18 each as Houston took a 3-1 lead in their Western Conference first-round series with Oklahoma City.
The Rockets have a chance to close out the series on Tuesday at home in Game Five.

Celtics 104, Bulls 95
Isaiah Thomas scored 33 points as Boston tied the Eastern Conference first-round series 2-2. The best-of-seven series resumes on Wednesday night in Boston.
Neither team has won a home game in the series.
Gerald Green scored a playoff-career-high 18 points, and Al Horford finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Celtics, who blew a 20-point lead only to rebound after the Bulls took a two-point lead in the third quarter.

Jazz 105, Clippers 98
Joe Johnson scored 28 points and Rudy Gobert added 15 points and 13 rebounds in his first game back from injury to help Utah tie the series 2-2.
Rodney Hood chipped in 18 points and Derrick Favors added 17 off the bench to help Utah win a playoff game at home for the first time in seven years.
Eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao concedes his next opponent Jeff Horn is a bit of an unknown quantity but has told the Australian he needs to be in peak condition to make sure their WBO welterweight title fight pleases fight fans Down Under.
Pacquiao made a low-key entry to Australia on Monday, touching down at Brisbane airport for a promotional tour for their July 2 bout at Lang Park and speaking briefly to reporters before being whisked away by handlers.
"I don't know much about him, but I know he's a fighter," Pacquiao told local media.
"I haven't watched his fights yet, but I'm going to get his last three fights and watch it.
"My message for him is to work hard, and make sure you're 100 percent conditioned on July 2 so we can give a good fight, we can entertain people."
The fight against Horn (16-0-1) will be the 38-year-old Pacquiao's first since his unanimous decision victory for the title over American Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas last November.
Pacquiao had previously agreed to an April fight against Briton Amir Khan in the United Arab Emirates but his promoter Bob Arum said last month it had been postponed after the $38 million offer for the bout failed to materialize.
The Horn-Pacquiao fight is eagerly anticipated in Australia and will be the biggest boxing event held in the country in decades.
Organizers expect a crowd of over 50,000 to cram into Lang Park, which regularly hosts domestic and international rugby and soccer matches.
Dean Lonergan, a director at promoter Duco Events, hoped the bout would revitalise boxing in Australia.
"It's been in the doldrums for some time," Lonergan said in comments published by state media ABC.
"I think you'll find this will be the biggest fight in Australian history and you'll see the underdog (Horn) come through, and there's nothing like Australians supporting their own guys when they're underdogs."

MANCHESTER, England For years it was assumed that if professional women's club soccer was to truly take off it would be the United States that would provide the home for an elite competition.
The U.S national team have won the World Cup three times and are four-times Olympic gold medalists. The country has produced some of the women's game's biggest and most marketable names.
On Saturday, however, two of those big names of American women's soccer, 2015 World Cup winners Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan, were in action in the north-west of England at Manchester City's Academy Stadium.
Lloyd, the current World Player of the Year, lined up in the sky blue of her Manchester club while Morgan was facing her for French team Olympique Lyon in the first leg of the semi-finals of the UEFA Women's Champions League.
It is a situation that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago but the recent growth of well-resourced women's teams at big European clubs such as City, Lyon and the other two semi-finalists, Barcelona and Paris St Germain, has changed the landscape for women players.
The big clubs are assembling increasingly international squads and recruiting from far and wide and Lyon's Norwegian international striker Ada Hederberg sees it as completely natural that American women would now come to Europe.
"If you are an American player I would think you would want to play at the highest level and you have the Champions League here in Europe, so why not?" she told Reuters after Lyon enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win against City.
"You have European football growing a lot now -– Barcelona, the Spanish teams, the English league, France, Germany, the game is growing in Europe and it is going to be exciting the next few years to see what happens," she said.
Both Lloyd, who scored a hat-trick in the 2015 World Cup final, and Morgan are on temporary deals in Europe while remaining under contract with their U.S. National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) teams.
Lloyd will return to her Houston Dash at the end of the  England's Women's Super League Spring Series while Morgan is due back with Orlando Pride after Lyon's season ends in June.
The NWSL is the latest attempt, after some failed efforts, to establish a solid professional club league in the U.S. and while it is making progress, limited budgets may lead to more Americans turning to Europe.
Recently Heather O'Reilly, a three-time gold-medal winner with the U.S., joined Arsenal while emerging American talent Crystal Dunn quit the NWSL's Washington Spirit to join Chelsea.

BIG NAMES
City's England international midfielder Jill Scott welcomes the trend and says she would not be surprised to see more Americans packing their bags soon.
"It is fantastic that we can attract players like this, you see the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal, players are now wanting to come and play in our league. That shows the progress that we have made and hopefully we can keep increasing the standard of our league and we can attract more big names," she said.
Lloyd says she had received plenty of questions from American players about life at Manchester City and the opportunities in Europe.
"I have had nothing but good things to say," she told Reuters, adding that she too would expect more of her compatriots to follow her path, especially before the big international competitions.
“I think so, time is running out though as we get close to 2019 and 2020 because those are big years with the World Cup and Olympics, it would have to be between now and 2019.
"It is a great competition to be able to compete in -– it's been a lot of fun," she said.
While Lloyd has been full of praise for the facilities available to City players, Morgan has made a point of highlighting the different styles of play that can be learnt in Europe and when she signed for Lyon talked of being "immersed in a soccer culture".
"It has always been a dream of mine to 'live' soccer and to compete in the Champions League," she said.
Although the U.S. college system continues to be an attractive option, the growth of big clubs in Europe and leagues such as England's Women's Super League, are likely to limit the number of players heading across the Atlantic to play club football in the States.
"You can see young English players in this league getting better and better. Why would they want to move to another league when ours is getting better and better?" asked Scott.

Romania Fed Cup captain Ilie Nastase was provisionally suspended from all International Tennis Federation (ITF) events on Sunday after being thrown out of the tie against Britain for verbally abusing opposing team members and the umpire.
The 70-year-old former French and U.S. Open champion, who earned a reputation for controversial behavior during his playing days, was excluded from the tie on Saturday for unsportsmanlike conduct.
Nastase had already run into trouble during the World Group II playoff tie in Constanta, Romania, after allegedly making a derogatory comment about American world number two Serena Williams's unborn child.
"Under the terms of the provisional suspension, Nastase may not participate in the Fed Cup in any capacity with immediate effect and shall be denied access to, and accreditation for, any ITF event including Fed Cup," the ITF said in a statement on Sunday.
The sport's governing body said it was continuing an investigation into the weekend's events and would make no further comment until that was completed.
Saturday's second singles rubber was briefly suspended with British world number seven Johanna Konta in tears, apparently because of remarks made by Nastase.
Konta recovered her composure to finish off a victory over Romania's Sorana Cirstea and level the tie at 1-1.
Britain's captain Anne Keothavong also said she was made to feel uncomfortable by comments made by Nastase at the official pre-match dinner.
Konta and Heather Watson both lost on Sunday to give Romania victory in the playoff.
At the draw for the tie on Friday, Nastase was heard speaking in Romanian to one of his team members about 23-times grand-slam champion Williams's baby.
"Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?" he was quoted by Romanian and some British media as saying.
Williams, who confirmed her pregnancy through a spokeswoman last week, is engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who is white.
Konta, who was beaten 6-1 6-3 by Simona Halep on Sunday,    defended herself after Cirstea said she had "over-reacted" by crying in their match.
"With all due respect to Sorana, she was not in my shoes at that end of the court being verbally threatened," Konta was quoted as saying by British media.
"Any abuse is not all right but when it's a couple of meters away from you, screaming at you, I think that's a different ball game. It's not something that you truly know how it affects you until you experience it, so I do believe she may have been slightly unaware of the events that happened."
Irina-Camelia Begu saw off Watson with a 6-4 7-5 victory to seal the tie for the Romanians before the doubles.
The visitors gained a consolation win when Laura Robson and Jocelyn Rae beat Halep and Monica Niculescu 6-3 1-6 10-8 in the doubles dead rubber.

Chuck Wielgus, executive director of USA Swimming for nearly two decades, died on Sunday in Colorado Springs of complications from colon cancer, the organization announced. He was 67.
Wielgus joined USA Swimming as executive director in 1997 and presided over a successful period in which the nation’s elite swimmers dominated international competition.
There were 156 podium performances by American swimmers in five Olympics during the tenure of Wielgus, including 16 gold medals at the 2016 Rio Games. No other nation won more than three golds in Rio.
“This is an extremely sad day, as we lost... one of the finest men I have ever had the pleasure to work alongside,” said Jim Sheehan, chair of the USA Swimming board of directors.
U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun also paid tribute to Wielgus.
“During his tenure at USA Swimming, American swimmers enjoyed more success and more support than ever before. He had a passion for his work and cared deeply about sport. Chuck fought a long and hard battle with amazing grace and optimism, and will be missed."

Hosts Romania beat Britain in their controversial Fed Cup World Cup play-off in Constanta on Sunday, with both Johanna Konta and Heather Watson failing to win their respective singles rubbers for the visitors.
Simona Halep beat world number seven Konta 6-1 6-3, while Irina-Camelia Begu saw off Watson with a 6-4 7-5 victory to seal the tie for the Romanians before the doubles.
World number five Halep started strongly against Konta on Sunday, opening up a 4-0 lead en route to winning the first set in 27 minutes.
Konta improved in the second to go 3-1 up, but Halep's superiority on clay shone through as she won five games in a row to clinch the match.
Konta was left in tears on Saturday apparently because of remarks made by Romanian captain Ilie Nastase during her match with Sorana Cirstea, which resulted in play being briefly suspended. [nL3N1HU06C]
Nastase was eventually banned from the tie because of "unsportsmanlike conduct" and had his accreditation removed by the International Tennis Federation, which has launched an investigation into his conduct.
Konta defended herself after Cirstea said on Sunday that she had "overreacted" by crying in their match.
"With all due respect to Sorana, she was not in my shoes at that end of the court being verbally threatened," Konta was quoted as saying by British media. "Any abuse is not all right.

Watson could not beat Begu to keep Britain's hopes alive, but the visitors gained a consolation win after Laura Robson and Jocelyn Rae beat Halep and Monica Niculescu in the doubles dead rubber.

LONDON Kenya's Daniel Wanjiru held off a late charge from Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele to win the London Marathon on Sunday in two hours five minutes 48 seconds.
His triumph completed the double for Kenya after Mary Keitany sealed her third London title in a women only world record of 2:17.01, beating Britain’s Paula Radcliffe's previous best by 41 seconds.
Radcliffe still holds the overall record of 2:15.25, which she set in a mixed gender race at the London Marathon in 2003 when she used male runners to help set the pace.
The IAAF recognizes two marathon world records for women, one for "mixed gender" and the other for "women only".
Bekele, 34, a three-time Olympic champion on the track, had been hoping to break Dennis Kimetto’s men’s world record of 2:02.57 and asked pacemakers to deliver him to the halfway mark in 61.30.
They arrived 10 seconds slower - still on world-record pace - but Bekele then fell away as his leg muscles tightened up under the strain, leaving Wanjiru, fellow Kenyans Bedan Karoki and Abel Kirui and Ethiopia’s Feyisa Lilesa to form a four-man lead group.
However, Bekele staged a recovery and was only a handful of seconds adrift of the head of the race when Wanjiru split the lead quartet with an acceleration in the 21st mile.
Bekele overtook Lilesa, Kirui and Karoki but could not catch Wanjiru, who won by nine seconds in his first appearance at the London Marathon.
Karoki finished one minute 53 seconds down in third on his marathon debut.
“Being second is frustrating. I felt my hamstring and my right calf. I had to change my running style,” Bekele told reporters.
The women’s race was far less competitive, after Keitany made an electric start and distanced all of her rivals by mile three.
She reached 10 miles one minute ahead of Radcliffe's overall world record, and although that pace proved unsustainable, she managed to stay comfortably ahead of the women’s only record.
Ethiopia’s Tirunesh Dibaba finished 56 seconds down in second place, while compatriot Aselefech Mergia was 6.07 minutes down in third.
Keitany said she did not think the overall record can be beaten in a women-only race such as London.
“I think 2:15 it might be impossible with a women's only. For the women only, 2:17 is possible, but not 2:15,” she said.
“I tried to push all the time. I’m very happy with the finish time.”
Last year’s winner, Jemima Sumgong of Kenya, did not defend her title after failing a drugs test earlier in the season.

LONDON Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele partly blamed his state-of-the-art Nike shoes for his failure to win the London Marathon on Sunday.
The 34-year-old was the pre-race favorite and had been on course to break the world record after 13 miles, but he then slowed down and fell behind his rivals.
He staged a superb recovery to finish second behind Kenya’s Daniel Wanjiru. He later explained that his problems had been caused by blistering.
Bekele was wearing Nike’s Zoom Vaporfly Elite shoes, which will be worn by Eliud Kipchoge, Lelisa Desisa and Zersenay Tadese in their Nike-backed attempt to run a sub-two-hour marathon in Italy next month.
“I used new shoes. When I was between 15km and 20km, the shoes started blistering my foot. My foot was not in a good position because of the shoes," Bekele told reporters.
“I changed the style to protect my foot more. It was difficult and changing the style affected my balance.
“Because of that I feel a little bit my hamstring. My leg was not responding well. That’s why I slowed the pace. Around 35km, I was feeling better and increased the pace.”
Officials at Nike could not immediately be reached for comment.
Wanjiru held off Bekele by nine seconds to win in two hours five minutes 48 seconds in his first appearance at the London Marathon.
The 24-year-old insisted he had not been distracted by Bekele’s demise and subsequent revival.
“I was not feeling (under pressure by) anybody because I was having self-confidence. My expectation was to win because I prepared very well in Kenya and my training went perfect.”

MONTE CARLO Rafael Nadal claimed a record-extending 10th Monte Carlo Masters title as he geared up for his beloved French Open with a 6-1 6-3 victory against fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos on Sunday.
The fourth seed, who is also targeting a 10th Roland Garros trophy this year, was always in command as he claimed his first ATP title since triumphing in Barcelona a year ago.
The 14-times grand slam champion had won his two previous encounters against Ramos and the 15th seed failed to snap that run on Sunday.
"It has been an amazing week on one of the most important events on the tour. I played well here, which helps me a lot to start the claycourt season with confidence," said Nadal.
Nadal wasted three break points in the second game as Ramos leveled for 1-1, only for the claycourt king to win the next five games to bag the opening set.
With Nadal's topspin working with devastating effect, Ramos struggled to stay close to his baseline.
The Mallorcan broke for 3-2 in the second set when Ramos sent a backhand long and from then on Nadal was unstoppable.
Ramos ended his first Masters final with a double fault that handed Nadal his 70th ATP title on the third match point.

BELGRADE A floundering Novak Djokovic should seek advice from evergreen Swiss maestro Roger Federer in order to rediscover his vintage self, the Serb's former Davis Cup coach Bogdan Obradovic said.
Djokovic has suffered a spectacular fall from grace since he captured his maiden French Open title last June for his 12th major honor, completing a career slam of winning all four of the world's top tennis tournaments.
"Given that Federer was able to return into the top 10 and win this year's Australian Open at the age of 36, I see no reason why Djokovic can't be the world number one again," Obradovic told Belgrade daily Blic on Sunday.
"Maybe Djokovic should talk to Federer. They are friends, they have known each other for a long time and the Swiss can certainly give him some good advice."
Having relinquished the top spot in the ATP rankings to Briton Andy Murray in November, Djokovic made a shock second-round Australian Open exit to Uzbek Denis Istomin followed by successive defeats to Australian Nick Kyrgios in Acapulco and Indian Wells.
The 29-year-old Serb also crashed out of the Monte Carlo quarter-finals on Thursday with a painful defeat by Belgian David Goffin after he threw away a 4-2 lead in the third set.
Obradovic, who steered Serbia to the 2010 Davis Cup title and the 2013 final during his 10-year spell in charge, made way in December for doubles specialist Nenad Zimonjic who has since appeared in a dual player-coach role.
Having advised Djokovic several times to restore meat to his diet, Obradovic stressed he believed that Djokovic's perceived loss of appetite on the court has come hand-in-hand with more hunger shown by rivals who have sensed blood.
"All other players seem to be galvanized against him while his own motivation appears to be inconsistent and shifting all the time," said Obradovic.
"He is not at his best, his serve keeps fluctuating as do elements in his game which really used to be at highest level consistently.
"However, it is difficult to play at such a high level indefinitely. Murray has a huge advantage in the standings but I am sure Djokovic will be back in contention for the top spot."

Justin Gatlin and the United States roared to victory in the men's 4x100m relay as rivals Canada and Jamaica dropped batons at the IAAF World Relays in the Bahamas on Saturday.
Run down by Canadian Olympic medalist Andre De Grasse in the earlier heats, Gatlin romped home in the final, leading the U.S. team of Leshon Collins, Mike Rodgers and Ronnie Baker to victory in 38.43 seconds.
"It's all about execution, not about superior speed," the 35-year old Olympic 100 meters silver medalist told reporters.
"Britain and Canada didn't get the stick off (in the final) so I am running with 20 meters to the finish line wondering 'Hey, where is everybody at."
Barbados claimed the silver and China surprised by taking the bronze.
Australia finished fourth ahead of France as both joined the medalists in qualifying for the IAAF world championships in August.
DeGrasse, who many have labeled as retiring Jamaican record holder Usain Bolt's likely successor, never had a chance to replicate his first-round showing.
Team mate Aaron Brown briefly got the baton to Brendan Rodney on the second exchange before the stick slipped away.
Britain, who ran well until problems on the last exchange, and the Netherlands also failed to finish the race.
Olympic champions Jamaica were not even in the final.
A botched baton exchange in the heats sent packing the Jamaicans, who were running without both Bolt and former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell.
Only once before since 2008 had Jamaica failed to claim gold in a global 4x100m race.
Their women made up some of the disappointment in the women's 4x200m  with double Olympic champion Elaine Thompson leading them home in a championship record 1:29.04.
Germany beat out the United States for second.
The Americans were first in the women's 4x800m, dominating in 8:16.36. That was more than three seconds ahead of Belarus with Australia third.
In qualifying, Trinidad and Tobago's men (3:02.51) and the U.S. women (3:29.27) led advancers in the 4x400m.
The relays conclude on Sunday with the top eight finishers in the 4x100m and 4x400m for men and women automatically qualifying for the IAAF world championships.

POINT-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe An Italian father and son duo have sailed their way into the record books after taking just over 11 days to cross the Atlantic in a catamaran.
Nico and Vittorio Malingri arrived in the Guadeloupe port town of Pointe-à-Pitre on Thursday, 11 days, one hour and nine minutes after leaving Dakar in Senegal, the World Sailing Speed Record Council said.
The time was 10 hours, 16 minutes quicker than the previous mark set by French duo Benoit Lequin and Pierre-Yves Moreau in 2007.
"Guys, the experience was spectacular, we were always on target, the boat was great to travel on," Nico Malingri said.
"We started to get tired towards the end but up until then we were happy with our average speed, we were doing well, it was a lot of fun."
The distance from Senegal to Guadeloupe is around 4,725 km (2935 miles), roughly the same as between New York and San Francisco.

BUENOS AIRES Buenos Aires is dropping out of the running to host the 2023 Pan American Games and will instead focus on a bid for the event four years later, the president of the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA), Gerardo Werthein, said on Friday.
Werthein said the Argentine capital, which will hold the Olympic Youth Games next year, was dropping its plans due to financial reasons, which leaves Chile's Santiago as the only city interested in hosting the quadrennial event in 2023.
Werthein said delaying the bid would also fit into Buenos Aires' plans for a possible Summer Olympics bid.
“I would like Argentina to present its Olympic candidacy for 2032, but for now I’m only thinking about (the PanAm Games in) 2027,” Werthein told reporters.
“The budget necessary to organize the Pan American Games was $650 million... It’s too much for this moment in Argentina,” he was quoted as saying by the leading national daily La Nacion.
The Pan American Games, which will next be held in Lima in 2019, have been staged twice in Argentina – in Buenos Aires in 1951 and Mar del Plata in 1995.
The last Games were held in Toronto in 2015.

Long-hitting Tony Finau stumbled at the final hole to fall back into a share of the second-round lead with fellow American Bud Cauley at the Texas Open on Friday.
Finau, buoyed by an eagle at the par-four 11th, looked set to enjoy sole possession of the lead at the end of the day until he bogeyed the par-five 18th, though he still carded an excellent seven-under-par 65 at TPC San Antonio.
The one-time PGA Tour winner joined Cauley (66) at eight-under 136, with Australian Cameron Smith in a group of three players one shot behind.
Cauley was upbeat after hitting the front in his quest for a breakthrough victory on the PGA Tour, after previously finishing third on three occasions.
“I hit it a little better yesterday and didn’t quite convert on some of the putts. Today I putted really well,” he said.
“It was windy out there. I knew I was going to miss some greens and I was able to hit some good chips.”
Smith, one shot back, also enjoyed his fair share of good breaks in his 65.
“It all fell into place,” he said. “Everything I hit, whether it was a rubbish shot or a good shot, went close to the hole. My short game was really good. I think I had three chip-ins.”
Last year's PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker, who was recently diagnosed with Lyme disease, also moved into contention at his hometown event, three strokes behind.
Walker said on Friday he planned to take a break from golf to undergo treatment for the tick-transmitted bacterial infection that can cause headaches, fever, fatigue, rashes and, if less untreated, can spread to the heart, joints and nervous system.
He said he started feeling fatigued late last year, but was not diagnosed accurately until two weeks ago, just before the Masters.
“It’s nice to know it’s something and we can do something about it,” he told the PGA Tour official website.
“It’s something you don’t really like to tell people how tired you are, how fatigued you are ... are you just going crazy, getting old?”

A Massachusetts state judge on Friday ordered prison officials to preserve any evidence collected from the cell of former National Football League star Aaron Hernandez, according to court documents, two days after he was found dead of an apparent suicide.
Lawyers for Hernandez's family had sought the ruling to ensure they can conduct their own investigation into his death at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts.
A lawyer for the state correction department told Superior Court Judge Thomas McGuire in New Bedford, Massachusetts, that the maximum-security prison was already keeping any evidence, making a formal order unnecessary, the Boston Globe reported on Friday. But the judge said he would issue one regardless.
Investigators have formally ruled Hernandez's death a suicide. It remains unclear why the 27-year-old hanged himself at the prison, where he was serving life for the 2013 murder of an acquaintance.
His death came just days after he was acquitted at trial of separate double-murder charges.
Authorities said on Thursday three handwritten notes were found near a Bible in his cell, though their contents were not made public.
The attorney for Hernandez's family, George Leontire, said none of them had received a "scintilla of information about what transpired in his death," including the contents of the notes, the Globe reported.
The family is seeking the contents of Hernandez's cell, the bedsheet he used to hang himself, and recordings of emergency phone calls related to his medical treatment, among other items.
Hernandez, a New England Patriots tight end, was considered among the best at his position when he was arrested in June 2013 for murdering Odin Lloyd.
His lawyers are also expected to ask a court to vacate his 2015 murder conviction. Under Massachusetts state law, convictions are typically vacated for defendants who die before their appeals can be heard.
Hernandez's appeal was still pending at the time of his death.
Lloyd's mother has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Hernandez. On Friday, she and her attorney, Douglas Sheff, called on the Patriots to give $6 million to Hernandez's estate that could be turned over to his victims' families.
"We want to provide the Patriots with the opportunity to become something more - not just champions of football but to become champions of justice," Sheff said.
The $6 million is roughly the amount of guaranteed money owed under Hernandez's contract at the time of his arrest. The Patriots voided the deal soon after the arrest.

Former European Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter warned his critics not to write him off after officially relinquishing his exempt status on the PGA Tour on Friday.
Poulter needed to finish 36th or better at the Texas Open to keep his tour card, but he missed the cut after posting a two-over 146 halfway total at TPC San Antonio.
The blunt-talking Englishman said he would continue to play U.S. tournaments on sponsor invitations, and would also add European Tour events to his schedule.
“I think it has been slightly over-dramatized,” Poulter said of reports of his struggles. “Yeah, I would love to have finished it off and got it done this week but that hasn’t happened.
“It doesn’t mean you’re never going to see me again. It means I’ve got some work to do and I need to go away and do some work.”
Poulter, 41, is in the field for next week’s PGA Tour event, the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, where he will team up with Australian Geoff Ogilvy in the new format of 80 two-man teams.
After missing the second half of last season with a foot injury, he started this season on a major medical extension, needing to earn either 218 FedExCup points or $348,000 in 10 events to retain his full playing privileges.
Poulter, ranked fifth in the world in 2010, is currently number 190.
He has won 12 times on the European Tour, including two World Golf Championship events.
Poulter is best known for his stellar Ryder Cup play, playing on the winning European team in four of five appearances in the event and racking up an impressive individual record of 12 wins, four losses and two halves.
“Golf’s a funny game,” he said. “We could quite easily go out next week and win and things are a little different.”

LONDON Britain's Parkour governing body has accused gymnastics of "encroachment and misappropriation" in seeking to incorporate  elements of the running, climbing and jumping sport into a new discipline.
Britain in January became the first country officially to recognize Parkour, which was founded in France in the 1980s and takes its name from the French word 'parcours' (course or route).
In an open letter to the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), Parkour UK emphasized that it was a "distinct and unique  sport in its own right and not a discipline of any existing sport/activity.
"Parkour/Freerunning is not 'gymnastics', nor are Traceurs/Freerunners 'gymnasts'," it added. "We are our own sovereign sport with independently recognized distinct uniqueness and cultural status."
The FIG executive committee had said in a statement in February that it agreed the development of a new discipline aimed at broadening the appeal of gymnastics after research into parkour.
Parkour UK called for a meeting with FIG to agree a memorandum of understanding and said it would take any dispute to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

ZURICH Disgraced former FIFA president Sepp Blatter said on Friday he had met lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department but was not a suspect in their soccer-related corruption investigations.
The 81-year-old, banned for six years by FIFA's own ethics committee at the height of a scandal engulfing world soccer's governing body, told journalists he had met the U.S. lawyers in October or November, without going into further details.
Several dozen soccer officials, including some from FIFA, were indicted in the United States in 2015 on corruption-related chances.
Blatter was not among them, although he subsequently said his lawyer had advised him not to travel abroad.
"I have had very little contact from my American lawyers because I was never a person of interest under scrutiny by the American justice," he told a group of international reporters on Friday.
"I have been investigated in two or three matters ... but there is no wrongdoing." There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Justice Department.

"STILL POPULAR"
Blatter and Ex-UEFA president Michel Platini were banned from all football-related activities in 2015, initially for eight years, over a 2 million Swiss franc ($2 million) payment FIFA made to Platini in 2011, with Blatter’s approval, for work done a decade earlier.
Blatter said on Friday he had become a “punching bag” for all FIFA’s problems but that he was still generally liked by his Swiss compatriots.
"Here in the city of Zurich and Switzerland in general, I am not only accepted but they like me," said Blatter, who has denied all charged against him.
"I don't have the impression that I am a rejected man. Why should I be rejected? I have done a good (job at) FIFA ... I feel that wherever I go the people and young people recognize me and want to take a picture and say hello. There are still fans who write to me.”
He said Swiss prosecutors had not contacted him over a separate case initiated in September 2015 against him relating to accusations of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation.
"I have never heard anything, my lawyer has heard nothing about that," he said. “That does not surprise me, because there was no reasons to open a case against me.”
"I have been interviewed and I will be interviewed in future but not in these cases; I am interviewed in cases concerning the activities in FIFA, as a person of information."
Swiss authorities have also opened investigations into the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively, into Germany’s successful bid to host the 2006 World Cup and against former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke.

LONDON Jacques Villeneuve has applauded Fernando Alonso's gladiatorial spirit in chasing motorsport's 'Triple Crown' but the retired Formula One world champion and Indianapolis 500 winner said he was skeptical about the Spaniard's chances.
Alonso, who races for Honda-powered McLaren in Formula One, will be at Barber Motorsports Park in Birmingham, Alabama, this weekend to soak up the Indy Car atmosphere before competing in the Indy 500 in May.
A win on the famed Brickyard oval would be sensational but the double world champion will still have to conquer the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race to match the unique Triple Crown achieved by the late Briton Graham Hill in 1972.
Villeneuve, who won Indianapolis in 1995 and the Formula One title in 1997 before finishing second with Peugeot at Le Mans in 2008, felt the likelihood of Alonso succeeding was "tiny".
"But he will go for it, and that’s what’s great. That’s what makes it exciting," the Canadian told Reuters at the recent Bahrain Grand Prix.
"It’s typical gladiators and that’s what built the sport,  made it what it is today. So it’s good that there’s someone going back to its roots like this, it’s amazing.
"What I find disappointing is how many (F1) drivers say ‘why bother, it’s only an oval race... it’s dangerous, why would I race there?' Well, you’re a racer."

JIM CLARK
Indianapolis was part of the Formula One world championship from 1950 through to 1960 but the winners were all Americans unfamiliar to European audiences and did not compete in grands prix elsewhere.
In 1965 Jim Clark missed the showcase Monaco Grand Prix - as Alonso will also do this year - to race at Indy. The late Scot won, becoming the only driver to take the Formula One championship and Indianapolis in the same year.
Hill, father of 1996 world champion Damon, won the Formula One crown in 1962 and 1968, the Indy 500 in 1966 and Le Mans in 1972.
"If you are a pure race fan and are passionate and a racer at heart, you have to be interested in Le Mans and Indy 500 as well as F1. It’s the three main things in racing," said Villeneuve.
"For drivers it was always important ... I finished second in Le Mans which is a shame, that really kills me. That hurts."
The Canadian competed in Le Mans only after retiring from Formula One, with Alonso - who will be 36 in July - likely to follow the same route.
Villeneuve said he would love another go at the French race but was not kidding himself about his chances, and suggested Alonso should not either.
"I’m waiting for the call. It won’t happen. I’m 46 and you need to be 18 to race now," he said, with some exaggeration about the younger end of the spectrum given that nine times Le Mans winner Tom Kristensen of Denmark retired at 47.
McLaren won Le Mans in 1995 against faster prototypes in wet conditions but the race has been dominated for more than a decade by major manufacturers.
"There’s doing Le Mans, and there’s trying to win Le Mans. And there’s only two or three cars that can do it and there’s no way you can get in there," said Villeneuve.
"A constructor would not want a big name to win the Triple Crown because ultimately it’s not their publicity, it’s the driver’s publicity," he added.
"They want to win as a constructor. So there’s that aspect also that blocks it."

The former president of the Costa Rican Football Association, Eduardo Li, was banned from the game for life by FIFA's independent Ethics Committee on Friday, the organization said.
Li is one of 42 individuals and entities charged in a U.S. investigation into the biggest corruption scandal in the history of FIFA. He was among seven soccer officials arrested at a Zurich luxury hotel in May 2015.
Li, who was also a former member of the executive of CONCACAF, the regional confederation for North and Central America, pleaded guilty in a U.S federal court in October to taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes.
U.S. prosecutors alleged Li and others engaged in schemes involving over $200 million in bribes and kickbacks that were sought and received by soccer officials for marketing and broadcasting rights to tournaments and matches.
In court, Li had said he negotiated a $500,000 bribe, of which $300,000 he actually received, to award a Miami-based unit of Brazil's Traffic Group media and marketing rights for 2022 World Cup qualifier matches.
Li also said he had agreed to accept a separate $500,000 bribe, $230,000 of which he received, from Panama-based intermediaries in exchange for awarding a U.S. company a contract to be the Costa Rican national team's uniform sponsor.

MADRID World number one Andy Murray will play next week's Barcelona Open in a bid to build match fitness and clock up much-needed claycourt time ahead of next month's French Open.
Murray on Friday took the late decision to play in Spain after a surprise defeat at the hands of Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas in the last 16 of the Monte Carlo Masters.
Murray had been scheduled to play just Madrid and Rome ahead of the French Open. The Scot had suffered an elbow injury in March, and only made his return from a five-week layoff on Wednesday in Monaco.
It has been a tough start to 2017 for Murray after finishing last year as the world’s top-ranked player. His run of 28 consecutive wins was brought to an end by Novak Djokovic in Doha in January, while unheralded Mischa Zverev ended Murray's hopes of a maiden Australian Open title in Melbourne.
Murray won his first tournament of the year in Dubai last month, but a week later suffered a shock defeat to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil – his first loss to a player outside the top 100 in six years.

BOSTON Geoffrey Kirui and Edna Kiplagat produced a Kenyan sweep at the Boston Marathon, winning the men's and women's races on Monday by conquering the race's hilly final miles to establish their dominance.
Kirui finished in two hours nine minutes and 37 seconds after holding off a challenge by American Galen Rupp in the race's final stretch down Boylston Street, the site of the deadly 2013 bombing attack.
Kirui repeatedly tested Rupp in the closing miles, with the American Olympic bronze medalist eventually unable to match the Kenyan's pace.
"He put in several surges and I was able to cover a few of them," Rupp told reporters after the race.
Kiplagat, a 38-year-old mother of two whose resume includes marathon wins in London, Moscow, New York and Daegu, ran alone for the final miles of the race and finished in 2:21:52, almost a minute ahead of Bahrain's Rose Chelimo.
The Kenyan maintained her comfortable lead despite briefly stopping in the final miles when she realized she had grabbed a rival's water bottle from an aid station and went back to return it.
"I had to put back something which was not mine," Kiplagat told reporters. "I was afraid, because you know, if you miss water it can affect you."
American Jordan Hasay set a record for an American women's debut marathon, coming in third in 2:23:00. Japan's Suguru Osako finished third among the men.
Security was high along the course, which begins in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and passes through Boston's suburbs to the finish line, where a pair of ethnic Chechen brothers on April 15, 2013 set off two homemade bombs, killing three people and injuring more than 200.
Meb Keflezighi, who in 2014 became the first American to win the race in over three decades, finished 13th in his final Boston Marathon.
Keflezighi, who plans to retire from racing after the New York City marathon in November, stopped after his victory to touch the hand of Bill Richard, whose 8-year-old son Martin was the youngest person to die in the bombing.
"In 2013, I was a spectator just like the three victims and when I saw the 8-year-old ... the first thing in my mind was that could have been my daughter," said Keflezighi.
Tens of thousands of people packed the streets for Boston's largest sporting event, held on the Patriots Day holiday, which commemorates the start of the American Revolution.

LONDON Max Verstappen apologized to Brazilian Formula One fans on Monday after a comment about Felipe Massa caused offence at the weekend.
The 19-year-old Red Bull driver had accused the Williams veteran of wrecking his best lap in qualifying at the Bahrain Grand Prix and was asked by reporters whether he would be speaking to him.
"Well, he's a Brazilian. So there's not much to discuss," Verstappen had replied.
The Dutchman, who won huge admiration for a stellar drive through the field to third place at a rainswept Interlagos circuit last year, took to Instagram to clarify remarks that went down badly in Brazil.
"Being a passionate racer, I was very disappointed with my last (qualifying) stint and gave an emotional reaction that was taken out of context," he said.
"By no means did I mean to insult the Brazilian people who I greatly respect and are always very nice to me when I visit the country.
"I would like to apologize to any Brazilians that feel offended and look forward to racing in your country again," he added, referencing Brazilian world champions Ayrton Senna, Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet.
Massa, the only Brazilian driver on the current starting grid, told UOL Esporte that he had spoken to Verstappen after the race and warned him to "be careful what you say because you're going to have to go to Brazil to race there".
Verstappen crashed out of Sunday's race at the Sakhir circuit after a brake failure.

BOSTON Ethiopia's Lemi Berhanu Hayle and Atsede Baysa will line up among the world's top distance runners on Monday to defend their Boston Marathon titles, with tens of thousands of spectators expected to line the course amid tight security.
Men's champion Hayle won the 2016 marathon in a tactical 2 hours, 12 minutes and 44 seconds, while women's title holder Baysa won in 2:29:19.
The 121st Boston Marathon will see four-time Olympian Meb Keflezighi make his farewell performance. Keflezighi became the first American to win the Boston Marathon in more than three decades in 2014 with a time of 2:08:37.
Security will be high along the course, that begins in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and passes through Boston's suburbs to the finish line on Boylston Street, where a pair of ethnic Chechen brothers in 2013 set off two homemade bombs, killing three people and injuring more than 200.
Tens of thousands of people are expected to pack the streets for Boston's largest sporting event, held on the Patriots Day holiday, which commemorates the start of the American Revolution.
Other top men's contenders include Kenya's Emmanuel Mutai, who won the 2011 London marathon, Ethiopia's Yemane Tsegay, who finished third in Boston in 2016, with the top American contender Galen Rupp of Portland, Oregon, fresh off a bronze in the Olympic marathon in Rio de Janeiro.
In the women's competition, runners to watch include Kenya's Gladys Cherono, who won the 2015 Berlin Marathon, and Edna Kiplagat, who finished second in Chicago last year.
Desiree Linden brings in the fastest time of any of the American women, with her 2:22:38 personal record set when she finished second in Boston in 2011.

BUENOS AIRES An Argentine soccer fan was declared dead after suffering a vicious attack by a group of men during a first division match at the weekend, local media reported on Monday.
TV footage showed Belgrano supporter Emanuel Balbo being set upon by hooligan fans of the same team during Saturday’s derby against bitter rivals Talleres in the northern city of Cordoba.
The 22-year-old was pushed as he tried to get away, falling more than three meters into a concrete stairwell and landing on his head.
Judge Liliana Sanchez told TyC Sports that four men already arrested and notorious “barrabrava” hooligan Oscar Gomez, who is said to have instigated the attack and is being sought by police, faced charges of aggravated homicide and up to 34 years in jail.
Balbo’s father Raul told reporters his elder son had been killed in a hit and run incident by Gomez four years ago.
"Here at Belgrano we are praying that Emanuel Balbo and Diego Frydman recover," the club said in a statement, adding that another fan had been injured in a separate incident.
Barrabrava violence is endemic in the Argentine game with Balbo the 317th fatal victim since 1922, according to statistics published by the NGO Salvemos al Futbol (let’s save football).
A ban on traveling fans at Argentine league matches has been in place since 2013 in a bid to curb the violence. Efforts to lift it at selected matches have failed.
The first derby between the rival teams for 15 years ended 1-1 with Talleres in 10th place, 14 points behind leaders Boca Juniors, and Belgrano one from bottom of the 30-team championship standings.

BOSTON Kenya's Geoffrey Kirui won the 121st running of the Boston Marathon in an unofficial time of two hours nine minutes and 36 seconds to win the men's race on Monday, holding off a final challenge from American Galen Rupp in the last mile.

MANAMA Formula One world champions Mercedes have indicated they may increasingly have to favor Lewis Hamilton over new team mate Valtteri Bottas to counter the threat posed by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
In practice, that is likely to mean the reluctant imposition of more of the so-called 'team orders' used in Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix.
"We don't like that, at all," team boss Toto Wolff told reporters after Bottas twice obeyed radio instructions to let the faster Hamilton through to chase eventual winner and championship leader Vettel.
"It's not what we have done in the last couple of years but the situation is different now so it needs a proper analysis of what it means and where we are."
Mercedes have never had a designated number one driver, and Wolff said the desire was to give both equal opportunity at the start of the race.
The team won all but two races last season but are no longer dominant in a championship that has for the past three years been an internal battle.
Vettel has now won two of three races and is seven points clear of Hamilton.
Finland's Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel's 2007 champion team mate who has yet to stand on the podium this season and not been on pole since 2008, slipped 34 points behind -- half as many as the German.
Bottas, who joined Mercedes in January as replacement for now-retired world champion Nico Rosberg, is 23 adrift of his team mate.
Wolff said the situation at Ferrari had to be taken into consideration.
"That is the interesting question that we need to analyze at the moment and I don't want to pre-empt what the consequence will be, or if there will be a consequence," he added.
The disparity between the current Mercedes pairing is more marked than before, with Bottas yet to win a race and Hamilton surpassed only by Michael Schumacher in the all-time lists with 54 victories.
Bahrain was Bottas's first career pole position, whereas Hamilton has 63 and could sail past Schumacher's record of 68 later in the year.
The Finn is also still settling into his new surroundings, whereas Hamilton has been there since 2013 and is the sport's biggest personality.
Hamilton had been on pole for six races in a row until Bottas broke the sequence in Bahrain and Wolff said Mercedes appeared to be still slightly ahead of Ferrari on single lap pace.
"In the race it's pretty evenly matched I would say. So I think that's going to be a close one for the next couple of races."

SEOUL The torch relay for next year's Winter Olympics will begin in South Korea in November and travel 2,018 kilometers around the country before arriving in Pyeongchang to mark the start of the Feb. 9-25 Games, organizers said on Monday.
The flame will be lit in Olympia, Greece on Oct. 24 before coming to Korea for the domestic relay. It would then be taken through 17 cities and provinces by 7,500 torchbearers, beginning on Nov. 1 -- the 100-day countdown to the Games, POCOG said in a statement.
The identity of the final torchbearer has not been revealed yet but it would be a huge surprise if figure skater Kim Yuna does not light the cauldron to start Asia's first Winter Games outside of Japan.
Kim, who almost single-handedly raised the profile of winter sports in South Korea, won gold at the Vancouver Games in 2010 and a controversial silver in Sochi four years later before retiring from the sport.
She was also a torchbearer at the 2006 and 2010 Games and said the experience would create a "lifelong memory" for those taking part in the relay for Pyeongchang.
"It was a great honor to carry the Olympic torch for Torino 2006 and Vancouver 2010," she said in the statement. "It motivated me to work even harder toward winning a gold medal at the Olympic Winter Games."
Also on Monday, the South Korean government said it would tack on 2 billion won ($1.75 million) in additional funding to help local athletes prepare for the Games, Yonhap News reported.
The funds are in addition to the 33.7 billion won the government had already set aside for athlete training and preparation.
Located in the mountainous Gangwon Province, some 180 kilometers east of Seoul, Pyeongchang failed in bids for the 2010 and 2014 Winter Games before finally finding success.
The 2018 Games kick off an Olympic cycle in Northeast Asia, with Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Games and Beijing staging the Winter Olympics two years later.
There have also been suggestions the region could stage three straight Winter Games with the Japanese city of Sapporo thought to be keen to stage the 2026 event.

Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas made an emotional return to the court on Sunday, a day after his sister Chyna had been killed in a car crash.
With the words ‘Chyna, R.I.P Lil Sis’ written on his green left shoe, and the date of her death on the right, Thomas was in tears on the bench ahead of their playoff game against Chicago and during a moment of silence before the national anthem.
The two-times NBA All Star gathered himself once he took the court and received vocal support from the capacity 18,000-plus crowd at TD Garden in Boston.
Thomas almost lifted the Eastern Conference top seeds to victory with two late baskets in their best-of-seven first-round series opener against the Bulls, but the visitors survived to draw first blood, 106-102.
Thomas, who top-scored for the Celtics with 33 points on 10-of-18 shooting from the floor, did not talk to the media after the game but team mate Avery Bradley said the players were proud of their grieving guard.
"I know tonight he was playing for his sister, playing for his family. We appreciate that as team mates," Bradley told reporters.
"We just need to continue to fight for him ... Isaiah to me is like family. We grew up in the same area."
Center Al Horford admitted it had been a difficult situation.
"We’re never going to make excuses but this is hard, this was difficult," he said. "I felt our guys, we really dealt with it the right way but Isaiah’s the one who I felt dealt with it best. We knew he was hurting."
Boston coach Brad Stevens let Thomas decide whether to play on Sunday, and said that would also be the case for Tuesday’s Game Two.
“Whatever he needs to do he needs to do,” Stevens told reporters. “I’m not going to ask him or make him make those decisions (tonight). Those have got to come in his own time and then we will adjust accordingly.”
Stevens said he was proud of the way Thomas had performed, and how his team mates had supported him.
“He’s an amazing player, amazing player. He somehow plays like that ... You couldn’t help but be inspired by his play."
Chyna Thomas, 22, died in a single-car accident in Washington State before dawn on Saturday.

BUENOS AIRES An Argentine soccer fan was in a coma and two men arrested for attempted murder after a scuffle among supporters in the derby between Belgrano and Talleres in Cordoba, local media reported on Sunday.
The fan, identified by Belgrano as Emanuel Balbo, was beaten by fellow supporters in the crowd of 57,000 and forced down the terraces where he tried to avoid more violence by vaulting a barrier, his father told Cordoba's Cadena 3 radio station.
Video footage showed Balbo falling over one tier of the stand and then lying prostrate on a concrete staircase below.
Local media reported he was in a serious condition.
Another fan named Diego Frydman was also hurt, home club Belgrano said.
"Here at Belgrano we are praying that Emanuel Balbo and Diego Frydman recover," the club said in a statement.
Saturday's violence is the latest in a long string of incidents at Argentine grounds.
In recent years away fans have been banned from some matches and games postponed but the measures have failed to curb the violence.
The game finished 1-1 to leave Belgrano second bottom of the 30-team Primera Division.

(The Sports Xchange) - The Toronto Blue Jays have problems with injuries to their pitching staff.
They placed right-hander Aaron Sanchez on the 10-day disabled list with a blister on his right middle finger, and left-hander J.A. Happ left in the fifth inning of Sunday's game against Baltimore with a sore left elbow.
Taking Sanchez's place on the 25-man roster is left-hander Matt Dermody, who was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo.
Sanchez is 0-1 with a 4.38 ERA in two starts this season. He has been dealing with a blister since spring training.
Happ threw ball one to Orioles center fielder Adam Jones in the fifth and then was visited at the mound by a trainer and manager John Gibbons. After a short meeting, Happ walked from the mound and was replaced by right-hander Joe Biagini.

The Baltimore Orioles placed closer Zach Britton on the 10-day disabled list with a left forearm strain.
The left-hander has five saves this season, including two in the four-game series with the Toronto Blue Jays that ends Sunday.
Right-hander Stefan Crichton was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk after he had been optioned there Saturday to make room for right-hander for Alec Asher, who started Saturday against the Blue Jays.

The San Francisco Giants placed outfielder Jarrett Parker on the disabled list a day after he broke his right collarbone crashing into the fence while catching a fly ball.
Giants manager Bruce Bochy said Parker likely will be out for about eight weeks after undergoing a surgical procedure this week.
The Giants recalled left-hander Steven Okert from the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats to take Parker's place on the active roster.

Croatian Borna Coric claimed his first ATP title when he battled back to beat experienced German Philipp Kohlschreiber in the final of the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakech on Sunday.
The 20-year-old, playing in only his second Tour final, won 5-7 7-6(3) 7-5 and saved four match points before sealing victory.
Third seed Kohlschreiber looked on course for victory when he led by a set and 3-0 but Coric recovered to level the final on a tiebreak. Coric then clawed back a 2-4 deficit in the decider before claiming victory in two hours 38 minutes.
It was a huge week for Coric who has suffered a marked loss of form and has slumped to 79 in the rankings having been tipped to challenge for major honors.

HONG KONG French duo Benjamin Thomas and Morgan Kneisky edged out Australia's Cameron Meyer and Callum Scotson to win the men's Madison, while Elinor Barker claimed her first individual world title at the track cycling world championships on Sunday.
Four world titles were awarded on the final day in Hong Kong, with France winning two, and Germany and Britain each claiming one.
Thomas and Kneisky, who lost out to Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish in London last year, displayed incredible endurance to go one further this time around, beating Meyer and Scotson in the 200-lap men's Madison by four points to take gold.
Belgium's Moreno De Pauw and Kenny De Ketele took bronze.
Thomas claimed his second gold medal in this year's world championships, having won the omnium title on Saturday, while Kneisky now has four world titles.
A late surge from Britain's Barker, a team pursuit Olympic champion, saw her snatch the points race title from United States' Sarah Hammer. Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands won the bronze medal, two laps in arrears.
Along with her points race victory, Barker also won scratch and Madison silver.
"I'm incredibly happy," Barker told the BBC. "Until the last lap it was looking like another silver. I'm so happy it was a gold."
Germany's two-time Olympic champion Kristina Vogel did just about enough to retain her keirin title, and in the process win her ninth world title, finishing 0.061 seconds quicker than Colombia's Martha Bayona. Nicky Degrendele of Belgium won bronze.
In the men's 1km time trial, France's world record holder Francois Pervis won the event for the fourth time, finishing comfortably ahead of Czech Republic's Tomas Babek and Frenchman Quentin Lafargue, who tied for silver to the thousandth of a second.
Australia finished top of the medal table with three golds and 11 medals in total. France's final-day heroics saw them leapfrog Russia to finish second. France, who claimed five medals in total, and Russia both won three golds.
This is only the second time the world championship has been held in Asia, with 11 countries winning world titles.

Cristie Kerr took advantage of a meltdown by South Korean Jang Su-yeon to win the LPGA's Lotte Championship by three strokes in Hawaii on Saturday.
Kerr, whose previous win on the U.S. women's golf tour came at the CME Group Tour Championship in 2015, carded a bogey-free six-under-par 66 to finish on a combined 20-under 268 for the tournament.
She played the last two rounds without a blemish on her scorecard, including a 10-under 62 in Friday's third round, and delivered 16 birdies in her final 36 holes.
The American, who earned $300,000 for the win, said her game clicked into gear unexpectedly on Friday.
"On Friday morning I wasn't playing too well and then I just found something and was able to turn it on and I just kept it going," she told the LPGA's official website.
"I can't remember two and a half days after I struggled with my swing feel, and then made so many birdies in my life. It was an unbelievable run."
The 39-year-old credited an encounter with a lucky turtle for turning things around.
"I didn't even think about it until after I shot 10-under (on Friday) that turtles are really good luck for me. They always have been. I went swimming with the turtles on Friday afternoon and I inadvertently touched one," she added.
"The patrols are out there so that you don't harm them, but it kind of swam at me and I touched it, and it was really, really good luck."
Overnight leader Jang could have used some of that luck.
The sponsor's invitee had gone 59 holes without a bogey before dropping three strokes just before the turn to open the door for Kerr.
She finished with an even-par 72 and was one of only two players in the top 30 not to break par in the final round.
Jang, who usually plays on the Korean women's tour, ended in a three-way tie for second place with compatriot Chun In-gee (67) and New Zealand's world number one Lydia Ko (64) on 17 under par.
South Korea's Ryu So-yeon, who won the first major of the year at the ANA Inspiration earlier this month, finished alone in sixth place, five shots behind Kerr.

LOS ANGELES Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert suffered a sprained left knee in the opening minute of their playoff opener against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday and will not return.    Gobert was setting a screen during Utah’s first possession and collided with Clippers forward Luc Mbah a Moute.
Gobert attempted to get back to his feet several times before being helped into the locker room by team mates.
An imposing presence inside for Utah, Gobert led the NBA with 2.6 blocked shots per game during a breakout season that saw him average 14 points and 12.8 rebounds.
There is no immediate news on his availability for the remainder of the series.

KINGSTON Double Olympic sprint champion Elaine Thompson cruised to a wind-assisted 10.75 seconds to win the 100 meters at Jamaica's UTECH Classic on Saturday.
Thompson, who became the first Caribbean woman to win the Olympic 100m and 200m double in Rio last summer, comfortably pulled away to cross the line ahead of Jura Levy (11.19) and Olympic finalist Christania Williams (11.30).
Thompson said she was surprised to run the time so early in the season.
"Actually when I heard the time announced I was shocked but as I say, each time I race I always surprise myself," she told Reuters.
"Honestly there was no plan coming in, I just wanted to work on the first 30 meters of my race because that is kind of my weak area. So I just wanted to execute."
In the men's 100m, 2011 world champion Yohan Blake stumbled from the starting block and Britain's Zharnel Hughes took full advantage, coming home in a wind-aided personal best 10.08.
Olympic and world championship 400m bronze medalist Shericka Jackson clocked a personal best of 22.57 to win the200, the second fastest time in the world behind the 22.29 run by Dafne Schippers. Williams shaved 27 hundredths of a second offer her previous best.
Miguel Francis, who has switched allegiance to Britain from Antigua, won the men's race in 20.44 ahead of Jamaica's Commonwealth Games champion Rasheed Dwyer (20.45).



The Los Angeles Dodgers unveiled a statue on Saturday honoring trailblazer Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball’s first African American player.
On the 70th anniversary of Hall of Famer Robinson breaking baseball’s color barrier with the Dodgers, all of baseball celebrated the annual Jackie Robinson Day with every player, coach, manager and umpire donning Robinson's No. 42 jersey, which was retired by MLB in 1997.
Ahead of their game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Dodgers held a ceremony to unveil a statue depicting Robinson sliding into home plate.
Robinson's wife Rachel and children Sharon and David were in attendance along with a host of Dodgers legends.
Robinson debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15 in 1947. He played 10 seasons in the Majors, all with the Dodgers, winning a World Series in 1955 and earning six consecutive All-Star selections ('49-54), as well as a National League Most Valuable Player Award ('49).
Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first appearance on the ballot in 1962, 10 years before his death.

Jason Dufner took advantage of two eagles and a run of three consecutive birdies to take a one-stroke lead over Canadian Graham DeLaet in the RBC Heritage in South Carolina on Saturday.
Dufner, the 2013 PGA Championship winner, collected eagles on the par-five second and fifth holes, then struck for birdies at  the 14th through 16th holes for a round of six-under 65 at Harbour Town Golf Links on Hilton Head Island.
He settled down after an uneven front nine that featured the two eagles, three bogeys and a birdie to stand at 13-under 200.
"It was a little bit of a roller-coaster on the front nine, and it's always nice to get an eagle, let alone two," Dufner told reporters. “I really got it going on the back nine and that bodes well for (Sunday).”
DeLaet, who shared the lead with Luke Donald after Friday's play, bogeyed the final hole to miss an opportunity to tie Dufner.
He shot 69 for the day, making four birdies and two bogies.
"It was disappointing to finish with a bogey on the last hole, but obviously I've been playing well and I'm excited about (Sunday),” said DeLaet who has never won in 159 previous starts on the PGA Tour.
“I'm looking forward to the challenge of playing with Jason (on Sunday). I've played with him a few times before and it should be fun.”
Americans Kevin Kisner (66) and Webb Simpson (68) were tied for third at 202, one stroke in front of England's Ian Poulter (69).
Donald dropped into a tie for sixth at 204 after a one-over par 72.

The Arizona Coyotes signed goaltender Hunter Miska to an entry-level contract on Saturday.
The 21-year-old Miska posted a 27-5-5 record with a 2.20 goals-against average, a .920 save percentage and five shutouts for University of Minnesota-Duluth this season.
Miska was named as a finalist for the Mike Richter award, given annually to the goaltender voted to be the most outstanding in Division I NCAA hockey during the regular season.
In 2015-16, the North Branch, Minnesota native had a 32-13-1 record with 2.46 GAA and .913 save percentage for the Dubuque Fighting Saints of the United States Hockey League.

Bartley, 29, sustained a triceps injury during the preseason and did not appear in a regular-season game with Minnesota.

In 53 regular-season games with the Ducks in 2016-17, Kase earned 15 points (five goals, 10 assists) and 18 penalty minutes.

Tampa Bay starter Jake Odorizzi left Saturday's game against the Boston Red Sox after throwing his first pitch of the second inning.
Odorizzi, who grabbed his groin/hamstring area, winced after throwing a warmup pitch, which brought Rays manager Kevin Cash and training personnel out of the dugout. Odorizzi appeared to try to stretch and then threw two warmup pitches, but was unable to continue and walked off the mound.

Third baseman Todd Frazier of the Chicago White Sox left Saturday's game against the Minnesota Twins early because of a recurrence of flu-like symptoms.
Frazier missed two games with symptoms of the flu before returning Friday night as the designated hitter. Frazier was back at third base on Saturday but left after striking out in the fourth inning.
- - -
Second baseman Brian Dozier of the Twins was out of the lineup against the White Sox after feeling some tightness and swelling in his right knee.
Minnesota's chief baseball officer, Derek Falvey, said an MRI exam on Dozier's knee did not show any significant injury.
- - -
New York Yankees designated hitter Matt Holliday was scratched from the lineup against the St. Louis Cardinals due to lower back stiffness.
Holliday was hitless in four at-bats with three strikeouts against the Cardinals on Friday night.
He spent 7 1/2 seasons with St. Louis. He signed a one-year deal to be New York's regular designated hitter and is hitting .242 with one home run and five RBIs to go along with 10 walks.

Home plate umpire Dale Scott was released from a Toronto hospital Saturday after being removed from the field on a stretcher in Friday night's game between the Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles.
Scott, a 31-year veteran crew chief, was diagnosed with a concussion after a foul tip off the bat of Baltimore's Mark Trumbo hit him in the bottom part of his mask in the top of the eighth inning.
Scott, 57, staggered backward before going down on one knee after the ball knocked off his mask.
He was mobilized with a neck brace, placed on a stretcher and carted off the field.

Former Baltimore Ravens and Arizona Cardinals tight end Todd Heap accidentally struck and killed his 3-year-old daughter while moving a truck in the driveway at his home in Mesa, Arizona.
The Mesa Police Department responded to the accident about 3:45 p.m. Friday afternoon. Officers were told the girl was on the driveway when her father moved the truck forward and hit her.
Police said the girl was taken to a local hospital, where she later died.
Impairment does not appear to be a factor, according to police. The investigation of the incident is ongoing.
Heap, 37, played 10 seasons with the Ravens after being selected in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He played two years for Arizona before an injury forced his retirement in 2012.

Wide receiver Martavis Bryant of the Pittsburgh Steelers moved one step closer to being reinstated by the NFL after being suspended for the 2016 season because of violations of the league's substance-abuse policy.
Bryant met on Thursday with the NFL's Management Council in New York as part of his efforts for reinstatement, Alex Marvez of Sporting News reported on Saturday.
Among the conditions for being cleared to play again, Bryant was told to assemble a plan detailing safeguards that would help him prevent a relapse, according to the report.
Bryant eventually will meet with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell or one of his representatives once the league's medical director and medical advisor submit their recommendation about reinstatement.
The NFL suspended Bryant in March 2016 for at least a year after he failed multiple drug tests. The NFL accepts applications no sooner than 60 days before the one-year anniversary of a suspension.
Bryant, 25, also was suspended for the first four games of the 2015 regular season because of violations of the same policy.
Bryant, a fourth-round draft pick by the Steelers in 2014, caught 50 passes for 765 yards and six touchdowns in 11 games during the 2015 season.

The Buffalo Bills are still deciding whether to pick up the fifth-year option on wide receiver Sammy Watkins' rookie contract.
That decision will be discussed internally over the next couple of weeks before the May 2 deadline, according to WGR 550's Sal Capaccio.
Watkins, 23, is under contract for another season with a salary cap hit of $6.343 million. If the Bills pick up his option, it will cost them about $13 million against the cap in 2018.
Watkins, drafted fourth overall out of Clemson in 2014, missed half of last season because of a foot injury. He underwent two surgeries on the left foot.
Watkins caught 28 passes for 430 yards and two touchdowns last season. He caught 60 or more passes in each of his first two NFL seasons and established career bests of 1,047 yards and nine touchdowns in 2015.

BOSTON A Boston jury on Friday found former New England Patriots football star Aaron Hernandez not guilty of murdering two men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012, following what prosecutors described as a dispute that began over a spilled drink.
The decision comes two years after another Massachusetts jury found the former National Football League tight end guilty of murdering an acquaintance in an industrial park near his home in June 2013. He is currently serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for that killing.
Except for a weapons possession count, Hernandez was found not guilty of all charges associated with the double murder, including witness intimidation. He was immediately sentenced to an additional four to five years in prison on the weapons conviction and led from the courtroom with tears streaking down his face.
Gasps were heard from the gallery when the initial verdicts were read, and members of the victims' families were led out of the courtroom, also in tears.
"What won this case was a dearth of evidence that connected Hernandez to these shootings," Ron Sullivan, a member of his defense team, told reporters after the verdicts.
Hernandez, now 27, was a rising star in the National Football League when he was arrested in 2013 and charged with murdering acquaintance Odin Lloyd.
More than a year passed before he was charged with the double-murder, which prosecution witnesses said was the result of his paranoid temperament, which led him to constantly suspect people were disrespecting and challenging him.
The jury heard from witnesses including a friend, Alexander Bradley, who said that he was in the car with Hernandez when the football star shot dead Cape Verdean nationals Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside the Boston nightclub.
Defense lawyer Jose Baez, best known for successfully defending Florida mother Casey Anthony in the 2011 trial in which she was charged with murdering her daughter, relentlessly hammered Bradley's credibility, suggesting that he had killed the men and pinned it on Hernandez in exchange for immunity.
He pointed out holes in the prosecution's case including the absence of forensic evidence tying Hernandez to the shootings - no fingerprints or DNA were found on the gun used in the killing or in the vehicle that Hernandez allegedly fired from.
Baez contended that investigators focused on Hernandez as a suspect because of his fame, and disregarded evidence that pointed away from the NFL star, who had a $41 million contract at the time of his arrest.
"They don't want you to base your decision on evidence, they want you to base it on prejudice. They want you to say he's got tattoos, he's different than us. They want you to say he's a celebrity, he's different from us," Baez told the jury in his closing argument. "That's what they're basing their case on."
Dan Conley, district attorney of Suffolk County, said the not-guilty verdicts showed the difficulty of solving a drive-by shooting.
"Our theory of this case stands," he told reporters, "It points inescapably to Hernandez."

Short game maestro Luke Donald and Canadian Graham DeLaet both holed-out on Friday on the way to grabbing a share of the lead on 10-under-par after two rounds of the RBC Heritage in South Carolina.
Donald found the hole on a short pitch shot, nipping the ball off the grass short of the green into a mound and making it pause after one big bounce before the ball trickled into the cup for birdie at the last to complete a four-under 67.
That tied the English former world number one with early starter DeLaet, who holed out a wedge shot from 109 yards to eagle the par-four ninth on his way to 67 on the Harbour Town layout.
European Ryder Cup stalwart Ian Poulter of England and 2012 U.S. Open winner Webb Simpson were two shots back at eight-under 134, one stroke better than five players including first-round leader Bud Cauley, who followed an opening 63 with 72.
Donald leaned heavily on his short game as he lost control off the tee, hitting just seven fairways yet grabbing a share of the lead in his quest to take the next step after four runner-up finishes here.
"It was a little bit of a struggle today, but my short game
certainly bailed me out," Donald, 39, told Golf Channel.
"The greens are very small and you're not going to hit all of them, so you need to be good around the greens. I proved that the last couple of holes."
DeLaet, seeking his first PGA Tour victory after three second-place finishes and three thirds, vaulted up the leaderboard with a red-hot run around the turn.
"I had a nice little stretch in the middle of my round. I birdied eight, then there was the ninth. At 10, I missed an eight-footer for birdie, and I birdied 11 and 12," he said.
DeLaet is one of eight players to have accumulated $10 million in earnings without a victory.
Donald said winning on Sunday would bring vindication.
"Would be a little bit of coming back to what I really feel like I can play," he said. "The last couple of years have been a struggle, but I still feel like I've got some good years in me. I need to try and finish it off this weekend."


(The Sports Xchange) - New York Knicks president Phil Jackson said on Friday that All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony "would be better off somewhere else."
Jackson, meeting with the media two days after the Knicks completed their fourth consecutive losing season, said the team will continue to explore trade options for the 10-time All-Star.
"We've not been able to win with (Anthony) on the court at this time," Jackson said.
"I think the direction with our team is that he's a player that would be better off somewhere else and using his talent somewhere where he can win or chase that championship."
New York went 31-51, falling well short of expectations with its third consecutive 50-loss season.
The Knicks posted an 80-166 mark and missed the playoffs in each of the first three years under the watch of Jackson, who won a record 11 NBA titles as head coach for the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers.
"I never took a jump shot. I never made a substitution, but the buck stops here," Jackson said.
Anthony, 32, and Jackson were at odds throughout the season because of trade speculation. As tension grew between the two, Anthony at one point said he wanted to remain with the Knicks and would not waive his no-trade clause.
"If somebody was talking bad about you indirectly at your job, what would you do?" Anthony said earlier this week. "You would want that person to come straightforward with you. And I feel the same way. I'm a very honest person."
Anthony said after Wednesday's final game of another disappointing season with the Knicks that he was "open" to be traded this summer.
He averaged 22.4 points, 5.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 74 games in 2016-17, his sixth full season with the Knicks.
"He's carried the basic load for this team," Jackson said Friday. "I thought he stood up well this year in a lot of tough situations.
"(But) Obviously, it hasn't worked out as a partnership."
Jackson said he met with Anthony on Thursday.
"Our meeting was not contentious at all, it was cordial," Jackson told reporters. "So we'll go forward with that.
"We'll take into account (Anthony's) consideration. This is not a situation we're going to dump you.
"Right now we need players who are very active, can play every single play, defensively and offensively. That's very important for us and that's the direction we have to go."

MANAMA McLaren Formula One boss Zak Brown is 'barking mad' to let Fernando Alonso race the Indianapolis 500 with so little experience of ovals, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said on Friday.
McLaren announced earlier in the week that the Spaniard, a double world champion, would miss the May 28 Monaco Grand Prix to compete at The Brickyard in the biggest event in U.S. open-wheel racing.
The switch has been made easier by McLaren's lack of competitiveness in Formula One, with the once-great team currently last in the championship without a point after two races and Alonso clearly frustrated with the situation.
"Look, it's a difficult one for Fernando, he's having a tough time," Horner, smiling, told reporters at the Bahrain Grand Prix.
"Zak's got the problem of a depressed driver on his hands,  he's trying to keep him motivated and he's come up with this idea to send him to Indianapolis. He must be barking mad, it's the nuttiest race I've ever seen.
"No testing, he's just going to jump in the car...Turn One there is a proper turn as well, it's not just easy flat all the  way round. So I think he needs to see a psychiatrist, personally."
Indy Car racing has a reputation as a considerably riskier series than Formula One, with cars running nose-to-tail at around 240 mph.
Last year's race was won by a rookie, however, former F1 driver Alexander Rossi with the same Andretti Autosport team that will run Alonso's car.
Horner said he would not have let his drivers, Dutch teenager Max Verstappen and Australian Daniel Ricciardo, race in the event.
"I think if a driver commits to a team it's like disappearing with another girlfriend half way through the year, it doesn't seem like the right thing to do," he said.
Brown, an American former racer and marketing expert who was appointed McLaren's executive director last year, defended himself as he sat next to Horner in a post-practice news conference.
"Fernando's not scared," he said. "He's going to get some testing in. He is studying Indianapolis, it's obviously going to be a challenge but he wants a challenge.
"I think he'll have a car capable of running at the front, and I think he will be extremely prepared. I think he's going to put on a good show and he's very smart. And that's what you need to be around Indianapolis.
"I think it's going to be good, everyone's going to be watching."

MANAMA Former commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone returned to the Formula One paddock on Friday, for the first time since he was ousted in January, and revealed how little involvement he has had with the new management.
The 86-year-old, who ran Formula One for decades, said he had yet to meet the sport's new commercial manager Sean Bratches.
"Never met Sean, I met (motorsport manager) Ross (Brawn) for 10 minutes this year and I knew Ross from the past obviously and I feel sorry for (chairman) Chase (Carey) being thrown in the deep end," the 86-year-old told reporters at the Bahrain Grand Prix.
Carey, who is also at the Bahrain race, was not immediately available for comment.
Brawn is a Formula One veteran -- a former technical director at Ferrari, principal of Honda's team and winning the 2009 world championship with his own Brawn outfit before selling to Mercedes, where he was also the boss.
He and Bratches attended the season-opening race in Australia.
Ecclestone was appointed 'chairman emeritus', a job with no defined role, after being moved away from the helm and replaced by Carey.
Formula One Management has moved out of its old headquarters into new premises away from Ecclestone.
Asked whether he was acting as a consultant to them, he replied that "they’ve never asked me anything" although he had spoken to Carey earlier on Friday as well as several times in recent weeks.
"I’m busier now than I have been in the past, with the same sort of things. I’m still busy," added the Briton, who spent time on Friday talking to Red Bull principal Christian Horner and Mercedes' non-executive chairman Niki Lauda.

One of the fiercest MVP debates basketball has seen in years will add another chapter when the NBA Playoffs open this weekend with award frontrunners Russell Westbrook and James Harden meeting face to face.
In one corner: Oklahoma City’s Westbrook, who averaged the league’s second ever triple-double with dizzying numbers of 31.6 points per game, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists for the Thunder.
In the other: the bearded Harden, who facilitated a surprising Rockets surge to 55 wins while putting up 29.1 points, 11.2 assists and 8.1 rebounds for Houston.
Individual mastery or team superiority? The first-round matchup between the number three seed Rockets and sixth-seeded  Thunder will have no bearing on the MVP trophy but will be yet another talking point in the raging discussion.
Defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers and top-seeded Golden State Warriors have a chance to extend their own rivalry - and become the first teams ever to meet in three straight NBA Finals – if they can overcome hurdles.
The Cavs lost 14 of their final 24 games to drop to second in the Eastern Conference, behind the Boston Celtics, and enter the postseason shakily with a first-round matchup vs. the Indiana Pacers that launches the playoffs on Saturday.
“It's been strange events this season, unfortunate events, some of them bad, some of them good but at the end of the day I can't have my mind focused on the past now,” three-time champion LeBron James told reporters.
“The present is the only thing that matters.”
In the West, the Warriors caught a late-season rhythm but did so mostly without prized off-season acquisition Kevin Durant, who missed 19 games with a knee sprain and is being reinserted into the lineup on the fly.
Golden State put their All-Star backcourt of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson against Portland’s own impressive guard duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum in the opening round against the Blazers.
“They are two great phenomenal scorers who can go off at any time,” Thompson said about Portland’s backcourt, before adding “We’re all excited, we’re locked in."
The West’s second-seeded San Antonio Spurs look to put recent playoff disappointments behind and open against Memphis.

The series will pit Spanish brothers Pau Gasol (Spurs) and Marc Gasol (Grizzlies) against one another for the first time in the playoffs.
Despite their current core of stars Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, the Los Angeles Clippers have never advanced beyond the playoff’s second round.
The Clippers will take another crack at it beginning against the Utah Jazz and their emerging French big man Rudy Gobert.
In the East, the Celtics seek to prove that their scrappy run to the top of the East was not a fluke.
The Toronto Raptors and Washington Wizareds are viewed as the other East contenders tasked with trying to stop James from reaching his seventh consecutive Finals.
The Raptors play their first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks, while the Wizards try to work their magic against the Atlanta Hawks.

SAN FRANCISCO The Golden State Warriors enter the NBA playoffs this weekend looking for redemption after last season's shocking defeat in the Finals, where the team blew a 3-1 lead to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the best-of-seven series.
Despite the unprecedented championship series collapse, expectations for the Warriors to win the title this year are sky high, and for good reason.
In the offseason they added one of the league's premier scorers, former league Most Valuable Player Kevin Durant, who quickly adapted to the team's fast-paced and unselfish brand of basketball.
Despite an injury to Durant late in the season that kept him sidelined for 19 games, the team finished with NBA's best overall record, ensuring home court advantage throughout the playoffs.
Durant returned to the starting lineup earlier this month and has shown no sign of lingering problems from the knee injury, boosting the Warriors' odds of winning.
Westgate Las Vegas Superbook on Thursday listed the Warriors as 1-2 favorites to bring Oakland their second championship trophy in three years.
ESPN analyst and former NBA head coach Jeff Van Gundy on Thursday anointed the Warriors the champions before the first playoff game had even been played.
"Golden State is your champion. It won't be close," Van Gundy told ESPN's The Lowe Post podcast.
"No one is gonna push them. It's over."
The Warriors faced similarly high expectations going into last year's playoffs after they won an NBA-record 73 games during the season, which made their inability to claim the title all the more shocking.
Even that disappointment could pale in comparison to this year should the team fail to win it all.
"For the Warriors, it's obviously championship or bust," Turner Sports analyst Reggie Miller and Hall of Fame shooting guard told reporters on Thursday.
"You don't go out and get Kevin Durant and be happy to get to the Conference Finals or the NBA Finals and lose. They have to win a championships. Period."
Turner Sports analyst and former coach Kevin McHale said Durant will be key to helping the Warriors finish off close games, something they were unable to do in Game Seven of last year's Finals when they surrendered their lead late in the fourth quarter to LeBron James and the Cavs.
"KD makes them better. He's a closer," McHale told reporters.

MANAMA Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was fastest in Bahrain Grand Prix practice on Friday with the joint Formula One championship leader comfortably quicker than his Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton despite problems in the second session.
The four times world champion lapped 0.400 faster than Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo in the afternoon and then pipped Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas by 0.041 under the evening floodlights.
Hamilton, the triple champion who won the previous race in China after Vettel's success in the Australian opener and shares the overall lead with 43 points, was 10th and fifth respectively.
Neither had a trouble free evening, however, with Vettel suffering what he called a "complete shutdown" on his car with half an hour to go.
The German was pushed into the pits by marshals and returned to the track 15 minutes later.
"It was not the best day for us, we still need to improve the car...On one lap it was OK. (on a) long run we might be quite a bit behind, but I am sure we can improve for tomorrow," said Vettel.
Hamilton ran off the track after being baulked by Nico Hulkenberg's Renault.
"These drivers are just so dangerous," the Briton said over the team radio, with both drivers later summoned to see the stewards.
Ricciardo was third in the evening with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen fourth after his afternoon session went up in smoke, with the Finn abandoning his smoking car and trudging off in the desert heat.
The solitary walk through the arid landscape in overalls and helmet, before being collected by a scooter, was an arresting sight -- and also typical of a driver with 'Iceman' tattooed on his left arm.
"Walking through the desert in 37C heat. In full race suit. Helmet on. Only the Iceman is cool enough to do it," the official formula1.com website observed on its Twitter feed.

ENGINE CHANGE
While Raikkonen built up a sweat, Vettel settled in at the top of the timesheets with a best lap of one minute 32.697 seconds. He did 1:31.310 in the cooler evening conditions, with Raikkonen fourth after an engine change.
Champions Mercedes had been more focused on longer runs with heavier fuel loads in the searing afternoon heat, with Bottas only 14th.
They speeded up in the evening and did more laps than anyone.
"It's definitely tougher than before, driving in the heat with these new cars. But I'm used to being in a Finnish sauna, so it's no problem," commented Bottas.
The 'T-wing', fixed on the engine cover of the Finn's car, broke free during the second session and was collected by Verstappen's Red Bull, damaging the car's floor.
"It did about 50,000 pounds ($62,650) of damage so I think they should be banned on grounds of safety and cost," said Red Bull principal Christian Horner.
Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda spent much of the opening session chatting to the sport's former commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone, who was appearing at a race for the first time since he was shuffled aside by chairman Chase Carey and Formula One's new owners Liberty Media.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was third and eighth fastest.
German driver Pascal Wehrlein, who missed the first two races with a back injury, returned with Sauber and was 18th and 19th in the two sessions.
McLaren's Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne, who scored a point in Bahrain last year as a stand-in, had a troubled day and stopped on track with engine problems 21 minutes from the end of the first session.

SAO PAULO At least six of Brazil's World Cup arenas, including the Maracana stadium where the final was staged in 2014, are under scrutiny in a wave of new political corruption investigations launched by the country's Supreme Court this week.
Newly unsealed plea bargain testimony from engineering group Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] cited irregularities at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo, the National Stadium in Brasilia, the Pernambuco Arena in Recife, the Castelao Arena in Fortaleza and the Amazonia Arena in Manaus, along with the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro.
Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin began releasing his findings on Tuesday, but details are still emerging from the hours of recorded testimony from 77 current and former executives at the politically connected Odebrecht Group.
Evidence that builders and politicians collaborated to fix contracts reinforces suspicions that many of the 12 stadiums built or renovated for the 2014 World Cup were overpriced.
The Maracana was slated to cost 700 million reais ($225 million) but eventually topped 1 billion reais. The Corinthians arena in Sao Paulo was originally going to be a smaller stadium built for 350 million reais but the cost rose above 1 billion reais after it was decided to hold the opening match there.
Brasilia's National Stadium, which was merely renovated for the tournament, was the most expensive of all, at 1.4 billion reais.
The Odebrecht executives gave their testimony as part of a settlement with U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authorities in the biggest-ever foreign bribery case. Politicians named in the testimony have denied any wrongdoing and now have the opportunity to present evidence of their innocence.
According to testimony released by the Supreme Court, at least five Odebrecht executives confirmed payments were made to secure what they called "an unfair advantage associated with work on the Maracana stadium."
In Pernambuco, Manaus and Fortaleza, Odebrecht and another construction company collaborated to "frustrate the competitive character of the bidding process."
Companies also combined to inflate the price of a roof for the National stadium, according to the testimony.
Brazil's biggest-ever graft investigation, which this week produced probes into nearly 100 politicians, has already jailed dozens of business leaders and money launderers over billions of dollars in bribes for public works deals with state companies.

BOSTON Ethiopian runner Lemi Berhanu Hayle will defend his Boston Marathon title in a wide open race on Monday against a men's field that includes the first American champion in three decades and no clear favorite.
Berhanu Hayle won last year's race in two hours 12 minutes  44 seconds after pulling away from twice champion and countryman Lelisa Desisa, who is not competing this year.
The last men's repeat winner was five-time champion Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot of Kenya, who completed a triple in 2008.
An Ethiopian woman, Atsede Baysa, will also be defending her title after winning in 2:29:19.
Berhanu Hayle's main challengers will include countryman Sisay Lemma, who ran 2:05:16 in Dubai last year, and Kenyans Geoffrey Kirui who ran 2:06:27 in Amsterdam last year and Emmanuel Mutai, who was second in New York and Chicago, and has the field's fastest personal best of 2:03:13.
The hilly Boston course usually leads to slower times than other major marathons.
"Any move (Berhanu Hayle) makes will be taken seriously by the others," said Scott Douglas, a contributing editor at Runner's World. "With no clear standouts this year, Boston will be a very interesting race to watch."
Making a farewell appearance will be Meb Keflezighi, who gave Boston an emotional boost when he became the first American man to win in three decades in 2014, one year after a pair of brothers of Chechen origin killed three people and injured more than 200 at the finish line with a pair of homemade bombs.
Keflezighi, 41, plans to retire from competition after November's New York City marathon.
"It will be very emotional to get to Hopkinton (where the race starts), but I'm excited. I know the course and I'm 100 percent healthy," he said.
Galen Rupp, who won marathon bronze at the Rio Olympics but has had foot problems this year, and Jared Ward, who wrote his masters thesis on marathon pacing, join a large U.S. contingent.
Strong women contenders include Kenyans Gladys Cherono, Edna Kiplagat and Brigid Kosgei.
These women will be racing in part because of Kathrine Switzer, who became the first woman to finish the then all-male Boston race with a bib 50 years ago.
Switzer, 70, will wear the same number - 261 - when she steps to the line to race again on Monday. "I will put on the full regalia: the bib plus the eye liner, mascara and lipstick," she said.

LONDON IAAF president Sebastian Coe said on Thursday he had every confidence in the security surrounding August's world athletics championships in London having had a close-up view of operations during the 2012 Olympics in the city.
In the light of the attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus before the Champions League match on Tuesday, Coe was asked whether security was being reviewed for the world championships.
"I can use my London (2012) experience here," Coe told a news conference in the city following a meeting of the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
"The best type of security is the security you never discuss," added the man who was head of the organizing committee of the 2012 Games which passed off without any major security issues.
"It is incremental and sequential and delivered in the light of all sorts of prevailing intelligence," Coe said.
"This is a city that does that probably better than pretty much anywhere in the world and we have a record of doing it extraordinarily well.
"So I am absolutely sure that the intelligence agencies, the Metropolitan Police and the plethora of other agencies will be looking at that all the time."
In Dortmund, three devices exploded near the team bus as it was taking players to the stadium to play a Champions League game against Monaco.
One player was injured and a man who, according to German prosecutors, was suspected of being a member of the Islamic State group was detained over the incident. The game had to be postponed until Wednesday.

The NBA's regular season may have drawn to a close but the venerable careers of several veteran players keeps forging ahead with no clear end in sight.
A league that seemingly keeps getting younger is still holding court for the last standing relics of basketball's previous era.
Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki, Manu Ginobili, Jason Terry, Paul Pierce and Metta World Peace carry the torch of the past as the only remaining NBA players who were drafted in the 1990s.
Hair has thinned and physiques have softened, but the aging competitors have survived the changing league while holding off Father Time.
Only Pierce, in his 19th season and headed to the playoffs with the Los Angeles Clippers, has proclaimed this campaign his last and embraced a farewell tour. The others play on, focusing on the battle in front of them rather than the days behind them.
"I want to play a long time," World Peace, 37, told the LA Daily News. "All I got to do is work hard. I know what I have to do to get there. I set those goals a long time ago."
World Peace has played through evolving styles and name changes. He entered the league as Ron Artest in 1999 before becoming Metta World Peace in 2011.
Though he averaged less than seven minutes a game with the Los Angeles Lakers this season he still possesses a physical presence that is ready when called upon.
Carter, 40, has seen his high-flying routine grounded in recent years but has prevailed with a work ethic that has allowed the Memphis Grizzlies forward to tally 2,048 career three-pointers, currently tied for fifth all-time.
Not coincidentally, Terry (2,242) and Pierce (2,143) are third and fourth, respectively, on that list.
"How you take care of yourself (is a key to longevity)," Grizzlies coach David Fizdale told Reuters.
"Vince doesn't have many days off. I went to see him in the summer and he has a gym built at his house with a full basketball court. When it comes to his nutrition and work ethic, he takes it very seriously."
Nowitzki's relentless work culminated last month when the Dallas Mavericks forward became just the sixth player in NBA history to reach 30,000 points.
A 13-time All Star, Nowitzki is one the game’s greatest international standouts, a discussion the Argentinean Ginobili also finds himself in.
Ginobili, 39, will try to add to his four NBA titles with the San Antonio Spurs in this year's playoffs.
And while the NBA debates the new school approach of top teams resting their best players throughout the season, the lingering faces of the 90s remind that simply playing hard every night can still stand the test of time.

BERLIN A German judge authorized on Thursday the arrest of a 26-year-old Iraqi man detained after an attack on a bus carrying players of a soccer team, and prosecutors said they believed he was a member of Islamic State.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office said the man, identified as Abdul Beset A., had joined Islamic State in Iraq by the end of 2014 at the latest and had led a 10-man command unit there. The jihadist group controls parts of Iraq and Syria.
"The task of his unit was to prepare abductions, kidnappings, extortions and killings," the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
The man traveled to Turkey in March 2015 and from there on to Germany in early 2016.
"Also from Germany, the accused continued to maintain contacts with members of 'IS'," it added, citing the grounds for the arrest.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office there was no evidence that the man had taken part in the attack in the western city of Dortmund.
Three explosions went off as the Borussia Dortmund bus traveled to the club's stadium for their Champions League match against AS Monaco on Tuesday, injuring Spanish defender Marc Bartra and delaying the fixture by a day.
Security is an issue in campaigning for Germany's federal election on Sept. 24, a tight battle in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term. In December, a Tunisian man killed 12 people when he ploughed a truck through a Berlin Christmas market.
Last year, Merkel lost support to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party after opening the country's doors to more than a million migrants. The AfD has since seen its ratings fall while the chancellor has regained some poise.

MILITARY DETONATORS
Bild newspaper said on Thursday that military detonators had been used to set off the three explosive devices, probably remotely using a mobile phone.
Three identical letters printed in German found near the scene of the attack in Dortmund suggested a possible Islamist motive for the attack.
One of the letters, published by Bild, starts with the Islamic phrase "In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful" and demands the withdrawal of German Tornado surveillance planes from Syria and the closure of the U.S. military air base in Ramstein, Germany.
"As of now, all infidel actors, singers, athletes and all prominent personalities in Germany and other crusader nations are on a death list of the Islamic State," the letter said.
Bild said prosecutors were also investigating two additional suspects in the attack, one a neo-Nazi sympathizer and another from a radical leftist group.


Dustin Johnson will make his first start since withdrawing from last week's U.S. Masters when he competes in the Wells Fargo Championship at Eagle Point Golf Club in North Carolina from May 4-7, the tournament's director said on Thursday.
"We certainly are excited that Dustin will be joining us in Wilmington in a few weeks," Wells Fargo Championship Executive Director Kym Hougham said in a statement. "More importantly, we are glad that he is OK and will be returning to the PGA Tour."
World number one Johnson, who walked off the first tee and withdrew from the Masters a day after slipping down a staircase and injuring his lower back, had been favorite to win at Augusta National.
The 32-year-old American, who won last year's U.S. Open and took over as the world number one in February, had arrived at the Masters having won each of his previous three events.
Johnson's best finish in the Wells Fargo Championship was a tie for 29th in 2010. In his two other starts, he missed the cut.
There are currently six players among the top-20 in the world now in the Wells Fargo field as Johnson joins Australian Adam Scott, Swede Alex Noren, Spaniard Jon Rahm and the US pair of Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson.
Players have until April 28 to commit to the field.

BERLIN A German judge on Thursday approved an arrest warrant against an Iraqi man detained after an attack against a bus carrying players belonging to the Borussia Dortmund soccer team, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.
Prosecutors earlier said the 26-year-old man is suspected of having been a member of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq before arriving in Germany in early 2016.
They added that there was no proof yet that the man had taken part in the attack in Dortmund.
The judge who approved the arrest warrant is from the Federal Court of Justice, the country's highest court for criminal and civil jurisdiction.

MANAMA Fernando Alonso's in-flight movies will be all about the Indianapolis 500 for the next few weeks as the double Formula One world champion gears up for a challenge that he is far from ready for.
The Spaniard outlined a busy agenda to reporters at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Thursday ahead of a string of races on two continents.
Alonso's McLaren team announced on Wednesday that he will miss the showcase Monaco Grand Prix to race in the 101st edition of the U.S. race, with a car run by last year's winners Andretti Autosport.
"Next weekend I will be in Alabama just visiting the race and meeting the team members to see how things go there," he said, referring to the third round of the Indy Car season at Barber Motorsports Park on April 21-23.
"Probably on Monday after the race I will do the seat fitting, and then I will fly to Russia."
The Russian Grand Prix in Sochi follows on from Bahrain as the fourth round of the F1 season.
"After Russia, I will try to be in Indianapolis for a couple of simulator days, hopefully test the car but it's not 100 percent sure, and after that I will go to the Spanish Grand Prix and then fly to America on Sunday after the race," he said.
Free practice at the famed Brickyard takes place on the Monday after the Formula One race at the Circuit de Catalunya. The Indy 500 is on May 28, the same weekend as Monaco.
"On the planes, I will try and look at some videos and races from past years and try to learn as quick as I can," said Alonso.
"It's completely different skills that you need there, to adapt to the car and circuit, strategies, ways of racing that close and at that speed. Many things I have to learn and I am not ready at the moment.
"I don't feel prepared now, I am not in my comfort zone driving those cars or thinking about those cars but I am not afraid of trying, of not delivering a good result," added the 35-year-old, who was confident he would adapt.
McLaren won at Indianapolis in the 1970s, and have also triumphed at Le Mans, with Alonso now dreaming of a Triple Crown that only one driver -- Britain's Graham Hill -- has achieved.
He also wants to feel like a winner again after two tough seasons with McLaren.
"The possibility to win a big race, a big trophy like the Indy 500 in the middle of a year is like winning a World Championship in one weekend," he said.

LONDON The 50km walk will remain in the Olympics and world championships after the IAAF voted unanimously to retain the longest event in the athletics program.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had put pressure on the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to drop the event, starting with the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, partly because there is no women's race over the distance.
Women do race over the distance in the world race walking championships, but their longest event at the Olympics is 20km, which was introduced in 2000.
"The IAAF support for the 50km fully comports with the objectives of the IAAF Constitution," American lawyer Paul DeMeester said following the decision by the IAAF's Council in London on Thursday.
"When it comes to the inclusion of women athletes, the IAAF has been miles ahead of the IOC," added DeMeester, in London to support the 50km distance.
"The IAAF recognizes world records for women at 50km and is allowing women to participate in the 50km walk at the world championships in London in August."

Jae Crowder and Amir Johnson each had 16 points, Isaiah Thomas finished with 13 points and eight assists, and Al Horford added 12 points for the Celtics.
Spencer Hawes and Michael Beasley each had 15 points for the Bucks, who also rested most their starters after securing the sixth seed in the East on Tuesday.

Raptors 98, Cavaliers 83
Norman Powell led all scorers with 25 points as Toronto pounded Cleveland.
Cleveland was without LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Iman Shumpert was the Cavs' leading scorer with 11 points.
The Cavaliers will be the second seed entering the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Raptors are the third seed.

Magic 113, Pistons 109
Aaron Gordon had 32 points and 12 rebounds in leading Orlando over Detroit.
Elfrid Payton scored 21 points, including six in the final 1:10 to ice the victory. The Pistons trailed throughout the night and never led by more than two points.

Knicks 114, 76ers 113

Nuggets 111, Thunder 105
Nikola Jokic scored 29 points to lead Denver over Oklahoma City.

Pelicans 103, Trail Blazers 100
New Orleans erased a nine-point deficit in the final eight minutes to beat Portland.
The Miami Heat completed a stirring second half to the NBA regular season by setting a new milestone on Wednesday but their brilliance was not rewarded with a playoff berth as the growing trend of resting players took on extra significance.
The Heat were the victims this time, their season drawing to a close earlier than they would have preferred despite a 110-102 victory over the Washington Wizards.
Miami made an awful start to the campaign and were 11-30 at the halfway mark, but the Heat became the first team to rally from more than 12 games below .500 and avoid a losing record.
They finished 41-41 and needed either the Chicago Bulls or Indiana Pacers to lose their final games to reach the playoffs.
The Bulls, however, breezed to a 112-73 victory against a Brooklyn Nets team missing six players, while the Pacers cruised to a 104-86 win over the playoff-bound Atlanta Hawks, who rested five players ahead of the post-season.
"The league has got to step in here, because this is a very big black eye for this league," former NBA Coach of the Year Hubie Brown said during the Indiana-Atlanta game.
NBA commissioner Adam Silver has expressed concern at the practice of resting so many players, but apart from promising to schedule teams to play less games on consecutive days, it has offered few other answers on how to solve the problem.
Boston clinched the top seed in the East, ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost their last four games, playing the final two without LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.
In the Western Conference, there was nothing at stake on Wednesday except for home court advantage for the series between the Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz.
The Clippers had to win their game against Sacramento to clinch the fourth seed ahead of Utah, and they did so easily, 115-95.

(The Sports Xchange) - The city of St. Louis is suing the NFL over the Rams' relocation to Los Angeles 15 months ago.
The 52-page lawsuit was filed Wednesday in St. Louis Circuit Court by the city, county and the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority. The suit also names the NFL's 32 teams as defendants and seeks unspecified damages and restitution.
"The Rams, the NFL, through its member teams, and the owners have violated the obligations and standards governing team relocations" because the Rams failed to meet league relocation rules, the suit that was obtained by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch claims.
The lawsuit claims St. Louis has lost an estimated $1.85 million to $3.5 million a year in amusement and ticket tax revenue with the departure of the Rams, as well as about $7.5 million in property taxes and "millions" in earning taxes, according to the Post-Dispatch.

The Rams exercised the fifth-year option on Pro Bowl defensive tackle Aaron Donald, the team announced.
The option will be worth $6.892 million for the 2018 season, guaranteed for injury only. Donald, 25, is set to make $1.8 million in his fourth season.
Donald, the No. 13 overall pick in 2014, was named to the Pro Bowl in his first three NFL seasons and made 28 career sacks over 48 games. In 2016, the 6-foot-1, 285-pounder recorded 47 tackles, eight sacks and two forced fumbles.

North Carolina quarterback Mitch Trubisky and Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett are still in play for the Cleveland Browns with the No. 1 overall pick.
According to ESPN, the Browns are considering the two underclassmen with the top pick in the draft.
NFLDraftScout.com projects Garrett as the No. 1 player available and expects the Browns to select the freakishly athletic pass rusher.
Trubisky has only 13 career starts. The last quarterback drafted early in the first round with such limited college experience was Mark Sanchez, the fifth pick in the 2009 draft after one year as Southern Cal's starter.

The start of the regular season is still five months away but the calendar -- or recent history -- did not serve as a deterrent for wide receiver Jarvis Landry, who boldly declared that his Miami Dolphins will sweep the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.
Landry made the strong statement over the weekend and followed up his comments in an interview with Peter King of Sports Illustrated's TheMMQB.com.
"If you're a competitor, that's the way you should feel, and I don't mind saying it," the 24-year-old Landry said.
DORTMUND, Germany Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said his team felt ignored by UEFA after being made to play AS Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after an attack on their bus.
The quarter-final first leg in Dortmund was postponed on Tuesday after three explosions went off near the German team's bus as it made its way to the stadium, injuring Spanish defender Marc Bartra.
The match was immediately rescheduled for Wednesday and Monaco ran out 3-2 winners in what turned out to be a pulsating game.
UEFA, European soccer's governing body, said it had made the decision after consulting both teams.
"We weren't asked at any point. We were told by text message that the decision had been made in Switzerland (where UEFA are based)," Tuchel told reporters. "When they told us 'you're up tomorrow', we felt completely ignored.
"They treated it as if a beer can had been thrown at the bus.
"We would have liked more time to take stock," he added. "This gives you the feeling of impotence, that we have to keep functioning and nothing else matters.
"I encouraged everyone to take the game seriously but football is not the most important thing in the world."
Tuchel said each player had been affected differently.
"Everyone has the right to deal with it in his own way," he said. "We want to help every player to overcome his inner conflict. It was a bad experience."
Dortmund midfielder Nuri Sahin, who came on as a second-half substitute, said the incident had put soccer into perspective.
"We love football, we suffer with football and I know we earn a lot of money, and we have a privileged life, but we are human beings and there is so much more than football in this world...and last night we felt it," he said.
"I don't know if the people can understand this but, until I was on the pitch in the second half, I didn't think about football," he said.
"I get goosebumps...when we were in the bus last night, I can't forget the faces."
AS Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said the match had been overshadowed by Tuesday's events.
"It won't be the result that will be remembered, it will be what happened yesterday, which was not a football situation," said the Portuguese.
"Of course, the preparation was not the same. We prepared twice for the same match and today's preparation was more difficult. Yesterday, the players phoned their families, their friends and their concentration levels were not so high."

DORTMUND, Germany Teenager Kylian Mbappe scored twice to give AS Monaco a 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday in a Champions League quarter-final first-leg match that was postponed following an attack on the home team's bus.
Mbappe gave Monaco a 19th-minute lead shortly after Fabinho had missed a penalty for the visitors, and they went further ahead when Dortmund defender Sven Bender headed into his own net.
Ousmane Dembele pulled one back for Dortmund in the 57th minute but another defensive mistake allowed Mbappe to break away and grab a third goal for the Ligue 1 side. Shinji Kagawa gave the German side hope with a neat finish six minutes from time.
Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said the game should not have gone ahead so soon after Tuesday's attack in which three explosions went off as the Dortmund team bus traveled to the stadium, injuring their Spanish defender Marc Bartra.
"We would have wanted more time, it would have been important to help us deal with the situation," he told reporters.
"I encouraged everyone to take the game seriously but football is not the most important thing in the world."
Monaco, who beat Manchester City on away goals after a 6-6 aggregate draw in the last 16, should have gone ahead in the 18th minute after Mbappe won a penalty but Fabinho pulled his spot-kick wide of the post.
One minute later Bernardo Silva burst out of the Monaco half and flicked a clever pass to Thomas Lemar whose low ball across the face of goal bounced off Mbappe's knee and into the net.
Monaco went further ahead in the 35th minute when Andrea Raggi sent an inswinging cross towards Radamel Falcao and, although Bender got to it first, he only succeeded in heading it past Roman Buerki and into the net.
Thomas Tuchel's double substitution at halftime galvanized Dortmund who went out on the attack and deservedly pulled one back in the 57th minute.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang cleverly flicked Raphael Guerreiro's cross into the path of Kagawa and the Japanese laid the ball into Ousmane Dembele's path for the 19-year-old to tap into an open goal.
It was the first time two teenagers had scored in a Champions League knockout tie.
Falcao missed an open goal for Monaco before Mbappe, 18, intercepted a poor Lukasz Piszczek pass, ran on and calmly fired his shot past Buerki.
The drama continued as Kagawa grabbed another goal for Dortmund and Aubameyang headed over the bar in stoppage time from six meters.

Matt Kuchar will try to build off his strong finish at the U.S. Masters when he tees off in the first round of the RBC Heritage in South Carolina on Thursday among a field featuring several recent PGA Tour winners.
The American world number 17, who had a hole-in-one en route to a five-under-par 67 that matched the lowest final round score at Augusta National where he finished in a tie for fourth, has heated up since a mostly slow start to the season
Kuchar has only two top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour in 11 events this season but knows how to navigate Harbour Town where he is a previous winner and also boasts a fifth-place finish and tie for ninth among his previous starts.
Kuchar, who at Hilton Head Island in 2014, will be joined by defending champion Branden Grace of South Africa, former winner Brandt Snedeker and England's Tyrrell Hatton, who at world number 15 will be the highest ranked player in the field.
Grace, who overcame a three-shot deficit on the final day with a five-under-par 66 to grab his first PGA Tour victory, is looking to become the tournament's first back-to-back champion since Boo Weekley accomplished the feat in 2008.
The field will also feature four of the past six PGA Tour winners in Adam Hadwin (Valspar Championship), Marc Leishman (Arnold Palmer Invitational), D.A. Points (Puerto Rico Open) and Russell Henley (Shell Houston Open).
Charley Hoffman, who was tied for the 36-hole lead at the Masters before falling hard to a share of 22nd place, will be eager to get back to a course where he has made six consecutive cuts and three top-15 finishes.
Former U.S. Open winner Jim Furyk, who missed last year's RBC Heritage after undergoing wrist surgery, returns for the first time since winning here in 2015.
Furyk snapped a nearly five-year PGA Tour victory drought when he beat Kevin Kisner in a playoff in 2015 which sparked a strong run of form that sent the American to world number three later that year.
"I have the same mentality I always do coming in here. It will be more a matter of patience," world number 62 Furyk told reporters. "I feel that this is the place in my career when I have been patient, when I have been playing well. I know I can win this golf tournament."


KARLSRUHE/DUESSELDORF, Germany German authorities arrested a suspected Islamist on Wednesday in connection with what Chancellor Angela Merkel called a "despicable" attack on a bus carrying players of one of the country's top soccer teams.
Merkel said she was appalled by Tuesday evening's incident, in which three explosions went off as the Borussia Dortmund bus made its way to a match. Spanish defender Marc Bartra suffered injuries to his arm and wrist.
The attack forced a 24-hour postponement of the team's high-profile clash with AS Monaco, which turned out to be a pulsating encounter that the visitors won 3-2.
"I encouraged everyone to take the game seriously but football is not the most important thing in the world," Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said after the game.
Police stepped up security for the rescheduled match and for a second Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.
An exit from the Dortmund stadium was briefly closed as police examined suspicious packages, but quickly re-opened.
Ralf Jaeger, interior minister in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes Dortmund, said the investigation was looking "in all directions", and it was unclear if one or several attackers were involved.
A spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office, which handles probes into suspected terrorism, said the explosive devices had contained strips of metal.
Spokeswoman Frauke Koehler said investigators had found three letters near the scene, all with the same content suggesting a possible Islamist motive.
She said the letters referred to the use of Tornado reconnaissance planes in Syria, which Germany has deployed as part of the military campaign against Islamic State, and also called for the closure of the U.S. military base at Ramstein in western Germany.
Investigators had identified two suspects from the "Islamist scene", searched their apartments and detained one man, she said.

DEFENDER INJURED
The blasts smashed windows on the bus carrying the players to the stadium. Bartra was operated on for a broken bone in his right wrist and shrapnel in his arm, a team spokesman said.
"We all agree that we are dealing with a despicable act," Merkel said at a business event in the western town of Allendorf.
"We were all appalled yesterday when we heard about the attack on the bus with the players of BVB in Dortmund," she added, praising Dortmund fans for offering accommodation to AS Monaco fans after the postponement.
Bartra, 26, joined Dortmund for 8 million euros ($8.5 million) last year from Barcelona. He has made 12 appearances for the Spanish national team.
The blasts revived memories of Islamist militant attacks in Paris in November 2015 whose targets included a stadium where France were playing Germany in a soccer friendly.
Security is among the issues at the heart of Germany's parliamentary election on Sept. 24, a tight battle in which  Merkel is running for a fourth term. In December, a Tunisian man killed 12 people when he plowed a truck through a Berlin Christmas market.

DORTMUND, Germany They lost the game, but realized there is more to life than soccer.
Just a day after an explosives attack on their team bus, Borussia Dortmund's frustration at losing 2-3 to AS Monaco in their postponed Champions League clash was eclipsed by their players' relief at being alive.
"I don't know if the people can understand this but, until I was on the pitch in the second half, I didn't think about football," Dortmund player Nuri Sahin said after Wednesday's match.
"Last night, I didn't realize what happened until my wife and son were waiting in front of the door and there I felt how lucky we were," he recalled. "I get goosebumps."
Earlier, German authorities arrested a suspected Islamist in connection with what Chancellor Angela Merkel called the "despicable" attack on the bus, in which three explosions went off as the Dortmund players made their way to the stadium.
"When we were in the bus last night, I can't forget the faces," said Sahin, speaking English to the Viasat Football broadcasting network. "I will never forget these faces."
Spanish defender Marc Bartra, injured in the attack, said he was "doing much better" after surgery on his wrist. His team mates wore shirts bearing his picture during their warm-up for the match, which turned out to be a pulsating encounter.
Police, who banned backpacks from the Dortmund stadium, stepped up security for the rescheduled match and for a second Champions League quarter-final between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.
An exit from the Dortmund stadium was briefly closed as police examined suspicious packages, but quickly re-opened.
Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said his team would have liked more time to take stock after the attack and felt ignored by the soccer authorities after being made to play less than 24 hours later.
"I encouraged everyone to take the game seriously but football is not the most important thing in the world," he said.
Merkel, who takes a keen interest in the fortunes of Germany's national soccer team, earlier praised Dortmund fans for taking in AS Monaco supporters overnight so they could stay on for the postponed match.
Some fans of AS Monaco, which neighbors the southern French city of Nice where 86 people were killed in an Islamist attack last summer, were more relaxed than Dortmund supporters.
"In France, we know this," said Monaco supporter Pierre Calmon, 50, from Toulouse, who was attending the match with his son, 16-year-old Thomas. "We are pleased to spend another day in Germany."


The city of St. Louis and other regional groups on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the National Football League and all its teams and owners, claiming the league violated its relocation guidelines when it allowed the Rams to leave the Midwest city.
The city, St. Louis County and the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority, in a lawsuit filed in Circuit Court of St. Louis City, is seeking damages totaling more than $1 billion for the move by the Rams to Los Angeles from Missouri last year.
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said there was "no legitimate basis" for the lawsuit.
"While we understand the disappointment of the St. Louis fans and the community, we worked diligently with local and state officials in a process that was honest and fair at all times," he said in an email.
Rams spokesman Artis Twyman said the team would not comment on pending litigation.
Since the Rams move, the San Diego Chargers announced their relocation to the Los Angeles market for the coming season. The Chargers and Rams will share a new stadium scheduled to open in 2019. In March, the owners also approved the eventual Oakland Raiders' move to Las Vegas.
Charges in the St. Louis lawsuit include breach of contract, unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation and business interference.
The city and other plaintiffs in a statement claim the NFL, the most popular U.S. sports league, failed to follow its own guidelines for franchise relocation even as it induced the city to spend "considerable time and money to generate a compelling new stadium development."
The plaintiffs said they made investments in the team's home stadium based on the NFL's policy requiring teams to work in good faith to remain in their home community, but team officials were aiming to move long before they made such plans public, the lawsuit said.
"The Rams never intended to engage in good faith negotiations with St. Louis," the lawsuit said.
In one instance, the plaintiffs cited a December 2016 interview with Rams former head coach Jeff Fisher, who said when he was hired in January 2012 he was told of plans to move to Los Angeles. Fisher was fired in December.
The plaintiffs said the loss of the Rams hurt the city and region and benefited the league and its owners, who received a $550 million relocation fee, the lawsuit said. Meanwhile, the value of the Rams increased by nearly $700 million.
Among other damages cited by the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were city and county bond obligations totaling $360 million, the loss of more than $100 million in net proceeds, $30 million for the installation of a new playing surface and other renovations, the loss of state revenue of more than $15 million and about $7.5 million in lost property taxes.
The city said it also contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to attract and retain an NFL team over the past 20 years, the lawsuit said. The sports complex authority spent more than $17 million during efforts to build a new stadium for the Rams.

LONDON Wayde van Niekerk's hopes of a 200/400 meters double at this year's world championships in London were given a boost when organizers announced on Wednesday that they had changed the program to avoid the two events clashing.
South African Van Niekerk, who electrified last year's Rio Olympics by smashing the 400 meters world record with a time of 43.03 seconds in the final, had set his sights on a double gold in London.
The 24-year-old's hopes, however, looked like being scuppered by the schedule, which originally put the 400 final on Aug. 8, just hours after the first round of the shorter sprint.
The IAAF, world athletics' governing body, has sought to avoid the clash by moving the first round of the 200m to Aug. 7 to "better allow for a 200m/400m doubling opportunity".
It said in a statement that it had responded to requests from athletics federations, including South Africa's.
“I am also delighted that the Council today approved the 200m and 400m double. These double headers create great excitement among both athletes and fans,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe said.
The world championships run from Aug. 4-13.

Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney will miss their Europa League quarter-final first leg against Anderlecht due to an ankle injury, manager Jose Mourinho said on Wednesday.
The England forward, who has sat out United's last two matches, did not travel to Brussels for the game on Thursday.
"He is not happy with his condition," Mourinho told reporters.
"He has bad feelings with his ankle and he’s not ready to play. Let’s see for the weekend, let’s see for next week. We don’t have many players and need everyone to try to be available."
United right back Antonio Valencia should be fit to return against the Belgian team after missing the last two games and    Mourinho said his side would have to be at their best against dangerous opponents.
"They are a good team and have a certain way of playing, adapted to the qualities of their players," he said.
"They play well, press well and have talented players. I think we have to play at our best level.
"When a team arrives at this stage of the competition, everyone feels it’s possible (to win it). The motivation is high for everyone."
United are fifth in the Premier League table, one place outside the Champions League qualification spots, ahead of their match against leaders Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday.
"We still have two open doors and my feeling is that we are really going to fight in both competitions," Mourinho said.
"Honestly, I have a special feeling with the Europa League, it’s a competition we can win."

BERLIN German police said they re-opened an exit from the Dortmund soccer stadium, venue for Wednesday's Champions League clash between Borussia Dortmund and AS Monaco, after specialists examined suspicious objects found there.
"The objects were examined. The south-east entrance/exit can be used," Dortmund police said in a tweet.

BOSTON The double murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez ended on Thursday with the prosecution and his defense attorneys locking horns over whether he had argued with, or even noticed, the men he is charged with gunning down outside a nightclub.
Prosecutors contend Hernandez hunted down Cape Verdean nationals Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado and shot them dead after flying into a rage because one of them had inadvertently spilled a drink on him while partying at a Boston club in July 2012.
Their star witness, convicted drug dealer Alexander Bradley, testified that he left the club with Hernandez and was sitting next to him in a car when he yelled to get the men's attention and then shot them dead.
Defense attorney Jose Baez disputed that claim, noting that no video evidence had been presented showing Hernandez interacting with the men during the 9 minutes he spent in the club and that he does not appear wet in surveillance video taken outside.
"It's an absolute lie," Baez said. He repeatedly emphasized that Bradley had been given immunity to testify and said that Bradley, not Hernandez, may have been the gunman.
Assistant District Attorney Patrick Haggan stuck by Bradley's testimony and showed video from outside the club that depicted Bradley gesturing to Hernandez in a way he said backed up the man's testimony that he was trying to calm his angry friend.
"We're not asking you to speculate," Haggan told the jury. "Alexander Bradley told you what's being said, he told you that he told him, 'Listen, you're a professional athlete, you have to stop getting so mad at things, people aren't trying to test you.'"
Hernandez was convicted in 2015 of fatally shooting an acquaintance, Odin Lloyd, in an industrial park near his North Attleboro, Massachusetts, home two years earlier. He is serving a life prison term for that murder.
Bradley said Hernandez shot him in the face while the two were on a 2013 trip to Florida after Bradley mentioned the Boston shooting. Bradley, who lost an eye in that incident, initially denied knowing who had fired at him but later identified Hernandez as the alleged shooter in a civil lawsuit seeking monetary damages.
Hernandez, 27, is charged with witness intimidation for that alleged shooting. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
The additional murder charges also carry potential life sentences.

SHANGHAI Sauber super-sub Antonio Giovinazzi, impressively up to speed on his Formula One debut in the season-opening race in Australia, is wasting no time as he sets his sights on the points in Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.
The Italian was drafted in as a last-minute replacement for Pascal Wehrlein in Melbourne after the German withdrew for fitness reasons on Saturday morning.
Giovinazzi impressed despite limited time in the car, lapping less than two-tenths of a second slower than his more experienced team mate Marcus Ericsson in qualifying and finishing 12th in the race.
With Wehrlein also opting out of the race in Shanghai this weekend, Giovinazzi, who is also Ferrari's third driver, will continue to stand in for the Mercedes-backed driver.
Breaking through into the top-ten points positions in a Sauber with its year-old Ferrari engine will a tough ask.
But with more time in the car, and rain predicted for Sunday, Giovinazzi said he would give it his all.
"To score a point will be difficult but I will try my best and score a point," said the 23-year-old, who if he finishes in the top ten will become the first Italian to score in Formula One since Vitantonio Liuzzi in 2010.
"It will be maybe wet and also to have some experience in the wet conditions will be good.
"What I can do is to do my best and hope the result can be good like Melbourne."
Wehrlein, who raced for now-defunct backmarkers Manor last year in his rookie season, hurt his back in an accident in the "Race of Champions" event in Miami in January.
The 23-year-old was unable to train for the greater physical demands of the 2017 cars as he took time off to recover.
He took part in testing, however, albeit sharing driving duties with Ericsson and was cleared to race in Australia.
Other drivers like Force India's Sergio Perez, who hoped Wehrlein wasn't suffering from a more serious issue, respected his decision but said they would have raced even if they weren't fully fit.
Sauber team-principal Monisha Kaltenborn, meanwhile, rebuffed conspiracy theories surrounding Wehrlein's decision.
"These kinds of things you have to take seriously," she told reporters, referring to Wehrlein's accident.
It is not yet clear if the German will return for next week's race in Bahrain.

LONDON Human rights campaigners have urged Formula One management to cancel next week's Bahrain Grand Prix, accusing the country's rulers of using the race to "whitewash" abuses and improve their image abroad.
Bahrain's biggest sporting event is watched by a worldwide  audience of millions and has been held since 2004, with the exception of 2011 when violent civil unrest forced its cancellation.
"Concerted and visible action is now required from Formula One, consistent with its commitment to human rights," the groups said in a letter to Formula One chairman Chase Carey and the two managing directors Sean Bratches and Ross Brawn.
"We call on you to suspend this year's race in view of the alarming situation in the country."
The letter, also addressed to the chief executive of F1   sponsor Heineken, was sent by the Gulf Centre for Human Rights, Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, Article 19 and Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain.
Activists recognized privately, after a media briefing, that they did not expect the call to be heeded.
Bahrain, a former British protectorate and the U.S. Navy's main outpost in the Gulf region, has stepped up a crackdown on the opposition, banning the al-Wefaq party and arresting several prominent activists.
The Sunni Muslim-ruled kingdom accuses Iran, a Shi'ite Muslim theocracy across the Gulf, of radicalizing and arming some members of its Shi'ite majority population. Three Shi'ite men were executed in January after being convicted of killing three policemen.
Formula One published a commitment in 2015 to respect "internationally recognized human rights in its operations globally".
Formula One is now owned by U.S.-based Liberty Media, which took over the sport in January and ousted Bernie Ecclestone as commercial supremo.
Ecclestone, 86, told Reuters he would be in Bahrain for the race, the first he has attended since he ceased to run the show.
The campaigners' letter said Formula One would "become complicit" in human rights violations in Bahrain if the race was not canceled.
Activist Zainab al-Khawaja, who lives in Denmark after being arrested and released several times in Bahrain, told reporters that the race raised the question, "Does the world care about what's happening in Bahrain?
"It (Formula One) is a message sent to the people of Bahrain that the world does not care," she said.
A Bahrain government spokesperson said the country had implemented "a range of institutional and legal reforms over recent years, in close collaboration with international governments and independent experts.
"As a result of these efforts, Bahrain now has a number of internationally recognized safeguards in place to ensure human rights abuses do not occur."
The spokesperson added, in a comment emailed to Reuters, that Bahrain was "entirely compliant and proactively participates" with Formula One's defined human rights policy.
"Like other Formula One host nations, Bahrain will work alongside the organization to help support these commitments, and the Kingdom welcomes the opportunity to demonstrate its own highly significant strides as part of this process."

Manchester United winger Jesse Lingard has signed a new contract that will keep him at Old Trafford until 2021, the Premier League club said in a statement on Thursday.
Lingard, who will earn up to 100,000 pounds ($124,650) a week according to British media reports, has an option to extend the deal by a further year.
"Manchester United has always been a big part of my life," Lingard said in a club statement.
"I have been with the club since the age of seven and I feel great pride every time I pull the shirt on."
The 24-year-old broke into the United first team under previous manager Louis van Gaal and has gone on to make 70 appearances for the club, scoring 11 goals.
Three of those have come at Wembley, with the winger netting the winner in last season's FA Cup final. He also scored against Leicester in the Community Shield and against Southampton as United won the League Cup in February.
"He has good intelligence which, when combined with his energy and ability, makes for a player with a great future ahead of him," United manager Jose Mourinho said.

SHANGHAI Fernando Alonso is not ready to swap his recalcitrant McLaren for a supermarket trolley just yet, despite the Formula One team's troubled start to the season prompting speculation about whether the Spaniard will see out the year.
The double world champion and McLaren endured a frustrating season opening race in Australia, following on from pre-season testing marred by a lack of power and reliability from their Honda engines.
Alonso, despite putting in what he called one of the best drives of his career, could only battle for the lower points positions, before dropping out of contention altogether and eventually retiring.
His team mate Stoffel Vandoorne could only finish 13th and last, after being lapped twice by Sebastian Vettel's race-winning Ferrari.
That McLaren felt the result exceeded expectations was a sign of how far in the doldrums the sport's second most successful team are.
McLaren's form renewed speculation about whether the 35-year-old, in the final year of a three-season deal, would stick around.
Former driver and Alonso's close friend Mark Webber also cast doubt on his future in comments to Belgian media.
"Definitely not true," Alonso told reporters on Thursday ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix.
"I prefer to be here than to be in the supermarket in my hometown."
"I keep competing because I want to have more trophies.
"I am in Formula One, I'm delivering at my best, I'm more prepared than ever, I'm performing at my best," he said.
McLaren, who last won a race in 2012, went into the season expecting to make a big step up the order after a season of progress following a troubled reunion with engine supplier Honda in 2015.
But the Japanese manufacturer's continued struggles with the V6 turbo-hybrid formula have left McLaren, who finished sixth overall last year after ending 2015 ninth, mired near the bottom of the pecking order.
The team expect to struggle even more this weekend in Shanhai and Alonso's plight has not gone unnoticed.
Former McLaren team mate and rival Lewis Hamilton, in particular, has expressed a desire to see him in more competitive machinery.
When asked if he could switch teams next season, perhaps even moving up to Mercedes alongside Hamilton, Alonso didn't rule it out.
"I have nothing to say right now, it's a question for the future," he said, adding: "Nothing is ruled out in life."

AUGUSTA, Georgia Arnie's Army was out in force one more time on Thursday, storming the first tee at the U.S. Masters in a final salute to Arnold Palmer, their fallen leader.
There have been many tributes since the man known as "The King" passed away at the age of 87 last September but none could match the emotional connection Palmer had with Augusta National and the Masters - a tournament the swashbuckling golfer made important and won four times.
The year's first major got off to a somber and poignant start as thousands of golf fans wearing commemorative buttons confirming their membership in Arnie's Army stood at attention during a moment of silence broken only by the sound of a chilly wind rustling through the trees.
Augusta National chairman Billy Payne addressed the massive gallery, telling them it was a morning of unbearable sadness. Golf icons Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player then struck the opening ceremonial tee shots without their long time friend and rival at their side.
"Welcome to the 2017 Masters. It is a wonderful but, in one respect, a difficult day," said Payne. "For the first time in many many decades someone is obviously missing from the first tee.
"The almost unbearable sadness that we all feel by the passing of Arnold Palmer is only surpassed by the love and affection for him."
Before Nicklaus, a six-time Masters champion, hit his shot the Golden Bear looked to the heavens and waved his cap into the leaden skies in a clear salute to Palmer, whose Masters Green Jacket was draped over a white lawn chair to the side of the first tee.
After Player, who played in a record 52 Masters, sent his tee shot right Nicklaus stepped up and crushed his straight down the heart of the fairway, drawing a huge cheer signaling the 81st Masters was officially under way.
Later, Nicklaus and Palmer, both wearing Arnie's Army badges on the lapels of their Green Jackets, held court and paid homage to Palmer, a gentleman, fierce competitor and friend who made the Masters into one of sports great events.
"So Arnold came along (and) television was getting started. It was a time that the popularity of the game was really stimulated by Arnold," said Nicklaus.
"It was a time when the Masters was just sort of getting its feet wet with what's going on in the golfing world. Arnold was sort of the guy that made that popular and took the Masters from being a tournament to being one of the four biggest events in golf," Nicklaus went on.
"I think it was Arnold who took it to that. So my feeling was that, yes, the Masters made Arnold in many ways because of his wins but the other way around, I think Arnold made the
Masters. Arnold put the Masters on the map and with his rise and his popularity, the Masters rose the same," he said.
"I think they were both very good for each other."

AUGUSTA, Georgia Commemorative pins honoring golfing great Arnold Palmer that were handed out to everyone attending the opening round of the U.S. Masters on Thursday were already appearing for sale online.
A number of "Arnie's Army" replica badges from the 1960s were already listed on online retailer eBay, with one seller seeking $120.
Palmer, who died in September at the age of 87, had a go-for-broke style that added to his appeal among his loyal fans, who became known as "Arnie's Army".
The white replica pins read "I am a member of Arnie's Army" in green writing with the Masters logo in the middle and the start date of the tournament at the bottom.
Palmer was honored in a moving tribute prior to the start of Thursday's opening round during which his Green Jacket was laid across the back of a white lawn chair at the first tee.

AUGUSTA, Georgia World number one Dustin Johnson, whose participation in the U.S. Masters was in doubt after a freak fall, will definitely tee off in the first round of the year's first major on Thursday, Golf Digest reported.
Johnson landed hard on his back inside an Augusta rental home on Wednesday but the report, which sourced the golfer's trainer, said the 32-year-old-American will tee off at 2:03 p.m. ET (1803 GMT) alongside compatriots Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker.
Earlier on Thursday Golf Digest had said Johnson was walking with more mobility and took a couple of practice swings slowly without a club.
"We got him to the point where he got mobility," Johnson's trainer, Joey Diovisalvi, said in the report.
"He was up and moving around and definitely going in the right direction. He was very much in an under control point going to bed last night."
Johnson arrived at the year's first major as the tournament favorite after winning his last three events.

SHANGHAI, Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel has tipped Mercedes as favourites to win the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday even after his victory in Formula One’s season-opening round in Australia.
"I think Mercedes still has to be the favourite, obviously," Vettel told reporters on a damp afternoon in Shanghai on Thursday.

"We know that we have a good package which puts us in a strong place but ... we know there’s a lot of things that we need to do to keep up with them and keep the position that we are in now, to fight for good races."
Vettel beat Mercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas by a comfortable margin in Melbourne two weeks ago.
Hamilton, who started from the pole position, appeared to have the edge over the German in qualifying but the Ferrari appeared genuinely faster in race trim.
Vettel's win in Australia was Ferrari's first since September 2015 and first in a season-opening race since Bahrain in 2010.
It raised hopes that the Italian squad could challenge Mercedes for the title this season and end the Brackley-based outfit’s run of dominance, one that has seen them sweep to a hat-trick of drivers and constructor' titles and 51 wins from 59 races over the last three years.
"It's the first race, so it doesn't mean much," Vettel said. "But for sure, as I said, it's the best way to start off."
Mercedes have a strong record around the 5.4-km (3.3-mile) long Shanghai track, winning four of the last five races at the circuit and starting each one on pole position. Hamilton, too, has won in China four times, more than any other driver by far.

He is also the only man to have enjoyed back-to-back success at the track, and Vettel could be right to be wary.
But he hasn’t ruled out the race throwing up some surprises, especially if the rain forecast for Sunday arrives.
"It's always a Grand Prix full of surprises," said the 29-year-old, who handed Red Bull their maiden Formula One triumph in a wet race in Shanghai in 2009.
"You never know what happens around here."

SHANGHAI, Formula One triple champion Lewis Hamilton believes Mercedes will have to raise their game if they are to beat a resurgent Ferrari in Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.
Sebastian Vettel dashed Mercedes' hopes of extending their spell of dominance into a fourth straight season by comfortably winning last month's season-opening round in Australia.
Hamilton was second ahead of new team-mate Valtteri Bottas."It wasn't ours to lose," said Hamilton, who went into the Melbourne race as the favorite. "It was both of ours to win and they did a better job at the end of the day.
"For sure you can always go back in lots of scenarios and say if you'd done this differently you could win, but that’s hindsight,” said the Briton, who lost precious time bottled up behind Max Verstappen’s slower Red Bull after pitting early.
"...So we have to do a better job."
For his part, Vettel tipped Mercedes as favorites to win the Chinese Grand Prix.
His win at the Albert Park circuit ended a victory drought for Ferrari and the German stretching back to the Singapore Grand Prix in September 2015.
It also raised hopes the combination could emerge as genuine title challengers to Mercedes, who have swept the drivers and constructors' crowns for the last three years straight.
The German outfit, though, have won four of the last five races in China while Hamilton, who also has four wins, is by far the most successful driver at the track.
With rain forecast on Sunday, it could swing the balance further in his favor even if the Briton, a rainy-weather specialist, is uncharacteristically uneasy about racing in the wet this weekend.
"Usually I like driving in the wet. But I am a little bit apprehensive," the 32-year-old said on a rainy afternoon in Shanghai.
Formula One's wet tyres have been revised after criticism about their effectiveness last year and as part of rule changes that have resulted in cars that are wider, with fatter tyres and more swept-back bodywork.
Teams had the chance to try out the new wet-weather rubber over the course of a day during pre-season testing on an artificially drenched track.
But Hamilton sat out the session with an electrical issue.
Despite his apprehension, Hamilton is looking forward to the race. "I do relish the challenge. I do believe if anyone is able to do it I can, so I will figure it out."

WWE Inc, owner of the sports entertainment spectacle WrestleMania, has launched a strategy to stage all of its live touring franchises in one city at a time, in a bid to cut costs and improve profitability.
In addition to WrestleMania, the WWE will use its so-called “takeover” strategy for other wrestling events like Summerslam, Survivor Series and The Royal Rumble, providing a four-to-five day live series each quarter. Still, WWE will need to demonstrate it can continue to draw large crowds over the multi-day stretch.
The WWE is coming off a weekend where it sold out five consecutive nights in Orlando, including WrestleMania at the Citrus Bowl, with records for that stadium's attendance of 75,245 fans and its revenue of $14.5 million.
Over a five-day stretch that began last Friday the WWE brought in more than 120,000 fans to the city. The other four shows were at the Amway Center.
Previously, WWE would typically hold events that followed one of their major events in nearby cities, as the quick turnaround time does not allow them to travel far.
WWE's live event business is its third-largest source of revenue, grossing $144.4M in 2016. Holding multiple live events  in one location will increase profitability by streamlining ticket sales and paring down costs, since the ring and set don’t have be taken apart and moved, the company said.
Robert Routh, an analyst for FBN Securities said WWE's plans to stage multiple live events in one city may lift revenue, but concluded it is too early to tell.
“The jury remains out on this,” he said.
Putting on the extravagant shows is complicated. For WrestleMania alone, 100 semi-tractor trailer trucks were needed to ferry equipment to Orlando and two weeks were needed to construct the set which included a super-sized ring.
WWE's live events are also key to growing overseas in marketing including China, a market the WWE is eager to break into.
Nearly a third of the WWE's $729 million in 2016 revenue came from international, said chief brand officer Stephanie McMahon.
Operating income for their live event business fell 15 percent in the fourth quarter to $6.2 million, while revenue grew 17 percent to $38.6 million in the same period, mainly due to 21 additional events since the previous year.
"We are constantly evaluating that model,” McMahon said, noting they want to stage more events in China to give more exposure to the Chinese nationals they signed last year. “We’re nowhere near the same kind of penetration that we are in other markets."

LONDON Chelsea ticked off three more points in their Premier League title quest with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City on Wednesday but Tottenham Hotspur's Houdini-like 3-1 win at Swansea means the race is far from over.
With Chelsea leading fourth-placed City at an edgy Stamford Bridge courtesy of Eden Hazard's first-half brace and Tottenham, who kicked off 15 minutes earlier, trailing 1-0 at Swansea, a decisive swing in Chelsea's favors loomed.
However, Dele Alli's 88th-minute equalizer for Tottenham followed by stoppage-time strikes from Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen means Chelsea's lead remains seven points with eight games of the season remaining.
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte described his side's gritty victory as a "big win" but said 90 points may be needed before they can start celebrating.
"The Tottenham result is important but the most important was our result," Conte, whose side rebounded from Saturday's first home defeat since September against Crystal Palace, told reporters after becoming the first manager to do a league double over City boss Pep Guardiola.
"The best thing for us to think is that Tottenham could win eight games so to win the title we need 18 points."
Joshua King's late leveller for Bournemouth in a 2-2 draw at Anfield all but knocked Liverpool out of the title equation as they are 12 points adrift of Chelsea having played a game more.
Goals by Philippe Coutinho and Divock Origi either side of halftime had put Liverpool ahead after Benik Afobe struck early for the visitors but once again Juergen Klopp's side dropped points against the supposed also-rans.
With City, without a win in four games, a further two points back in fourth, Guardiola's chief concern will be ensuring they keep above Arsenal and Manchester United in the scrap for qualification for next season's Champions League.

RASH TACKLE
Sergio Aguero's equalizer on Wednesday, his 15th league goal of the season, looked to have given City the launchpad to increase Chelsea's jitters but Fernandinho's rash tackle on Pedro for a penalty which Hazard scored on the rebound meant Guardiola was outsmarted by Conte for the second time.
"We come here to Stamford Bridge and play the way we have, with huge personality. I'm a lucky guy to manage these guys," Guardiola, an animated figure throughout the match, said.
With United only drawing with Everton on Tuesday, Arsenal moved up to fifth, four points behind City with a game in hand, after a 3-0 home victory over struggling West Ham United -- a first win in four for Arsene Wenger's side.
It was not just an important night at the top.
Hull City's third win in four games -- a 4-2 triumph over Middlesbrough with five goals coming before the break -- saw Marco Silva's team climb above Swansea and out of the bottom three.
Lazar Markovic, Oumar Niasse, Abel Hernandez and Harry Maguire were all on target to leave Boro looking favorites along with Sunderland to drop into the Championship next season.
Sunderland are 10 points adrift of the safety zone while Boro, without a win since December, are seven behind Hull.
Swansea, who led through Wayne Routledge's early goal at the Liberty Stadium and seemed poised for a priceless victory, slipped back into the bottom three, two points below Hull.
Palace fell back to earth with a bump after their weekend heroics at Stamford Bridge, losing 3-1 at Southampton while West Ham's fifth defeat on the spin keeps Slaven Bilic's side too close to the relegation zone for comfort.

Liverpool's quest for a top-four finish suffered a setback as a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth on Wednesday saw them again drop points to a side in the bottom half of the Premier League - the Anfield team's Achilles heel this season.
Liverpool are unbeaten in 10 games against top-six teams this season, having won five and drawn five, claiming seven more points than their closest rivals Chelsea in that mini-league.
Liverpool's downfall has been their inability to dispatch teams lower down the table, with their last six defeats dating back to last season coming against teams in the bottom half.
Liverpool have now matched their points tally from last term but losses to Burnley, Bournemouth, Swansea City, Hull City and Leicester City have created a sense of 'What if?' at Anfield.
Against Bournemouth on Wednesday, Liverpool led 2-1, having conceded an early opener, and were heading for three points before Joshua King's 86th-minute equalizer.
At one stage, Liverpool were level on points with second-placed Tottenham Hotspur but the Merseysdiers' late setback, coupled with Spurs' late 3-1 comeback win at Swansea City, means they now sit five points adrift of the north London side.
Liverpool remain third but Manchester City are two points behind them with a game in hand, while Arsenal and Manchester United are six points adrift but have two extra games to play.
"We could have closed the game earlier but we didn't find the right solution, the right pass," Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp told the BBC.
"It was clear it would not be perfect tonight but, of course, we could have found this one counter-attack to close the game.
"And then, of course, (there was) the second ball after the set piece (which led to the equalizer). It's my responsibility. We have to work on this, we have to sort it because it hurts a lot," added Klopp.
"It is important that you feel disappointment because we can't ignore it and say, 'No problem'. It's one point more which is good. We all know we can beat each team but obviously we can lose against a few. We have to learn from it."
Liverpool travel to Stoke City in their next game.

(The Sports Xchange) - Marshawn Lynch visited the Oakland Raiders' facility on Wednesday, with ESPN's Adam Schefter citing an undisclosed source as saying that a deal between the retired running back and his hometown team "eventually will happen."
Lynch's arrival at the Oakland-based facility was first reported by former Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee at his new position as a Barstool Sports contributor.
Lynch, who turns 31 on April 22, retired from the NFL and Seahawks after the 2015 season. He has been on the reserve/retired list since May 2016.
Under terms of his existing contract, Lynch would be in line for a $9 million salary and cap hit in 2017, and he would be due a base salary of $7 million in 2018 and could potentially earn an additional $3 million roster bonus, according to ESPN.
The Raiders lost running back Latavius Murray to the Minnesota Vikings in free agency. Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington are among the candidates to take the lead role in Oakland.
Lynch finished his nine-year NFL career with 9,112 rushing yards and 74 touchdowns in 127 games, and another 1,979 receiving yards and nine TDs.

Dallas is reportedly emerging as a favorite to host the 2018 NFL Draft at the Cowboys' new training facility and headquarters in Frisco, Texas.
League sources told ESPN that Dallas is pushing to host the draft and feels it has the infrastructure at The Star -- the Cowboys' training facility, which opened last year.
Philadelphia is also in contention, while Kansas City and Green Bay are considered long shots, according to ESPN.
The NFL is not expected to decide the host of the 2018 draft until this year's draft is complete. The 2017 draft is set April 27-29 in Philadelphia for the first time since 1961 after the last two drafts took place in Chicago.
The draft was held annually in New York City from 1965 to 2014. New York is not in consideration for next year's draft, a source told ESPN.

The New England Patriots re-signed running back Brandon Bolden to a contract.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed by the team for the 27-year-old Bolden, who was an unrestricted free agent.
With free agent LeGarrette Blount's status still in limbo, Bolden joins a crowded backfield that features James White, Dion Lewis, Rex Burkhead, D.J. Foster and fullback James Develin.
Bolden's contributions were felt primarily on special teams in 2016. He has 20 career special teams tackles and one blocked punt during his five seasons with New England.

The Los Angeles Rams signed veteran center John Sullivan to fill one of the team's starting needs on the offensive line.
Sullivan, 31, started 93 of 109 games for the Minnesota Vikings from 2008 to 2014 and spent last season as a backup with the Washington Redskins, where new Rams head coach Sean McVay served as offensive coordinator.
Sullivan played in 13 games and made one start for Washington in 2016. He missed the 2015 season with a back injury.


(The Sports Xchange) - Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Kris Letang will undergo surgery for a herniated disc in his neck, the team announced Wednesday.
Letang, 29, will miss the remainder of the regular season and the playoffs, with an expected recovery time of four to six months.
"Kris underwent an MRI in February that revealed a herniated disc in his neck," Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement.
"Our neurosurgeons examined him and recommended conservative treatment in an attempt to correct the condition without surgery. Kris had been making progress and was hopeful of returning for the playoffs until about a week ago, when the progress plateaued. He underwent another MRI, and, at that point it was determined that surgery was needed."
Letang has not played since Feb. 21, missing the Penguins' last 20 games. The native of Montreal contributed 34 points (five goals, 29 assists) in 41 games this season.
In 11 NHL seasons, all with the Penguins, Letang owns 386 points (87 goals, 299 assists) in 603 games.
Letang is a two-time Stanley Cup champion. He played in the NHL All-Star Game in 2011, 2012 and 2016.

Forward Kyle Okposo will miss the final three games of the Buffalo Sabres' season with an undisclosed illness, coach Dan Bylsma said.
The Sabres also recalled Linus Ullmark from Rochester of the American Hockey League, one day after fellow goaltender Anders Nilsson was injured in practice.
Okposo collected 19 goals and 26 assists in 65 games after signing a seven-year, $42 million deal in the offseason. The 28-year-old power forward had recorded three straight seasons of at least 50 points with the New York Islanders.

The Columbus Blue Jackets signed defenseman Ryan Collins to a three-year, entry-level contract.
The team announced Collins will join the American Hockey League's Cleveland Monsters prior to Friday's game at Milwaukee.


April 5 - - Arsenal re-ignited their stuttering top-four challenge, climbing above Manchester United into fifth place, with a 3-0 home victory over West Ham United in the Premier League on Wednesday.
Rumors of a fan protest were well founded with many empty seats visible at The Emirates Stadium during an otherwise uneventful first hour which yielded few chances before Mesut Ozil curled in a 58th-minute opener.
Theo Walcott doubled the Gunners' advantage, finishing a slick passing move with a close-range finish 10 minutes later, before Olivier Giroud came off the bench and scored a sublime third to seal his side's second win in seven games.
"We come out of a difficult period and our confidence goes quickly and comes back slowly," Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told the BBC.
"We are in the final sprint in the Premier League and consistency will be very important. We have a little handicap on the points front. We have fewer possibilities to drop points."
Arsenal have 54 points from 29 games -- four behind Manchester City, who have played a game more, in fourth.
West Ham, who suffered a fifth straight loss, are 15th with 33 from 31 and are just five points above third-bottom Swansea City, who they host on Saturday, and the drop zone.
The Hammers manager Slaven Bilic was given the support of the club's board this week after a poor run of form - which now stretches to five league defeats in a row -- that has dragged his side into the midst of the relegation battle.
"Of course we are (in a relegation battle). We don't have to hide it," the Croat told the BBC.
"It's not being negative, it's being realistic. I told the players to forget today -- we have big games ahead of us. It's a massive game against Swansea on Saturday. We are in a fight to keep our Premier League status. We have to start winning games.
"To get that confidence back is the key point. One win will change everything for us. Because three points at this stage of the season are massive," he added.

The world’s richest horse race just got richer, with organizers on Wednesday announcing a $16 million purse for the 2018 Pegasus World Cup Invitational in Florida.
The inaugural race in January paid $12 million, eclipsing the $10 million on offer at the Dubai World Cup.
Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum recently told CNN he wanted the Dubai race to regain its status as the richest race.
"The 2017 Pegasus World Cup Invitational surpassed our expectations and we believe took the sport of thoroughbred racing to an exciting new level," said Belinda Stronach, president of the Stronach Group.
American colt Arrogate is the reigning champion of both races. He won the Pegasus World Cup at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach on Jan. 28, before taking the Dubai World Cup on March 25.
The Florida event, the brainchild of businessman Frank Stronach, is funded largely by a $1 million entry fee paid by the connections of each of the 12 starting horses.
The Stronach Group will contribute the remaining $4 million to the 2018 race, to be held on Jan. 27.

LONDON Newcastle returned to the top of the Championship and moved a step closer to an immediate return to the Premier League with a controversial 1-0 victory against Burton Albion on Wednesday.
Newcastle thought they had opened the scoring when Matt Ritchie converted a penalty but referee Keith Stroud blew his whistle having spotted an apparent encroachment before the spot kick was taken.
In bizarre circumstances, however, he disallowed the goal rather than order a re-take as the law dictates -- much to the bewilderment of Newcastle and manager Rafa Benitez.
Ritchie finally did open the scoring with a thumping strike in the 68th minute to seal the win.
Minutes after the final whistle the Professional Game Management Official Limited (PGMOL) -- the group which officiates all Premier League, English Football League and Football Association matches -- said an apologetic Stroud had "mis-applied" the rule.
"The referee Keith Stroud awarded Newcastle a penalty in the 29th minute. As Matt Ritchie took the kick Dwight Gayle encroached in the penalty area," the PGMOL said in a statement.
"An indirect freekick was awarded to Burton but the laws of the game state the penalty should have been re-taken.
"Unfortunately the referee has mis-applied the law. Keith and his team are understandably upset at the lapse in concentration and apologize for the mistake."
Benitez was incensed on the sideline immediately after the incident and exchanged animated words with the fourth official after the final whistle.
The Spaniard, however, refused to comment when questioned about the incident after the game.
"I was very surprised but I don't want to talk about the incident that we have seen," he told Sky Sports. "At the moment I prefer to talk about the game. We scored a great goal and I prefer to talk about that."
Victory means, with six games remaining, Newcastle have 84 points -- one more than second-placed Brighton and Hove Albion.
Huddersfield Town climbed to third, nine points behind Brighton, with a comfortable 3-0 win against Norwich City thanks to goals from Elias Kachunga, Aaron Mooy and Nahki Wells.
Reading are a point adrift in fourth while Leeds United and Sheffield Wednesday sit fifth and sixth with 69 and 66 points respectively.

LONDON Chelsea recovered from their shock weekend defeat with Eden Hazard's double securing a nervy 2-1 victory over Manchester City that maintained a seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League.
Their home loss to Crystal Palace on Saturday re-ignited the title race but Chelsea responded with a gritty display to keep second-placed Tottenham Hotspur -- 3-1 comeback winners at Swansea City -- safely at arm's length with eight games left.
Hazard's deflected shot gave the hosts a 10th-minute lead although City keeper Willy Caballero should have saved it.
Sergio Aguero leveled with a tap-in after 26 minutes following a poor clearance by keeper Thibaut Courtois but Hazard restored Chelsea's lead against the run of play in the 35th with a rebound after his weak penalty was saved by Caballero.
Fourth-placed City dominated possession in the second half and skipper Vincent Kompany, starting a league match for the first time since November, looped a header on to the bar.
With news of Tottenham's late revival in Wales filtering through, there was palpable tension in the air and a huge sigh of relief swept Stamford Bridge in stoppage time when City defender John Stones blazed over with the goal gaping.
It was hardly a flowing performance by Antonio Conte's long-time leaders but the title is edging ever closer.
Pep Guardiola's City, for all their slick inter-play, are now looking anxiously over their shoulders at Arsenal and Manchester United after four games without a win.
Chelsea have 72 points from 30 matches to Tottenham's 65 ahead of Liverpool in third place on 60, having played a game more, followed by Manchester City with 58, then Arsenal and Manchester United on 54, both having played a game less.

HAZARD SHINES
If Chelsea do secure the title for the second time in three years, Hazard's contribution will be key.
The Belgian now has 13 league goals this season -- 10 of them scored at the Bridge.
Yet the two he scored on Wednesday were memorable only for their importance to Chelsea's cause.
His 10th-minute shot from Cesar Azpilicueta's pull back packed no real venom but it glanced off Kompany which seemed to fool Caballero who failed to keep the ball out.
Courtois's mistake for City's 26th minute leveler was even worse. The Belgian's clearance went straight to David Silva and, though the keeper saved the Spaniard's shot, the rebound was gobbled up by Aguero for his 15th league goal of the season.
Courtois redeemed himself with a great save to deny Leroy Sane as City took charge, but the visitors' momentum was curtailed when Fernandinho -- one of two City players sent off in Chelsea's 3-1 win at the Etihad in December -- clumsily fouled Pedro in the area to give away a penalty.
Hazard's weak spot kick was saved by Caballero but the ball fell kindly for the Belgian to tuck away the rebound.
Chelsea rarely threatened after the break but Gary Cahill and David Luiz were rocks at the heart of the defense as the hosts completed a double over City.

LONDON Britain's Olympic show jumping double gold medalist Nick Skelton announced his retirement at the age of 59 on Wednesday, saying he was not getting any younger and it was good to go out at the top.
Skelton, a team gold medalist in London in 2012, won his first individual Olympic title with Big Star at last year's Rio Games.
The oldest British gold medalist since 1908, he competed in seven Olympics despite being advised by his surgeon to give up riding after a fall in 2000 snapped vertebra in his neck in two places.
"It has come to a point, after months of thought and consideration, that myself and my partner Big Star have decided to retire from competition," Skelton said on his website (www.nickskelton.com).
"We feel that Big Star has done everything that a rider could ask and it is time for him to relax and enjoy his stallion duties. As for myself, I have always stated that when Big Star was finished I would be as well.
"This sport has given me more than I could have ever hoped over the past 43 years and it is such a difficult decision to make, but I'm not getting any younger and it is nice for the two of us to end on the highest note possible."
Skelton and Big Star's farewell appearance will be at the Royal Windsor Horse Show on May 14.

DOHA Hundreds of Asian workers pay recruitment fees for jobs building World Cup stadiums in Qatar and some end up working for nearly five months without a day of rest, according to an investigation funded by the Gulf state's World Cup organizing body.
Conditions for workers from India, Nepal and Bangladesh powering a $200 billion infrastructure upgrade for the 2022 World Cup have come under scrutiny from rights groups who say migrants live in squalor and work without proper access to water and shelter.
The Gulf Arab kingdom says it is implementing labor reforms and Qatar's World Cup organizing body last year hired a British consulting firm, Impactt Ltd, to assess working conditions on stadiums in an effort to improve transparency.
The Impactt report presented to the tournament's organizing committee includes testimonies from migrants who work 18-hour days for six days a week on stadium sites and whose passports are held by their employers.
Three workers said they had worked for 148 consecutive days, nearly five months, without a rest, while more than three-quarters of the 253 workers interviewed said they paid recruitment fees to agents in their home countries.
"The findings we gathered ... indicate that workers paid the equivalent of between USD 80 and 3,800 in fees during the recruitment process," the report said.
Two World Cup workers were dismissed last year accused of inciting workers to strike in protest over their employer's clocking-in system, it said.
Protests by workers are extremely rare in wealthy Qatar where labor unions are banned and authorities penalize dissent with jail terms or immediate deportation.
Hassan al-Thawadi, Qatar's 2022 committee chief, said he welcomed the report which had identified challenges and demonstrated progress made by Qatar on workers' rights.
"We respect the constructive observations and recommendations made. We will do everything necessary to ensure the issues identified are dealt with promptly," Thawadi said in an emailed statement.
The 46-page document said Qatar had improved workers' accommodation and safety on construction sites by increasing inspections and suspending contractors found violating worker welfare provisions.
The wealthy state's kafala work sponsorship system - under which migrant workers cannot change jobs or leave the country without their employer's permission - lies at the heart of allegations of forced labor.
In December, Qatar passed a new law which allows the country's 1.6 million foreign workers who have completed contracts to change jobs freely and imposes fines of businesses who confiscate employees' passports.
Activists say the reforms do not go far enough.
Workers still need their employer's permission to seek alternative employment, during the period of their contract, which can last up to five years.

LONDON Novak Djokovic hopes the spark he has been lacking so far this year will return as he pulls on his Serbia shirt for this weekend's Davis Cup quarter-final against Spain in Belgrade.
The former world number one's appearance in his home city is one of several intriguing plots as the team competition reaches the business end with four hard-to-call ties.
Nick Kyrgios will be leading Australia's charge when Lleyton Hewitt's side host the U.S. in a clash of Davis Cup heavyweights, Belgium take on Italy while Britain, without the injured world number one Andy Murray, are away in France.
Since opening the year by winning the Doha title, world number two Djokovic has managed only six victories, and his ATP Race points total of 475 looks tiny compared with the 4,045 already amassed by a resurgent Roger Federer.
An early defeat by 117th-ranked Denis Istomin at the Australian Open was followed by two defeats by Kyrgios in Acapulco and Indian Wells. He then withdrew before the start of last week's Miami Open citing an elbow injury.
That is why all eyes will be on the 12 times grand slam champion on the indoor hardcourt in the Serbian capital.
"I personally always draw very positive energy from these weeks," said Djokovic, whose career went into warp drive after helping Serbia win the 2010 Davis Cup title.
"These weeks always bring the best out of me."
Spain will offer a formidable test even without world number five Rafael Nadal. World number 19 Pablo Carreno Busta has been one of the form players on the ATP Tour this year and will be supported by 24th-ranked Albert Ramos-Vinolas.
The weekend will kick off in Brisbane where the two most successful nations in Davis Cup history clash for a 47th time.
Australia are seeking a semi-final spot for only the second time in 11 years and much will depend on the form of Kyrgios.
With the U.S. boasting a team of in-form Jack Sock, John Isner, Sam Querrey and Steve Johnson, Hewitt will be banking on two wins from the mercurial Kyrgios as his second singles player is the inexperienced world number 79 Jordan Thompson.
"We've got a big tie against USA. Obviously Jack is playing unbelievable. John (Isner), he's a proven player. They've got a great team," Kyrgios, who lost a thrilling Miami semi-final against Federer last week, told the Davis Cup website.
Britain face a tough assignment without Murray on the clay in Rouen where Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans will be trying to fill his sizeable shoes against a host nation missing Jo-Wilfried Tsonga but led by 17th-ranked Lucas Pouille.
Belgium, the only won of the quarter-finalists never to have lifted the trophy stunned Germany in Frankfurt without David Goffin in round one but will have their top player back for the home clash with Italy in Charleroi.

AARHUS, Denmark Former senior World Anti-Doping Agency official David Howman was appointed on Wednesday as head of the newly established Athletics Integrity Unit to battle doping and corruption amid a drop in the sport's  popularity.
International athletics federation (IAAF) President Seb Coe said Howman, a lawyer who was director general at WADA for 13 years until 2016, was the perfect choice to chair the AIU.
The AIU takes over from the IAAF’s former anti-doping department and will manage testing, intelligence gathering and investigations among other things.
It will also address issues of bribery, corruption, betting and the manipulation of competition results in athletics, the flagship sport of the Olympics.
"The AIU is all about the athlete. It is our responsibility to create the right framework for everyone to succeed," Coe said.
"I am therefore delighted that we have attracted someone of the caliber and experience of David Howman as chairperson, as we set out to create a place where athletes can understand the rules and gain knowledge, confidence and experience."
Coe is hoping to reform the IAAF following the departure of his predecessor Lamine Diack in 2015, who is the subject of an ongoing French investigation into corruption and embezzlement.
He passed sweeping reforms late last year, including the establishment of the AIU.
"I want athletics to be on every observable metric a top four sport in the next four years," Coe, a former Olympic track and field champion, said at an international sports convention.
The IAAF still has many unresolved issues, however, and has triggered the wrath of Russia after it banned its athletics team from competing at last year's Rio de Janeiro Olympics over the country's huge doping scandal.
The Russians are also likely to miss the world athletics championships in London in August.
IAAF Council member Frank Fredericks stepped aside in March pending the results of an ethics investigation looking into allegations of payments he received from a now-banned athletics official before the 2016 Olympics was awarded to Rio de Janeiro.
Asked whether he expected more scandals to hit his sport, Coe said: "I honestly don't know."
"The sport is significantly more resilient than it was a year ago," he said. "Whatever challenges we are confronted with we have to have systems in place so that we can deal with them."
The IAAF said this week it had suffered a cyber attack by suspected Russian hackers who had targeted information concerning applications by athletes for Therapeutic Use Exemptions.

PARIS Briton Mark Cavendish has been ruled out of Sunday's Paris-Roubaix one-day race with an ankle injury, his Dimension Data team said on Wednesday.
"Mark Cavendish will not take the start at today’s Scheldeprijs or at the weekend's Paris-Roubaix due to an overuse injury," Dimension Data said in a statement.
"Cavendish, who last competed at the Milano-San Remo (classic), has been hampered by pain felt in his right ankle. The discomfort was first felt on the penultimate stage of Tirreno-Adriatico in March and has hindered our sprint ace since."
Former world champion Cavendish finished Paris-Roubaix, the biggest classic in the calendar featuring several tough cobbled sections, only once, taking 30th place last year.

SHANGHAI Lewis Hamilton has raised his game but whether the Mercedes driver can deny Ferrari a second successive win of the season in China this weekend remains to be seen.
On paper, the triple world champion is still the man to beat -- the most successful driver by far in Shanghai with four wins  to date.
"Lewis is the best Lewis that I've seen in the last four years, both on and off the track," said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff after the Briton started on pole and finished second to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in the Australian season-opener.
"He has become a pillar of this team and he proved that in Melbourne."
But Vettel is leading the championship, the first time a non-Mercedes driver has done that since he took his fourth title with Red Bull in 2013, and once-dominant Mercedes have a fight on their hands.
Mercedes, who have taken both the drivers and constructors' titles for the last three years, have won four of the last five races in China.
As Melbourne showed, however, past form may count for little in a season of sweeping rule change.
"If you think you are going to cruise to victory in the future, based on a track record of success, you'll be proven wrong very quickly," said Wolff.
"Australia was a weekend full of lessons, now we go to China ready and excited for another battle."
Ferrari have not started a season with consecutive wins since 2004 at the peak of the Michael Schumacher era, the Italian team taking 15 victories from 18 races that season.
Vettel's win in Australia ended a victory drought for Ferrari stretching back to September 2015, and drew rare praise from company chairman Sergio Marchionne, but they must now prove they can be genuine contenders.
"You really have to go step by step," said Vettel.
"It's good to know that we have a great car but it's just the beginning: new regulations, new generations of cars so there will be a lot of progress."
The cars this year are longer and wider, sporting fatter tires and more swept-back bodywork as part of a rules shake-up aimed at making them faster, more spectacular to watch and harder to drive.
But overtaking has also become more difficult, with Australia raising concern about the lack of real moves.
The long straights and wide sweeps of the Shanghai circuit saw 128 passes last year, more than at any other track, and should provide a more definitive verdict.
Once-great McLaren can expect to be on the receiving end, with engine partners Honda under intense pressure after a slow start to the season.
"The characteristics of the Shanghai International Circuit are very different from Melbourne, and its long, fast straights will likely expose the weaknesses in our package more than Albert Park did," said McLaren Racing Director Eric Boullier.
Italian rookie Antonio Giovinazzi makes his second start for Sauber as a replacement for Pascal Wehrlein, with the Swiss team concerned the German still needs time to get race fit.

Amazon.com Inc will live-stream games for the U.S. National Football League this year, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday, marking a high-profile push by the online retailer to attract fans to its Prime shopping and video-playback club.
As part of the deal, Amazon will stream 10 Thursday-night games online for Prime members exclusively. The same games will be broadcast by networks CBS and NBC on television.
Amazon beat out Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc and Google's YouTube for the digital distribution rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Seattle-based company agreed to pay the NFL five times what Twitter spent on the rights last year, which was reported to be $10 million, the person said.
Amazon declined to comment on the deal's price tag.
The deal underscores a key strategy Amazon has to win a greater share of shoppers' wallets: offer benefits like fast shipping and video-streaming so people sign up for Prime and, consequently, turn to Amazon for more of their purchases.
While the Seattle-based company has streamed live events in the past, the NFL may be its biggest stage yet, and reflects Amazon's push beyond its mainstay of on-demand video.
Sports fans are increasingly relying on the internet to watch content at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. Twitter attracted 243,000 viewers on average during its NFL livestream debut last year.
"The NFL was a great partner to launch our strategy and we will continue to work with them to bring great content to our passionate sports fans," the social media company said in a statement.
News of the deal with Amazon was earlier reported by technology news site Recode.

MELBOURNE Australia's James Magnussen will forgo the chance to win a third 100 meters freestyle title at the swimming world championships in Budapest and instead focus on defending his Commonwealth Games gold medal at the Gold Coast next year.
The 25-year-old, nicknamed 'the Missile', said he felt a strong Commonwealth Games field, which includes compatriots Kyle Chalmers, the reigning Olympic champion, and Cameron McEvoy, would offer a better benchmark than the global championship.
“World championships in the year after the Olympic Games, some people come, some people have the year off, like myself," the three-times Olympic medalist said in comments published in The Australian newspaper on Wednesday.
"So I don’t feel like it’s a true test of being back at the top of the sport and I think the Commonwealth Games will really provide that for me.
"I think more than the event ­itself, it’s the competition standard that I will have at this Commonwealth Games (that makes it so important).
"If I can get back to my best and win this Commonwealth Games, I believe there's no doubting that achievement."
Magnussen won the 100m freestyle world title at Shanghai in 2011 and defended it in 2013 at Barcelona but missed the 2015 event in Kazan due to a shoulder injury.
He has struggled to return to his best form since the injury and failed to qualify in his pet event at the Rio Olympics but grabbed a bronze in the 4x100m relay.
Australia's national championships, which double as trials for the world championships, will be held in Brisbane next week.

SAO PAULO Chapecoense beat Atletico Nacional 2-1 in the first leg of their South American Supercup final on Tuesday as the game was marked by memorials to those killed in an air crash before the teams' scheduled Copa Sudamericana final last November.
The match was the first between the sides since all but three of the Brazilian team and their staff perished as their plane crashed on approach to Medellin last year.
Only six of the 77 on board survived the crash.
Organizers laid on pre-match shows and post-match fireworks for Tuesday's clash, which was billed as 'The Gratitude Game'.
Fans also launched one minute's applause in the 71st minute of the game to commemorate those who died.
The home fans, eager to repay the support given to their players and staff in Colombia immediately after the accident, also applauded the visitors' goal, a stunning 25-yard equalizer from Macnelly Torres in the second half.
The home side had gone 1-0 up through a Reinaldo penalty after 23 minutes before Torres equalized 13 minutes into the second half.
Chapecoense regained the lead with a header from substitute Luiz Antonio 17 minutes from time.
The return leg is scheduled for May 10 in Medellin.


(The Sports Xchange) - Golden State Warriors star forward Kevin Durant may return for Saturday's home game against the New Orleans Pelicans provided he doesn't experience any setbacks after missing at least 17 games with a left knee injury.
Durant, in his first season with the Warriors, was diagnosed with a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise in his left knee after sustaining the injury on Feb. 28 against his hometown Wizards in Washington.
The Warriors reportedly targeted Saturday's game as Durant's return date, and he is expected to play in the team's final three regular-season games per ESPN. Durant will start upon his return, but will be on a minutes restriction.
The 28-year-old former NBA MVP is averaging 25.3 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists in year one of a two-year deal worth $54.3 million with Golden State.

The repeal of controversial House Bill 2 in North Carolina has led to the NBA considering to hold the 2019 All-Star Game in Charlotte.
This year's game was moved from Charlotte to New Orleans due to the law that required individuals to use the bathroom that corresponded with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The NBA was outspoken about the law and how it discriminated against transgender people.
Commissioner Adam Silver said when the game was moved that the league would consider playing the 2019 game in Charlotte if changes were made.
A decision is expected later this month.

Boston Celtics small forward Jae Crowder cleared a hurdle when results of an MRI exam came back displaying no structural damage in his injured left elbow.
Crowder underwent the MRI on Monday. He said he doesn't know how he was injured but pulled himself out of Sunday's game against the New York Knicks when he noticed the swelling.
It remains unclear whether Crowder will be available for Wednesday's showdown with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The Cleveland Cavaliers assigned forward/center Larry Sanders to the Canton Charge, their affiliate in the NBA Development League, as the former 15th overall pick continues to work his way back.
Sanders, 28, had not played in the NBA since the 2014-15 season before signing with the Cavaliers on March 13 to provide frontcourt depth following Andrew Bogut's season-ending left leg injury.
Since signing on with the Cavs, Sanders has appeared in two NBA games.

Archie Goodwin and the Brooklyn Nets have agreed on a multi-year contract after the guard signed a pair of 10-day deals with the team in mid to late March, the team announced.
Goodwin, 22, first joined the Nets on a 10-day contract on March 15 and signed a second one on March 25. He is averaging 6.6 points on 57.1 percent shooting, 1.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 12.4 minutes per game over seven games with Brooklyn.

(The Sports Xchange) - Tony Romo was granted his release from the Dallas Cowboys on Tuesday and subsequently retired and accepted a job as the lead game analyst for CBS, the Cowboys and the network separately announced.
The longtime quarterback has been considering his future over the past few months and the television opportunity led to him ending a 14-year career spent solely with the Cowboys.
"We wish Tony and his family nothing but the best," Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones said in a statement. "As an organization, we did what he asked us to do in terms of his release, and we wanted to do what was ultimately in his best interest and in the best interest of his family."
Romo will join Jim Nantz and sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson on CBS' top broadcast team.
Romo, who turns 37 on April 21, is the all-time leading passer in Cowboys history with 34,183 yards and 248 TD passes. He lost his starting job in 2016 after a preseason back injury pushed rookie Dak Prescott into the No. 1 role with the Cowboys. Prescott went on an unexpected run and won Offensive Rookie of the Year, leading the Cowboys to the divisional playoff round where Dallas suffered a last-second loss to the Green Bay Packers.
- - -
The future of Phil Simms at CBS has yet to be determined after Romo replaced him as the network's lead analyst.
One possibility for Simms is joining the studio show as an opening was created when Tony Gonzalez recently said he won't return after a three-season stint.

The Baltimore Ravens traded defensive tackle Timmy Jernigan and a third-round compensatory draft pick (99th overall) to the Philadelphia Eagles for the 74th overall pick in the third round.
Jernigan, 24, spent three seasons with the Ravens after being drafted 48th overall in the second round in 2014. The former Florida State standout has 91 tackles, 13 sacks, three passes defensed, one interception and a fumbled recovery in 43 career games.

- Zlatan Ibrahimovic returned after suspension to rescue a 1-1 draw for Manchester United against Everton at Old Trafford with an injury-time penalty.
Ibrahimovic coolly struck home the 93rd-minute spot kick after Ashley Williams had been sent off for deliberate handball keeping out Luke Shaw's shot.
But United's push for a top-four place in the Premier League still suffered a huge setback with a rare and deft Phil Jagielka goal giving Everton a first-half lead and ensuring them a share of the points.
Jose Mourinho's side, whose form has been so underwhelming recently at their "Theater of Dreams", were facing the end of their 19-match unbeaten streak in the league as luck had earlier deserted them.
England center back Jagielka showed all the predatory instincts of a goal poacher, latching on to a Williams header from a 22nd-minute corner and, with back to goal, holding off Marcos Rojo to conjure up a shot that trickled between the legs of David de Gea.
His first goal of the season prompted an urgent response from United, with an Ander Herrera effort striking the bar, but even with Ibrahimovic back in the team, United were blunt.
There was misfortune, too, when Paul Pogba headed against the bar after the break before Ibrahimovic also had a headed goal ruled out for offside, with TV replays suggesting it had been the closest of calls.

ROME Lazio reached the Italian Cup final despite losing 3-2 to neighbors AS Roma in the second leg of their last-four encounter on Tuesday.
A brace from Egypt forward Mohamed Salah turned out to be in vain as Lazio went through 4-3 on aggregate to face either Napoli or Juventus, who meet on Wednesday, in the final.
Leading 2-0 from the first leg, Lazio increased their aggregate lead when Sergej Milinkovic-Savic scored from a rebound although Stephan El Shaarawy replied for Roma just before the break.
Ciro Immobile put Lazio back in front in the 56th minute but Salah replied 10 minutes later and grabbed a last-minute winner.






- Troy Deeney became the first Watford  player to score in four successive home Premier League games as the 10-man Hornets continued their revival by beating West Bromwich Albion 2-0 on Tuesday.
Fresh from ending a run of four league games without a win on Saturday against Sunderland, Walter Mazzarri's men prevailed at Vicarage Road despite having Miguel Britos sent off in the 65th minute.
M'Baye Niang gave the Hornets a 13th-minute lead, the Milan loanee crashing home a superb shot after being freed by Deeney's nod-on from a long ball.
Frenchman Niang then repaid the compliment soon after the break, his long ball being chested down and bundled in by Deeney for his sixth goal in his last eight league games.
After Britos was dismissed, for a second yellow for a foul on Salomon Rondon, Watford had to survive for 25 minutes with 10 men as Albion piled on the pressure but defended stoically to move into the top half of the table.

AUGUSTA, Georgia Dustin Johnson said on Tuesday that being the hottest golfer on the planet heading into the U.S. Masters means nothing when it comes to trying to tame Augusta National.
The long-hitting American is the favorite to win the year's first major after recording wins in his last three tournaments but no world number one has captured the Green Jacket since Tiger Woods in 2002.
"It's a funny game. It doesn't matter how good you're playing, you can still not win," Johnson, who became world number one in February, told a news conference.
"I've got a lot of confidence in my game right now, especially with the way I've been playing the last few tournaments. But, you know, anything can happen."
Apart from two top-10 finishes the last two years, Johnson has a modest history at the Masters but has never arrived here with his game as sharp as it is right now.
Last year, his dreams of winning were ruined by two double-bogeys in the final round. He tied for fourth, four shots behind winner Danny Willett.
He now boasts all the tools needed to tame the demanding layout, most notably his prodigious length off the tee that will give him as good a chance as anyone of essentially changing the four par-five holes into par-fours.
"I always thought it suited my game very well. It's a tough golf course, everything in your bag needs to be working for you to play well around here," said Johnson, who will tee off on Thursday with twice Masters champion Bubba Watson and PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker.
"The last couple years, I've done a little bit better and I feel like I've had a chance. Obviously I'm playing well coming into this week, so hopefully I can continue that success and I'm looking forward to giving myself a chance to win on Sunday."
Should Johnson, who clinched his first and so far only major at last year's U.S. Open, win this week he would become the first golfer other than Woods to win four consecutive PGA Tour starts since Ben Hogan in 1953.
"Obviously, over the last year or so, I've gotten -- I feel like my game's gotten a lot better," said Johnson. "But I always believed that I could get there."

BARCELONA Two Eldense players have been arrested along with the club's  coach and managing director in a corruption investigation over alleged match-fixing after the team's 12-0 Spanish third-tier joint record loss to Barcelona's B side, police sources said.
A Spanish police source on Tuesday declined to name the two players but confirmed that Eldense's Italian coach Filippo Di Pierro and managing director Nobile Capuani had been arrested.
Di Pierro joined the club in January after being hired by the unnamed Italian investment group which managed Eldense's sporting and financial affairs until Sunday.
Defender Emmanuel Mendy said in an interview with radio station Cadena Ser on Monday that the club's assistant coach, Fran Ruiz, had spoken to him in the hotel before the game about the plot to fix it.
"He asked me if I was in and how much I wanted and if I wasn't in then I wouldn't play," he said. "Fran said this to me because the head coach doesn't speak very good Spanish."
Also speaking to Cadena Ser, Ruiz confirmed the story but said he was passing on orders from Di Pierro.
"In principle the orders came from above, from the coach. I didn't know what to do, I was between a rock and a hard place," Ruiz said.
"I didn't say a word in the dugout, I made no substitutions and I didn't send anyone out to warm up. Then I resigned from the club."
A police source confirmed Di Pierro had been arrested on suspicion of corruption in connection with the 12-0 defeat but had no further information.

"NOT REAL"
Eldense's Mauritanian striker, Cheikh Saad, first insinuated that the game had been fixed on Sunday in a post on Twitter, writing: "12-0 is not real and everything will soon come to light."
Saad was also among the substitutes during the game and told Cadena Ser he found out about the plan from Mendy. He said he was told players would be paid 30,000 euros ($31,965.00) each for fixing the game.
"The coach told me to come on as a substitute and I said I didn't want to. After the game I came close to punching some of my team mates," Saad said.
The defeat on Saturday, the heaviest loss in the Spanish third tier since 1992, sealed Eldense's relegation to the Tercera Division.
A day later the club announced it would not play any more fixtures this season and had cut its ties with the group of Italian investors, although president David Aguilar later said Eldense would honor their fixtures.
There is no indication that Barcelona B players had any involvement with the alleged match-fixing.
"It's a very delicate situation but it's exclusively related to Eldense. Barca B have nothing to do with it and is another victim of this racketeering," Barca coach Luis Enrique told reporters on Tuesday.
"I'm glad that it's being investigated and is being taken seriously."

April 4 - Leicester City secured a fifth straight Premier League victory and increased the mounting pressure on bottom-of-the-table Sunderland with a 2-0 win at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday.
Sunderland manager David Moyes, who has been widely criticized this week for comments he made to a female reporter last month, saw his side succumb to a fifth defeat in six league games after Islam Slimani powered home a 69th-minute header.
Leicester, who have climbed away from their own relegation battle to the relative safety of mid-table, saw Sunderland go close to an equalizer before Jamie Vardy fired home to seal the points.
With eight games remaining Sunderland have 20 points, eight behind Swansea City in 17th. Leicester, meanwhile, climbed to 10th with 36 points.

LONDON, (Reuters)- - Burnley took a big step towards staying in England's top flight after a fine George Boyd goal in the second half gave them a 1-0 win over Stoke City in a dour Premier League clash on Tuesday.
The result lifted Burnley to 12th position on 35 points, eight clear of the relegation zone and one behind 11th-placed Stoke, who failed to score for a fifth successive away league game.
After an uneventful first half at Turf Moor, the night's best action was squeezed into a single minute of action as Boyd broke the deadlock in the 58th minute moments after Marko Arnautovic had come close with a looping header at the other end.
Boyd gave goalkeeper Lee Grant no chance after a dazzling solo run and pass by Jeff Hendrick left the midfielder with time and space to curl a first-time shot from 12 meters into the bottom left corner.

BERLIN Runaway leaders Bayern Munich suffered only their second Bundesliga defeat of the season when they were beaten 1-0 at surprise package Hoffenheim on Tuesday.
Third-placed Hoffenheim, whose 29-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann is the youngest in the league, dominated the first half and deservedly won with a goal from Andrej Kramaric.
Bayern, who have 65 points from 27 games, are still 13 clear of second-placed RB Leipzig, who visit Mainz 05 on Wednesday.
Hoffenheim, who had never previously beaten Bayern in the league, are third with 51 and still on course for a Champions League place while Borussia Dortmund remain their closest rivals, remaining fourth after easing past Hamburg SV 3-0.
Bayern were outclassed in the first half and fell behind to a Kramaic half-volley which goalkeeper Sven Ulreich could only deflect into his net.
The Bavarians nearly leveled with their first real chance when Roberto Lewandowski's strike hit the crossbar.
Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann had more to do in the second half and Bayern nearly snatched an equalizer deep into stoppage time when Lewandowski's close-range shot was deflected wide of the goal.
Gonzalo Castro, Shinji Kagawa and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shared the goals in Dortmund's win, which left Hamburg -- the only ever-present club in the Bundesliga's 54-year history -- just one point clear of Augsburg in the relegation playoff spot.

LONDON Zlatan Ibrahimovic has said that any potential contract extension with Manchester United is dependent "on the vision of the club" as he does not want to lose any time towards the end of his illustrious career.
The prolific Swedish forward, who joined from French champions Paris St Germain on an initial one-year deal, has been the shining light in an otherwise inconsistent campaign for a United side who spent heavily during the close season.
Ibrahimovic has scored 15 times in his first season in the Premier League and United, who sit just adrift of the top four, have become reliant on the 35-year-old's goals.
"Everything depends on what you want and what the club wants and what the vision of the club is because I said from day one that I didn't come here to lose time," Ibrahimovic told MUTV.
"I'm 35, a lot of things have to be settled. It's not like I'm 20 and I have another five or 10 years. I probably have one, two or three years.
"I came here to win. I have been winning but If you want to win bigger you have to create bigger."
Ibrahimovic -- who has won league titles in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France -- was coy about the status of his ongoing negotiations with the 20-times English champions.
"We are talking (about a contract extension). If we are far from each other or close to each other, there is no news. There are still talks so lets see what will happen. I'm open but there is nothing done yet.
"I came here with no Champions League and I came here with the team as it was. It was not a team that was favorites to win but I still came. I came to help.
"I came to do what I'm able to do, I came to make it better. To bring the team to higher views. Let's see what happens."

AUGUSTA, Georgia World number one Dustin Johnson will launch his bid for a maiden U.S. Masters title in the company of twice champion Bubba Watson and PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker, in groupings announced on Tuesday.
Johnson, who has won his last three starts, will tee off in the final group at 2:03 p.m. ET in Thursday's opening round at Augusta National.
World number two Rory McIlroy, who can complete the career grand slam of golf's four majors with a win this week, will set off with red-hot Spaniard Jon Rahm and Japan's Hideto Tanihara at 1:41 p.m.
Australian world number three Jason Day, who took a short break from golf as his mother had surgery in her battle with lung cancer, has been paired with England's Justin Rose and American Brandt Snedeker.
The trio will set off at 10:56 a.m., right behind gallery favorites and three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson, Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello and South Korea's Kim Si-woo.
Defending champion Danny Willett will tee off at 12:24 p.m. along with Matt Kuchar and Australian amateur Curtis Luck.
Former champion Spieth, who was leading in the final round last year until falling apart by dropping six shots in three holes, will set off with Germany's Martin Kaymer and England's Matthew Fitzpatrick.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia's bid for his maiden major title will open with England's Lee Westwood, who finished runner-up here last year, and Ireland's Shane Lowry.
In other groupings, Japan's Hideki Matsuyama will set off with Rickie Fowler and Scotland's Russell Knox while Swedish world number five Henrik Stenson was paired with twice major winner Angel Cabrera of Argentina and England's Tyrrell Hatton.
First off at 8:00 a.m. following ceremonial tee shots by golfing greats Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player will be Americans Daniel Summerhays and Russell Henley, who secured his Masters invite by winning in Houston on Sunday.
Groupings remain the same for the second round, though the tee times change, with those who play early on Thursday going out late on Friday, and vice-versa.

North Carolina made up for last year's title-decider heartbreak by putting together a late run to overhaul Gonzaga 71-65 in the final of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament on Monday.
Trailing 65-63 with less than two minutes remaining, North Carolina ended the contest with an 8-0 spurt to pull clear of their fellow top-seeded opponents.
The triumph at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona came in sharp contrast to the scenes of utter dejection a year ago when the Tar Heels fell to Villanova on a buzzer-beater in Houston, Texas.
"They wanted redemption," North Carolina coach Roy Williams told reporters after claiming his third career national title.
"I told my team with three minutes left: 'If you had told me on the first day of practice that we would be in this position I would have taken it.' What we had to do was play the last three minutes."
Justin Jackson converted a three-point play to put the Tar Heels ahead for good with 1:40 left and Isaiah Hicks added a crucial shot inside.
Joel Berry II led the Tar Heels with 22 points in the victory.
"I wanted to see the confetti fall on us," Berry said. "We came out and competed down to the last seconds but we're national champions now."
SLIDESHOW: North Carolina wins NCAA title
Gonzaga, from Spokane, Washington, lost for just the second time this season in its first ever appearance in a national championship title game.
Nigel Williams-Goss had a team-high 15 points for the Bulldogs. He put his team on top 65-63 with a jumper but tweaked his ankle in the closing 90 seconds, leading to some missed shots down the stretch.
"He's such a warrior, he blew out his ankle and was still able to get to his shot," Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. "The kid is a flat out winner. We got good shots and had the ball where we wanted."
Gonzaga claimed a 35-32 halftime advantage but North Carolina started the second stanza with an 8-0 run as the teams traded the lead all the way until the Tar Heels pulled away at the death.
 
The National Hockey League will not take part in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, saying on Monday that it would finalize its 2017-18 season schedule without a Winter Games break. It declared negotiations "officially closed".
The NHL statement brings an end to years of tense bargaining between the International Olympic Committee, International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and the NHL over the league's continuing participation in the Winter Games.
Unhappy about having to shut down for almost three weeks in the middle of their regular season, the NHL had been seeking major concessions from the IOC, including recognition comparable to that of an Olympic Top Sponsor, for taking part in the South Korea games.
The NHL had participated in every Winter Olympics since the 1998 Nagano Winter Games.
The decision will impact almost every major hockey playing nation with the Sweden, Finland, Russia, United States and Canadian teams almost entirely made up of NHL players.
Some players, however, have already said they would play in Pyeongchang no matter what and the NHL's decision also earned a rebuke from the players' union.
"Players are extraordinarily disappointed and adamantly disagree with the NHL's shortsighted decision," the NHL Players Association (NHLPA) said in a statement.
"Any sort of inconvenience the Olympics may cause to next season's schedule is a small price to pay compared to the opportunity to showcase our game and our greatest players on this enormous international stage."
The NHL's absence will be a blow to the Olympics as the hockey competition was one of the Winter Games premier events and pulled in top ratings, particularly in North America.
The decision, however, has meant the sport has lost a major opportunity to showcase itself in new markets, the NHLPA said.
"A unique opportunity lies ahead with the 2018 and 2022 Olympics in Asia," the NHLPA said.
"This impedes the growth of our great game by walking away from an opportunity to reach sports fans worldwide."

NO MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE
The NHL said they had become frustrated with months of inaction and "no meaningful dialogue".
"Instead, the IOC has now expressed the position that the NHL's participation in Beijing in 2022 is conditioned on our participation in South Korea in 2018," the league said.
"And the NHLPA has now publicly confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the clubs.
"As a result, and in an effort to create clarity among conflicting reports and erroneous speculation, this will confirm our intention to proceed with finalizing our 2017-18 regular season schedule without any break to accommodate the Olympic Winter Games.
"We now consider the matter officially closed."

CONCERN OVER COSTS
NHL participation in the Olympics had appeared in danger after the IOC said it would no longer cover the cost of players insurance and transportation as it had done in previous Olympics.
Last week the IIHF said it had agreed to cover those expenses, estimated at $20 million, but the NHL was unmoved.
For handing over a talent pool with contracts valued at $3.5 billion, the NHL was seeking something akin to IOC Top Sponsor status which would allow the league to market the Winter Games on its platforms.
The NHL decision effectively ends any possibility of the league playing in the 2022 Beijing Olympics.
The IOC had dangled the 2022 Winter Games and a gateway into the China market as a possible inducement to NHL officials.
Last week, however, the NHL showed it was prepared to enter the Chinese marketplace with or without the IOC, announcing the league would stage games next season in Beijing and Shanghai.

ZURICH The IOC said it had not detected any significant abuse of clenbuterol after finding "very low levels" of the banned substance during re-testing of samples from the Beijing Olympics.
The International Olympic Committee's comments on Monday came one day after German broadcaster ARD reported that traces of the banned substance were found in samples provided by members of the Jamaican sprint team at the Games in 2008.
Jamaica won 10 medals in the sprint events led by Usain Bolt, who took gold in the men's 100 and 200 meters.
In a statement, the IOC said that "very low levels of clenbuterol" were found in the cases of athletes from a number of countries and different sports. It said the athletes were innocent and could not give any more details.
Without mentioning Jamaica or the ARD allegations, the IOC said that all values were "in the range of potential meat contamination cases".
It said it "carefully deliberated" whether or not to proceed with the cases and consulted the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
According to the IOC, WADA said that it could not find "any significant and consistent pattern of abuse of clenbuterol in these cases and that it would be appropriate not to take these cases any further".

"FALSE REPORT"
Jamaican officials said they hoped the IOC and WADA would set the record straight with regard to the ARD report.
"I think some of the innuendoes and assertions have been unfortunate, if not outright false, and hopefully these will be corrected by the IOC and WADA in due course,” Jamaica Olympic Association president Mike Fennell told Reuters.
He said his association had not received any official notification from the IOC or WADA about the allegations.
“It is clear that there are many people in the world that want to get at Jamaica because some of them feel that we have been far too successful and we do not deserve to be successful," Fennell added.
"They cannot believe that this little country can produce so many superstars and they are trying to find some way to damage that.
"Our athletes are clean and we respect the anti-doping rules."
Warren Blake, president of the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association, also questioned if the report was aimed "at trying to destroy Jamaica's good name."
"I find it very interesting that the WADA official that they showed in the documentary made no mention of sprinters, but yet still they have extrapolated from Jamaican athletes to sprinters," he said.

BEIJING RE-TESTS
The IOC stores samples for a decade to test with newer methods or for new substances. It ordered re-tests of samples from Beijing in the run-up to last year's Rio Olympics to try and root out drug cheats.
Clenbuterol is a performance-enhancing substance sometimes found in weight-loss pills and is on the WADA banned list.
In 2011, more than 100 players tested positive for clenbuterol during the under-17 soccer world championship held in Mexico. They were also acquitted of any wrongdoing after FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said they were victims of a health problem in the country.
However, double Tour de France champion Alberto Contador of Spain was handed a two-year ban for testing positive for clenbuterol during the 2010 race, despite maintaining that he had eaten contaminated meat.
Jamaica were stripped of the Beijing 4x100 meters gold medal in January when Nesta Carter was found in re-tests of his sample to have taken the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine.
The whole relay team lost their medals as a result, including Bolt.

Dustin Johnson returns to this week's U.S. Masters a different person than a year ago, more confident and comfortable, a golfer with greatness in his sights but some Everest-like mountains still to climb.
Johnson, the newly-ascended world number one, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy are the three clear favorites for the year’s first major championship, though at least two dozen others have a realistic chance of winning if the stars all align at the right time.
But the road to the Green Jacket will lead through Johnson, who ticks all the boxes as the man to beat. Before he is measured for a Green Jacket, however, it would be wise to remember he would not be the first favorite to be spat out by the unforgiving Augusta National layout.
The American, with victories in his past three starts, has a game tailor made for Augusta, prodigiously long off the tee, confident with his irons and short game and a soft putting stroke that seems to be getting better with age.
He also has a good recent Masters record – tied fourth last year and tied sixth in 2015 – and returns approaching a golfer’s usual peak at the age of 32.
“I don't think I've ever gone into a major being ranked number one,” he said recently, before adding to laughter: “Actually, I know I haven't.
"It’s not going to be any different for me. I'm still going to prepare like I always do and go out and try to play the best I can. I played good there the last two years. I'm excited to go back when the game is in good form. I feel like everything is working pretty well.”
While Johnson arrives with a spring in his step, Spieth is hardly looking forward to being reminded of his 2016 debacle, when he endured arguably the worst collapse in Masters history, giving up a five-shot lead over the final nine holes, due largely to a quadruple bogey at the 12th hole.
He missed the cut in Houston on Friday, but publicly at least sounded an upbeat note.
“I made strides in my putting this week, which is something I can take a lot of confidence into next week,” he said. “Putting well next week obviously is important considering I didn't strike it very well last year and certainly was in position to win.”

MCILROY SHARP
While Spieth’s short game and putting are usually second to none, McIlroy has been working to raise those facets of the game to a level close to his ball-striking.
Perhaps only Johnson can drive the ball as long and accurately as McIlroy, whose chances often hinge on the quality of his wedge game and putter.
“I feel like that part of my game is as sharp as it has ever been going into Augusta, so that's a good thing,” said McIlroy, who with a victory would become just the sixth man to win all four modern major championships.
Others to watch include American veteran Phil Mickelson as he goes for a fourth Green Jacket at the age of 46, Hideki Matsuyama trying to fulfill the hopes of a nation and become the first Japanese player to win a men’s major, and Jon Rahm, young, strong and fearless, whose chances maybe be hindered only by his lack of course knowledge in his Masters debut.
Fellow Spaniard Sergio Garcia has the quality to end his majors drought if he can turn back the clock and putt as well as before several near-misses started to weigh him down.
For those searching for a realistic dark horse, keep an eye on Australian Marc Leishman, winner of the recent Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Another outstanding ball-striker, Leishman tied for fourth in 2013, when he played the final round with eventual winner Adam Scott.

AUGUSTA, Georgia U.S. Masters week got off to a stormy start as heavy rains swept across Augusta National Golf Club on Monday with tornado warnings forcing players and spectators off the course.
For the first time in 11 years, opening practice at the Masters was suspended and the merchandise shop can expect a run on umbrellas with more rain forecast for later in the week.
Mother Nature is expected to throw a little bit of everything at the year's first major.
Monday's rain will be followed by hot, humid conditions on Tuesday with more thunderstorms on Wednesday, while high winds and cool temperatures, which could dip close to freezing, are forecast for the opening two rounds of the tournament on Thursday and Friday.
"I wasn't planning on doing really anything today," said American Rickie Fowler, the world's eighth-ranked player. "Mondays for me at a normal tournament are typically rest days.  So this has just kind of been rest, recover and get ready for the week."
The only major held at the same venue every year, experience counts at Augusta National where the learning curve, particularly through Amen Corner, on a gusty afternoon can be cruel to the extreme.
Whether in the opening round or final round, a Green Jacket can be won or lost through holes 11, 12 and 13 as Jordan Spieth learned last year when he carded a seven at the par three 12th.
"It's a really good stretch of golf, especially with the way the forecast is looking for Thursday and Friday, the winds look like they're going to be pretty gnarly," said U.S. PGA champion Jimmy Walker.
"That's a section of the course that gets really tough, especially if the wind swirls. I think if you get through there at even par, you're doing really well.
"Everybody thinks 13 is such a cake walk. It's really not.
"It's kind of one of those trick holes. You think you should birdie it every time and then you walk away with a five."
Briton Tommy Fleetwood was among those able to squeeze in a few holes before play was halted but it was enough to learn that Augusta National is not your average championship layout.
"We play a lot of courses where it's kind of simple to wander around and go, 'Well, you can't hit it there or over there is a good miss and that will be fine'," said the Masters rookie.
"Sometimes it only takes one practice round but this place is very, very different.
"The course can work in your favors as much as it can harm you."

AUGUSTA, Georgia Viewers calling in rule violations and affecting the outcome of major tournaments would be a thing of the past if players competing at this week's U.S. Masters had their way.
World number eight Rickie Fowler and reigning PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker are the latest to criticize the controversial rule a day after American Lexi Thompson lost the year's first LPGA major after a surprising penalty.
"There's no other sport where anybody can call in and say 'oh that was a foul.' It just doesn't happen and I don't know why (golf) is the exception," Walker told a news conference on Monday at Augusta National.
"Nobody gets to call ins and outs in tennis. It just doesn't happen and I think we need to change that."
Thompson had six holes to play when her three-shot lead was wiped out by a four-shot penalty for an infringement that was committed the previous day and only brought to officials' attention by an email from a television viewer.
She incurred a two-stroke penalty for playing her ball from the wrong place and an additional two strokes for signing an incorrect scorecard and went on to lose in a playoff.
Fowler said he was surprised the rule was not changed long ago and that one would be hard pressed finding any golfer who would say otherwise.
"Once you sign your scorecard, that's kind of it. I feel like, you know, it's somewhat like when you look at if something were to come up Monday after the tournament, the tournament's done," said Fowler. "It just goes back to, there shouldn't be anyone outside of the officials being able to make this call."
The impact of armchair rules officials has come up in the past but never has it had such a dramatic impact on the outcome of a major event.
Spain's Jon Rahm, who is making his Masters debut this week after a stellar start to the season, said some of golf's rules are hard to interpret but if it is the right call then one player is always going to be hurt.
"I feel bad for Lexi, because maybe she would have won the tournament if that hadn't happened," said world number 12 Rahm.
"But a 10-inch putt, I feel like, (she) could have left it alone, she's not going to miss it anyway, whether it's a millimeter right or left."

AUGUSTA, Georgia Rickie Fowler recently put an end to an aggravating narrative that he could not close the deal on the PGA Tour and he enters this week's U.S. Masters with sights set on seeing off another dubious distinction.
World number eight Fowler begins the year's first major riding high after a solid start to the season in which he finally turned a 54-hole lead into a win and now wants to shed the label of being the best current player without a major title.
Fowler, whose Honda Classic victory in February was his fourth PGA Tour win, feels his recent putting form will allow him to focus on "offense" at Augusta National.
"I'm making a lot of birdies right now, and that bodes well around this golf course," Fowler, who ranks seventh on the PGA Tour in birdies this season, told a news conference on Monday.
"If I can continue to do that here this week, a lot of birdies, maybe a couple eagles in there, that's going to be something that's going to be very good."
Fowler's opening 80 last year marked his worst-ever round at Augusta National and he went on to miss out on weekend play for the first time in six Masters starts.
But the 28-year-old American is not worried about the same fate this year.
"I just made some dumb mistakes that easily could have been avoided," said Fowler, whose best Masters finish was a tie for fifth in 2014.
"I don't have to play my best golf around here to get it around the golf course and still find a way to score. I know this golf course too well now to really make those mistakes that I did last year."
In his opening round last year Fowler sent shots into the trees, found water, overshot greens, yet he is not trying to erase that round from his memory.
"It's good to remember your bad shots and your good shots," said Fowler. "Being that way, when you end up in a similar situation, if it's a good one, you remember what you were thinking and go through a process and get in that same frame of mind.
"And then remembering the bad ones is also good, as well; understanding what did I do wrong there, what was I thinking, how can I think differently, how do I block, if something (negative) crept in, how do I keep that out."

AUGUSTA, Georgia Spain's Jon Rahm will seek inspiration from the late Seve Ballesteros this week when he makes his first appearance in the U.S. Masters after a stellar start to the season.
The 22-year-old won the Farmers Insurance Open and finished second behind world number one Dustin Johnson in the WGC Dell Matchplay to put himself in contention to become the first player to win on his Augusta debut since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979.
Ballesteros, who claimed the Masters title twice, would have celebrated his 60th birthday on Sunday. He died of cancer in 2011 at the age of 54.
"Seve is my ultimate idol and the name Seve Ballesteros is really important to me," Rahm told reporters on Monday.
"I try to emulate a lot of things he did."
Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal was the last Spanish Masters winner in 1999 and he also donned the Green Jacket in 1994, the year in which Rahm was born.
"For a Spaniard, it's hard to explain all the feelings that come to mind," Rahm said. "It really is a place that seems to suit the Spanish character, the Spanish way of playing."
Rahm has climbed to 12th in the world rankings and really sprung to prominence in a dramatic WGC final against Johnson last month in which he fought back from five down to lose at the last hole in the matchplay event.
"I learned that if I have a good day I can take on the number one player in the world," Rahm said.
Rahm has benefited from a close relationship with five-times major champion Phil Mickelson whose brother Tim is the Spaniard's manager.
"Obviously I've been able to play a lot with Phil," Rahm said. "We all know how great a guy he is and how much he can help a person and how knowledgeable he is in the game of golf.
"The way he studies the game, he thinks about it more than anybody else. The insight he's got, it really is amazing."
The muscular Rahm, who drives the ball a prodigious distance and has the shot-making skills required to win at Augusta, is not short of confidence either.
"If I didn't think I could win the tournament, I wouldn't be here," he said.
"When I tee it up, it's just because I want to win and I believe that I can win."

LONDON Sunderland manager David Moyes faces a possible FA sanction after telling a female reporter that she "might get a slap even though you're a woman" for questions asked in an interview last month.
Moyes, whose side are rooted to the bottom of the Premier League, apologized for the comment at a news conference on Monday.
Reporter Vicki Sparks, who works for the BBC, had made no complaint at the time and the broadcaster said the pair had spoken about the exchange and resolved the issue between themselves.
Footage of the conversation, filmed on a mobile phone, was published on Monday on the website of the tabloid Daily Star newspaper. Both parties appeared to be laughing during it.
Others took the matter much more seriously, however, with shadow (opposition) sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan calling for an FA investigation.
"If you look at the fact that he wouldn't have said that to a male reporter, and I truly believe that, I think the comments and his behavior and attitude was sexist," she told BBC radio.
"With the FA, part of what they have been criticized for in the past is not tackling sexism and other forms of discrimination, which needs to be stamped out across the sport.
"Fundamentally it's a male-dominated environment that women find it incredibly difficult to break into and comments like this do nothing to encourage women," she added.
The Football Association, which earlier announced the unanimous approval by its council of reforms to increase the number of women on the board, said it was "seeking observations" from the north-eastern club.
The comments were made after Sparks asked Moyes whether having Sunderland owner Ellis Short in the stands during the 0-0 home draw against Burnley on March 18 had increased the pressure on him.
Moyes said on Monday: "It was in the heat of the moment, I deeply regret the comments I made. It's certainly not the person I am and I accept it was a mistake.
"I've spoken to the BBC reporter who accepted my apology and hopefully we can now move on.
"If you look at my character and personality it couldn't be further from the truth. It can happen to managers young and old. It can be difficult being put in front of the cameras so soon after the games."

ZURICH The governing body of global athletics (IAAF) said on Monday it had suffered a cyber attack that it believes has compromised information about athletes' medical records.
The IAAF said in a statement the hacking group known as Fancy Bear, which has been linked by western governments and security experts to a Russian spy agency blamed for some of the cyber operations that marred the 2016 U.S. election, was believed to be behind the attack of medical records in February. The hack targeted information concerning applications by athletics for Therapeutic Use Exemptions, the IAAF said.
Athletes who had applied for TUEs since 2012 have been contacted and IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, apologized.
"Our first priority is to the athletes who have provided the IAAF with information that they believed would be secure and confidential,” Coe said in the statement. "They have our sincerest apologies and our total commitment to continue to do everything in our power to remedy the situation."
TUEs are issued by sports federations and national anti-doping organizations to allow athletes to take certain banned substances for verified medical needs.
The IAAF said that data on athlete TUEs was "collected from a file server and stored on a newly created file".
"The attack by Fancy Bear, also known as APT28, was detected during a proactive investigation carried out by cyber incident response (CIR) firm Context Information Security," the IAAF said.
Private security firms and U.S. officials have said Fancy Bear works primarily on behalf of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency. Fancy Bear could not be immediately reached for comment.
The group and other Russian hackers were behind the cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election last year that were intended to discredit Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump, a Republican, win, according to U.S. intelligence agencies. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations.
It was not known if the information was stolen from the network, the IAAF said, but the incident was "a strong indication of the attackers’ interest and intent, and shows they had access and means to obtain content from this file at will".
The attack was uncovered after British company Context Information Security conducted a investigation of the IAAF's systems at the request of the athletics body.
Context Information Security said in a separate statement that it was a "sophisticated intrusion" and that "the IAAF have understood the importance and impact of the attack and have provided us comprehensive assistance."
Last year, Fancy Bear hacked into the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) database and published the confidential medical records of several dozen athletes.
Those included cyclist Bradley Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France winner and Britain's most decorated Olympian with eight medals, who was revealed to have used TUEs before some races.
Wiggins retired last year under something of a cloud after it was revealed he took corticosteroid triamcinolone for asthma, although he broke no anti-doping rules.
The IAAF banned Russia's athletics federation after a WADA commission report found evidence of state-sponsored doping. Almost all Russia's athletes missed the track and field events at the Rio Olympics last year and are likely to also miss the world athletics championships in London in August.

Five players to watch in this week's U.S. Masters at Augusta, Georgia:
Dustin Johnson
Top-six finishes the past two years, but in a different place mentally as he returns with the confidence that comes from finally winning a major, the U.S. Open last June, and taking over world number one ranking.
His wedge play now matches his renowned long game, which should give him the confidence to lay up if he gets into trouble off the tees.
- - -
Jordan Spieth
Has finished no worse than second in three appearances, including victory in 2015, but will have to deal with the mental baggage of his meltdown last year, when he blew a five-stroke lead over the final nine holes.
Arguably the best mid-range putter in the world, has the imagination and ability to execute with the flatstick on some of the game's fastest greens.
- - -
Phil Mickelson
Would become, at 46, the oldest Masters champion, seven months older than Jack Nicklaus when he won the 1986 Masters. Invariably raises his game at Augusta, no matter how he has been playing in the lead-up.
Apart from his three victories, Mickelson has six other top-three finishes. The Augusta layout, with most fairways moving right-to-left, ideally suits a left-hander such as Mickelson, who can play power fade off the tee.
- - -
Hideki Matsuyama
Seeking to become the first Japanese man to win a major, showed his affinity for Augusta with a fifth place in 2015, and enhanced his major credentials with a tie for fourth at the PGA Championship last August.
Was the hottest player in the world from October through early January, with four wins and two seconds in six starts. Has gone off the boil a little recently. Putting is not the best part of his game.
- - -
Jon Rahm
A realistic chance of becoming the first player to win the Masters in his debut since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979.
The sport’s most exciting young player he won the Ben Hogan Award for the most outstanding collegiate golfer in the United States in 2015 and 2016. The native of northern Spain has quickly lived up to his billing since turning pro, winning at Torrey Pines for his maiden PGA Tour victory two months ago. Has finished no worse than 16th in six starts this year.

It took Jordan Spieth nine minutes and 57 seconds to complete the 12th hole in the final round at the 2016 Masters, a short chunk of time that still feels surreal to the man who called the action live for a global television audience.
Frank Nobilo was in the CBS tower adjacent to the 12th tee at Augusta National, describing the action, and the normally erudite Kiwi kept his words to a minimum, aware that the pictures of Spieth’s collapse spoke for themselves.
One seemingly inexplicable bad shot, a chunked wedge that barely made it to the water hazard, let alone cleared it, led to a quadruple bogey and ultimately cost Spieth the Masters.
After the Texan had found the Rae’s Creek tributary with his tee shot, a nine-iron, a terrible mistake, Nobilo expected Spieth would play his next shot from the drop zone.
Instead, Spieth opted to drop in line with where his ball last crossed the hazard line, which meant he could go back as far as he wanted, in this case 80 yards, his preferred distance.
“I’d walked around the drop zone but never considered someone dropping from where Spieth did,” Nobilo told Reuters.
“From that angle he had only four yards in front (from the front of the green to the hole) and four yards right (to the edge of the green). You’re choosing the narrowest part of the green. He was desperate to get away with a bogey.
“He played the ball back in the stance, got a bit steep on it and hit it a fraction fat.”
Nobilo, who finished fourth at the 1996 Masters, recalled it had rained overnight and he suspected that part of the course was a little damp, the moisture exacerbating Spieth's error, leading to the sort of shot that would disgust a 20-handicapper.
Swing instructor Steven Bann concurred.
"That pitch I think is the hardest in golf," Bann, who coaches several tour players and is a director at the Bann-Lynch-McDade instruction school in Australia, told Reuters.
"The fairway is mowed away from the green so it is into the grain and the ground is always soft, being low and near Rae's Creek. Plus there is only 20 feet of green that you don't see all of. Plus you know over the green probably means triple bogey."
Spieth was at a loss to explain it: “I’m not really sure what happened ... I just hit it fat,” he said.
Bann thinks Spieth's previous tee shot into the hazard sent his nervous system into overload.
"Some panic probably set in and his nervous system went into a spin, and the net result was the next chunked pitch shot."
Less than an hour earlier, Spieth strode purposefully to the 10th tee with a five-stroke lead, the back nine seemingly destined to be a victory stroll to a second straight Green Jacket.
“If they could see this, they would cut their rope and go home,” Nick Faldo, on the TV call, said of the other players.
Yet by time Spieth arrived at the 11th tee his lead was only two strokes, and about to disappear completely.
A year later, Spieth will have no choice but to confront his demons at the 12th hole.
"He will have analyzed and processed what happened, learn from the experience and be all the better for it next time he is faced with a similar situation," said Bann, before adding "I think."
Nobilo, meanwhile, will be back in the TV tower, wondering what drama will unfold this year at the hole named Golden Bell.
“I remember thinking I can’t believe I just saw that,” Nobilo recalled.
“Mental mistake, technical mistake, boom it’s lost.”

AUGUSTA, Georgia Danny Willett is hoping to slip under the radar once again as he bids to retain the U.S. Masters title following his dramatic and surprising victory at Augusta last year.
While American Dustin Johnson surged to the top of the world rankings and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama enjoyed a good run of form before recent struggles, Willett has experienced a quiet start to the year.
"We might be able to slip under the radar, which would be quite nice and hopefully let the result take its course," the 29-year-old Briton told reporters.
"There's obviously going to be a few commitments and stuff through the week but in terms of going under the radar, I think it will probably be very similar to last year, even as defending champion."
Willett has not won a tournament since slipping on the Green Jacket 12 months ago a few weeks after winning the Dubai Desert Classic. His best recent results were sixth at the Hong Kong Open in December and fifth in the Maybank Championship in February.
"The game is not far away," the world number 17 said.
"Our run of form obviously has been nowhere near what it was last year and nowhere near what some of the other guys are playing."
Willett shot a bogey-free final-round 67 to win last year's Masters by three shots, taking advantage of a spectacular meltdown by American Jordan Spieth who made a quadruple-bogey on the 12th hole.
Spieth took partial revenge at the Ryder Cup as the United States beat a European team including Willett but the pair have never discussed the Masters.
"Obviously, it wouldn't be in my nature to bring it up," Willett said.
"I'm pretty sure it was a very difficult time for him. He really is one of the classiest guys out there, especially at his age, it's quite astounding in terms of how well he took it."
Willett admitted he struggled to maintain his form last year as he coped with the extra demands of being a major champion.
"Toward the back end of the season the game wasn't where I wanted it to be," he said.
"Being tired means you can get frustrated a little bit easier and that leads you to hit more balls and practice harder and in actual fact all that does at times is make you more tired."
Willett was unable to take the six-week break he had planned.
"We had a lot of things to do when we got back from Augusta," he said. "Then we played in the Olympics and we were in the Ryder Cup and we ended up playing about 32 events last year."
Now fully refreshed, he cannot wait to return to the scene of his greatest triumph.
"I'm pretty sure that as I get even within the area of Augusta, there's going to be a big Cheshire smile on my face," Willett said.
"I'm going to be able to slip my shoes on in the champions locker room upstairs and to be able to go back to Augusta National and defend your first major is going to be something pretty special."

LONDON Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix will expose McLaren and Honda's weaknesses more starkly than last month's season-opening race in Australia, according to Formula One team racing director Eric Boullier.
Double world champion Fernando Alonso ran in the top 10 but failed to finish in Melbourne on March 26 while the Spaniard's  new Belgian team mate, Stoffel Vandoorne, was 13th but last on the road.
"I can predict that we won’t be as fortuitous with our pace, compared to our rivals, as we were in Australia," Boullier said in a team preview.
"The characteristics of the Shanghai International Circuit are very different from Melbourne, and its long, fast straights will likely expose the weaknesses in our package more than Albert Park did."
McLaren and engine partners Honda endured a difficult pre-season with reliability problems limiting their mileage in testing.
The former champions had hoped to take a big step up in 2017, after two years of struggle with Honda in the new V6 turbo hybrid era, but instead are looking likely to go back down the pecking order.
They finished sixth last year after ending 2015 ninth.
While Alonso exceeded expectations in Australia, he has not spared Honda in highlighting the lack of performance compared to rivals with Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault power units.
"We are last in terms of performance," he told reporters in Australia. "In normal conditions on a normal circuit we should be last and second last."
Honda's F1 head, Yusuke Hasegawa, recognised Australia had been tough and agreed with Boullier that another difficult weekend was in store in the second race of the season.
He said, with more than a hint of understatement, that there was "room for improvement when it comes to performance".
"We expect the Chinese Grand Prix to be even more challenging," added Hasegawa. "The race is always a bit of an unknown due to the changeable weather conditions, which affects the set-up and balance of the car.
"The track itself also places a lot of stress on the power unit with its slow- and medium-speed corners, and two very long straights. The key will be preparation and set-up."
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel leads the standings after winning in Melbourne with Lewis Hamilton second for champions Mercedes.

LONDON World number two Rory McIlroy has signed a long-term extension to his contract with Nike ahead of this week's U.S. Masters at Augusta National.
"Looking forward to the next 10+ years as a @nike athlete," the Northern Irishman said on his verified Twitter account.
The world's biggest sportswear maker said last August that it would stop selling golf equipment -- including clubs, golf balls and bags -- to focus on footwear, apparel with the familiar swoosh logo and partnering more golfers.
The company, which built its golf business on the success of Tiger Woods, gave no details about the deal in a separate statement.
"I've loved this company since I was a kid," it quoted McIlroy as saying. "I'm really happy to continue this journey with Nike."
British media estimated, however, that the new deal could be worth $100 million with the 27-year-old remaining free to negotiate with equipment makers.
McIlroy joined Nike in 2013 on a deal that also covered clubs and the former world number one has since won 12 tournaments, including two major championships. He had been previously sponsored by Titleist.
A first Masters victory, and the coveted green jacket, would make him only the sixth player in history to complete golf's grand slam of major championships.

Australia's number two Bernard Tomic will be absent from this week's Davis Cup quarter-finals but the United States will still have a fight on their hands in Brisbane due to the impressive form of Nick Kyrgios, U.S. team captain Jim Courier said.
Kyrgios pushed Roger Federer to the limit in a classic Miami Open semi-final on Friday and beat world number two Novak Djokovic twice in succession in the recent U.S. hardcourt swing.
The 21-year-old firebrand will shoulder Australia's hopes at Brisbane's Pat Rafter Arena, with world number 79 Jordan Thompson retained for the singles while out-of-form Tomic continues his self-imposed exile.
Jack Sock and John Isner are expected to lead off the singles for the U.S. team, who defeated the hosts at Melbourne's Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club in the first round last year.
"Nick has been playing some of the best tennis on tour already this season so he’s in great form and should have a lot of confidence," Courier told reporters in Brisbane.
"So we’re going to have do something special to beat him.
"He's started off probably not the way he wanted to at the Australian Open, going out early, but since then he’s been a house on fire.
"So he’s playing right there, I mean, he's right there with Federer, and (Federer) has been the best player this season, so it’s impressive."
Kyrgios withdrew from last year's Kooying tie with a virus, leaving his replacement Sam Groth and Tomic to be ground down by the Isner-led United States on a purpose-built grass court at the former Australian Open venue.
Tomic opted out of this year's first round tie against an under-strength Czech Republic at the same venue, where Kyrgios and Thompson combined to lead the hosts to an emphatic 4-1 win.
Tomic, though currently in a dreadful run of form, has an impressive 17-4 record in Davis Cup singles and defeated Sock last year before losing the decisive tie to Isner.
Courier said opposing captain Lleyton Hewitt would miss Tomic's Davis Cup experience.
"He played last time we played down here and was awfully tough on us, so I’m sure it’s disappointing for Lleyton and the boys that he’s not involved this year," said Courier, whose team thrashed a Federer-less Switzerland 5-0 in the first round.
"But it’s not something that we know a whole lot about.
"We know that Jordan Thompson will be ready to battle ...  There’ll be no easy outs for us."
The United States, who celebrated the last of their 32 Davis Cup titles in 2007, are bidding to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2012.
A clash against either Italy or seventh-seeded Belgium awaits the winner.

JAKARTA Indonesia hopes to complete preparations to host the 2018 Asian Games by the end of this year, Vice President Jusuf Kalla said, shrugging off concerns over a corruption probe and construction delays.
Indonesia faces "huge" challenges in organizing the multi-sport event, particularly coordination of government agencies, the Olympic Council of Asia said last month, media reported.
A police investigation into the alleged embezzlement of nearly $700,000 from promotional funds also led to two senior officials of the Indonesian Olympic panel being suspended late last year, after they were named as suspects.
"We are optimistic we will finish the main venues by the end of the year," Kalla said in an interview at the presidential palace in central Jakarta on Friday.
"Sometimes there is a possibility for delay and ... if anything happens we still have six months to finalize," added Kalla, who was charged with overseeing preparations last month, after President Joko Widodo raised worries about progress.
Organizers expect more than 30,000 people to be involved in the events, from athletes to coaches, he added.
Held every four years, the games will take place in the capital and the south Sumatra city of Palembang in August and September next year. Athletes from 45 Asian nations will compete in sports from badminton to the Chinese martial art of wushu.
Indonesia last hosted the games in 1962.
The graft probe will not disrupt preparations, however, Kalla added.
"If anything, everybody is being more responsible and careful about the organizing," he told Reuters.

The battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League is likely to go down to the final game of the season, Swansea City manager Paul Clement has said after his club were held to a goalless draw by fellow strugglers Middlesbrough on Sunday.
Swansea are one point and one place above the drop zone, with Hull City, Middlesbrough and Sunderland occupying the bottom three spots.
"I think it will go right down to the final games of the season, if not the final game," Clement told British media.
"And we have to be well prepared and give our best in every individual game we have."
The point earned by Middlesbrough was their first in four games and Clement said only time would tell whether Swansea would regret not taking all three points at home.
"I do not know if it will be a decent point, I hope so come the end of the season," he added
Clement is hoping leading scorer Fernando Llorente will recover from an ankle injury before they host second-placed Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday.
"You do miss him because he's a big focal point," he added.
"He has an ankle issue which I'm hoping won't keep him out for very long so Wednesday is achievable but he's still a doubt for the game."
Spurs, who trail leaders Chelsea by seven points, have won their last four league games, while Swansea are unbeaten at home since a 4-0 defeat to Arsenal in January.


SEOUL North Korea will be allowed to travel to South Korea for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics if it wishes to take part, Seoul's Unification Ministry said on Monday.
North Korean athletes need approval from Seoul to enter the South as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically in a state of war.
The ministry's comments come after Choi Moon-soon, the governor of the 2018 host city's province, said on Sunday that a North Korean sports official had told him the North wanted to take part in the Games.
A North Korea sports delegation is currently in South Korea to take part in an international ice hockey competition in Gangneung, which will host some events during the 2018 Games.
Speaking in response to a question regarding North Korea's participation at the Olympics, ministry spokesman Lee Duk-haeng said there were no sanctions in place that prevented them from taking part.
"On North Korea participating in a sports event in South Korea, if they apply to come under regulations and procedures, our position is to approve it under regulations and procedures," he added.
Seoul has also approved a trip to North Korea by the South's women's soccer team to take part qualifiers for the 2018 AFC Women's Asian Cup.
Group B of qualifying for the Asian Cup finals in Jordan will be held in Pyongyang from April 3-11, with Hong Kong, Uzbekistan and India also involved. The match between the two Koreas is scheduled for Friday.
Tensions on the peninsula are currently high, with South Korea saying late last month that the North was ready to carry out a new nuclear test.

Lexi Thompson was denied a major victory in the cruellest of fashions at the ANA Inspiration on Sunday after she was hit with a four-stroke penalty for a rules infraction the previous day then lost to South Korean Ryu So-yeon in a playoff for the title.
Thompson was leading by three shots when she was informed of a rule breach stemming from the way she replaced her ball on the 17th green during Saturday's third round.
She incurred a two-shot penalty for the breach and another two-shot penalty for returning an incorrect scorecard.
The LPGA said in a statement that a television viewer had alerted them to the infraction on Sunday and that after a review they had informed Thompson of the breach.
“Is this a joke? Oh my God. Four-stroke penalty, that’s just ridiculous,” Thompson said when notified of the penalty.
The American was in tears as she teed off on the 13th hole but gathered herself and birdied it. She then had an eagle putt on the last to win in regulation but had to settle for a birdie and a playoff with Ryu.
Ryu then birdied the 18th, the first playoff hole, to win the title.
"I just ... cannot believe this situation,” said Ryu, who captured her second career major.
“During play, I didn't even check the leaderboard, but I thought Lexi played really, really well.”
Thompson was also looking to capture her second major, having won the ANA Inspiration in 2014.
“I did not intentionally do that (violation). So to the officials, or whatever called in, that was not my purpose. I didn't even realize I did that,” Thompson said.
South Korean Park In-bee, Minjee Lee of Australia and Suzann Pettersen of Norway finished tied for third at 13-under.
Michelle Wie finished sixth at 11-under while defending champion Lydia Ko finished tied for 11th at seven-under.

German World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger scored on his debut for the Chicago Fire as his new team drew 2-2 at home against Montreal Impact on Saturday.
Schweinsteiger, the latest big-name veteran to join Major League Soccer (MLS), made an immediate impact by powerfully heading home a cross from five yards in the 17th minute.
The 32-year-old midfielder was signed last week from English Premier League club Manchester United, where he had fallen out of favor with manager Jose Mourinho.
The practice of MLS teams signing stars nearing the end of their careers has caused heated debate, with some clubs now preferring to focus on younger players with more upside.
But the Fire, who finished at the bottom of MLS last season, decided Schweinsteiger would be a good fit.
Schweinsteiger was a member of the winning German team that beat Argentina in the 2014 World Cup final in Brazil.
He has quickly immersed himself in his new city's sports culture. On Thursday night he attended a Chicago Bulls NBA game with his wife Ana Ivanovic, a former world number one tennis player.



(This version of the story corrects Kang's margin of lead to six shots instead of four in first para of story originally moved on March 31)
South Korea's Kang Sung-hoon, who needs a win this week to earn a U.S. Masters invite, led by six shots after the second round of the Shell Houston Open on Friday while the final Augusta tune-up ended early for a quartet of major champions.
Swedish world number five Henrik Stenson (77), sixth-ranked Jordan Spieth (77), seventh-ranked Australian Adam Scott (77) and South African Ernie Els (75) all missed the cut in the final event before the April 6-9 Masters.
Kang drained a 30-foot putt for eagle on his penultimate hole, the par-five eighth, to go along with seven birdies for a nine-under-par 63 that tied the course record at the Golf Club of Houston in Humble, Texas.
"I putted pretty good yesterday, putted really good today," said Kang , who needed 25 putts over his round. "Plus I teed off first and the greens are just pure, nobody really had them. The putter just kept making the putts."
Americans Hudson Swafford and Russell Henley were in a share of second place after both shotting 67s while first-round leader Rickie Fowler (71) was a further stroke back in fourth place.
Kang, who is ranked 202nd in the world and has missed the cut in seven of his last 12 starts, started his day one shot off the pace and will now try to hang on as he heads into the weekend with hopes of securing his first Masters invite.
"It's not in my head. I'll go play," said Kang. “Whatever happens, happens."

Late-blooming Johanna Konta won the biggest title of her career when she beat Caroline Wozniacki 6-4 6-3 in the women's final at the Miami Open on Saturday.
British 10th seed Konta used an aggressive game plan to overcome Danish 12th seed Wozniacki on the Crandon Park hardcourt.
Konta stuck to her hard-hitting tactics, despite a few hiccups, before clinching victory with a perfectly-weighted lob that landed on the baseline for her second title of the year, after winning in Sydney in January.
“I couldn’t believe it was over because I was so focused, just trying on every single point,” Konta, who hit 33 winners, said in a courtside interview.
“Having opportunities like these to almost get a pat on the back for all that hard work is very rewarding.”
Wozniacki used all of her vaunted endurance to run tirelessly after every ball, but was undone by a weak serve. She was broken six times and won only 30 percent of her second serves, which Konta picked off relentlessly.
Konta, 25, is somewhat of a late bloomer. She was ranked 150th in the world at the end of 2014 and improved to 47th in 2015, but her biggest improvement came last year.
It has been barely eight months since she clinched her first career title by beating Venus Williams in the Stanford, California final, before adding in the city of her birth the Sydney International in January.
“I think the belief has been there since I was a little girl,” said Konta, who will rise to seventh on Monday.
“Everybody’s journey is different. I needed a little more time and a little more experience to accumulate the knowledge that I have and re-use it in my matches.
“I play smart tennis and calmer tennis I think. It just took time. On paper it looks like a quick turnaround but it’s been a long time coming.”
Asked how high she could go in the rankings, and whether a grand slam victory was in her sights, she said: “I think the belief has been there since I was a little girl. I’d like to be the best player in the world but there’s a lot of work to be done between now and then.”


(The Sports Xchange) - Two-time NBA scoring champion Tracy McGrady, Kansas coach Bill Self and women's star Rebecca Lobo headline the Class of 2017 for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
The class also includes the late Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause, former ABA and NBA star George McGinnis, Notre Dame women's coach Muffet McGraw, high school coach Robert Hughes, Harlem Globetrotters owner Mannie Jackson, Black Fives era pioneer Zack Clayton, Greek standout Nick Galis and former NCAA administrator Tom Jernstedt, known as "Father of the Final Four."
"I couldn't believe it," McGrady said on Twitter after being told of his selection. "I had him repeat it again."
McGrady, a 6-foot-8 forward, won NBA scoring titles in 2002-03 at 32.1 points per game and again the following year at 28.0, both while playing for the Orlando Magic.
A seven-time NBA All-Star after being picked in the first round (ninth overall) by the Toronto Raptors in 1997, McGrady averaged 19.6 points, 5.6 rebounds and 4.4 rebounds for seven teams in his 15-year NBA career.
He also played for the Houston Rockets, New York Knicks, Detroit Pistons, Atlanta Hawks and San Antonio Spurs.
Self has coached Kansas to a dozen Big 12 Conference titles and a national championship in 2008. He also coached at Oral Roberts, Tulsa and Illinois, with a career record of 623-193, including 202-10 at Allen Fieldhouse on the Kansas campus. His teams have won 17 conference titles in 17 seasons.
Oregon eliminated Self's Jayhawks in the Elite Eight, 74-60, this season.
Lobo led the Connecticut Huskies to their first NCAA women's championship in 1995 with a perfect 35-0 season. She won a gold medal with the United States team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and played six seasons in the WNBA for the New York Liberty, Houston Comets and Connecticut Sun.
Krause, who died on March 21, was the architect of the Bulls teams led by Michael Jordan that won six NBA championships from 1991 to 1998.
The enshrinement ceremony is scheduled for Sept. 8 in Springfield, Mass.

HELSINKI It was far from the perfect performance they are known for but a slip by Scott Moir could not prevent him and Tessa Virtue from winning a third ice dance title at the world figure skating championships on Saturday.
The 2010 Olympic champions, who had taken a two-year hiatus after settling for silver at the 2014 Sochi Games, had been expected to cap their comeback season with a flourish having earned world record scores in their short dance just 24 hours earlier.
Instead they had to rely on the 5.54 point lead they had taken into the free dance to hold off twice-world champions and French training partners Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron after Moir inexplicably lurched forward having tripped up on their circular step sequence.
The Canadians won the title with a total of 198.62 despite being beaten in the free dance by almost three points by Papadakis and Cizeron.
Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani unexpectedly ended up with bronze after American team mates Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donahue, who had been lying third, surrendered their medal hopes following a fall by Donahue.



HELSINKI Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu's exquisite all-round skating skills allowed him to overhaul a massive 10.66-point deficit as he struck gold to end Javier Fernandez's two-year reign at the world figure skating championships on Saturday.
The so-called revolution by the next generation of men's figure skaters failed to gather steam on the final day of competition, with quad-jumping powerhouses Nathan Chen, Shoma Uno and Jin Boyang coming up short in their bids to overthrow the establishment.
Although Hanyu's Japanese team mate Uno snapped up the silver and China's Jin completed an Asian sweep of the medals, they could not match the grace and precision that the 22-year-old champion brought to the ice.
Two days after Hanyu's gold-medal prospects appeared to be in jeopardy, when a landing on bended knee from his quad Salchow left him trailing in fifth place, the Winnie-the-Pooh fan had his coach Brian Orser banging the side hoardings in celebration as he racked up a world-record 223.20 points for the free skate.
"After the short program I was deeply depressed but my fans helped me to produce this performance today," a beaming Hanyu told reporters after bagging his second world gold with a total of 321.59.
"I demonstrated everything I was capable of, my whole package. I wanted to do five quads but did not have enough energy."
There was no need for Hanyu to take unnecessary risks of adding another quadruple jump to his program because his mesmerizing performance to Jo Hisaishi's "Hope and Legacy" was absolutely flawless.
Woven in with four soaring quad jumps were his intricate footwork, sublime spins and inventive choreography - skills that set him apart from the chasing pack.
After watching Hanyu draw a masterpiece on ice with his blades, Orser was caught mouthing "Wow", and it was a sentiment shared by the roaring Japanese fans who showed their appreciation by hurling an avalanche of Winnie-the-Pooh stuffed toys on to the ice.
Despite the record score, Hanyu ominously declared: "It's great to beat my own world record by three points but I can get even higher scores."
Coming into the final world championships before next February's Winter Olympics, all the hype had been about the number of high-scoring quads the teenaged tyros were cramming into their programs.
On Saturday, a jaw-dropping 47 quads were attempted by 18 of the 24 men who made up the free-skate field.
Incredibly, 24 of those jumps featured during the final 40 minutes of the competition when the top six took to the ice.
Aged 17, Four Continents champion Chen has been the leading advocate of the skill and he was aiming to top his own record of landing five in a single performance, which he achieved at this year's U.S. Championships.
But the perils of the jump, which requires skaters to execute four complete aerial revolutions, was clear within seconds of his routine as he fell on his opening Lutz. He went on to attempt five more quads, but landed only four.
So had the gamble been worth it?
"I don't feel very good about it," said Chen, who finished sixth. "I'm not going to lie. This wasn't the program I wanted to perform."
It was a sentiment shared by Fernandez, who had been the odds-on favorite to complete a hat-trick of victories after wowing the judges with his short program on Thursday.
That earned him a healthy 4.19-point lead over nearest challenger Uno going into Saturday's free skate.
But a fall on his quad Salchow and two further botched landings dropped the Spaniard out of the medals and into fourth place.

NEW YORK The World Series champion Chicago Cubs are on a new mission in 2017, aiming to end another drought by repeating as Major League Baseball's best with another Fall Classic crown in the season starting on Sunday.
The long-suffering Cubbies turned the baseball world upside down last season, ending North American pro sports' longest wait for a championship by getting to the winners' circle for the first time in 108 years.
Now the Cinderellas are favorites to win again and become the first repeat champions since the New York Yankees made it three in a row in 2000.
The Cubs help kick off the six-month regular season on Sunday with an Opening Night contest against long-time rivals the St. Louis Cardinals.
Cleveland’s Indians, who took the Cubs to extra innings of a climactic Game Seven to decide MLB's championship, top a bunch of worthy contenders standing in their way.
Taking over the dubious honor of replacing the Cubs as the longest suffering franchise since their last championship, the Indians made a bold move for a first title in 69 years by signing former Blue Jays slugger Edwin Encarnacion to a three-year $65 million deal.
Along with the expected return to health of talented outfielder Michael Brantley and rotation members Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar at full strength, the Tribe are clear favorites to win the American League Central again.
Cleveland may need all those edges, however, with the Boston Red Sox expected to be an American League postseason force from the East.
Boston’s blockbuster deal with the White Sox brought them dazzling left-hander Chris Sale to join a rotation that includes reigning AL Cy Young winner Rick Porcello and former winner David Price, although he will miss the start of the season due to injury.
The Red Sox will be without slugging designated hitter David Ortiz, who retired, but Boston still boast a dangerous lineup that may get a boost from a slimmed down Pablo "Kung Fu Panda" Sandoval at third base.
The AL West looks competitive with a Texas rivalry looming between the Rangers and the fortified Houston Astros, both looking for their first World Series triumph.
Houston showed they mean business by adding catcher Brian McCann and veteran outfielders Carlos Beltran and Josh Reddick to a youthful roster featuring young stars Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and the emerging Alex Bregman.

CUBS CLOSER
The Cubs lost Cuban fireballing closer Aroldis Chapman, who returned to the Yankees as a free agent, and centerfielder Dexter Fowler, who signed with NL Central rivals St. Louis.
To fill the Chapman void, Chicago dealt for Kansas City closer Wade Davis to mop up for their impressive starters Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta and Kyle Hendricks.
Chicago is banking on the further development of their brilliant young infield of third baseman/NL Most Valuable Player Kris Bryant, shortstop Addison Russell and second baseman Jorge Baez to continue their reign.
Opposition could come from the NL East, where a lively race is expected between the pitching rich Mets and underachieving Nationals.
The NL West once again could boil down to the old Dodgers-Giants rivalry which remains as intense in California as in days of yore when the franchises resided in Brooklyn and New York’s borough of Manhattan.

Kenya's Joyciline Jepkosgei broke the world half marathon record as well as the 10km and 15km marks at the Prague Half Marathon on the way to winning the IAAF Gold Label Road Race in one hour, four minutes and 52 seconds on Saturday.
The 23-year-old, who was competing in just her fifth half marathon, clocked splits of 30:05 and 45:37 to improve the 10km and 15km world records.
"I didn't know I would break the world record today," said Jepkosgei, whose previous best time was 1:06:08 in this year's Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon.
"I only wanted to improve my time. This is a surprise for me. The conditions were good for me because I'm used to training at this time of day, in the morning."
Defending champion Violah Jepchumba of Kenya finished second in 65:22, with Fancy Chemutai third.
Jepkosgei was pushed to her limits by Jepchumba as the pair were separated by one second at the 10km mark, both well inside the previous record of 30:21 set by Paula Radcliffe in 2003.
However, Jepkosgei began pulling away from Jepchumba as her lead grew to three seconds at 15km and she crossed the line with 64:52 on the clock to shave 14 seconds from the world half-marathon record set this year by compatriot Peres Jepchirchir.
Ethiopia's Olympic 10,000m bronze medalist Tamirat Tola won the men's race in 59:37. Kenyans Josphat Tanui and Geoffrey Yegon were second and third.

Norwegian Suzann Pettersen labored her way through a long day to take a one-shot lead after her second round at the suspended ANA Inspiration on Friday.
After high winds halted Thursday's first round, Pettersen returned to the Mission Hills Country club course early on Friday to finish off a four-under-par 68.
She followed in the afternoon with a 69 to reach seven-under before the second round was stopped due to darkness.
"I played really good. I played quite a bit of golf," Pettersen told the LPGA website.
"Just Steady Eddie, just plugging along, hitting good shots, giving myself chances."
Fifty-six players will have to return to the course on Saturday to complete their second round.
A group of six players trail Pettersen by a stroke including Park In-bee and the 2014 U.S. Women's Open champion Michelle Wie, who was only through eight holes of her round.    South Korean Park was at eight-under before bogeying her final two holes to fall to six-under.
French veteran Karine Icher was the first-round leader after shooting a 67 and was also at six-under through 11 holes in her second round.
World number one and defending champion Lydio Ko of New Zealand was at four-under following her second round 70.
Pettersen continued her strong form on the Mission Hills Country Club course where she has seven top 10 finishes.
"How can you not love this place? It's heaven for golf and great surroundings," Pettersen said.
"Just really got to be on your A-game to feel like you can attack this course. I'm driving the ball well so I'm giving myself good irons into the greens."

Tiger Woods will miss next week's U.S. Masters due to his troublesome back and has no timetable for his return to competitive golf, the former world number one said on Friday.
It will be only the third time Woods has missed the year's first major since he first competed at Augusta National in 1995. The four-times champion did not play at the Masters in 2014 or 2016 and tied for 17th in 2015.
"I did about everything I could to play, but my back rehabilitation didn't allow me the time to get tournament ready," Woods said in a statement on his website.
"I have no timetable for my return, but I will continue my diligent effort to recover, and want to get back out there as soon as possible."
The 14-times major winner said he would still be at Augusta National's clubhouse on Tuesday for the annual Champions Dinner ahead of the April 6-9 Masters.
Woods returned to the PGA Tour in January after a 17-month absence following back surgery but has not played a tournament since he pulled out of a European Tour event in Dubai because of a back spasm in early February.
He missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open after shooting rounds of 76 and 72 and shot an opening-round 77 a week later in Dubai.
Now 41, Woods has not won a major title since he clinched the 14th of his career at the 2008 U.S. Open and his form has slumped dramatically as he has battled injury in recent years.
This year's Masters marks the 20th anniversary of Woods winning the first of his four Green Jackets at Augusta National. He also won the title in 2001, 2002 and 2005.

South Korean bobsleigh duo Won Yun-jong and Seo Young-woo have played down the importance of home ice at next year's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, saying they are "good enough" to win gold for their country on their own merits.
Sliders from host nations have enjoyed a competitive edge in recent Winter Games as they have the opportunity to train on the Olympic track more often than their rivals and are familiar with every twist and turn on the course.
Won, the pilot, and Seo, his brakeman, are one of the main medal hopes for the host nation in the sliding events, which will be held at Pyeongchang's Alpensia Sliding Centre.
"The ultimate goal for athletes is to win an Olympic gold medal," Won was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency. "We want the people to think that we won the medal because we were good enough to do so, not just because we were racing at home."
The duo won the World Cup series last year but have struggled this season, failing to record a victory and finishing outside the top 10 in two World Cup stops.
Yun Sung-bin, who is South Korea's sole medal hope in the men's skeleton, wants to let his results do the talking next season as he builds up to Pyeongchang.
During the eight World Cup events of the 2016-17 season, Yun won once and finished as runner-up three times, including the season finale at Alpensia earlier this month, where he lost to Latvia's Martins Dukurs by 0.01 seconds.
"I didn't think I'd get beat at the time, but I think a tiny mistake made the difference," Yun said. "If I continue to work harder, I should post better results. I'll let my times do the talking next season."
The last two men's Olympic skeleton champions have come from the host nations.

A coach at British Canoeing was suspended in December after a formal complaint, the BBC has reported.
An independent investigation into the complaint is still underway, the report said.
"We can confirm that, in response to a formal complaint in December 2016, a member of our performance team has been suspended," a British Canoeing spokesperson told the BBC.
"As a result, a full and independent investigation was immediately initiated. British Canoeing will not be making any further comment until this process has been concluded."
British sport has been rocked by allegations of bullying and sexism in elite performance programs with concerns raised that the push for medals had come at the expense of athlete welfare.


The Indian Pacific Wheel Race across Australia was canceled on Friday after British cyclist Mike Hall was struck and killed by a car while competing in the marathon event, organizers said.
The crash happened on Friday morning on the Monaro Highway at Royalla, south of Canberra, in New South Wales. Hall, 35, who won the 2012 World Cycle Race, died at the scene.
"The Indian Pacific Wheel Race has been canceled with immediate effect in light of this morning's tragic incident," race organizers said in a statement before confirming Hall's death.
"This is a difficult time for everyone involved, along with their families, and their well-being is our primary concern."
The Yorkshire-born Hall had been in second place at the time of the accident. The race, from Perth to Sydney, began on March 18 and was due to finish on Friday.
"I can suggest, given the nature of the collision, an investigation into the circumstances would suggest the rider of the push bike died at the scene," ACT Policing Sergeant Chris Meagher was quoted as saying by local media reports.

Former FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the South Korean's five-year ban from all football-related activities, according to Yonhap News Agency.
Chung, who served as FIFA vice-president between 1994 and 2011, was found guilty in 2015 of breaching the governing body's code of conduct during South Korea's bid for the 2022 World Cup seven years ago, which was eventually awarded to Qatar.
He will discuss his decision to approach CAS at a news conference in Seoul next Thursday.
FIFA's appeals committee had earlier reduced Chung's initial six-year ban to five, saying there was not enough evidence to prove he had infringed an article of FIFA's ethics code covering confidentiality.
It also halved the fine imposed on him to 50,000 Swiss francs ($49,940).


Johanna Konta became the first British woman to reach a Miami Open final when she outlasted American veteran Venus Williams 6-4 7-5 in the early hours of Friday morning.
The clock had ticked past midnight and most of the crowd had long since departed before Konta eventually put away the 36-year-old Williams after more than two hours of attrition on the Crandon Park hardcourt.
The 10th seed will play Caroline Wozniacki in Saturday's final after the Danish 12th seed won an even longer semi-final, 5-7 6-1 6-1 against second seed Karolina Pliskova to kick off the day's action.
"Thanks to everyone who stayed. Good morning by the way," Konta joked in a courtside interview at an almost empty stadium after the pair traded eight breaks of serve in a baseline slugfest.
"To be honest it was so incredibly close, so many back-and-forths in every point of every game. I feel very fortunate I was able to take advantage of a couple more opportunities than maybe her. It really could have gone either way."
The final will be Konta's second of the season after the world number 11 won the Sydney International in January, with the Briton meeting Wozniacki for a second time following her third round win over the Dane at this year's Australian Open.
Konta predicted a marathon final against Wozniacki, who capitalized on her renowned endurance and made fewer unforced errors in wearing down Pliskova, despite frittering away three set points in the opener.
The result exacted a measure of revenge for Wozniacki, who was beaten by the big-serving Czech in the Doha final last month.
"Fitness is something I'm working really hard on every day. It's a huge part of my game," Wozniacki, who completed the 2014 New York Marathon in less than three-and-a-half hours, said in a courtside interview.
"It was definitely a mental grind. Having two or three set points in that first set and ending up losing it is kind of depressing, but I got a good start to the second set and that got me fired up and I just kept playing."
Wozniacki, a part-time south Florida resident, said she considered the Miami Open her local tournament.
"It's extremely special," she said of reaching her first Miami final. "Having a place here and training here in the off season, it's a home court."

SEOUL The South Korean Unification Ministry said on Friday it expects the national women's soccer team's trip to North Korea for an international competition to proceed in a "calm and orderly manner".
The South Korean government approved the team's trip to Pyongyang for next month's 2018 AFC Women's Asian Cup qualifiers in North Korea on Thursday.
South Korean athletes need approval from Seoul to enter the North as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically in a state of war.
Group B of qualifying for the Asian Cup finals in Jordan will be held in Pyongyang from April 3-11, with Hong Kong, Uzbekistan and India also involved. The match between the two Koreas is scheduled for April 7.
A ministry official confirmed they had approved the trip for the South Korean delegation, which consists of 23 players, 18 coaching staff members and 10 reporters.
North Korea provided written safety assurances for the South's delegation to Seoul via the Asian Football Confederation late on Wednesday.
Ministry deputy spokeswoman Lee Eugene said in a briefing on Friday that the “government gave approval considering that the competition is an international sports game held according to international rules and procedures ...(and) expects it to be carried out in a calm and orderly manner, considering the current situation between South Korea and North Korea.”
Tensions on the peninsula are currently high, with South Korea saying last week that the North was ready to carry out a new nuclear test.
The decision to approve the visit comes after Seoul gave the green light for the North Korean women's ice hockey team to visit the South for a competition.
The International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Women's World Championship Division II Group A will be held in Gangneung from April 2-8 and will be used as a test event for the ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.
The North Korean delegation is schedule to arrive in the South on Saturday.


Tempers flared between Nick Kyrgios and Alexander Zverev late in their Miami Open quarter-final on Thursday when a botched line call and contentious decision by the chair umpire to allow a challenge on the point caused both players to react angrily.
The pivotal moment of the Australian's 6-4 6-7(9) 6-3 triumph came on the first point of the sixth game in the deciding set, when a lob from Germany's Zverev sailed long.
The linesman mistakenly called the ball in and Kyrgios, despite believing it was out, decided to try a low percentage 'tweener' shot between his legs before challenging.
Chair umpire Fergus Murphy allowed the challenge, a decision that former player Brad Gilbert called "wrong" during television coverage, and replays showed the ball was indeed out.
The point was awarded to Kyrgios, which left Zverev seething, the German arguing that the 12th seed should not have been allowed to challenge the call after hitting the ball.
Flustered, he lost the game, which turned out to be the only service break of the set, and Zverev gave Murphy a piece of his mind at the next change over.
"You might cost me the match," he said. "You know that. The decision is absolute crap."
Kyrgios, meanwhile, was not happy either, giving the linesman a verbal spray for missing the call in the first place, but settled down to hold serve and finally clinch victory on his sixth match point, earning a semi-final against Roger Federer.

Roger Federer stared down defeat and saved two match points before knocking Tomas Berdych out of the Miami Open on Thursday with a 6-2 3-6 7-6(6) victory in their thrilling quarter-final.
Federer will next face Nick Kyrgios on Friday after the 12th seeded Australian edged German teenager Alexander Zverev 6-4 6-7(9) 6-3 in an evening quarter-final, finally clinching victory on his sixth match point.
Swiss magician Federer had to call upon all his resources of skill, poise and experience to edge the Czech in a third set tiebreak in front of a frenzied crowd at Crandon Park.
Berdych served for the match at 6-4 in the tiebreak but Federer reeled off four points in a row, including two unplayable serves, and secured the win when the 10th seed crumbled with an awful second serve.
Federer conceded he had rode his luck at times to advance.
"I’ve had some tough losses here where I should have won. They stay with you so I’m happy today to have come through somehow,” he said courtside.
"I definitely got very lucky at the end but I think I showed great heart today and I fought. Tomas really stepped it up and it was a great match at the end but one guy had to win.”
Australian Open champion Federer, who also won at Indian Wells two weeks ago, is playing some of the best tennis of his career and appears completely recovered from a knee injury that kept him out of the second half of last year.

'STAY AGGRESSIVE'
The 35-year-old is 17-1 this season, his only loss a surprise defeat to Russian Evgeny Donskoy in Dubai.
Federer has won all seven of the tiebreaks he has faced during his current American campaign.
“I enjoy winning breakers because those are the ones that are going to make you win a tournament or not sometimes,” he said.
“(My thought process is) don’t mess up, hit a few aces, stay aggressive on the return, all those silly things that never work but they seem to be working now.”
In the tiebreak, Berdych hit a backhand winner into the corner to set up two match points, the first on serve, but netted a forehand to squander the first.
Federer saved the second match point with a superb first serve and set up his own with an ace down the middle. The pressure reverted to Berdych and this time he cracked, his second serve landing closer to the baseline than the service line.
Kyrgios is looking forward to facing Federer after pulling out of their scheduled Indian Wells quarter-final with a virus.
“He’s my favorite player, so I’m going to enjoy the moment,” said the 21-year-old, who won their only career meeting, on clay in Madrid in 2015.
“He’s the greatest of all time. We don’t know how long he’s going to hang around so it’s a blessing.”

Rickie Fowler, with one eye on Augusta, turned the other eye to the task at hand, coping with a number of "mud balls" to surge into the first round lead at the Shell Houston Open in Texas on Thursday.
The American ended his day in style, very nearly grabbing a hole-in-one at the 230-yard par-three ninth, his ball rolling past the edge of the cup before settling five feet away, setting up a birdie.
He rolled in seven birdies from inside 10 feet for a bogey-free eight-under 64 and a one-shot advantage over South Korean Kang Sung-hoon, who missed a short putt at the final hole.
Former world number four Fowler skipped last week’s World Golf Championships match-play event, preferring instead to play the week before the Masters.
“I like playing my way into majors and they’ve been able to do a great job here making it as similar to possible of what we may see next week,” Fowler told reporters.
“I love playing here. Just playing and going through the process and getting ready makes it easier when you tee it up Thursday next week.”
Fowler said several of his drives had collected mud on the damp fairways at the Golf Club of Houston, leading to some guess-work on approach shots, with the flight of the ball difficult to predict.
But he didn’t have to worry about mud on the four par-threes, where he could peg it up, making three birdies.
“I was fortunate enough to take advantage of the par-threes and managed my way around nicely with mud balls, as everyone did.
“Yes, the golf course was gettable but tough when you’re playing in those conditions with mud balls.”
Second-placed Kang was poised to join Fowler in the lead, only to miss a putt at the final hole that was officially measured at four feet but looked considerably shorter.
“Unfortunately there were a couple of spike marks and I hit those and kicked to the right,” world number 202 Kang said of his miss. “(Overall I)  putted great today. I’m very pleased with how I played.”
Not so great was Phil Mickelson, the three-times Masters champion who shot even-par 72.
“I played terrible,” he said. “I was just a little bit off, didn’t hit my irons close, hit a few in the hazard, just wasn’t quite sharp.”
Mickelson, publicly at least, preferred to think he had gotten his bad round out of the way.
“I think playing here really helps me get sharp (for the Masters), so I don’t have a day like this next Thursday. I like the fact the course is set up similar.”

HELSINKI The last time Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue turned up at a major global competition, they poured their hearts out about how being in a coach-share situation with their main ice dance rivals left them feeling rather neglected.
So the Canadians would never enter into such an agreement again, right?
Wrong.
While it may come as no surprise that they chose to cut ties with Russian-born coach Marina Zoueva, who had guided Virtue and Moir to the 2010 Olympic title before repeating the feat four years later with Americans Meryl Davis and Charlie White, what is surprising is the camp they defected to.
Back after a two-season hiatus, they are now coached by former Canadian ice dancers Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon, who also happen to be the guiding force behind current  world champions Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron.
Having accused Zoueva of "not being in our corner" during the run-up to the Sochi Games, where Virtue and Moir ended up with silver, should they not have known better than entering another crowded coaching school bursting with star pupils?
Moir said the passage of time has shown him that the pros of training with their number one rivals far outweigh the cons.
"We are very lucky we train beside Gabby and Guillaume but it is a different situation," Moir said as he prepared to return to a world championships arena for the first time since 2013.
"There are times in the rink when we really miss training with Meryl and Charlie. We had a great rivalry and looking back with hindsight and seeing how much we pushed each other.
"Even though we did not come up the ranks with Gabby and Guillaume, it’s very similar."
During the 2010-2014 Olympic cycle, Virtue and Moir tossed major titles back and forth with Davis and White until the Americans embarked on a 22-month winning streak which culminated with the Sochi triumph.
That competition drew a line under the rivalry as Davis and White called time on their skating career, while Virtue and Moir realized they were not done with the sport.
That hunger has carried them to six straight titles since they made their comeback at the start of the season and they credited the training set up with Papadakis and Cizeron for the success.
"It’s motivating to watch younger teams excel," added Moir, who will be targeting a third successive Olympic medal in Pyeongchang next February.
"They’re extremely talented. It does push you. You are always trying to figure out little things. We watch figure skating with a much more positive spin on it."
Virtue, who won the last of her two world titles in 2012,  added: "We feel like we’re right back in our element and it feels like this is where we should be.
"The competitive spirit never left. It also feels fresh and invigorating and a lot of that has to do with our new team and new training location in Montreal."

(The Sports Xchange) - Russell Westbrook recorded the highest scoring triple-double in NBA history Wednesday night, totaling 57 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a come-from-behind, 114-106 overtime road victory over the Orlando Magic.
For Westbrook, it was just another day at work as he compiled his fourth consecutive triple-double and his 38th of the season, leaving him three shy of the NBA record held by NBA legend Oscar Robertson. The 57 points were one short of his career high.
"You just got to want it more than other people," Westbrook said. "I don't think about getting tired. I just keep going and going. I don't think about it. I just think about making the next play, making winning basketball plays. I'm blessed."
The Thunder (43-31) have won eight of the last 10 games. Westbrook scored 16 points in the fourth quarter Monday when Oklahoma City erased a 13-point deficit in the final 3:31 to win in Dallas. He scored 19 points in the final six minutes of regulation to force overtime Wednesday when the Thunder erased another 13-point fourth quarter deficit.
"Russell was spectacular coming down the stretch and the way he closed the game," Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. "Overall, it's just incredible what he's doing now. He played an exceptional second half again. He just has an incredible competitive spirit."
"That (Westbrook's performance) was one of the best," Magic coach Frank Vogel said. "It's tough to rank those over the years, but it's right up there with the best. Give him credit."
Westbrook hit 21 of 40 shots and six of 15 3-pointers. He made nine of 11 free throws.
He led a late rally by scoring 19 points in the final six minutes of regulation, hitting a 3-pointer with seven seconds remaining to send the game into overtime.
Westbrook scored seven points in overtime.
Until Westbrook's 3-pointer, the Magic led the entire second half.
The Magic led by as many as 21 points in third quarter.
"I was just looking at the scoreboard, taking it one possession at a time," Westbrook said. "I don't take this game for granted. I just try to come out each and every night and compete at a high level."

RANCHO MIRAGE, California Golf is getting younger, more global and more female, all to the delight of LPGA Commissioner Mike Whan.
Rather than cringe at the Asian dominance of the largely U.S. tour a decade ago, Whan embraced the global appeal of the game and now revels in the growth during his eight-year reign.
"My first day on this job, I was introduced at Madison Square Garden in 2009 as the new commissioner and when we went to the Q&A session, the first question I got was: 'Commissioner Whan, what are you going to do about all the international influences on the tour?'
"I said, 'embrace it,'" Whan told Reuters in an interview this week ahead of the ANA Inspiration, the first women's major of the 2017 season.
Whan said he told the reporters he would be the commissioner of a new kind of tour.
"Where players come from all over the world, and sponsors are calling us from all over the world and fans want to watch us in seven different website languages," he said, adding that the global approach was challenging but with an upside 10 times higher.
There are 34 official events on the 2017 LPGA Tour schedule with four new events this year including one in Scotland and one in New Zealand. More than $67 million in total prize money is there for the taking.
Six years ago, there were 23 events on the schedule with an overall purse of $41.5 million.
"It’s a borderless game and as a result people from all over the world are finding it interesting whether they’re fans or sponsors or players," said Whan.

YOUTH MOVEMENT
Whan said Lydia Ko, a South Korean-born New Zealander who took the LPGA Tour by storm after winning as a 15-year-old, was "a game-changer."
Ko became the youngest winner on the LPGA Tour, the youngest player to win a major, and the youngest world number one.
"I think when somebody breaks a barrier, all of a sudden everybody realizes that wasn’t a barrier anymore.
"And a bunch of 14-year-olds are standing on tees all around the world."
The youth movement is in full swing in women's golf.
The average age of winners in 2016 was 22.3, and more than 70 percent of winners last year were under the age of 24.
The top three finishers in the Player of the Year award and the top three in the Race to the CME Globe last year were all under 21.
Whan said the trend is fueled from the introductory levels, and that the growth of interest among young girls was the thing he is proudest of.
"When I joined back in 2008 we, together with the USGA, were running a program called Girls Golf, where we introduced young girls to the game in an all-girls environment. We were introducing about 4,500 girls a year.
"So we set a goal of trying to get to 50,000 girls a year by the time we got to Rio (Olympics). When we got to Rio, we were introducing 60,000 girls a year.
Whan predicted that "by the time we get to Japan (Tokyo 2020 Olympics) we’ll be introducing 100,000 girls a year and right now girls under the age of 18 is the fastest growing segment of golf in America."


CHICAGO For all the talk of how the United States has embraced soccer, it became clear there is still some way to go to complete the conversion after newly arrived Bastian Schweinsteiger was asked if he thought his club, Chicago Fire, could win the World Cup.
Chicago is a huge sports city, boasting fanatical followers of ice hockey, American football, basketball and baseball. Last year, 60,000 even turned out to watch Ireland shock New Zealand in a rugby union test. But not everybody has quite bought into the "other football".
Schweinsteiger, who helped Germany win the sport's ultimate trophy in 2014, was facing the media on Wednesday after his move from Manchester United and though he has excellent English, the midfielder was understandably bemused when asked if he felt his arrival might help Fire win the World Cup.
A team official hurriedly whispered that the question must refer to the World Club Cup but while Schweinsteiger was preparing to answer, the reporter rephrased the question, making it painfully obvious he was indeed referring to the most-watched sporting event in the world.
General Manager Nelson Rodriguez stepped in to gently explain to the reporter that clubs do not compete for the World Cup -- a tournament where the United States has featured in the last seven editions, reaching the knockout stage in four of them.
Instead he suggested that Schweinsteiger treat the question as an enquiry about a more modest, but eminently more achievable ambition -- winning the MLS Cup.
"I think in football everything is realistic and I always believe in the team which I play for that you can win the game even if it's against the best team in the world," Schweinsteiger said, presumably not in reference to Fire's chances against Brazil.
"You have a chance to win and I experienced that a lot in my career that everything is possible."
Almost everything.

BEIJING The National Hockey League (NHL) will stage two annual pre-season games in China from this year as it looks to build interest in the country that will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, even as its participation in next year's Games remains in doubt.
Commissioner Gary Bettman announced on Thursday that the Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver Canucks would play exhibition games in Shanghai on Sept. 21 and in Beijing two days later.
The NHL is the latest major sports league hoping to tap China and its 1.3 billion-person market, following European soccer teams and the National Basketball Association (NBA), which is highly popular in the country.
The announcement in Beijing comes as the NHL has yet to decide whether its players will take part in the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
NHL team owners are unhappy at having to shut down the season for two-and-a-half weeks and exposing their top players to injury during the Winter Games.
Recent Winter Olympics have been preceded by the question of whether NHL players will take part, with Bettman saying last week that people should assume the league would not send its players to South Korea.
However, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) has agreed to cover the cost of travel and insurance for NHL players, Reuters reported on Wednesday, in hopes of breaking the impasse.
The cost, which could run to $20 million, was covered at the last five games by the International Olympic Committee, which has said it would no longer do so in 2018.
Bettman did not sound moved by the gesture.
"The expenses that they say are being paid are consistent with the prior Olympics – that is not the issue we are dealing with," he told a media briefing at an arena in the Chinese capital. "We are focused on the disruption of the season."
Bettman said the NHL was committed to growing the sport in China regardless of whether its players took part in the Olympics.
"We first have to deal with South Korea before we can focus on Beijing," he said. "But the point is, whether or not the players play for two weeks in either South Korea or Beijing does not change our commitment for the long term to grow hockey in China."

SEOUL Chinese golfers on the U.S. women's tour may decide not to play in a tournament next month in Hawaii sponsored by South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, a sign that fallout from a diplomatic row between Beijing and Seoul over a missile defense system is increasingly spilling into the sports world.
Rio Olympics bronze medalist Shanshan Feng decided not to play after she and three other Chinese players - Simin Feng, Jing Yan and Xiyu Lin - were informed it was in their best interests not to take part in the event due to its association with Lotte, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
One of the sources said that at least one player received an instruction not to attend the Lotte event from someone connected to China's national team. The source declined to name the player and it wasn't immediately clear how such a message had been passed onto the others.
    However, Simin Feng herself, and Shanshan Feng's agent in China, both denied in interviews that the players were being pressured by the Chinese authorities to pull out.
“The four of us were talking about it a little bit because now it’s such a sensitive issue," said Simin Feng, who is currently in California preparing for the first major of the season. 
    The Orlando, Florida-based golfer, who finished in the top 10 in two Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) events last year, said that she had yet to decide whether to play in the Lotte-backed LPGA tournament on April 12-15.
"I'm really for my country and with the politics nowadays, both countries are not at a very good situation." But the 21-year-old added: "No one really seriously came up to us and said, ‘you really shouldn’t play.'"
Relations between Beijing and Seoul have been damaged by the plans to deploy the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in South Korea to defend against the threat from North Korea. China is concerned that the system's powerful radar could also be used to track Chinese missiles, undermining its security.
    Earlier this year, Lotte approved a land swap with the South Korean authorities, enabling the system to be deployed on a site that is part of a golf course the company owns. The move prompted a backlash against Lotte in China, with Chinese authorities closing dozens of its retail stores following inspections.
    China is South Korea's largest trading partner and the dispute over THAAD has resulted in a sharp decline in Chinese tourists going to South Korea. Entertainers have faced a cultural freeze because of the dispute, with South Korean singers and actors blocked in various ways from reaching a mainland Chinese audience, and dozens of Korean-focused blogs suspended in China.

OTHER SPORTS AFFECTED
    In the sports world, the tensions have affected many sports, including soccer, tennis, climbing, and golf. Chinese players have pulled out of various events in South Korea, according to South Korean media.
    Shanshan Feng, who has won six events on the LPGA Tour, including a major title at the 2012 LPGA Championship, declined to comment when asked about the issue in California on Wednesday.
Ruby Chen, Shanshan Feng's Shanghai-based agent at global sports management firm IMG, said Feng "most likely won't be attending" the $2 million Hawaii tournament, an event which she has played in each year since it came onto the schedule in 2012.
    "Yes she played that tournament last year but she's always adjusting her schedule every year," said Chen.
    Chen said Shanshan Feng, 27, would not play as many tournaments or travel as much this year so that she could stay healthy and prolong her career. The decision was not related to issues linked to Lotte, and Feng had not received any official instruction to pull out, Chen added.
    The two other players, Yan and Lin, both declined to comment.
   
    LPGA AWARE OF SITUATION
    An official at China's General Administration of Sport said he had not heard of the players being told to skip the event and said it was up to them to decide when and where they play.
    The LPGA said players had to confirm their participation in the tournament by next week.
    "We are aware of the situation, which is a complex one, and will continue to discuss with our players," the LPGA told Reuters in a statement. "We fully support all decisions made by our players."
     While the LPGA has been making inroads into China, where it now plays two events each year, in recent years it has had a much closer relationship with South Korea.
    Since Pak Se-ri's groundbreaking win at the 1998 U.S. Women's Open, around 25 percent of all LPGA tournaments have been won by Korean players. Seven of the current women's top 10 were born in South Korea.
    Jon Podany, the LPGA’s chief commercial officer, said last year that South Korean television agreements were the Tour's top source of revenue, while South Korean firms continue to put up large sums of cash to sponsor events.
    This season, South Korean companies such as Lotte and automaker Kia sponsor five events on the Tour, putting up millions of dollars in prize money each year.
    All four Chinese players took part in the Kia Classic, which finished on Sunday, with Shanshan Feng finishing ninth.
    Lotte has been a key sponsor in the South Korean sports arena over the years, plowing cash into a variety of sports, including golf and baseball. It has also agreed to sponsor the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next February.
    The row over the missile defense system also affected a women's tournament co-sanctioned by the Korean, Chinese and European Tours in Haikou, China earlier this month.
    Lotte-sponsored player Kim Hae-rym won the event but Chinese broadcaster CCTV continually shot pictures of the South Korean from a distance or from behind, focusing on her shoes in close-up shots and avoiding showing her cap with 'Lotte' emblazoned on it, according to Korean media.
    It then failed to broadcast the prize giving ceremony, prompting South Korea media to dub Kim the "Faceless Champion".

FUNCHAL When the island of Madeira on Wednesday renamed its airport in honor of its hometown hero Cristiano Ronaldo, all eyes were expected to be on the four-time world player of the year who is adored not only for his soccer skills but also his model looks.
But grabbing attention instead was a bronze bust of the player with a toothy grin and bulging eyes that instantly created a laugh on social media because of its debatable likeness.
"I defy you not to feel better after viewing this picture of Cristiano Ronaldo alongside his portrait bust," wrote one Twitter user, Tom Sutcliffe (@tds153).
"That hideous Ronaldo statue is going to be a meme in 5,4,3...," posted @Agave310.
Another Twitter user deemed the statue "the most gloriously awful bust" of Ronaldo.
The 32-year-old Real Madrid player's girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez, and his mother, Maria, both attended the renaming ceremony of Portugal's Aeroporto da Madeira, now known as Cristiano Ronaldo Airport.
The newly revealed statue holds the distinction of being the second bust of the soccer star and occasional model that has been the subject of online ridicule.
Another statue, also in Ronaldo's hometown, was picked apart for what some saw as glaring obscurities and differences in likeness between the player and his bronzed counter-part.
"For a very handsome man, Ronaldo has had some appalling luck with statue-makers," quipped Twitter user Tom Williams(@tomwfootball), posting images of the two statues side by side.
On Tuesday, Portugal played their first match on the island in 16 years, the hosts losing 3-2 to Sweden despite an early Ronaldo goal.

World number one Dustin Johnson is playing the "best golf in the world" and will start as the favorite to win the Masters next month, Jordan Spieth has said ahead of Thursday's Houston Open.
Johnson maintained his impressive form by winning the WGC-Dell Match Play in Austin last weekend to mark his third victory in as many starts in 2017.
Spieth, who has a victory and two runner-up finishes at Augusta in the last three years, said he would have to be on top form to defeat Johnson at the first major of year, which starts on April 6.
"I think Dustin Johnson is the guy to beat in golf no matter where you are," Spieth said at a news conference on Wednesday.
"If I play my best golf, I believe that I can take down anybody, and you have to believe that.
"But I think that he is the guy that everyone is saying he's playing the best golf in the world right now.
"Major championships have huge weight and I'm not focused on trying to win majors to get to number one any more," the 23-year-old added.
"So, that side of things, getting number one isn't the pressure that I feel, but that's the only way to really take big strides towards him because I don't think he's letting up any time soon."



Rafa Nadal moved into the Miami Open semi-finals with a straight sets win over American Jack Sock on Wednesday, while second seed Kei Nishikori was sent packing after going down 6-4 6-2 to unseeded Italian Fabio Fognini.
Nadal staved off four break points to avoid going down a double-break early in the second set, a pivotal game that set the stage for his 6-2 6-3 victory on the Crandon Park hardcourt.
Nadal's poise and shotmaking came to the fore when 13th seed Sock threatened to take a stranglehold on the second set.
“That was the key of the second set, two-love (down), 15-40,” Nadal said in a court side interview. “With three-zero a player like Jack, you’ll probably be thinking third set.
“It was a double positive thing. I saved that game and got the break back (in the next game). The match was much closer than the result says.”
Nadal could face his long-time nemesis Federer in the final, with the Swiss, who has a Thursday quarter-final against Tomas Berdych, on the other side of the draw.
Federer and Nadal have met twice this year, with Federer winning both times, in a memorable five-set final at the Australian Open and in a one-sided straight-sets fourth-round thumping at Indian Wells two weeks ago.
But Nadal is not looking ahead to Federer, because his semi-final opponent Fognini presents a potential banana skin. Nadal has a 7-3 career record but is mindful he lost to the Italian in a five-set thriller on the U.S. Open hardcourt in 2015.
"It’s like a dream maybe,” said the 29-year-old Fognini after becoming the first unseeded player in 10 years to make the Miami semis.
“This is a big, big tournament for me. I’m happy about my performance. I’m just trying to be focused on my game and do my best.”

Venus Williams beat top seed Angelique Kerber on Wednesday to advance to a Miami Open semi-final against Britain's Johanna Konta.
American 11th seed Williams, who is seeking her fourth Miami title, survived a long first set before she completed a 7-5 6-3 victory over Germany's Kerber on a calm evening in south Florida.
Konta, the 10th seed, had earlier recovered from the brink of defeat to edge third seed Simona Halep in a three-set encounter that lasted two hours, 30 minutes.
Halep was only two points from victory in the second set, but could not put away her opponent, who pounced on the Romanian's evident emotional fragility to prevail 3-6 7-6(7) 6-2.
Williams, 36, whose previous Miami titles came in 1998, 1999 and 2001, will meet Konta in the semi-final, while Czech second seek Karolina Pliskova faces Danish 12th seed Carolina Wozniacki.
Williams, playing in front of a crowd that included her popcorn-munching father Richard, took nearly an hour to take the first set from Kerber, but made quicker work of the second.
Halep, meanwhile, got down on herself after losing the second set tiebreak to Konta.
"It was a really tough match, very high level," Halep told the WTA. "I was so close to winning, I was two points away in the tiebreak, but she played very strong and deserved to win."
Despite the result, Halep took comfort from a solid tournament as she works her way back from a knee injury.
"I'm happy to be here after the break that I had. I'm just disappointed I lost a match I had in my hands. But my confidence is there, the game is there, I just need to play matches."
Her post-match comments were more positive than her negative remarks to coach Darren Cahill after the second set.
"This is my character," Halep grumbled to her coach. "Two double faults at the end of the tiebreak and I miss all the balls."
Cahill told a sullen Halep she was a better athlete than Konta, imploring her to make her opponent run in the third set.
"You can write yourself off but I'm not writing you off," Cahill said. "It's up to you. It comes from within ... be brave in the big moments."
But Halep was completely outplayed in the final set, and she said afterwards her exchange with Cahill was nothing out of the ordinary.
"It's just my personality to be hard on myself. I want to change that in the future. I can say that I'm better than before, and I'm working on it."

BUENOS AIRES The Argentine FA, lacking proper leadership since 2015 and fearful its national team might not reach the World Cup finals without banned captain Lionel Messi, elected a third-tier club chairman and former roadsweeper as its president on Wednesday.
Claudio Tapia of Barracas Central, who play in the Primera B Metropolitana division, was the sole candidate in the election but still needed the support of a majority of delegates, which he achieved by scooping 40 of 43 votes cast.
He will serve a four-year term, but some of the power behind the scenes is expected to be wielded by his deputy Daniel Angelici, who is president of top flight Boca Juniors and was a key figure in promoting Tapia's candidacy.
Tapia, who is also known as “Chiqui” (little one), said one of his first tasks would be to get Messi's four-match suspension reduced and said it was imperative everyone got behind beleaguered coach Edgardo Bauza.
Messi was suspended on Tuesday after FIFA said he had "directed insulting words at an assistant referee" during their 1-0 World Cup qualifying win over Chile on Thursday.
The match officials did not include the incident in their reports but FIFA acted on video evidence and Messi missed  Tuesday’s 2-0 defeat to Bolivia in La Paz.
"(We) will make the necessary efforts before FIFA for the sanction to be ... reduced because it is unjust," Tapia said.
Messi will miss games away to Uruguay and at home to Peru and Venezuela, before returning for their final match in Ecuador in October.

BELOVED ARGENTINA
Tapia said it was crucial to give Bauza backing if he was to help Argentina rise from fifth place in the South American  qualifying campaign.
Only the top four teams qualify automatically for Russia in 2018 while the fifth-placed team must go into an intercontinental playoff against a side from the Oceania zone.
"We must back him ... as well as all the players," he told a news conference.
"We must meet with him to sit down and see what's best (for the team). We must find the way to recover our confidence so our beloved Argentine national team represents us in Russia and does its best possible."
The AFA has been under the administration of a FIFA-appointed Regularising Committee, headed by Argentine Armando Perez, since last June after a presidential election in 2015 ended in a 38-38 tie between two candidates when only 75 delegates had a vote.
Tapia is the first man to win the AFA presidency in an election since Julio Grondona in 1979. Grondona ran the AFA as his personal fiefdom for 35 years until his death in 2014.
The 49-year-old Tapia, who came to Buenos Aires from San Juan province with his family when he was a boy, spent nine years working for the capital’s refuse collection company while playing for Barracas and became a trade union leader and president of his club aged 35.
Tapia has been close to the Argentina team since 2015 and headed the delegation that took them to the Copa America Centenario in the United States last year where they lost the final on penalties to Chile.
The AFA will hope to draw a line under the 35-year reign of Grondona, who died a month after Argentina reached the World Cup final in Brazil. During his tenure the team also won the trophy in 1986 and reached the 1990 final.



LONDON Singer Justin Timberlake has been confirmed as the headline act at this year's U.S. Formula One Grand Prix as organizers seek to build on the crowd-pulling success of Taylor Swift's appearance at the 2016 race.
Timberlake, whose Oscar-nominated song 'Can't Stop the Feeling' won him a 10th Grammy Award, will appear on stage on Saturday Oct. 21 at Austin's Circuit of the Americas (COTA) after qualifying.
Last year's race ended a trend of declining audiences and drew a record crowd of 269,000 with Swift's first concert of the year watched by some 80,000 people.
"Last year did what we hoped it would do, which is not only enhance an already great event but also give us the chance to expose a lot of new people to the sport," COTA chairman Bobby Epstein told Reuters. "And it worked.
"I think where we saw a big change was in the average number of tickets sold per transaction, which told me that families were buying. And so I think we’ll see that continue."
The 2017 F1 season, which began in Melbourne last weekend, is the first with the sport being run by American company Liberty Media, which took control of Formula One in January.
Liberty replaced CVC Capital Partners as the sport's commercial rights holders, with Chase Carey ousting 86-year-old Bernie Ecclestone as commercial supremo.
F1 has long struggled to get a foothold in the American market, so hopes are high that Timberlake's performance can build on last year's successful race weekend.
Bad weather hit the track's revenues significantly in 2015, with Saturday's final practice taking place behind closed doors due to flooded conditions and qualifying moved to the Sunday.
Epstein said COTA would refund 105 percent of the value of any three-day reserved seat ticket purchased by July 4 if more than two inches of rain falls in the 24-hour period before the start of the race.
In addition, the ticket would still be good for the race.

LONDON U.S. Grand Prix promoter Bobby Epstein says it would make sense for Formula One's new American owners Liberty Media to buy some circuits as part of their long-term strategic plans for the sport.
The Circuit of the Americas (COTA) co-founder and chairman whose Austin, Texas, track is the country's sole purpose-built F1 facility, told Reuters he would be happy to do a deal "at the right price".
Speaking ahead of tickets for the Oct. 22 race going on sale on Friday, he added, however, that there had been no discussions with Liberty.
"I do think it makes a lot of sense for them to own some circuits. It would have to be part of any long-term strategy for them," said Epstein, whose race is the only U.S. round on the current calendar, in a telephone interview.
"I see a lot of logic and business reasons for them to own some circuits."
Formula One's previous business model, which the new owners have said they want to change, has been based on television revenues and circuits paying significant hosting fees with an annual escalator.
Austin's annual fee has been reported at around $33 million, with $25 million coming from state subsidies based on a formula for calculating how much economic activity the grand prix generates for Texas.
COTA drew a record three-day crowd of 269,889 last year, thanks mainly to singer Taylor Swift holding her long-awaited first concert of the year on the Saturday night.
This year's race has Justin Timberlake lined up as the headline act.

BETTER OFF
"I think all of the circuits struggle under the current environment," said Epstein. "If they (Liberty) change it and help the circuits survive, are they better off owning the circuits than making concessions?
"Are they actually giving up profitability by not owning the circuits? If they (the circuits) are going to make money from an F1 race, then F1 might as well own that profit."
Several of Europe's oldest circuits, such as Silverstone which has been looking for a buyer, struggle to make money while Germany is off the calendar this year for financial reasons.
Liberty completed their takeover in January, ousting 86-year-old supremo Bernie Ecclestone and replacing him with Chase Carey, who has appointed Sean Bratches as managing director for commercial matters.
Asked directly about the possibility of Liberty buying circuits, Bratches said only that there were "a number of different models that can be pursued".
Formula One is seeking to expand in the Americas, with talk of adding street races in U.S. "destination cities" like Las Vegas, Miami, Los Angeles and New York and treating each race like a Super Bowl with events through the week.
Epstein said Austin had pioneered that formula since the debut race in 2012.
He said the circuit now wanted to establish an all-year Formula One presence and estimated 50,000 people a year could be drawn to the circuit by an interactive garage experience.
"Watch parties", where fans gathered for broadcasts of other grands prix, and track tours were also popular.
Epstein suggested COTA could become the "brand-building headquarters for F1" in North America and a permanent home while other races came and went.
"Since you can’t move this circuit, and you can’t duplicate it, it can always be counted on to be there," he said. "I think the goal would be ‘Let’s get the show on the road’.
"You can rotate it (Formula One) through different cities so that you are continuing to expose the sport.
"It’s not likely that anyone else is going to build and spend that kind of money on a permanent course in the United States."

Five bruised and battered surfers are vying for a $5,000 cash prize for the season's most spectacular wipeout, to be presented at the Big Wave awards in California next month.
The World Surf League has released a video of the shortlisted crashes, including American Wilem Banks falling from the top of a huge wave in California and Chilean Rafael Tapia coming off his board as a massive wave breaks in Portugal.
American Nathan Florence, Danny Griffiths of Australia and Briton Tom Lowe are also in the running for the wipeout prize.
The cameraman who recorded the most eye-catching fall will take home $2,000. The awards will be announced on April 29.

MOSCOW The president of world chess's governing body said on Wednesday that an attempted "revolution" to oust him by falsely announcing his resignation had failed, and that he would serve out his full term and might even stand for re-election.
Russia's Kirsan Ilyumzhinov -- a millionaire businessman and ex-politician who once said he had been abducted by aliens -- has headed FIDE, chess's governing body, for the last 22 years, flying around the world to promote chess.
But since Monday, after a weekend meeting in Greece of FIDE's presidential board, Ilyumzhinov has been embroiled in a surreal power struggle with his organization's secretariat.
A statement announcing he had resigned appeared on FIDE's website on Monday. A letter from Ilyumzhinov saying that was "untrue" appeared on the same site on Tuesday along with a separate letter from Nigel Freeman, FIDE's executive director, contradicting him and saying he had repeatedly declared he was quitting.
Chess and politics are no strangers. Cold War rivalry gave a special edge to the 1972 world championship, in which American Bobby Fischer beat Russian Boris Spassky, and the 1978 contest between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi pitted the golden boy of Soviet chess against a dissident who defected to the West.
In the 1990s, FIDE witnessed a major rebellion when then-champion Garry Kasparov accused it of corruption and set up a breakaway body. But even by FIDE standards, the current machinations are unusual.
Ilyumzhinov, 54, who has in the past beaten chess greats such as Karpov and Kasparov to win a slew of FIDE presidential elections, told a news conference in Moscow he had defeated an attempt at political intriguing and remained in charge of world chess.
"I didn't sign any resignation announcement or hand one over. I'm the current president," he said, adding that the matter of his possible resignation had come up in informal discussions but that he had made clear he did not think he should go unless there was proof he was at fault in some way.
Ilyumzhinov, who has stirred controversy in the West by meeting strongmen leaders such as Libya's late Muammar Gaddafi, said that FIDE officials who had announced his resignation had been "economical with the truth" and likened what had happened to "a revolution to seize the telegraph office."
When asked if there had been an attempted coup against him, he said: "Yes."
Freeman, FIDE's executive director, did not immediately respond to a request to respond to Ilyumzhinov's comments.
In his letter on the organization's web site he said Ilyumzhinov had definitely resigned and that an extraordinary presidential board meeting would be held on April 10 to discuss the matter.
"During the presidential board meeting in Athens, you several times threatened to resign and at the end of the meeting, three times you repeated 'I resign' before leaving the room," Freeman wrote.
Ilyumzhinov was placed under U.S. sanctions in November 2015 after Washington accused him of helping the Syrian government. The chess enthusiast has met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but denies the U.S. accusations.
He said on Wednesday he intended to serve out his full term as FIDE president and would decide next year whether to run for re-election in September 2018.

LONDON Several whistleblowers have approached the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) through a new program set up after revelations of rampant state-sponsored doping in Russia, WADA President Craig Reedie said on Wednesday.
WADA this month launched its "Speak Up" secure digital platform for athletes and others to report anti-doping violations.
"We already have a number of whistleblowers speaking to us, so I am told," said Reedie, speaking at the SportsPro Live conference. He had no details about which sports or countries might be involved.
"The investigations people do not tell the president of the organization what they are doing. And that's exactly the way it should be. That has to be confidential."
Asked whether the world might be facing another big scandal, after Russian track and field athletes were banned from last year's Rio Olympics, Reedie said he did not know but hoped not.
WADA recommended that the entire Russian team be excluded from Rio after an independent report by Richard McLaren, published just before those Games, accused the country of widespread state-sponsored doping.
The IOC rejected a proposed blanket ban and instead let international sports federations decide which athletes should be eligible to compete.
Russia has said it hopes to have the suspension of its anti-doping body RUSADA lifted in November, but Reedie said that could not be relied upon.
He said a decision on Russian athletes' participation at next year's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea needed to be made as early as possible and they could expect an aggressive program of targeted testing in the run-up.
"I certainly want (Russia) to be compliant as quickly as possible. Not having the biggest country in the world compliant poses problems for sport that sport is finding very, very difficult to handle," he said.
"What I think is important going into Pyeongchang is that whatever else happens, there is a very rigorous pre-Games testing exercise," he added.
"I think the pre-Games testing program, which is easier to do for a winter Games than a summer Games because you’ve got fewer sports, will almost certainly be extensive and authoritative."
The chances of Russian athletes competing at this year's world athletics championships in London in August remain slim.
"I think it would be difficult for the IAAF to remove the suspension of Russian athletics while the Russian anti-doping agency is non-compliant," Reedie said.
"My guess is that it would be a struggle to have them compliant in time to allow the IAAF to change their view."

BERLIN The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) has agreed to pay NHL players' travel and insurance costs to try to lure them to the 2018 Winter Olympics but team owners have set more commercial demands, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Wednesday.
The NHL and the international federation have been locked in talks over the world's best players' participation in next year's Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with team owners frustrated by the forced shutdown of the season for two-and-a-half weeks.
Recent Winter Olympics have been preceded by the question of whether NHL players will take part, with negotiations often continuing right up to the eve of the event.
The IOC had covered those costs for the last five Games but said it would no longer do so for 2018. The IIHF stepped in and clearly hopes that a contribution that could run to up to $20 million will help resolve the situation.
For handing over a talent pool with contracts valued at $3.5 billion the NHL is seeking something akin to IOC Top Sponsor status which would allow the league to market the Winter Games on its platforms.
"Because of the interest of the Olympic movement to see the NHL players in the Olympic Games, the IIHF has ensured that the travel and insurance cost of the NHL players will be fully covered, as was the case in previous Olympic Games," IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.
Adams told Reuters talks between the NHL and the IIHF were ongoing but the IOC would not be treating the NHL team owners any differently than other international sports federations it deals with.
"Obviously, this time the owners of the NHL clubs are putting more commercial conditions to the IOC and the Olympic movement," Adams said.
"The IOC has been informed the talks between the International Federation and the NHL are continuing.
"The IOC knows that the NHL understands that the Olympic movement cannot treat the owners of a commercial franchise of a national league better than an international sports federation or other professional leagues with regard to the Olympic Games."
Several players have said they will compete in the Olympics regardless of the NHL's decision and Japanese tire maker Bridgestone, which is both an IOC Top Sponsor and major NHL advertiser, is also trying to help push a deal forward.
"We know that the players definitely want to play and the fans want to watch the best players in the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018," Adams said.
"These Games give the greatest worldwide exposure to the sport of ice hockey. The offer for the two Olympic Winter Games
2018 and 2022 remains on the table and we are still hopeful there will be an agreement in the interests of all."



SEOUL Seoul has given the North Korean women's ice hockey team the green light to take part in an international competition in the South next week, a Unification Ministry official said on Wednesday.
The International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Women's World Championship Division II Group A will be held in Gangneung  from April 2-8 and will be used as a test event for the ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.
North Korean athletes need approval from Seoul to enter the South as their 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically in a state of war.
The ministry official confirmed they had given the North Korean delegation approval on Tuesday and that the visit would take place from April 1-9. The delegation consists of 20 players and 10 coaches and other staffs, the official said.
The ministry said the last visit by North Korean athletes was to take part in the Asian Games in Incheon in 2014.
Tensions on the peninsula are currently high, with South Korea on Friday saying the North was ready to carry out a new nuclear test.
North Korea said last year it had mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile and has been ratcheting up a threat that its rivals and the United Nations appear powerless to contain.

SAO PAULO Neymar shrugged off some rough tackling and a missed penalty to score a brilliant solo goal as he led Brazil to a 3-0 win over Paraguay which booked their place at the 2018 World Cup finals on Tuesday.
It was Brazil's eighth consecutive win in qualifying and, combined with Peru's 2-1 win over Uruguay in a later game, ensured they would finish the 10-nation group in the top four, guaranteeing them a berth at the Russia finals.
Brazil lead the standings on 33 points with four matches to play, 11 points ahead of arch-rivals Argentina, who slipped back into fifth after a 2-0 defeat away to Bolivia without suspended captain Lionel Messi.
The top four teams qualify automatically and the fifth play off against a team from another confederation. Paraguay are in eighth spot on 18 points, behind Peru on goal difference.
The early part of the match was marked by a string of fouls on Neymar but the first big chance was a breakaway by Paraguay’s Derlis Gonzalez, who hurried his shot and put the ball wide.
Midfielder Hernan Perez missed another chance for Paraguay before Philippe Coutinho opened the scoring for the hosts in the 34th minute at the Corinthians Arena.
The Liverpool playmaker played a neat one-two with Paulinho before curling a low, left-foot shot past goalkeeper Anthony Silva and inside the far corner.
Neymar was awarded a penalty after being brought down early in the second half but his stop-start run-up failed to deceive Silva and the keeper saved with a dive to his right then blocked his effort with the rebound.
Stung by the miss, Neymar made up for it 10 minutes later, scampering down the left wing from inside his own half, skipping tackles and driving into the box before beating a wrong-footed Silva with a shot that took a deflection off a defender.
Neymar, who thought he had a second goal when he picked up a rebound off a team mate in an offside position and put the ball in the net, came in for some more heavy treatment from Paraguay,  who hardly troubled Brazil goalkeeper Alisson in the second half.
Left back Marcelo put the icing on the cake with another fine goal in the closing minutes for Brazil, who extended their South American qualifying record with the victory.
Peru's win pulled them within four points of Argentina and kept alive their own faint hopes of qualifying for a first World Cup since 1982.
Carlos Sanchez turned in Luis Suarez's pass to give Uruguay the lead after half an hour but Paolo Guerrero leveled four minutes later and Edison Flores gave Peru a deserved win with an emphatic finish just after the hour.
Uruguay's unhappy evening ended with a red card for substitute Jonathan Urretaviscaya in the 75th minute.

ZURICH Brazil have become the first team to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, maintaining their proud record as the tournament's only ever-present side with a little help from Lionel Messi's foul mouth and lightly-regarded Peru.
The five-times champions beat Paraguay 3-0 on Tuesday for their eighth successive win in the South American qualifying competition.
That in itself was not enough to confirm their participation in Russia but Peru's surprise 2-1 win over Uruguay in a later game guaranteed Brazil a top-four finish.
With four rounds of fixtures remaining, Brazil have 33 points, followed by Colombia (24), Uruguay and Chile (23). Argentina (22) are currently in fifth place, which earns a two-legged playoff against the top-ranked Oceania region side.
Uruguay and Argentina still have to face each other which means it is impossible for both to overtake Brazil.
Argentina dropped down the standings after losing 2-0 away to Bolivia at high altitude in La Paz, weakened by the absence of Messi as he began a four-match suspension.
The five-times world player of the year was banned less than six hours before kickoff for swearing at a linesman in the previous match, a 1-0 win over Chile.
He will now only be available for the last of Argentina's games, a potentially key match in Ecuador.
Russia are guaranteed a place as hosts.

The United States remain in contention for a spot at next year's World Cup after Bruce Arena's side battled to a scrappy 1-1 away draw against Panama in CONCACAF qualifying on Tuesday.
A loss would have left the U.S. anchored equal bottom in the six-team group known as the Hexagonal, but the draw sends them home relieved and still in contention for one of the three automatic spots to Russia 2018.
Mexico extended their lead to three points atop the group with a 1-0 away win over Trinidad and Tobago, a second-half goal by Diego Reyes in Port of Spain lifting El Tri to 10 points from four games.
Costa Rica are second on seven points after a 1-1 away draw at Honduras, followed by Panama on five points, the U.S. and the Hondurans on four, while Trinidad have three points.
In Panama City, teenager Christian Pulisic set up striker Clint Dempsey for his 56th international goal as the U.S. took the lead in the 39th minute.
But Panama were on equal terms four minutes later when the American defense failed to deal with a long throw-in, the ball bobbling to Gabriel Gomez, who fired home from close range.
After the match, U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard considered the result as one point gained rather than two points lost.
"We didn't tie the game, we won a dogfight," he said in a pitch-side interview. "It's tough away from home in qualifying. We had to get a point."
As for the physical nature of the contest, Howard did not mince his words.
"If you watch the game you would shake your head. It's what we've come to expect away from home with all the elements. We're always swimming upstream away from home.
"They're a physical team. This is probably the most athletic team in CONCACAF so it's hard to match them but I thought we did a good job."
Arena, who took over after the Americans lost the first two games of their qualifying campaign under Jurgen Klinsmann, was happy with the result, if not the officiating.
"The referee didn't blow his whistle too much," he said wryly, while conceding Mexico were now likely to win the group.
Mexico rode their luck against Trinidad, who felt aggrieved after a slick first half effort by Joevin Jones was disallowed for offside, though replays appeared to show he had timed his run to perfection.
The visitors had the better of the second half, with Hector Herrera hitting the post with a curling 20-yard shot, before defender Reyes powered home a header from a corner in the 58th minute.
"We knew it would be difficult... but in the second half we found the spaces and I think we deserved the victory in the end," defender Hector Moreno said.
In San Pedro Sula, Honduras bounced back from a 6-0 drubbing against the U.S. last week by sharing the spoils with Costa Rica.
Anthony Lozano bundled the ball home to give Honduras a first-half lead, before Costa Rica equalized in the second half with a Kendall Watson header.

ZURICH Soccer's governing body FIFA said on Monday it had heard nothing official from Diego Maradona since the Argentine World Cup winner threatened last week to quit his ambassadorial role.
FIFA said its last official contact with former Argentina captain Maradona had been when he took part in a draw for the under-20 World Cup in South Korea on March 15.
"There have been no updates from him since then," said a  spokesman, adding that Maradona's relationship with FIFA during that event had been "very positive".
Maradona told Argentine newspaper Clarin last Wednesday he was angry over the Argentina FA's (AFA) decision to appoint television presenter Marcelo Tinelli as head of its national teams committee, which oversees teams from under-17 upwards.
Maradona told FIFA president Gianni Infantino in a telephone call that he would step down if the decision was not reversed within two days, the interview said.
The AFA is currently under FIFA intervention which, Maradona said, gave soccer's governing body the power to reverse the appointment.
Last June, FIFA responded to a financial and governance crisis in the AFA by stepping in and putting it under the administration of a 'normalization committee'.
The committee's main role is to prepare the AFA for a presidential election which is due to be held on Wednesday.
Maradona took up his new role in February, saying: "Finally I can fulfill one of the lifelong dreams; to work alongside people who really love football."
FIFA, meanwhile, said it wanted Maradona to have "a major role in the organization's activities to promote the game across the globe."
In January, Maradona publicly backed Infantino's plans to expand the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams, a proposal which was approved by the FIFA Council one day later.

Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris, a bronze medalist at the Sochi Olympics, is in a Vancouver hospital recovering from injuries sustained in a backcountry snowboarding accident, Canada Snowboard said on Monday.
McMorris suffered a fractured jaw, fractured left arm, ruptured spleen, a stable pelvic fracture, rib fractures and a collapsed left lung on Saturday and had to be airlifted to Vancouver General Hospital, where he has undergone several surgeries.
The 23-year-old, who claimed bronze in slopestyle in Sochi, is expected to recover in time to compete at next year's Pyeongchang Winter Games, where he is expected be a gold medal contender in the new Olympic discipline of Big Air.
The accident marks a dark end to a brilliant season that saw McMorris win three X Games medals and two Crystal Globes, including the Big Air title and another as the overall Freestyle World Cup champion.
"Mark has shown incredible resilience and commitment to recovering from injury and we know that Pyeongchang 2018 will be a strong motivation for his comeback," said Canada Snowboard’s executive director, Patrick Jarvis in a statement.

MADRID Barcelona and Spain have been searching for a player to hold their teams together like glue, orchestrating the midfield as Xavi Hernandez used to do for club and country.
Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara seems the natural heir to Xavi, who left Barcelona in 2015 having retired from Spanish international the previous year.
But although Julen Lopetegui has made the 25-year-old Thiago a key cog in Spain’s midfield, it is significantly harder for Barcelona to bring back their former player.
He left in 2013 for 24 million euros ($26.1 million) and Spanish media reported on Monday that Bayern have quoted the Catalans an eye-watering 90 million to re-sign him.
Barcelona did not do enough to persuade Thiago to stay, with Bayern pouncing to sign a player who was keen to link up again with former manager Pep Guardiola, this time at the Allianz Arena.
“Pep has always had a lot of faith in me, and mein him, so if he was still the coach then yes (I probably would have stayed),” Thiago said at the time.    Lopetegui has long been a fan of Thiago, who was one of the best players when the coach led Spain to the Under-21 European Championship trophy in 2013.
Thiago scored a hat-trick in the final as Spain beat Italy 4-2 and Lopetegui has now made him a key part of his midfield in the senior team, ahead of midfielders including Isco and Koke.
With Xavi retired and his long-time partner Andres Iniesta,entering his final years at the top level, the onus is on the likes of Thiago to assume the mantle.
He started as Spain beat Israel 4-1 in a World Cup qualifier on Friday and may feature in the friendly against France on Tuesday in Paris.
Several of the players from Lopetegui’s U-21 team are establishing themselves in the Spain side, including David de Gea and Alvaro Morata, but to safeguard the intricate passing style that led the country to 2010 World Cup and Euro 2008 and 2012 glory, the midfield maestro is essential.
That is why Barcelona are also attempting to recapture a player who has improved significantly under Carlo Ancelotti’s guidance in Munich, although reports in Germany suggest Bayern are ready to offer him a new deal.
If Thiago does succeed with Spain, Barcelona will have an uncomfortable reminder of what might have been for them — unless they are willing to pay a high price to bring him back to the Nou Camp.

LONDON Niki Lauda has hailed Valtteri Bottas's debut for Formula One world champions Mercedes as "incredible" and suggested the Finn's retired predecessor Nico Rosberg would have done no better.
Bottas started and finished third in Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, with his team mate and triple champion Lewis Hamilton second behind Ferrari's race winner Sebastian Vettel.
"Bottas did an incredible job. First time in the car, finished third, close up to Lewis. He could not have done a better job," said retired triple world champion Lauda, who is non-executive chairman and a shareholder in the team.
"We have the right choice," added the 68-year-old, who told Sky Sports television that the former Williams driver had been top of his list of candidates to replace Rosberg after the German announced his retirement in December.
The 27-year-old was announced as Hamilton's team mate in January.
"I expected Bottas, in a new car with a new team, with the help of the team to get quicker. He did all that. So the whole weekend he was a sensation," said Lauda.
"I don't think he would have been worse than Nico if Nico would have raced here.
"It could have been exactly the same result but he was the first time in the car, which I think was outstanding," added the Austrian.
Bottas told reporters after spraying champagne on the podium that the race weekend had been a "good starting point for the journey for me driving for Mercedes" but felt he could do a lot better.
"I didn’t get everything perfect but it was the first qualifying with the team and this track really hasn’t been fantastic for me ever in qualifying," he said.
"Overall, I think not a disastrous first race weekend with the team but I do have my points I will take, and I can do better next time and I look forward to that."
Rosberg, who beat Hamilton to the 2016 title despite winning fewer races, has said he has no regrets about retiring but nonetheless kept a close eye on proceedings in Melbourne.
The German posted photographs on his Twitter account of himself, his wife and daughter watching the race from his Monaco apartment.
"Respect to all of you who always get up so early on Sunday mornings," he said. "I'm excited to watch it, first time in 11 years now in front of the TV, so that's a massive different experience."
He later sent a message of congratulations to Vettel and Ferrari.

MOSCOW The Russian head of world chess's governing body FIDE said on Monday he was the victim of a plot to oust him but denied a report by his own organization that he had resigned.
The statement on the FIDE website said Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, its president since 1995, had announced his resignation on Sunday at the end of a federation board meeting in Greece.
But Russia's TASS news agency quoted Ilyumzhinov as saying: "They wanted to oust me but it didn't work. I haven't signed anything and I'm not resigning. I think there is an American hand in this, and I think it's called a set-up."
When asked in an email exchange with Reuters if he could clarify the situation, FIDE Executive Director Nigel Freeman only repeated the organization's earlier statement. Regarding Ilyumzhinov's allegations of a plot, Freeman said he could not comment further.
Ilyumzhinov is a former head of the Russian semi-autonomous republic of Kalmykia. He has said he was abducted by aliens in 1997 and returned to Earth after a trip around a star.
He was re-elected as FIDE president in 2014, defeating former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, who is one of the harshest critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In 2015, the U.S. government included Ilyumzhinov on a list of people subject to financial sanctions for providing support to the administration of Russian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels trying to oust him.
Washington alleged Ilyumzhinov had business ties to people who have worked with Assad's administration. Ilyumzhinov denied doing anything illegal and said he would challenge the U.S. government's ruling.

LONDON Lewis Hamilton lost a battle but regained a rival after Sebastian Vettel won Sunday's Australian season-opener for Ferrari.
The outcome raised hopes of a genuine title tussle between the two dominant Formula One drivers of the past decade, even if overtaking opportunities were thin on the ground.
The first Ferrari victory since 2015 made Vettel, a four-times world champion with Red Bull, the only non-Mercedes driver to have led the standings since the V6 turbo hybrid power units were introduced in 2014.
Over the past three years, triple world champion Hamilton has had only his team mate, the now-retired 2016 title winner Nico Rosberg, and reliability to worry about with Mercedes winning 51 of 59 races up to Melbourne.
If Hamilton, winner of 10 races last year, was disappointed not to make a winning start to the campaign, the Briton also sounded enthused by the new challenge.
"You are seeing the best against the best," he told reporters.
"I am really grateful to have that fight with him (Vettel),"  continued the 32-year-old, who won his first title with McLaren in 2008. "Finally we can have an actual race. It's going to be close... it's great to see Ferrari there."
Between them, Hamilton and Vettel have won seven of the last nine championships. Only Britain's Jenson Button, in 2009, and Germany's Rosberg last season interrupted their success.

HARD SLOG
But they have yet to race each other as main contenders for the crown, Red Bull and Ferrari waning as Mercedes entered an era of engine domination just as McLaren had faded away previously.
"It's been a privilege to be racing in an era with him and now finally at a period of time when we can actually have a real race," said Hamilton, who finished second after starting on pole with Vettel alongside.
"I wish we could race a lot closer in the cars that we have today, but still I think the fact that we are similar pace-wise, it's going to be a very, very hard slog this season.
"Racing the best is what Formula One is all about and ultimately makes you work that much harder, having to raise the bar and I'm looking forward to that."
Vettel, who joined Ferrari in 2015 after four successive titles with Red Bull, has 43 career wins to Hamilton's 53 but every hope of closing the gap.
"Right now it looks like we have equal machinery," Vettel said.
"I hope it stays that way and then we will see how it turns out, but it's obviously a lot of fun to race for victories and a lot of fun to race against the best."

World number one Andy Murray is likely to miss Great Britain's Davis Cup quarter-final trip to France due to an elbow injury, his brother Jamie Murray has said.
Three-times grand slam winner Murray, who pulled out of the ongoing Miami Masters after sustaining an elbow problem in training, is expected to be left out of the Great Britain squad, which will be announced on Tuesday.
"It's some sort of tear in his elbow, so he needs to rest. He said he can do everything except serve and he told me that rest was all he had to do," Jamie told British media.
"I am not planning that he is going to be there (in France) but, if he is, then obviously that is great for the team and we'll see what happens.
"But the most important thing for him is just to get healthy ... He just needs to get a bit settled and get a good crack at it over the next three months because there are a lot of big tournaments to play."
Murray is also not expected to make the Monte Carlo Masters beginning on April 17.

Jon Rahm blamed a loud noise, reported as a slamming portable toilet door, for a poor chip shot at the final hole that cost him a chance of forcing extra holes in his final against Dustin Johnson at the WGC-Dell Match Play on Sunday.
Rahm was just starting his backswing for the 80-foot shot at Austin Country Club in Texas when a sudden noise reverberated across the green.
The 22-year-old Spaniard continued with his swing but hit the ball fat and he reacted in disgust when it stopped barely halfway to the hole.
“That’s absolutely why I missed it,” Rahm told Golf Channel, referring to the noise, which NBC television said was a portable toilet door banging.
“I lost focus with my head, chunked it and left it short. That’s absolutely what happened.”
Rahm never expected to hit his chip to tap-in distance, because he had to negotiate a ridge and a downhill slope but he expected to get it much closer than 30 feet.
“'Gimme' distance was impossible, but 10, 12, 15 feet for birdie is what I had in mind ... and for that to happen is just unfortunate.”
Rahm missed his long birdie putt, halving the hole with Johnson, who escaped with a 1-up victory in the World Golf Championships event.
Despite the disappointment, another strong week cemented long-hitting Rahm’s reputation as one of the game's rising talents and an intriguing prospect for his Masters debut in two weeks.
Since his maiden PGA Tour victory at Torrey Pines in southern California two months ago, he has finished 16th, fifth, third and second.
He is projected to jump from 26th to 14th when the world rankings are updated on Monday.
 
South Korean Lee Mi-rim turned a close Kia Classic into a procession, charging clear for a six-stroke victory in Carslbad, California on Sunday.
Starting the day one-stroke in front, Lee birdied all five odd-numbered holes on the front nine en route to a seven-under-par 65 on the Aviara course.
Her 20-under 268 total matched the tournament record low set by Cristie Kerr in 2015, when Lee finished runner-up.
"It’s been a long time to be winner of the tournament,” Lee told reporters via a translator after clinching her third LPGA victory at the age of 26.
“So I (was) kind of nervous before I started. But I tried to focus and then it gave me a good result.”
Fellow South Korean Ryu So-yeon and American Austin Ernst tied for second on 14-under in the final tune-up for players before the first major of the season, the ANA Inspiration starting on Thursday.


Rafa Nadal celebrated his 1,000th tour level match with a come-from-behind victory over German veteran Philipp Kohlschreiber to reach the fourth round of the Miami Open on Sunday.
World number 31 Kohlschreiber was on fire early, ripping through the first set in only 21 minutes but fifth seed Nadal flipped the switch and turned the match on its head to prevail 0-6 6-2 6-3 on the main stadium hard court at Crandon Park.
It was the first time Nadal had failed to win a game in the first set of an ATP tour match since 2008, the ATP said.
The 30-year-old Spaniard ignited the near-capacity crowd with a typically determined comeback to clinch his 822nd career victory.
He joins a small group of 11 players headed by Jimmy Connors (1,535) to have played at least 1,000 matches.
"One thousand matches is a lot of matches. Obviously that's good news because that says I am having a long career," Nadal told reporters.
"During a lot of years, I heard that I'm going to have a short career, so it's something important for me. I remember the first match very well because it was at home in Mallorca. It was my first victory on the ATP and was a great feeling."
Nadal said he had not done much wrong in the first set against an opponent who was in the zone.
"He was doing everything good, so that's sport. I lose the set because he was playing too good. That's it.
"But a match is long and the positive thing is I held the pressure well this afternoon after a very tough first set. I resisted well in the first few games of the second set and then I think I played a great second and third set."
While Nadal played in the relative comfort of the late afternoon, Kei Nishikori also took three sets and nearly three hours to advance under a high noon sun, outlasting Spain's Fernando Verdasco 7-6(2) 6-7(5) 6-1.
Nishikori, the runner-up to Novak Djokovic last year, fired 37 winners but Verdasco, aided by persistent swirling winds, used his varying pace and depth to rattle Japan's number one, inducing 48 unforced errors.
Milos Raonic withdrew before his match against American qualifier Jared Donaldson, blaming a persistent hamstring injury.
"It's related to the previous injury I sustained almost four weeks ago... in Delray Beach," the Canadian told reporters.
Raonic said he would not return to the tour until he felt 100 percent fit.
"That could be in two weeks, that could be a little bit longer."

MELBOURNE Mercedes' three-year domination of Formula One looked on shaky ground on Sunday as the Silver Arrows' confidence was rocked by Ferrari pace and a Sebastian Vettel victory in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.
Bookmakers had pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton as a heavy favorite to win at Albert Park but the Briton finished runner-up, nearly 10 seconds behind Vettel after complaining of poor grip on the lakeside circuit.
Hamilton's frustrations were shared in the team garage where Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff pounded his fist on a desk in rage after Vettel snuck in front of the Briton when re-joining the race from a pit-stop.
The German then burned away for a dominant win that has raised hopes of a genuine challenge to the Mercedes team that has swept the drivers' and constructors' championships for the last three years running.
Three-times champion Hamilton had declared Ferrari the "quickest" after winter testing and his forecast of a title fight with the Italian glamor team appeared right on the mark.
"I don’t lie. And I’m not really good at bluffing or playing poker," he said.
"I didn’t know how quick they were going to be in the race. The pace they showed in testing was true and today their speed in that first stint on ultra soft tires was fantastic.
"My real strength wasn’t until right at the end of the race but it was far too late by then."
Wolff was also convinced Ferrari had the quicker car and saw testing times ahead for a team that has largely raced itself for three years.
"Some you win, some you lose and today the Ferrari was the quicker car. And it put us under pressure straight from the beginning, and that’s how we lost it," said the Austrian.
"It’s going to be very close, there’s no big margins between the teams and also between our two team mates. It’s going to be a more stressful season than in the past but personality-building."
Valtteri Bottas, who took champion Nico Rosberg's vacant seat following the German's shock retirement last season, was third on his Mercedes debut but the focused Finn was hardly  jumping for joy.
"I struggled quite a lot with the ultra soft tires, I felt I was sliding around, missing some front and rear grip," he said at the post-race media conference.
"It wasn’t a disaster but I will have my points that I will take.
"I think it’s going to be a big challenge, we need to work really hard if we want to beat (Ferrari). They were quicker today, no doubt."


MELBOURNE Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne hailed their winning start to the Formula One season on Sunday by saying it was "about time", and reminded the team that they still had a long way to go.
Sebastian Vettel's Australian Grand Prix victory on Sunday was the team's first race win since September 2015.
It was also the first time since 2010, with Fernando Alonso in Bahrain, that the sport's oldest and most successful team had won a season-opening race. Ferrari last won in Australia with Kimi Raikkonen in 2007.
"It was about time. I am delighted for the team and for our tifosi (fans) who stood by us throughout this whole period. We've been waiting for this victory for almost a year and a half," said Marchionne in a statement.
"Hearing the Italian national anthem again was very moving," he continued.
"Now, however, it is absolutely essential to remember that this is not the destination but the first step on a long road that must see us all focused on improving each and every day."
Ferrari, celebrating the 70th anniversary this year of founder Enzo Ferrari's first race car, have not won a championship since their constructors' success of 2008.
The last driver to win a title in Ferrari red was Raikkonen in 2007.
After drawing a blank in 2016, when Mercedes wrapped up both titles for the third year in a row, Ferrari were hurting.
Strategy calls went awry, four-times world champion Vettel stood out more for his explosive outbursts over the team radio and there was talk of a 'climate of fear' at the Maranello factory.
Sunday was a day when it all went right, the strategy was spot-on and Vettel had recovered his boyish smile and that famous raised single finger to signify number one.
"It's a great relief for everyone. It's been tough the last couple of months," said the German after his fourth win for the team since joining from Red Bull in 2015.
Ferrari's head of racing activities Jock Clear, who joined from Mercedes, said it was a good feeling.
"To win in red, it's got to be the dream, hasn't it?," he told Sky Sports television. "This is Italian. This is just what it's all about."

MELBOURNE A tough week for Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo ended in despair on Sunday as the home hero came to a stop midway through the Australian Grand Prix with smoke billowing out of his car.
Ricciardo's hopes of a maiden podium at Albert Park were already razor-thin after a crash during qualifying on Saturday, which forced a gearbox change and resulted in a five-place penalty, leaving him 15th on the grid.
But even getting to the grid proved beyond his Red Bull, which stopped with a gearbox sensor problem as he lapped the lakeside circuit before the start.
Ricciardo exited the track fuming but was soon lowering himself into the seat again as technicians frantically worked on his car in the garage as the clock ticked down to the start.
He eventually joined the race from the pit-lane two laps behind the other cars but lasted just 25 laps before his car finally ground to a terminal halt at turn three with an apparent fuel pressure problem.
It takes a lot to wipe the smile from the affable 27-year-old's face but he cut a grim figure in the garage as he watched the rest of the race, won by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
Having endured an exhausting week of media and sponsor events as his nation's great hope in motor sport, Ricciardo had little joy from his car during practice and qualifying, and he could not wait to be shot of Melbourne.
"On the plus side, I'm getting out of here," Ricciardo, who initially finished second in Melbourne in 2014 but was later disqualified for a fuel limit infringement, told reporters.
"It's been a long week. Don't get me wrong, it's been fun.
"I feel bad for everyone, for the fans. Obviously I believe there's more people here supporting me than the others and I'm sure they would have loved me to get out there and race.
"But it just kind of snowballed from yesterday... Happy to move on."
His Dutch team mate Max Verstappen had a better time of it, finishing fifth behind the Ferrari and Mercedes cars.
The teenager, tipped to give Ricciardo headaches this season after challenging him on track last year, said he was surprised his car had the pace to keep close to Ferrari's fourth-placed Kimi Raikkonen.
"I think the car behaved quite a bit better in the race than in qualifying," Verstappen said.
"It looked a lot better in the race, I'm very happy about that. We still need to improve and we will work hard to do that."

Roger Federer continued his impressive 2017 campaign with a straight-sets, second-round victory at the Miami Open in Florida on Saturday.
But it was far from a cakewalk for Federer, who came within two points of losing the first set before breaking twice in the second for a 7-6(2) 6-3 triumph over American teenager Frances Tiafoe.
Next up for Federer is Juan Martin del Potro, who beat Dutchman Robin Haase 6-2 6-4 in a night match at Crandon Park.
Federer has a 15-5 career record against del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion.
"I would love to play against (del Potro)," Federer said, speaking before knowing who his next opponent would be. "We've had some epic matches against each other. I'm sure the crowd would love to see it."
Tiafoe provided a good competitive workout for the 35-year-old Swiss maestro in his first match since he won the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Sunday.
Tiafoe broke in the first game of the second set, but fourth seed Federer broke straight back with a sizzling backhand winner and another break was all he needed to clinch his 1094th career victory at tour level.
Tiafoe, ranked 101st in the world, has only four career victories, but he showed enough to suggest he will add to that number sooner rather than later.
Federer could be on course for a semi-final showdown with compatriot Stan Wawrinka, less than two weeks after they met in the Indian Wells final.
Top seed Wawrinka defeated Argentina's Horacio Zeballos in 65 minutes, firing seven aces in a 6-3 6-4 victory in less than favourable morning conditions.
"I'm really happy with the match today," Wawrinka told reporters. "It's quite tough conditions, raining and really windy today. It's really windy on the court, so it's never easy.
"I'm happy with the way I was moving, the way I was playing and my attitude in general was really positive," he added. "So it's a great match."
Austrian number six Dominic Thiem was the only high seed to suffer a loss on Saturday.
Thiem fell to 20-year-old Croatian Borna Coric, who overcame an embarrassing brain freeze in the final game to win 6-1 7-5.
Serving for the match, Coric stopped in the middle of a rally, challenging a line call, only to be reminded by the chair umpire that he had no challenges left.
Volatile Australian Nick Kyrgios won his match, and also received a code violation warning from the chair umpire for swearing at a spectator who called out during a point.
Kyrgios, the 12th seed, dropped his first two service games, but roared back to beat Damir Dzumhur 6-4 6-3.

Polish fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska was the highest women's casualty at the Miami Open on Saturday, blown away for the second time this year by Croatian Mirjana Lucic-Baroni.
Radwanska had no answer to the 26th seed, who rolled to a 6-0 6-3 win in barely an hour.
Lucic-Baroni also beat Radwanska at the Australian Open in January, in the second round en route to the semi-finals, where she eventually fell to Serena Williams.
"She was playing unbelievable tennis today," Radwanska, speaking about Lucic-Baroni, told the WTA.
"She was very solid from the beginning, very aggressive, hitting everything with unbelievable speed. I couldn't do much.
"The first set went so quickly, and in the second set I had chances, but I didn't come back and unfortunately I missed the chance to stay in the match. She was just too good today."
Another high seed had a fright, number six Garbine Muguruza overcoming a slow start to beat China's Zhang Shuai 4-6 6-2-6-2 in over two hours.
"Since I've started the year, I've had a lot of matches like this, and I'm expecting that every time I go on court," Muguruza said.
"A win is a win, I don't wish to have matches this tough every day, but I'm very happy with the way I'm facing them.”
It was Muguruza's second victory over Zhang in barely a month, after their match in Doha in February that also went three sets.
Second seed Karolina Pliskova's match went according to form, the Czech beating Kazak 27th seed Yulia Putintseva 7-5 6-3.
But 17th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was sent packing, beaten 4-6 6-0 6-3 by American Bethanie Mattek-Sands.

World number one Dustin Johnson stayed on track to become the first player to win all four World Golf Championships events when he advanced to the semi-finals at the WGC-Dell Match Play in Texas on Saturday.
Johnson lost three consecutive holes during his quarter-final against Alexander Noren, but had enough in reserve to secure a 3&2 victory over the Swedish eighth seed at Austin Country Club.
Next up for the American top seed is a Sunday morning semi-final against Japanese 54th seed Hideto Tanihara, while Spaniard 21st seed Jon Rahm and American 42nd seed Bill Haas meet in the other semi. The final will be played in the afternoon.
"It's a long way to go but I like my chances," Johnson told NBC television after dusting off Noren.
“I gave him a hole there (by hitting into a water hazard on the 11th) and on 10 missed a short putt, but other than that I played really solid, drove it well, hit some good iron shots and rolled some nice putts in.”
A victory on Sunday would make Johnson the only player other than Tiger Woods to win consecutive World Golf Championships events, after his Mexico Championship triumph three weeks ago.
Giant killer Tanihara, a 14-times winner on his home tour, earned a spot in the final four with an emphatic 4&2 win over Englishman Ross Fisher.
Even if he goes no further, Tanihara has already achieved his objective of qualifying for the Masters in two weeks.
He started the week ranked 60th in the world, but is now assured of jumping into the top 50 and punching his ticket to Augusta.
“My goal was to get to the Masters. I’m really happy,” he said.
Haas, meanwhile, took out five-times major winner Phil Mickelson 2&1 in an all-American quarter-final.
“Against Phil, I really felt like I needed to capitalize when I had the chances, and I was able to do that,” Haas said. “It’s something I’ll never forget.”
Mickelson endured a frustrating afternoon on the greens, but nonetheless sounded satisfied with his preparation for the Masters, where he will shoot for a fourth green jacket.
“I didn’t get the putts to go this match the way I had been making them previously and that was the difference,” he said.
Rahm made quick work of the other quarter-final, giving Dane Soren Kjeldsen a 7&5 shellacking.
Rahm could not remember playing better, except perhaps over the final nine holes en route to his maiden PGA Tour victory at Torrey Pines in southern California two months ago.
“I haven’t played 13 holes the way I played today maybe ever,” said the 22-year-old from Barrika in northern Spanish Basque Country.
“I missed one shot, the second shot on nine, and every other single shot was pretty much exactly the way I saw it. To play golf like that and make a couple of putts, it was just a perfect round.”


Chris Stroud took a one-stroke lead after the third round at the Puerto Rico Open on Saturday, declaring it was time to win a PGA Tour event.
Stroud, winless in 276 starts on tour, has come close with a playoff loss in Hartford in 2013, but has never lifted a trophy.
Despite career earnings of nearly $10 million, he is far from satisfied.
“I feel like I’m way overdue,” the 35-year-old Texan told Golf Channel after making birdie at the par-five 18th for a five-under-par 67 at Coco Beach.
“At this point I’ve got experience on my side. I was very calm today. Nothing really freaks me out.”
Stroud, at 15-under 201, heads fellow Americans D.A. Points (69) and Bill Lunde (69) by one stroke, with six others two strokes behind.
With such a tightly-bunched leaderboard, Stroud knows he will need to attack on Sunday to have a chance of winning.
“I’m going to try to get to 20-under or more,” he said. “With these conditions you’ve got to make a lot of birdies. It’s not one of those golf courses you can sit around and make pars.”

KAMPALA Frank Fredericks has temporarily stepped aside from his duties on the IAAF Council pending the results of an ethics investigation, the governing body's President Sebastian Coe said on Saturday.
Fredericks, an International Olympic Committee (IOC) member, has not resigned from his position but will not attend the world athletics ruling body's council meeting in London next month, Coe said.
The Namibian is being investigated by the IOC ethics panel regarding an alleged payment he received from a now-banned athletics official before the 2016 Olympics was awarded to Rio de Janeiro.
"I have spoken to him (Fredericks) regularly since this issue came out and he decided to step away from all this as he needs time to sort all this," Coe told reporters before Sunday's world cross country championships in Uganda.
"He also indicated that he will not attend the Council meeting in London."
Fredericks, a former sprinter who won four Olympic silver medals at the 1992 and 1996 Games, has denied any wrongdoing following the allegations published by French newspaper Le Monde.
He stepped down this month as head of the team evaluating bids to host the 2024 Olympics.
The IAAF has been plagued by alleged doping and bribery controversies in recent years and Coe said earlier this week that he could not be certain that further officials would not be indicted.

Spaniard Maverick Vinales will make his Yamaha debut on pole position after Saturday's qualifying for MotoGP's floodlit season-opening Qatar Grand Prix was abandoned due to rain and thunderstorms.
With standing water left by overnight rain and more storms building up, all action on the Losail track was canceled for the evening with the starting grids for Sunday's race decided on combined times from practice.
Vinales, the 22-year-old who has replaced compatriot Jorge Lorenzo in the Yamaha works team lineup and was fastest on Friday, therefore secured his first pole position in the top flight.
The Spaniard, who moved from Suzuki at the end of last year, set the fastest time of one minute 54.316 in Thursday's first practice session for the only night race on the calendar.
He was joined on the front row by Suzuki's Italian rider Andrea Iannone and reigning triple world champion Marc Marquez on a Honda.
"It's been very strange, and strange that it rains in Qatar," said Vinales.
"It was difficult today, it wasn't okay for wet tyres or dry tyres. It was too risky to go out," he added. "For me, it's safety first and it's tricky conditions."
Nine-times world champion Valentino Rossi, Vinales's team mate, will start tenth with triple MotoGP champion Lorenzo 12th on his debut for Ducati.
The factory KTM team, making their MotoGP debut with Britain's Bradley Smith and Spaniard Pol Espargaro, were last in qualifying.
Grids for the Moto2 and Moto3 classes were also decided on combined times.

Top seed Stan Wawrinka made his opening appearance at the Miami Open a quick one as he defeated Argentina's Horacio Zeballos in 65 minutes on Saturday.
Swiss Wawrinka fired seven aces as he turned back Zeballos 6-3 6-4 in less than favorable conditions.
"I'm really happy with the match today," the Indian Wells finalist told reporters. "It's quite tough conditions, raining and really windy today. It's really windy on the court, so it's never easy.
"I'm happy with the way I was moving, the way I was playing and my attitude in general was really positive," he added. "So it's a great match."
Eighth seed David Goffin and 10th seed Tomas Berdych also advanced.
Belgium's Goffin stopped Darian King of Barbados 7-5 6-1 and Czech Berdych cruised past Russia's Andrey Rublev 6-3 6-2.

MELBOURNE Lewis Hamilton took pole for Mercedes at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on Saturday but Sebastian Vettel raised hope of a Ferrari renaissance by grabbing a spot on the front row.
Hamilton's flying lap of one minute 22.188 seconds set a new record at Albert Park but was only 0.268 seconds in front of German Vettel, offering the tantalising prospect of a competitive championship after three years of domination by the Silver Arrows.
Vettel left Hamilton's new team mate Valtteri Bottas frustrated in the second row, the meat in a Ferrari sandwich next to fourth fastest Kimi Raikkonen.
On a cloudy day with the merest hint of rain, 32-year-old Hamilton grabbed his 62nd pole in Formula One, holding firm as  Vettel and Bottas pushed hard late in the session.
After it wrapped up, the Briton rolled around the lakeside track with his index finger raised, 10 years after his brilliant debut at the same circuit when he qualified fourth for McLaren and finished third in the race.
"It has been a fantastic weekend so far," Hamilton told reporters.
"I am really proud of my team, the guys have worked so hard to make the car what it is today.
"Valtteri has done a great job and it is great for Mercedes. It is close between us all and it will be a tight race."
After Hamilton dominated Friday practice, Vettel topped the timesheets in the final session on Saturday but rued a mistake in his fastest qualifying lap.
"I lost it a bit in turn one... Anyway, great job," Vettel said on his team radio.
It was still encouraging enough for him to declare that the 'scuderia' could contend in Sunday's race, having shown impressive pace and reliability during winter testing.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen qualified fifth but it was a forgettable day for his team mate Daniel Ricciardo, whose hopes of becoming the race's first home winner spun out early in Q3.
He took a spin at turn 14, ended up in the gravel and will start 10th on the grid.
"I'm alright, sorry guys," he said on the team radio before his car was towed off the track.
With McLaren plagued by power unit and reliability problems during winter testing, it was something of a surprise that twice champion Fernando Alonso survived the cut to Q2 and will start 13th on the grid.
His rookie team mate Stoffel Vandoorne will start 18th for the Honda-powered team.
Canadian teenager Lance Stroll has had a memorable, if drama-filled, debut for Williams and the 18-year-old was 19th fastest in Q1.
He will start last on the grid, however, due to a five-place penalty for needing a new gearbox following a crash during practice earlier on Saturday.
Antonio Giovinazzi, a late replacement for Pascal Wehrlein after the German pulled out with fitness concerns, will start 16th for Sauber after an impressive debut in qualifying, one behind team mate Marcus Ericsson.

LONDON As far as Spain's Javier Fernandez is concerned, his coach Brian Orser is more than just a mentor with the Midas touch.
Since Orser jumped for joy when his baby-faced Japanese charge Yuzuru Hanyu struck gold at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, the Canadian has turned into a figure skating juggernaut.
Thanks to Hanyu and Fernandez, Orser's coaching credentials are soaring higher than any quadruple jump either of his star pupils can pull off. And the 55-year-old will be out to preserve the 100 percent success rate he has enjoyed at the world championships in the current Olympic cycle in Helsinki next week.
"To me he's the best coach in the world. He's proved himself with all the skaters he has taken to the top," double world champion Fernandez told Reuters in a telephone interview from Toronto.
"The best thing about him is the energy he brings to the people around him. Even when we are tired, he always manages to lift us. He creates a really good environment around us every day."
That source of boundless energy has served Orser, and his pupils, well over the years.
He missed out on the ultimate Olympic prize himself, coming off second best to Scott Hamilton at the 1984 Sarajevo Games and again when losing the 'Battle of the Brians' in 1988 when he was pipped by another American, Brian Boitano, in Calgary.

RIP-ROARING SUCCESS
As a coach, however, the 1987 world champion has enjoyed rip-roaring success with South Korea's Kim Yuna at the 2010 Olympics followed by Hanyu four years later.
Hanyu's unexpected triumph in Sochi saw Orser embark on a golden trail with his celebrated students having also won every men's world title since. Hanyu's skate to the top of the podium in 2014 was followed by Fernandez in 2015 and 2016.
In fact Orser's two proteges have been untouchable at the world championships for the last two years, when the rest of the men's field were left chasing the bronze.
With the 2018 Winter Games less than 11 months away, Fernandez would like nothing better than to make it a golden hat-trick for Orser in Pyeongchang.
"It will be amazing if I can give him the hat-trick and I am going to try my hardest and my best to give him that," said the 25-year-old Fernandez, who also owns five European championship golds.
"I hope I can get it. It will be amazing for Brian to have three skaters to have won the Olympics."
For Fernandez, however, glory for Orser is not the only milestone at stake.
Hailing from a country bursting with sporting success, Fernandez would likely run out of puff if he was asked to reel off the number of soccer, tennis, motor racing and cycling titles Spanish athletes have won over the years.
But if he was asked how many medals Spain have won at the Winter Olympics, he would only need to hold up two fingers.
One gold for Francisco Fernandez Ochoa in 1972 and a bronze for his sister and fellow Alpine skier Blanca Fernandez Ochoa in 1992 is the sum total of Spain's success in 19 Games dating back to 1936.
To make matters worse, the country's German-born cross-country skier Johann Muehlegg won three gold medals at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games only to be disqualified for doping.
Against such a backdrop of failure, and with Fernandez's homeland blessed with Mediterranean sunshine all year, it is little wonder there are few takers for winter sports in Spain.
But the Real Madrid soccer fan wants to change all that by becoming the first Spaniard to win an Olympic medal on blades.
"I am the first figure skater from Spain to have won world and European titles and that’s really important to me," he said.
"But, obviously, the Olympics is in my mind and (I want the) chance to win the medal I haven’t won yet.
"But once I am done with skating, I want to be a good coach like Brian and teach some other skaters what I have been taught and try to help them in their careers. I want to grow figure skating in my country."

LONDON Javier Fernandez, Yuzuru Hanyu and Patrick Chan have won the last six men's titles at the figure skating world championships but the 'old guard' will be under pressure in Helsinki to quell the growing threat posed by a gang of high-flying upstarts.
In the final global meet before next February's Winter Olympics in South Korea's Pyeongchang, the trio will be eager to show that they are still capable of pulling off more soaring quadruple jumps than their younger rivals.
"It's mind blowing what these guys are doing technically," the 26-year-old Chan, who won a hat-trick of world titles before settling for Olympic silver behind Hanyu at the 2014 Sochi Games, told reporters in a conference call.
"We are at a point now where it’s crazy."
Just seven years ago, American Evan Lysacek captured the 2010 Olympic gold without attempting a single quadruple jump.
That prompted 2006 Olympic gold medalist Yevgeny Plushenko to claim Lysacek was "not a true champion" and that he had won gold by "dancing rather than skating like a man".
Now it is no longer a question of 'if' the top contenders will attempt a skill that requires them to lift off into the air and complete four revolutions before touching down on the ice, but 'how many' quads they will pull off.
The battle for the gold medal is likely to be between double world champion Fernandez and Japan's Hanyu, who won the Olympic and world titles during a magical few weeks in 2014.
The two Brian Orser graduates have been untouchable at the world championships for the last two years, leaving the rest of the field to chase bronze.
However, with 17-year-old American Nathan Chen capturing the top prize at last month's Four Continents competition, the chasing pack is closing in fast.

'SKATING WIFE'
Fernandez, 25, still expects to be fighting it out with Hanyu for gold in Helsinki but said emerging talents such as China's Jin Boyang and Japanese teenager Shoma Uno could not be discounted.
"Definitely Yuzu will be my biggest rival in Helsinki because he’s always my biggest rival," Fernandez told Reuters about the training partner he calls his "skating wife".
"I know Patrick is going to be fighting for that medal.
"Nathan Chen is a great technique guy, he does a lot of quads and is pretty strong. Boyang Jin is also very technical and strong. Even Shoma Uno can skate really well."
When Chan decided to take a break after his Olympic dreams were dashed, his quad repertoire was limited to quad-toeloops.
A year into his comeback, he has added a quad Salchow to his arsenal in an attempt to keep pace with the young tyros.
Fernandez said the younger skaters were developing quickly.
"Figure skating is changing, the guys who were in the juniors only one or two years ago are now pushing us really hard," he added.
"There are maybe five skaters who will be fighting so hard for that gold medal at the worlds."
Recent form suggests that the other titles will be more clear cut as defending women's champion Evgenia Medvedeva has not been beaten this season, while 2010 Olympic ice dance champions Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir have enjoyed a comeback to savour.
Following a two-year hiatus, the Canadians have won every meet they have entered and look set to end the two-year reign of their French training partners Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron.
"This is the most prepared we’ve been for a world championships arguably in our whole career," Moir said during a conference call. "We can’t wait to get to Finland, we can’t wait to get on that ice and we can’t wait to compete two programs that we love."
Fellow Canadians Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford will arrive in Helsinki for the March 29 to April 2 championships chasing a hat-trick of pairs titles.



Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker became the unlikeliest member of an elite scoring club when he erupted for 70 points on Friday against the Boston Celtics.
Just the sixth NBA player to ever reach the scoring mark, Booker joins hallowed players Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe Bryant, David Thompson, Elgin Baylor and David Robinson.
It was an astounding performance from Booker, a 20-year-old second-year player, and one few could predict coming.
"It's a night I'm going to remember the rest of my life," Booker told reporters.
Phoenix (22-51) fell to Boston 130-120 but Booker stole the limelight with his shooting.
"It's a zone. It's kind of hard to explain. I've been in those zones before, but never to this extent."
Booker, averaging 20.9 points per game entering the night, had never scored as many as 40 points before lighting up the scoreboard Friday.
He made 21 of 40 field goal attempts for the game and tallied 51 points in the second half. Phoenix called late timeouts to give him more shots and the Boston crowd cheered as his total climbed.
"That meant a lot (to be cheered), especially here in Boston. I know how rowdy they can be on opponents sometimes. I respect that."

Big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic made a strong return to competition on Friday by beating Viktor Troicki 6-3 7-5 to reach the third round of the Miami Open.
Joining the Canadian in the third round were Spanish fifth seed Rafa Nadal and Japanese second seed Kei Nishikori.
Nadal advanced past Israeli Dudi Sela 6-3 6-4, taking the critical second-set break in the seventh game, while Nishikori cut down South African Kevin Anderson 6-4 6-3.
Third seed Raonic has been sidelined by a right leg injury that forced him to concede a walkover in the Delray Beach Open final last month and to withdraw from the Mexican Open and BNP Paribas Open.
“I have to be very happy with just the outcome, that I was able to get the win today, that I have another chance to play in two days,” said the world number five.
Raonic breezed through the opening set and led 3-1 in the second before Serbia's Troicki battled back.
World number 38 Troicki, who has reached the fourth round in Miami twice, drew level at 5-5 before Raonic’s pressure helped him secure the deciding break.
Raonic advanced to play American Jared Donaldson, a 6-4 6-4 winner against 28th seed Mischa Zverev of Germany.
Raonic said he has been helped by the addition of former world number 69 Jesse Levine to his coaching support.
“He's somebody that I get along with great, is a little bit closer to my age as well, and somebody that I can play with on court and put in hard hours with,” he added.
A string of upsets unfolded later in the day with world number 13 Grigor Dimitrov eliminated in straight sets by Argentinean Guido Pella 6-3 7-6(4).
Dimitrov, who lost to Nadal in the Australian Open semi-final, has now lost three of his last six matches since winning the Sofia Open last month.
American Donald Young knocked out 11th seed Lucas Pouille 6-2 6-4, Federico Delbonis took down 15th seed Pablo Carreno 1-6 7-5 6-2, while Frenchman Gilles Simon fell to German Jan-Lennard Struff 6-1 6-1.
In earlier action, Frenchman Jeremy Chardy defeated seventh-seeded former U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic of Croatia for the first time since 2009 to move into the third round with a 6-4 2-6 6-3 win.

Bryson DeChambeau, D.A. Points and Bill Lunde were locked in a three-way tie for the lead when darkness suspended second-round play on Friday at the Puerto Rico Open.
The three Americans were knotted at 11 under par on the rain-softened Coco Beach course, with Lunde having three holes to complete as one of 45 players returning early on Saturday to finish the round in Rio Grande.
DeChambeau fired a seven-under-par 65, Points a 69, and Lunde was four-under for the day after an opening 65.
New Zealand left-hander Tim Wilkinson joined a large group one off the lead with a sizzling 63, playing his last eight holes in seven under par.
PGA Tour rookie Trey Mullinax, who grabbed the first round lead at 63 five days after getting married, remained at nine under par after 13 holes when play was halted.
With nearly all of the game's top players competing at the WGC-Dell Match Play in Austin, a weak field at the Puerto Rico could provide a springboard to success for the eventual winner, though the champion will not receive an invitation to the Masters next month.


It will be Johnson v Johnson as world number one Dustin takes on double major champion Zach in a round-of-16 clash at the WGC-Dell Match Play in Texas on Saturday.
And five-times major champion Phil Mickelson will meet in-form Australian Marc Leishman as the World Golf Championships event enters the knockout phase after completing the round-robin phase at Austin Country Club.
Big-hitting Dustin Johnson emerged with a perfect 3-0-0 record, wrapping up the group phase with a 5&3 shellacking of fellow American Jimmy Walker on Friday.
He said he fancied his chances of beating namesake and compatriot Zach, not because of the world rankings but because of his form.
“No matter what ranking I am, I feel I should win,” he told reporters. “I feel like I’ve got a bit of an advantage, just because I’m playing so well.
“Today I made a bunch of birdies, no bogeys and usually in match play you do that, you win. Just because I'm number one I don't get a pass. I've still got to play really well.”
Zach Johnson, meanwhile, said he would relish the challenge of taking on the game’s hottest player.
“I think his time is about done. Physically, he is not looking great,” he said, tongue planted firmly in cheek, before turning more serious.
“Hopefully I’ve got my A game. I need it. I expect nothing less out of Dustin. He does things with the golf ball only a small percentage can do out here.”
Mickelson finished group play in style at 3-0-0 with a 6&5 thumping of fellow American J.B. Holmes.
Leishman was given a scare before winning his group in a three-way playoff with Englishman Lee Westwood and American Pat Perez after they all finished with the same 2-1-0 record in their group.
"(I'm) having a good week or so," Australian Leishman, who won the Arnold Palmer Invitational last Sunday, said.
Asked for his thoughts about facing Mickelson, known for his light-hearted trash talking, the laid-back Leishman sounded unfazed.
"I'll have to work on my trash talking I guess," Leishman said. "I've got to keep hitting it the way I have been and make some putts."
Among other round-of-16 match-ups will be Spaniard Jon Rahm versus American Charles Howell III, Englishman Paul Casey against Japan's Hideto Tanihara and American Bubba Watson against Englishman Ross Fisher.
Rahm won his group by beating countryman Sergio Garcia 6&4.
"I'd rather not play a fellow Spaniard but luckily whoever won today was going to make it through," Rahm said.
Howell topped his group after an eventful three-way playoff with Englishman Tyrrell Hatton and Spain's Rafa Cabrera-Bello.
Hatton was eliminated at the first extra hole after incurring a two-stroke penalty for putting without replacing his ball after he had caused it to move fractionally. Howell finally emerged victorious four holes later.
The round-of-16 on Saturday morning will be followed immediately afterwards by the quarter-finals.


PALERMO, Italy Italy survived some first-half scares on the way to a 2-0 win over Albania in a World Cup qualifier marred by crowd trouble caused by away fans on Friday.
A Daniele De Rossi penalty and Ciro Immobile header gave Italy three points in Group G as their veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made his 1,000th senior appearance.
De Rossi had to wait to take his penalty when two firecrackers were thrown onto the pitch by Albania fans behind the goal.
The match was then interrupted for nearly 10 minutes in the second half as Albania fans set up more firecrackers, creating a cloud of smoke over Buffon's penalty area. The match resumed after the Albania players appealed to their supporters for calm.
Italy are level on 13 points with Spain at the top of the group although their rivals lead on goal difference.
Albania's defeat left them with six points and further dented their hopes of a first-ever World Cup finals appearance.
"We didn't settle quickly enough but after the 30th minute, Buffon didn't have anything to do," said Italy coach Giampiero Ventura.
"It was not an extraordinarily exciting performance tonight but we have taken another small step forward."
The visitors nearly grabbed a first-minute lead when Sokol Cikalleshi shot across the face of goal while Odise Roshi was not far wide with a long-range effort.
It was a hair-raising start for Italy but they survived to take a 12th minute lead when Andrea Belotti was pushed by Migjen Basha in the area and De Rossi, undisturbed by the firecrackers, converted confidently.
Albania continued to look threatening and Roshi got clear of his marker but shot weakly at Buffon, the only save the 39-year-old had to make in his landmark game.
The Russian-based midfielder had another chance just before halftime when the ball came to him in the penalty area but he curled his shot over the bar.
Italy took a firmer grip on the game after the interruption and Antonio Candreva was denied on the hour when Albania's debutant goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha saved at his feet.
Immobile wrapped up the points when he met Davide Zappacosta's long, looping cross with a firm header at the far post to in the 71st minute.
Albania coach Gianni De Biasi said he was "really upset" about the firework incidents.
"I saw a different side to the Albanian fans, something I hadn’t seen in my years here," said the Italian.
"It... hurt to see those scenes and I never thought I’d see that from the Albanian supporters."

Diego Costa was among the scorers as Spain strolled to a 4-1 win at home to Israel in a World Cup qualifier on Friday to stay top of Group G.
Manchester City playmaker David Silva put Spain ahead in the 15th minute with a low shot through the legs of goalkeeper Ofir Marciano while Vitolo doubled their lead on the stroke of halftime just after Israel had squandered a chance to level.
Chelsea striker Diego Costa scored a fourth international goal in four games to put Spain 3-0 up early in the second half with a header from a corner although Israel striker Lior Refaelov made amends for an earlier miss by pulling one back in the 76th minute.
Isco then restored Spain's three-goal advantage in the 88th minute, rolling the ball into the near corner to complete a sweeping counter started by a burst forward from Costa from the halfway line.
Spain top Group G with 13 points from five points, ahead of  Italy on goal difference. Israel are third on nine points and Albania are fourth on six.
"Every game is like a World Cup for us, everything is at stake in every game and we know that every time three points are up for grabs they could be decisive," Spain coach Julen Lopetegui told reporters.
"I'm delighted with the mentality of the team and how we wanted to play as a team. We created a lot of chances and kept attacking and trying to stay intense. I'm happy with our collective spirit and this is the path we need to stay on."
Thiago Alcantara dictated the play for Spain in midfield and created their first effort with a snapshot from outside the area which Marciano tipped onto the bar.
Israel forced an opening when a lapse in concentration from Gerard Pique allowed Eran Zahavi to race towards goal but the striker lost his composure as he entered the area.
Spain's patient build-up play paid off when Jordi Alba slid the ball through a defender's legs to Silva on the left side of the area, allowing the City midfielder to fire through Marciano's legs.
Israel defender Eitan Tibi was carried off on a stretcher shortly after the first goal following a challenge from Pique. The visitors had had little possession but carved out an excellent move just before the break, Lior Refaelov's header forcing David de Gea into a brilliant low save.
Spain were quickly knocked into shape and got their second with the next move, Thiago laying on a pass which looked destined for Silva although the midfielder, who was offside, waited for Vitolo to send the ball trickling over the line.
Costa further stretched Spain's lead after the break with a simple header but Refaelov smashed the ball into the roof of the net after Rami Gershon had headed against De Gea's near post before Isco struck late on.

DUBLIN Ireland's Seamus Coleman broke his leg after a scything challenge from Wales defender Neil Taylor, who was immediately dismissed in the goalless Group D qualifier at Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Friday.
The Everton fullback left the field on a stretcher, with an oxygen mask on his face, after Taylor recklessly clattered into him on 68 minutes of the encounter that left Wales facing a tough task to qualify directly for the World Cup.
"It's obviously a real blow to him, he's having a season of a lifetime at club level. He's a big player for us, a great captain so it's a big, big loss to us and Everton," Ireland manager Martin O'Neill told a news conference.
Taylor's wild challenge came two minutes after a booking for Wales talisman Gareth Bale meant both men will now miss the key qualifier against Serbia, who top the group on 11 points, ahead of Ireland on goal difference and four points clear of Wales.
Ireland were already without the suspended Robbie Brady and injured Wes Hoolahan and the group leaders going into Friday's games badly missed James McCarthy early on after the central midfielder's withdrawal just before kickoff.
Spending long spells without the ball, Ireland still managed to keep Bale at bay, hurriedly closing the subdued Real Madrid man down at every touch as the half ended without a single shot on target.
Wales, who named the same side that famously beat Belgium 3-1 in last year's European Championship quarter-final, started the second half as they did the first and Bale came alive, finally testing Darren Randolph's goal twice in four minutes. 
The game turned on Taylor's red card as the packed stadium, buzzing since kick off, erupted as the hosts piled on the pressure.
Man-of-the-match James McClean, wearing the number 5 jersey in tribute to his friend Ryan McBride of local Irish team Derry City who died on Sunday, came closest to scoring after his deflected shot flashed inches wide.
There was still time for Bale to almost snatch it with a long range left foot drive but Wales' 25-year run without a victory over Ireland remained as Coleman's injury overshadowed the night.
"It's a bad one for Seamus, I hope he's not out for too long because he's one of the best fullbacks in the Premier League. Neil Taylor's not that type of player and he's been there himself with that type of injury," Wales manager Chris Coleman said.
"He's a great boy and Neil Taylor's devastated himself."

BARCELONA Spain's Supreme Court will consider Barcelona talisman Lionel Messi's appeal against a 21-month prison sentence for tax fraud on April 20, a court spokesperson said on Friday.
That date is three days before the "Clasico" between Barca and Real Madrid which could go a long way to deciding this season's La Liga title.
Argentine Messi, five-times world player of the year, was found guilty by a Barcelona court last July on three counts of tax fraud between 2007 and 2009, resulting in a suspended 21-month prison sentence and fine of 2 million euros.
Messi's father Jorge was given the same sentence and ordered to pay a fine of 1.5 million euros.
Spanish law is such that any sentence under two years for a non-violent crime rarely requires a defendant without previous convictions to serve jail time.
Messi, 29, and his father defrauded the Spanish tax office of almost 4.2 million euros from 2007-09 by using a web of shell companies to avoid taxes on income from the player's image rights.
Messi is top scorer in La Liga this season and has netted more goals than any player in matches between Barcelona and their arch-rivals Real Madrid.
Real lead the Catalans by two points at the top of the league standings and have a game in hand.

Sweden will host a pair of regular-season games between the Colorado Avalanche and Ottawa Senators in November, the National Hockey League said on Friday.
The Senators and Avalanche will play at Stockholm's Ericsson Globe on Nov. 10 and Nov. 11, marking the sixth time the league has traveled to Europe for regular-season games, the NHL said in a statement.
"We have more Swedish players than ever in the NHL, and we are extremely pleased that the 2017 SAP NHL Global Series will allow us to showcase a number of those players, with their NHL teams, in their homeland," NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said.
The games will mark the 21st and 22nd regular-season games played in Europe and the seventh and eighth regular-season games played in Sweden.
Ottawa captain and Landsbro, Sweden, native Erik Karlsson as well as Avalanche captain and Stockholm, Sweden, native Gabriel Landeskog will be playing in their home country for the first time as NHL players.
Other Swedes currently playing for the two clubs include Ottawa's Frederik Claesson (Stockholm) and Viktor Stalberg (Gothenburg), and Colorado’s Anton Lindholm (Skelleftea) and Carl Soderberg (Malmo).
The news comes a day after the NHL said it would hold a news conference in China where the league is reportedly going to announce a pair of September exhibition games between the Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver Canucks in Beijing.

Candidates vying for the four available Asian Football Confederation (AFC) seats on the FIFA council have been cleared to stand for election by the world governing body, the AFC said on Friday.
The four successful candidates at May's AFC congress in Bahrain will represent Asia on the body along with Bahraini vice president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, also the head of the AFC, and members from Japan and Malaysia.
The four spots include one reserved for women.
Australian Moya Dodd, formerly a co-opted member of the old FIFA Executive Committee, will take on Mahfuza Ahkter of Bangladesh, Han Un-gyong of North Korea and Susan R. A. Shalabi of Palestine.
Chinese Football Association general secretary Zhang Jian, South Korea's Mong Gyu Chung, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah of Kuwait and Mariano V. Araneta Jr. of Philippines will contest for the other three spots.
Olympic Council of Asia President Sheikh Ahmad, who heads the Association of National Olympic committees and is an influential International Olympic Committee (IOC) member, has a FIFA Council seat currently, the term of which ends in May.
The FIFA Council replaced the largely discredited Executive Committee as FIFA's decision-making body under reforms instituted in the wake of the 2015 corruption scandal in soccer's world governing body.
Last September, the AFC extraordinary congress, called to conduct the elections for the FIFA Council, was postponed over the disqualification of a Qatari candidate.

ZURICH A Pan-American tournament similar to last year's Copa Centenario could be played on a regular two or four-yearly basis depending on the outcome of discussions between the two confederations involved.
Victor Montagliani, president of the North, Central America and Caribbean Confederation (CONCACAF), told Reuters that significant talks had taken place with South America's CONMEBOL over the organization of future competitions.
The new tournament would effectively be a merger of the CONCACAF Gold Cup and South America's Copa America which could cease to exist in their own right.
The Copa America, the world's oldest continental competition, has been organized by CONMEBOL since 1916 while the CONCACAF championship was first held in 1963 and renamed the Gold Cup in 1991.
The Copa has suffered from having only 10 teams while the Gold Cup, traditionally dominated by Mexico and the United States, has been held back by a lack of world-class sides.
The Copa Centenario, won by Chile, was held in the U.S. last year to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the South American competition.
"We've had some significant discussions with our CONMEBOL friends in terms of moving forward on a (tournament) on a more regular basis rather then a one-off," said Montagliani, adding that CONCACAF was pleased with last year's event.
The new tournament, which would take place in 2020 at the earliest, would be "similar to what Centenario was in the sense that it was CONCACAF and CONMEBOL teams," added the Canadian.
Asked if it meant ditching the Gold Cup and Copa America, he said: "Those are some of things we are talking about - would it be viable to still have a Gold Cup, in our case?
"If you have that kind of situation, those are things that are being analyzed."
CONMEBOL could not immediately be reached for comment although resistance to the end of the Copa America as a competition in itself is likely to be strong.
Hosting rights and the frequency of the tournaments would be another issue. The Gold Cup is permanently hosted by the U.S. while the Copa America is rotated between countries.
"Do you alternate between confederations on a quadrennial basis, do you split it up, those are all things we are discussing with our good friends in CONMEBOL," said Montagliani.
"Is it every two years, it is every four? The calendar is already packed, I'm not sure every two would be sensible but I think at this point you want to look at everything, you don't want to leave any stone unturned."
Montagliani, elected last year, has already overseen fundamental changes to the CONCACAF Champions' League, its flagship club competition, where the group stage will be replaced by a knockout contest from next season.
"You need to make games relevant and impactful...and I think our format change is going to do that," he said.


MELBOURNE Three-times world champion Lewis Hamilton dominated practice at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on Friday, putting Mercedes on top of the timesheets and leaving his Formula One rivals with plenty to ponder before the weekend.
Ferrari had the pre-race buzz with their impressive pace during winter testing but Hamilton's times at Albert Park will give Mercedes early hope of extending their three-year dominance into another season.
The Briton led new team mate Valtteri Bottas in a Mercedes one-two in the first session and raised the pace on slicker tires in the second to be comfortably quicker than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel on a cloudy day at the lakeside circuit.
Hamilton's fastest lap of one minute 23.62 seconds was more than half a second clear of four-times world champion Vettel, who edged Bottas into third.
A thrilled Hamilton said the day was "99 percent perfect".
"After struggling with some issues in Barcelona, we didn't know if we'd have the same thing here," he said.
"What's really encouraging is that we've arrived at the track just a week later and the car is exactly where it should be."
Finn Bottas, who replaced champion Nico Rosberg after the German's shock retirement last year, remarked this week that he felt no pressure stepping up from his former team Williams.
He may feel the heat now, after being well shaded by his team mate.
The 2007 championship winner Kimi Raikkonen was fourth fastest for Ferrari in the second session, improving on his fifth placing earlier.
Red Bull drivers Dan Ricciardo and Max Verstappen were third and fourth quickest in the first session but dropped down the timesheets to fifth and sixth later after changes to their cars between the sessions.
Dutch teenager Verstappen skidded into the grass in FP2 and team principal Christian Horner said neither he nor Ricciardo had appreciated the tweaks in the garage.
"Max did a little grass-mowing (but) yes, we're generally quite encouraged," he told reporters.
The first session was largely incident-free but there were plenty of problems later, with Renault driver Jolyon Palmer having a particularly tough day.
With his FP1 cut short by a seal problem, FP2 was also over quickly when Palmer skidded at turn 16. He slammed into a barrier, scattering debris on the track and the red flag was raised until his wrecked car was hauled off.
Felipe Massa's Williams car stopped half an hour into the second session.
Twice champion Fernando Alonso was 12th fastest in FP2 and may have been buoyed by the result after arriving in Melbourne anxious after a dreary winter testing for the Woking-based team.
With fatter tires and improved aerodynamics, the speed of the new cars was impressive. Hamilton's fastest lap was just shy of Vettel's pole record of 1:23.529 set at Albert Park in 2011.

Russian Elena Vesnina and Spaniard Garbine Muguruza were in big trouble in their second round matches when the weather came to their rescue at the Miami Open in Florida on Thursday.
Four days after the biggest victory of her career at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, 13th seed Vesnina was facing defeat at the hands of Croatian wild card Ajla Tomljanovic, who led 3-6 6-4 5-3 when a thunderstorm halted play for the night.
The world number 594 will have more than 14 hours to think about the possibility of a huge upset before serving for the match when play resumes on Friday.
Sixth seed Muguruza, meanwhile, drew a blank in the first set of her match against 46th-ranked American Christina McHale, who led 6-0 2-3.
Earlier, Czech second seed Karolina Pliskova cruised into the third round with a 6-1 6-3 win over Madison Brengle, while Dominika Cibulkova beat Paraguayan qualifier Veronica Cepede Royg 6-3 6-2.
Pliskova, a finalist at last year's U.S. Open who reached the semi-finals at Indian Wells last week, relied on her booming groundstrokes and strong returning to dispatch her American opponent in 59 minutes.
"The last few matches it's not really about my serve because the percentage is a little low, but I'm happy that I have my game from the baseline," Pliskova, who hit 27 winners compared to six for Brengle, said after the match.
"I was feeling the ball pretty well today."
Pliskova controlled the rallies, winning six straight games to finish off the opening set and go up a break in the second.
Brengle then attacked Pliskova's serve to earn her first service break, but the world number three re-established the lead in the next game and served out to end the match.
Slovakian fourth seed Cibulkova faced only two break points against Royg and saved both in a win that set up a third-round clash with Belgian Kirsten Flipkens, who outbattled 29th seed Croatian Ana Konjuh 7-6(4) 6-7(6) 6-2.
Fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland survived a first set tie break before dusting off China's Wang Qiang 7-6(3) 6-1.
Twelfth seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark was impressive in a 6-1 6-1 demolition of American Varvara Lepchenko 6-1 6-2.

The U.S. women's ice hockey team has expressed "confidence" that any American players approached to stand in for them at the upcoming world championship would refuse.
With the women threatening a boycott of the tournament over a wage dispute, the team said in statement on Thursday that USA Hockey was contacting other players to replace them.
"The players are aware that USA Hockey is attempting to secure a team to play in the world championship, in case the players and USA Hockey are unable to reach agreement," it said.
"As we have maintained from the beginning, this issue is about more than the compensation of the current team: it's about equitable treatment for female players now and in the future.
"A forward-looking agreement will benefit the next generation of players even more than the current players. For that reason, and the fact that the younger players identify with us, we are confident that they would choose not to play."
Earlier this week, the two sides said they had held productive talks and would continue discussions this week in the hope of reaching a deal.
"We ask that they (USA Hockey) approve the original agreement that, the players believed, was acceptable to both parties after Monday's meeting," the statement added.
"Unless there is an agreement, the players remain resolved to bypass the defense of the world championship."
The tournament begins next Friday in Plymouth, Michigan.

MONTEVIDEO Brazil recovered from conceding an early goal to beat Uruguay 4-1 in Montevideo on Thursday, with Paulinho grabbing a hat-trick in a win that all but cemented their place at next year's World Cup finals.
The victory gave Tite his eighth win in eight games as coach and lifted leaders Brazil to 30 points in the South American qualifying group, a tally that has been more than enough to guarantee qualification in previous campaigns.
"We work hard every day and so this isn't an accident," Paulinho said of the three points and three goals, his first professional hat-trick.
"We played a great game and got a great win. We knew how difficult it would be here. We went behind, but we kept our concentration and we had the coolness to go after a result.
"Now we need to keep it up and I am sure this team has a lot more to offer."
The five-times World Cup winners led second-placed Uruguay by four points before the game but it was the weakened home side that took the lead after eight minutes thanks to a penalty from Edinson Cavani.
Marcelo tried to chest down the ball to his keeper but Cavani nipped in to intercept and was pulled down by Alisson. The Paris St. Germain striker got up to rifle the ball home low to Alisson's right.
It was the first time that Brazil had gone behind since Tite took over as coach last summer and it only took them 10 minutes to show they would not be bowed.
Neymar laid the ball off to Paulinho in midfield and the former Tottenham midfielder hammered home a spectacular right-foot shot from 30 yards out.
When Brazil took the lead six minutes into the second half it was again Paulinho who did the damage.
Goalkeeper Martin Silva could only parry Roberto Firmino's shot from the edge of the box and Paulinho was on hand to knock the rebound home from six yards.
Neymar had a quiet game but he got Brazil's third with 16 minutes to go when he seized on a long ball to outrun Sebastian Coates and deftly lob the stranded Silva.
Paulinho got his third and Brazil's fourth in injury time when he cheekily chested home a cross from Dani Alves.
In the evening's earlier match, Colombia beat Bolivia 1-0 in Barranquilla.
James Rodriguez got the winner from the penalty spot after 83 minutes to lift Colombia in to third place in the qualifying group with 21 points.
Paraguay also took three points to move into seventh place in the 10-team group with a narrow 2-1 win over Ecuador.
The top four teams qualify automatically for Russia 2018 and the fifth-placed side go into a play off with a team from Oceania.

BUENOS AIRES Lionel Messi converted a penalty as Argentina labored to a 1-0 win over Chile in a World Cup qualifier on Thursday that put them back in the automatic qualifying spots for next year's finals in Russia.
Messi beat Claudio Bravo from the spot in the 16th minute after Angel Di Maria had been pushed from behind in the first quarter of a poor, tense match on a terrible River Plate pitch.
Argentina, a shadow of the team that finished World Cup runners-up in 2014, moved into third place in the 10-nation South American group on 22 points, eight behind leaders Brazil and one in arrears to second-placed Uruguay.
Brazil earlier beat Uruguay 4-1.
Colombia, who beat Bolivia 1-0 at home, are now in the fourth qualifying place with 21 points, one ahead of Ecuador, who lost 2-1 away to Paraguay and sit in the playoff berth.
"We suffered because we lost the ball but at least we won," relieved Argentina coach Edgardo Bauza told reporters.
Chile, missing suspended midfielder Arturo Vidal but worthy of at least a draw, gave Argentina and early scare when they had the ball in net after a free kick from the left only for Jose Fuenzalida to be ruled offside.
Argentina took the lead when Brazilian referee Sandro Ricci ruled that Fuenzalida had pushed Di Maria as he chased a fine through ball from Javier Mascherano.
Messi sent Bravo the wrong way and buried the ball in the back of the net to a roar from a wildly passionate 60,000 crowd at El Monumental.
Stringing moves together was difficult for both teams on a patchy pitch and Argentina were relieved when the final whistle went after withstanding intense pressure from the Copa America holders, who are now sixth in the group on goal difference.
Argentina central defender Nicolas Otamendi should have scored from a Messi free kick before halftime but blasted a chance over the bar.
Messi was mostly kept quiet by the Chile defense but he had another chance to score from Marcos Rojo's cross from the left only to see his effort go over the bar.
Midway through the second half, Chile's Alexis Sanchez hit the bar with a free kick and goalkeeper Sergio Romero had to get down sharply to prevent a subsequent cross from reaching substitute Nicolas Castillo.
On a disappointing night in front of goal for Chile, Sanchez lobbed a free kick from a similar position high over the bar and Castillo slipped through the defense to meet a cross but steered his shot wide of the near post.

World number one Dustin Johnson continued his perfect record at the WGC-Dell Match Play on Thursday while number two Rory McIlroy was eliminated without even setting foot on the course.
On an extremely windy afternoon at Austin Country Club with gusts of up to 35 miles per hour (56 kph), Johnson coped manfully with the elements to beat German Martin Kaymer 3&2 .
"Putting is the hardest part," Johnson told Golf Channel after improving to 2-0-0 overall with his second straight win over a major champion. "It’s very breezy and then really gusty at times."
Despite two wins from two matches, Johnson was not guaranteed of advancing out of the group stage. He must win or halve his Friday match against compatriot Jimmy Walker to be certain of advancing to the final 16.
The format divides the 64 players into 16 four-man groups, with the winner of each group entering the knockout stage on Saturday.
After losing to Dane Soren Kjeldsen on Wednesday, McIlroy got a win on Thursday when his scheduled opponent Gary Woodland withdrew, citing personal family reasons.
Even with that walkover, however, McIlroy still needed Kjeldsen to lose his second match to have any chance of advancing out of the round-robin group stage.
But Kjeldsen duly shut the door on the Northern Irishman, beating Argentine Emiliano Grillo 4&3 on Thursday to improve to 2-0-0.
Kjeldsen said he relished the tough conditions.
“I’m brought up in this," he said. "The way I play golf, I like to shape shots, like to change the trajectory. When I saw it being windy today I was really happy.”
Swede Alexander Noren is also guaranteed of being part of the sweet 16, after beating Austrian Bernd Wiesberger 3&2.
McIlroy was not the only highly-ranked player eliminated from the final 16 with world number four Hideki Matsuyama also making an early exit after losing to Englishman Ross Fisher 2&1.
The wind caused all sorts of problems and a watery grave for many a ball, even a shank by American Charles Howell, who had no problem assigning the blame to the conditions.
“(It was) difficult enough to cause a shank,” he said after escaping with a 1-up win over Spaniard Rafa Cabrera-Bello.
Phil Mickelson, who improved to 2-0-0 thanks to a 5&4 thumping of fellow American Daniel Berger, said it was fortunate that the match play format was being used rather than stroke play, given the conditions.
"Given the severity of the greens and so forth, certainly there are holes we're going to look ridiculous on," he said after chipping clean across a green into a water hazard.
"I think it's fun and it's great for match play because you don't worry about the stroke. It's just relative to your opponent."

MELBOURNE Daniel Ricciardo will again carry his nation's hopes of a first home winner at the season-opening Grand Prix at Albert Park on Sunday and it would be a well-earned victory for the Red Bull driver after a punishing week off the track.
The pin-up boy of Australian motor racing, Ricciardo's profile has grown year by year since humble beginnings with the defunct Hispania Racing team in 2011.
Since replacing compatriot Mark Webber at Red Bull in 2014 after two years with Toro Rosso, the affable 27-year-old's popularity has soared in his home country and his 'shoey' celebration -- drinking champagne from his race boot on the podium -- has been adopted enthusiastically by local athletes.
Burgeoning corporate support for the Perth-born driver has also meant an exhausting schedule of promotional events ahead of the season-opener and Ricciardo said he often felt overwhelmed by the attention.
On Wednesday, he raced down Melbourne's Yarra River on speed-boats with team mate Max Verstappen early in the morning before a big media scrum.
Twelve hours and some five events later, a glassy-eyed Ricciardo cracked jokes and told racing anecdotes at a re-branding party for a Western Australian sponsor specializing in sandalwood production.
Having come fourth at Albert Park last year and had a runner-up finish in 2014 stripped when his car was disqualified due to a technical breach, Perth-born Ricciardo is desperate to reward his fans with a win on Sunday.
But he won't be putting too much pressure on himself.
"It is demanding, it is a tiring week but obviously it's pretty cool to see so many people supporting me and the event," he said at the pre-race media conference on Thursday.
"It's kind of overwhelming actually.
"But it's nice and encouraging to see. I hear ticket sales are up quite a chunk from last year. I try to enjoy it as well. I appreciate it won't last forever."
Ricciardo won three races in his 2014 debut season with Red Bull before going winless in a disappointing 2015 plagued by reliability problems.
He returned to the winner's circle at Malaysia last year, one of only two races not sewn up by Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, who retired after winning the championship.
The other race was won by Verstappen, the teenage wunderkind expected to make life increasingly difficult for Ricciardo on the track as he matures.
Ricciardo welcomed the rivalry from the young Dutchman as positive for Red Bull's hopes of threatening Mercedes' three-year reign over Formula One.
"Hopefully tough (battles), hopefully we're fighting for victories," he said.
"He's obviously fast and it's his third year now... He's no longer a rookie any more.
"The team is excited to see how we go, (like) everyone else.
"Hopefully it can be hyped up that we are fighting at the front, that's what we both want."

BERLIN The International Olympic Committee was hopeful negotiations with the National Hockey League would eventually be successful, allowing the world's best players to compete at next year's Pyeongchang winter Games, the governing body said on Thursday.
The NHL players' participation is traditionally a thorny issue for the Olympics with the season forced to shut down for 2-1/2 weeks to accommodate the Games while club owners are concerned with player injuries and the high cost of insurance.
The NHL last met with the IOC and the International Ice Hockey Federation in early February but talks have so far been unsuccessful and NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said this week it was unlikely the players will travel to South Korea.
"We remain hopeful that the negotiations between the IIHF and the NHL will prove successful," an IOC spokesperson told Reuters.
"The fans want to see the best hockey players taking part in the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018."
Bettman had told Reuters on Tuesday it should be assumed players would not compete at the winter Games in South Korea.
"There are no negotiations ongoing," Bettman said. "We were open to having discussions on a variety of things that might mitigate the damage to our season but that had no resonance.
"As things stand now people should assume we are not going."
For handing over $3.5 billion in player contracts the NHL is seeking something akin to IOC Top Sponsor status that would allow the league to market the Winter Games on its platforms.
The NHL has also said the IOC will have to backtrack and pay player insurance and transportation costs after saying it would no longer bear the costs like it had during the five previous Winter Games.
The NHL did not agree to go to the 2014 Olympics in Sochi until July, 2013. While NHL owners have dug in, the IOC and IIHF have both the players and the sponsors in their corner applying pressure.
Some players have said they will compete in the Olympics regardless of the NHL's decision, while Japanese tire maker Bridgestone, which is both an IOC Top Sponsor and major NHL advertiser, is trying to help push a deal forward.

Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee, has warned of a global shortage of match officials if efforts are not made to tackle abuse and violence towards referees at the grassroots level.
Collina, who was in charge of the 2002 World Cup final between Brazil and Germany, said it is a "real threat" when match officials face verbal and physical abuse in amateur football.
"It's a worldwide problem that we need to consider and we need to take (action) as soon as possible," Collina told Sky Sports.
"We have a huge number of referees working every weekend in grassroots and amateur football. At this level there is something as a threat; it's a physical threat of violence.
"Unfortunately, at this level, instead of paying huge respect for these unknown heroes... they are abused verbally, physically sometimes, this is a real threat."
Collina welcomed initiatives to improve behavior towards the officials.
"Many national associations have launched a campaign, the FA did something like this, also UEFA and FIFA are promoting respect, not only towards referees but football," the 57-year-old Italian added.
"I know that it won't be easy but something has to be done. Certainly top football has to give grassroots football the correct message."

MELBOURNE Fernando Alonso felt lucky to be alive after emerging unscathed from a spectacular crash during last season's Australian Grand Prix but the twice Formula One world champion will give it no thought on his return to Albert Park this year.
Alonso clipped one of the Haas cars at high speed going into turn three of his 18th lap and the impact sent the Spaniard's McLaren careening into a barrier before it flipped, rolled and flew end-over-end into another barrier.
With debris scattered all over the track, Alonso extracted himself from the wreckage and later said safety improvements had probably saved his life.
Returning to Albert Park on Thursday, Alonso said the crash was not on his mind.
"No, no. I try always to forget any of the accidents," he said at the pre-race media conference.
"It was a really big one last year but it will be perfectly OK and I really will be looking forward to going back here.
"I like the circuit and how passionate the fans are when we are on the track. It will be a good experience to go back through those turns."
Alonso has other headaches, chiefly the performance of the Honda-powered McLaren during winter testing.
Drivers on other teams have raved about new technical changes, including fatter tyres and aerodynamic upgrades, which have made the cars faster this season.
But there has been little excitement at McLaren, despite its efforts to re-boot during the off-season under a new team boss and with highly-rated Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne taking the seat vacated by 2009 champion Jenson Button.
The reliability problems remain, and Alonso, who has had two bleak seasons since returning to McLaren in 2015, was scathing of Honda's power units in comments published by his home media during testing.
He was more diplomatic when asked about the team's prospects on Thursday but conceded the Woking-based outfit were still very much up against it.
"Let's wait and see. We've only done the testing period so the first race now will make things more clear," he said.
"There is a question mark exactly where we are. We were not able to push the car to anywhere close to the limit on any lap on testing due to different problems.
"So let's see if we can have a good first weekend and see a little more potential in the car and see where we are. There is still a long way to go for us and a lot of work to do."

MELBOURNE There are "too many dudes" in the paddock at Formula One races and the series needs to improve access for women, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton said on Thursday.
In the leadup to Sunday's Australian Grand Prix, the three-times champion Briton, and other leading drivers, were asked for their wish-lists for the championship and Hamilton had little hesitation championing a more inclusive track-side environment.
"A Miami race and more ladies in the paddock," the 32-year-old said at the pre-race media conference.
"More access for the women, there's too many dudes in the paddock."
Hamilton was more for turning back the clock when it came to the series' power units, however, agreeing with Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo's wish for no more "electric engines" in Formula One.
The current generation of quieter and more fuel-efficient V6 turbo hybrid power units, while technologically impressive, have failed to win over some fans who miss the noisier V8 engines.
Hamilton was less sold on McLaren driver Fernando Alonso's ironic suggestion that teams be given "equal engines".
The 35-year-old Alonso was frustrated with the poor performance of the Honda-powered McLaren cars during winter testing, having already endured two bleak seasons since returning to the team in 2015.
"I don't agree with that one," Hamilton said of Alonso's wish.
"Not electric and not Honda," he quipped, drawing a murmur from reporters.
Most Formula One fans will wish for a more competitive series this year after Mercedes swept the drivers' and constructors' championships for the last three seasons running.
The only serious on-track rivalry has been between Hamilton and his now-retired team mate Nico Rosberg.
Hamilton won 10 of 21 races last season, including the last four in succession, but was still runner-up behind German champion Rosberg, who has been replaced by former Williams driver Valtteri Bottas.
A raft of technical changes, including fatter tires and aerodynamic enhancements, have raised hopes rivals can bridge the gap with the Silver Arrows.
Bookmakers are less convinced, with many installing Hamilton  as unbackable favorite to win a fourth world title and also the race at Albert Park on Sunday.
Hamilton has deflected the hype onto Ferrari, which had fast lap times and impressive reliability during winter testing.
He said he would relish a title fight from Ferrari's four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel this season.
"It's interesting to see, Sebastian is usually a lot more hype," Hamilton said, eliciting a half-smile from the German sitting a meter away from him at the media conference.
"I can tell he's trying to keep a lid on it.
"More teams and more drivers up the front fighting for wins, that's what racing is all about. I'm hoping that's the case."

SAO PAULO Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino will replace Gabriel Jesus in the Brazil team to play Uruguay in Thursday's crunch World Cup qualifier, coach Tite said on Wednesday.
Firmino will replace the injured Manchester City striker to win his 13th cap in Montevideo, where the Brazilians will be looking for an eighth straight win under Tite to all but book a spot in next year's finals in Russia.
"Firmino has come in well, including scoring goals, and he has justified his selection," the coach told reporters.
Brazil go into the match top of the South American qualifying table with 27 points from 12 games and are confident that if they can avoid defeat in Uruguay, and in Paraguay five days later, they will secure their place in Russia.
A tally of 28 points was enough for the fourth-placed team to qualify the 2010 and 2006 tournaments, the last time all 10 South American nations played the qualifiers.
"Classification being so close makes us anxious," Tite admitted ahead of the top-of-the-table clash.
The match is in many ways a tale of two leaders, with the former Corinthians coach having transformed Brazil's fortunes in a seven-game winning streak since taking over last summer.
He will face off against Oscar Tabarez, one of the most experienced managers in world soccer.
Tabarez, 70, has been in charge of Uruguay for 11 years and took them to the semi-final of the World Cup in 2010 and then lifted the Copa America on home soil a year later.
But he has never guided a Uruguay side to victory over Brazil, the only South American side he has never beaten.
Both sides will be missing key players.
In addition to Gabriel Jesus, who has scored five goals in his first six internationals, Brazil will be without Bayern Munich winger Douglas Costa.
The home side, meanwhile, have even bigger problems, with Barcelona striker Luis Suarez, Atletico Madrid defender Jose Maria Gimenez and first choice goalkeeper Fernando Muslera all out through suspension.

World number one Dustin Johnson rolled and Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth stumbled, while Jason Day left to be with his ailing mother in Wednesday's opening day of the WGC-Dell Match Play in Austin, Texas.
Johnson won the first three holes and was 5-up after nine holes and steamrolled Webb Simpson 5&3.
"When you get up real early, you just want to keep the momentum on your side," said Johnson.
Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth were surprise losers in their first round-robin matches at Austin Country Club.
McIlroy, who reached last year's semi-finals, fell 2&1 to Dane Soren Kjeldsen while Japan's Hideto Tanihara, making his first appearance at the tournament, routed Spieth 4&2.
Kjeldsen was 1-down with five to play but rattled off four successive birdies, knocking his last four approaches inside nine feet, with the last three inside four feet.
"I played well. If I had played anyone else, I might have won. Soren played great," said McIlroy.
Northern Irishman McIlroy will play Gary Woodland on Thursday and Argentine Emiliano Grillo on Friday. Woodland beat Grillo 3&2.
Twice major champion Spieth never led against Tanihara, who has 13 career titles overseas. The American played his last nine holes in three over, hitting only one green.
"I knew if I brought my 'A' game, I could probably compete against him," said Tanihara. "I wanted to see how a top player would play and I was just looking forward the whole day."
Next up for the Texan is a clash with Japan's Yuta Ikeda on Thursday and Ryan Moore on Friday. Moore halved his match with Ikeda.
Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and U.S. Ryder Cup Captain Jim Furyk halved, while Brooks Koepka was lights out with the putter in a 6&5 trouncing of fellow American Kevin Kisner.
Day, last year's winner, walked off the course after six holes, revealing to reporters that he was leaving to be with his mother, who is having lung cancer surgery on Friday.
"Hard to comprehend being on the golf course right now with what she's going through," said a tearful Day. "Family is first."
The event is comprised of 16 four-player groups who play round-robin matches from Wednesday through Friday with the winners of each group advancing to a single-elimination bracket at the weekend.
Players receive one point for a win and a half-point for a halved match.

An emotional Jason Day abruptly pulled out of his opening match at the WGC-Dell Match Play on Wednesday to be with his mother, who has been diagnosed with lung cancer and is having surgery on Friday.
"Hard to comprehend being on the golf course right now, with what she's going through," said a tearful Day, who struggled to maintain his composure as he met with reporters after conceding his match at the Austin Country Club.
Day, who was three down to Pat Perez after six holes when he conceded, did not say how long he would be away from the game or whether he would be at the April 6-9 Masters.
"As of now, I am going to be back with my mom," said Day, who had tears streaming down his face. "It's been a very, very hard time for me to be even thinking about playing golf."
Day, 29, said his mother, Adenil "Dening" Day, was given 12 months to live at the start of the year after being diagnosed in Australia. She is in the United States for treatment, and the golfer said the prognosis appears to be better.
Day lost his father, Alvyn, to cancer when he was just 12 years old.
"I've already gone through it once with my dad," the Australian said. "And I know how it feels. And it's hard enough to see another one go through it, as well.
"So as of now, I'm going to try to be back there with my mom for surgery and make sure everything goes right with her."
Day, who has struggled on the course this year with one top 10 in six events as he slipped two spots to world number three, began his news conference by saying his balky back was all right and that he was 100 percent physically before choking with emotion as he explained about his mother.
He gave no timetable for his return to competition.
"Emotionally, it's been weighing on me," said Day. "My mom says not to let it get to me, but it really has so I just need some time away to make sure everything goes well."

(The Sports Xchange) - NFL commissioner Roger Goodell claims he has heard the average fan's discontent about the pace of the game and intends to do something about it.
In an email addressed to the fans on Wednesday, Goodell wrote that the NFL will make a series of changes that will help improve "the flow and pace of the game, and commercialization and the number of necessary disruptions to the game on the field."
Goodell promised in the email that the league will tweak in-game timing and replay reviews, with next season to feature starting of a clock after a player goes out of bounds and the duration of halftime. A play clock also will be instituted after extra points.

CHANGXING, China/MILAN The paper trail for an $800 million bid by little-known Chinese investors for AC Milan, the seven-time European soccer champions, leads via Luxembourg, Hong Kong and a network of shell companies to the deserted 11th floor of the World Trade Centre in Changxing, two hours west of Shanghai.
The storied club announced the sale last August and it was expected to close by the end of last year.
But the bidding group - identified by Milan's owners as Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Co Ltd - has pushed back the payment of cash installments and is negotiating a further delay in closing the deal, two people close to the matter have told Reuters.
The acquisition, announced at the height of China's $3 billion European soccer splurge, has become something of a lightning rod for Beijing's crackdown on overseas vanity deals as it tries to check capital outflows amid a weaker yuan currency.
It also highlights the often obscure and complex network of investors and shell companies behind some Chinese overseas bids - an attraction for those maybe seeking a quiet way to move money abroad, but a potential risk for others involved.
The bidders have paid 200 million euros ($215.7 million) in three tranches to Milan's owner Fininvest, the family company of Italian media tycoon and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. They are due to pay an outstanding 320 million euros and are expected to inject a further 100 million euros into the team.
A likely new deadline for payment is April 7.
The agreement values AC Milan at 740 million euros ($788 million) including 220 million euros of debt.
As pressure from Beijing increases on foreign exchange acquisitions, key investors are pulling back, say those close to the matter.
AC Milan announced the sale with no public signing or press conference, just a few hand-out photographs. The club named only two individual investors - Li Yonghong and Han Li - along with state-linked Haixia Capital and other undisclosed "state-controlled entities".
It's unclear how many of those remain.

"A STEP BACKWARDS"
China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the highest-profile known backers, had pledged to invest around 150 million euros, but backed out of the consortium last month, one of the sources said, prompting the group to ask for more time to pay.
Haixia Capital, which is owned by arms of the provincial Fujian government, State Development and Investment Corp (SDIC) and Taiwanese conglomerate Fubon Group, is still on board, but only in a financing role, the person said.
Among the direct investors, only Li Yonghong remains, the person added. Li is not well known in China or in soccer.
China-based sources at CCB said that recent tighter capital controls would impact the investment, but they were not aware of how the deal would be finalised.
CCB, Haixia Capital and Fubon declined to comment. A spokeswoman for SDIC said she wasn't aware of the deal, and noted that Haixia Capital makes its own investment decisions.
Reuters could not reach the Fujian government for comment. Neither Li nor Han could be contacted.
Berlusconi's son, Pier Silvio, said last week he had no direct information on the deal, but noted that if something were to go wrong there would be no financial damage for Fininvest, as "a step backwards by the buyers would leave something concrete in our hands" - referring to the Chinese payments already made.

"NO ONE EVER COMES HERE"
The head of China's foreign exchange regulator this week became the latest high-profile official to point the finger at overseas deals, including soccer, suggesting some were simply a way to ghost funds out of the country. He gave no specifics.
"If these purchases help improve the standard of Chinese football, then I think that's a good thing," said Pan Gongsheng, head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. "But is that what's really happening? A lot of Chinese companies already have high levels of debt and then borrow another large sum to make overseas purchases. Others pretend to be investing, but are actually just moving their assets."
Italy's football association, the FIGC, says inclusion in its premier soccer league requires solid finances and transparency, with buyers having to disclose financial and banking qualifications within a month of purchase.
The investment vehicle Sino-Europe Sports holds together a web of firms with names like Rossoneri Sport and Sino-Europe Milan. Most are also linked to Chen Huashan, the listed legal representative.
Reuters could not independently reach Chen.
The use of shell companies in deals is not unusual. But soccer dealmakers and lawyers said the complex consortium put the deal at greater risk as Beijing goes cold on mega deals.
Charles Wang, a London-based sports lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said the opaque structure of such deals could increase the risks overseas, though the anonymity it provides is a lure for some investors in China.
Trying to predict whether these deals go through, though, is hard, he said. "There are so many driving forces, known or unknown, behind lots of outbound investments made from China, not only in football, but in other areas where we see active Chinese investors."
A Reuters visit to the Changxing World Trade Centre found that the offices of eight of the shell companies connected to the bid and registered there did not exist.
Guards and office workers said they had heard of Sino-Europe Sports, but had rarely, if ever, seen any employees.
"I've heard about the firm," said Liu Cong, an analyst who works on the same floor. "But no one ever comes here."

MELBOURNE Beefier cars and bulked-up drivers will hit Albert Park circuit on Sunday for Formula One's season-opening Australian Grand Prix where many fans will be hoping at least one team can strike an early blow against dominant Mercedes.
Revised aerodynamics and fatter tires are among a raft of technical changes that pundits feel could bring the Silver Arrows back to earth after they swept the drivers and constructors' championships for the last three years running.
Ferrari's strong performance during winter testing has added to expectations that the sport is in for a shake-up, even as F1's new American managers seek to rejuvenate a series plagued by inertia.
And yet Mercedes, once again, appear primed to ride roughshod over new-season hopes for a changing of the guard.
Nico Rosberg vacated his Mercedes seat in a shock retirement from the sport shortly after winning the drivers' world championship but his old team mate and three-times champion Lewis Hamilton stands poised to take the title back.
German Rosberg thwarted Hamilton's bid for a third successive title and the pair's heated rivalry took its toll on both drivers.
Rosberg's Finnish replacement, Valtteri Bottas, is not seen as someone who will create as many headaches for Hamilton, who will be going for his third victory in Melbourne and 54th overall after winning the last four races of 2016.
"I think he's one of those guys who is not going to be that difficult to manage, especially in the battle with Lewis," Rosberg said of former Williams driver Bottas in a video posting for Formula One sponsor UBS.
"I don't know if he will be able to challenge Lewis or even beat Lewis. That remains to be seen."
Bookmakers have Hamilton a heavy favorite to win at Albert Park, although the Briton has deflected the hype onto Ferrari and four-times F1 champion Sebastian Vettel.
"I think Ferrari are bluffing and that they are a lot quicker than they are showing," Hamilton said at testing in Barcelona.
German Vettel has been busy playing down expectations of a Ferrari renaissance and has become a master of it since crossing to the 'Scuderia' from Red Bull in 2015.
Great expectations followed he and team mate Kimi Raikkonen  to Melbourne last year after a similarly promising testing in the leadup but neither driver won a race all season.
Red Bull are the other team seen snapping at Mercedes' heels if they can avoid reliability problems of the past and drivers Daniel Ricciardo and teenager Max Verstappen, seen as a  champion-in-waiting, can keep their growing rivalry from spoiling their racing.
"We’ve been on six dinners already this week. He brought me breakfast yesterday morning. We don’t share a room ... not yet," Australian Ricciardo joked to reporters on Wednesday when asked about their relationship.
“We try to keep it as amicable as possible."
With bigger tires and more downforce, the new cars are expected to be up to five seconds quicker per lap in Melbourne and drivers have had to hit the gym to be fitter and stronger to cope with the driving demands.
There will be plenty of intrigue as to how the drivers and their tires wear, with Melbourne's changeable weather and the circuit's tight corners adding to the air of unpredictability.


HELSINKI Formula One team Ferrari have set expectations high after strong performances in testing and could pay a heavy price if they disappoint in the season's opening race in Australia, according to retired double world champion Mika Hakkinen.
Ferrari failed to win a race last year, finishing third overall, and their last title was the 2008 constructors' championship.
"I believe that the whole Ferrari team has put enormous pressure on themselves," said Hakkinen, who won his 1998 and 1999 championships with McLaren.
"If they don't perform in the first race as well as their tests have indicated, then it will be a terrible disappointment for the whole team," the Finn said at a promotional event.
"The effect can be damaging and lead to hasty decisions."
Ferrari have Hakkinen's compatriot and fan favorite Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, in their lineup alongside four times champion Sebastian Vettel.
Vettel is the bookmakers' second favorite for the title behind Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton.
Hakkinen said he expected Raikkonen to be more competitive this year thanks to new regulations that have made cars faster but in some cases harder to handle.
"That's based on what I saw in Barcelona. The Ferrari drivers didn't need to worry that they'd lose control of their cars when driving into corners," he said.
"You could see their confidence in their cars. And based on that, I think they are better positioned this season than in previous years."
Finland's big hope this season lies with Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas, who has replaced retired world champion Nico Rosberg.
Hakkinen, who has been closely involved in the former Williams driver's career, said Bottas was capable of winning races alongside Lewis Hamilton.
"He knows the situation, that he is facing a really tough guy. He still has a lot to learn, and he wants to learn more," he said.
"Valtteri will not be disappointed if he does not beat him (Hamilton) in the first or second Grand Prix, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't want to."
Hakkinen also spoke of McLaren, whose relationship with engine partner Honda is under severe strain after poor testing performances.
"It will take an enormous effort ... to solve the problems," he said. "You just need to bring in the right people ... and I'm sure they already have very good people."
   

MELBOURNE Indonesian driver Sean Gelael will take part in three Formula One tests with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso this year, the Italy-based team said on Wednesday.
Gelael, 20, will be at the first in-season test in Bahrain in April, in Hungary just before the August break and in Abu Dhabi after the championship ends in November.
Toro Rosso, preparing for Sunday's Australian season-opener in Melbourne, published the details on their Twitter feed along with a photograph of the driver having a seat fitting at the Faenza factory.
Gelael, who hopes to follow in the footsteps of Indonesia's first Formula One driver Rio Haryanto, will be competing in  Formula Two -- the renamed GP2 feeder series -- this year after making his debut in 2016.
Haryanto is no longer in Formula One after losing his seat with now-defunct Manor.
Gelael's father Ricardo runs the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) franchise for Indonesia and was linked last year to a takeover of Manor.

MELBOURNE Renault said they have fixed their pre-season power unit problems with a "belt and braces" approach ahead of Formula One's Australian Grand Prix opener.
Issues with the unit's Energy Recovery System (ERS) limited the team's mileage in the second Barcelona test this month, although the car was clearly a significant step up on last year's.
"We have addressed the ERS issue which caused us reliability concerns and do not expect to see a repeat of it in Australia," Renault Sport F1 managing director Cyril Abiteboul said in a team preview for Sunday's race in Melbourne.
"We know we have a strong base with the RS17 (car) which puts us in good stead for the relentless development race we expect to see," he added.
Technical head Bob Bell said he was "reasonably confident" after testing.
"Even though we did experience some issues we don't have any overriding concerns over reliability as we accumulated sufficient data and have taken remedial and precautionary measures to address the particular ERS issue we saw," he said.
Bell said the ERS issue had been seen previously in static dyno tests at the factory "but packaged in the car and out on track it was amplified.
"Since Barcelona we've adopted a belt and braces approach to avoid a similar issue in Melbourne," he added.
Renault have a changed lineup this season, with Germany's Nico Hulkenberg coming in from Force India to partner Britain's Jolyon Palmer, and an all-new power unit that they hope will help close the gap to Mercedes.
The former champions finished ninth last year, their return as a constructor after taking over the failing Lotus team at the end of 2015, but have set their sights on fifth in 2017.
Hulkenberg expected Renault to be among the midfield teams in Australia but improving steadily.

BERLIN The head of European athletics has called on Frank Fredericks to step down from the world athletics' (IAAF) federation council pending an investigation into allegations he accepted payments before the awarding of the 2016 Olympics to Rio de Janeiro.
A statement issued on Wednesday by Svein Arne Hansen, who does not name Fredericks but clearly refers to his case, comes a day after IAAF president Sebastian Coe said the Namibian would stay on the council while the ethics board decides if an investigation is necessary.
"In recent weeks the IAAF Council has been confronted with new and disturbing integrity-linked accusations related to one of its members," Hansen said in his statement on Wednesday.
"In my personal opinion, any individual who finds themselves under such suspicion now or in the future should step aside from all their sport-related duties until the issue is resolved as it is not good for the organization they serve."
As well as being in charge of European Athletics, Hansen, like Fredericks, is an IAAF Council member.
"I want to emphasize that in the current case we are dealing with allegations and must always presume innocence until they are proven," Hansen added.
"However, should the allegations turn out to be true, they would reveal an extremely disappointing betrayal of athletics and its values, which would damage the sport's image in the eyes of its supporters and the public."
Former sprinter Fredericks, an International Olympic Committee member, stepped down two weeks ago as head of the IOC team evaluating bids to host the 2024 Games and has also removed himself from the IAAF task force looking into doping in Russia.
French newspaper Le Monde had reported that Fredericks received almost $300,000 from Papa Massata Diack, the son of disgraced former IAAF President Lamine Diack, prior to the election of Rio as the 2016 Olympics hosts back in 2009.
Fredericks has said he received the money but denied any wrongdoing, saying it was for "services rendered" to promote the sport in Africa and had nothing to do with the Rio vote.
The IOC has also launched an investigation into the matter.
French prosecutors are investigating whether bribery was involved in the awarding of the 2021 world athletics championships to the U.S. city of Eugene and are also looking into several other host city decisions.

British freestyle wrestler Chinu Sandhu, who won bronze at the Commonwealth Games in 2014, has been handed a four-year ban for a doping violation.
Sandhu tested positive for an anabolic steroid in an out-of-competition test administered on Sept. 20 and an independent National Anti-Doping Panel (NDAP) upheld the charge against him.
The 29-year-old had contested the charge on the grounds that he had not acted intentionally and that the positive test resulted from taking a contaminated supplement.
"Chinu Sandhu, an experienced British wrestler, has been suspended for a period of four years following a proven Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV)...," the NDAP said on the Sport Resolutions website (www.sportresolutions.co.uk) on Wednesday.
"Mr Sandhu's ban will run from 14 October 2016 until 14 October 2020," the statement added.
UK Anti-Doping chief Nicole Sapstead said that Sandhu's reputation had been "tainted because of his own actions.
"Athletes are solely responsible for any substance which is found in their system, regardless of whether there is an intention to cheat or not.
"Chinu Sandhu was one of this country's leading freestyle wrestlers having won a bronze medal at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and represented Great Britain at the European Games in Baku in 2015," she added.

McLaren's last podium finish was in Australia in 2014 (Magnussen).
Russian Daniil Kvyat has failed to start the last two races in Melbourne due to technical problems.

MILESTONE
Formula One has no reigning champion on the grid for the first time since 1994, the season after French great Alain Prost retired.


The United States tagged on an eighth-inning run to edge out Japan 2-1 at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday to advance to the World Baseball Classic (WBC) final for a first time.
Adam Jones provided the decisive play when he broke a keenly-contested 1-1 tie with a ground ball out to third base that scored Brandon Crawford and eliminated two-time WBC champions Japan at the semi-final stage.
"We're one game away from doing something we've never done before," American outfielder Andrew McCutchen said in an on-field interview. "This is awesome to have the opportunity to be here."
The U.S. advances to face unbeaten Puerto Rico in the championship game at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday.
The Puerto Ricans (7-0) edged Netherlands 4-3 in their semi-final on Monday to book a second straight trip to the finals after losing to the Dominican Republic in 2013.    Seven U.S. pitchers combined to limit Japan, who were the only other undefeated team in the tournament prior to Tuesday's loss.
Rght-hander Tanner Roark made his second appearance and first start of the event, giving up two hits and no runs in four innings before being replaced.
Luke Gregerson came on in the ninth to shut down Japan with three straight outs as he recorded his third save of the WBC.
McCutchen gave the Americans a 1-0 lead in the fourth inning on an RBI single, while Japan tied the contest with a sixth-inning home run from Ryosuke Kikuchi.
The winning run was set up when Crawford singled off Kodai Senga (1-1) with one out in the eighth, and Ian Kinsler followed with a double that brought Jones up to bat.
Japan starter Tomoyuki Sugano tossed six innings and allowed one run in the no-decision.    The WBC has not always drawn many of the top American players to the competition but McCutchen was hopeful that this year's run could help change that.
"We don't focus on who's not here we focus on who is here," McCutchen said.
"Hopefully in the near future guys will want to play more after they see what we're doing now."
The finalist have already met in this year's tournament when Puerto Rico edged the United States 6-5 at Petco Park, San Diego in a second round pool game last Friday.

NEW YORK Frank Fredericks will stay on the IAAF Council while an ethics board reviews allegations that he accepted payments before the awarding of the 2016 Olympics to Rio, Sebastian Coe, the organization's head, said on Tuesday.
Fredericks, an International Olympic Committee member, stepped down two weeks ago as head of the team evaluating bids to host the 2024 Olympics and has also removed himself from the IAAF task force looking into doping in Russia.
Despite the allegations, however, he will remain a member of the IAAF council while the ethics board determines if an investigation is necessary.
"We are speaking with Frank; he has stepped aside from the Russian task force so he has stepped aside from his functions within the council," Coe told Reuters following a presentation at the Leaders Sport Business Summit on Tuesday.
Doping and votes-for-pay controversies continue to haunt athletics as Coe desperately tries to push away the dark clouds by implementing reforms he hopes will put the spotlight back on the track.
Asked if he believed other IAAF council members could be caught up in the scandal, Coe said he had no idea.
"We are just getting on with delivering sport," said Coe. "We are the subject of scrutiny and investigation but I can't give you any insight into that at all."
French prosecutors are investigating whether bribery was involved in the awarding of the 2021 world athletics championships to the U.S. city of Eugene and are also looking into several other host city decisions.
Despite the distractions Coe told an audience of influential sports business people that he remains focused on restoring confidence and trust in athletics and returning the sport to its former glory.
While cleaning up years of scandal have taken up much of Coe's time it is the future that most concerns him and how to make the sport more attractive to fans and viewers.
He said some hints were provided by the recent Nitro Athletics Series event in Melbourne won by the Usain Bolt-led team of international 'All-Stars.'
Coe admitted 'power play' events that award double points to winners and gimmicks such as the mile eliminations and mixed distance medleys all played out to rock music soundtrack would leave purists cringing but change was necessary.
"You don't expect everything you see on the catwalk to ending up on coat hangers in retail stores," said Coe. "I think Nitro gave us some clues. We have to do more to connect.
"I saw three nights of full houses. ..most sports have innovative and we have been slow.
MELBOURNE Valtteri Bottas is determined to make the most of his "dream" opportunity after being ushered into the Mercedes seat left vacant by the sudden retirement of Formula One champion Nico Rosberg at the end of last season.
The Finn has proved his pace over 77 races with Williams but knows he will be stepping up into the big leagues when he starts his first race for the reigning constructors' champions at this week's Australian Grand Prix.
"It's a great challenge for everyone, but I think especially for me," Bottas told reporters in Melbourne.
"This team has been winning the last three years and it's kind of a dream come true for me to be in a team like this. So, it's a big year ahead."
Expectations are indeed high at Mercedes, and if Bottas fails to at least support the team's charge for a fourth successive constructors' title with regular podiums and points there will be no shortage of drivers waiting to replace him for 2018.
Although he finished fourth in the drivers' championship in 2014 and has accumulated nine podiums and 411 points over his career, Bottas has never won a race.
Melbourne has thrown up a few surprises but Bottas is not banking on breaking his duck at Albert Park, however much he would love to.
"That would be the perfect way to start a season and my career with Mercedes, but I'm not thinking about it too much," he added.
"Obviously, it's the only thing I want, but I always want to focus on my job and work as a team and if we do our work perfectly, if I do my job perfectly, it's possible.
"But yeah, definitely, the goal for me is to start a season in a good way and get the results early on and continue from there."
Bottas has already been welcomed with open arms by fellow Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton but the Briton's history with former team mates, including Rosberg, suggests the bonhomie would not last long if the Finn was a genuine title contender.
As the winner of 10 of the 21 races in 2016, including the last four, Hamilton is the clear championship favourite this season and expectations are high that he will win the Australian Grand Prix for the third time on Sunday.
Bottas showed off one skill advantage that he almost certainly has over his team mate when he took to the ice hockey rink with players from Melbourne Ice and Melbourne Mustangs on Tuesday.
And the 27-year-old made clear he would not be moving over to let Hamilton through if he got in front of the triple world champion on the Albert Park track.
"I think Mercedes doesn't have number one or number two driver and that's pretty much up to me to perform," he said.
"That is to perform on the track on the level where the car should be. We're all good and I know I can do it."

Hong Kong have withdrawn from their Davis Cup tie against Pakistan in Islamabad citing security concerns, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said in a statement on Tuesday.
Pakistan have been forced to play home Davis Cup ties in the Asia/Oceania group abroad since 2010 because of the security situation in the country, but international tennis returned last month.
Pakistan beat Iran 3-2 in a first-round tie in Islamabad in what was the first Davis Cup match in the country in 12 years.
Hong Kong had challenged the Davis Cup Committee's decision to approve matches in Pakistan, and withdrew following an independent tribunal ruling that the tie should go ahead.
"The ITF regrets and respectfully disagrees with the decision of Hong Kong, China to default its upcoming Davis Cup tie against Pakistan," the federation said.
"The ITF takes the security of all players, team personnel, officials and spectators very seriously. We are entirely confident in the security risk management procedures we have in place."
Pakistan have advanced to the third round of Asia/Oceania group II as a result of Hong Kong's withdrawal and will host the winner of the tie between the Philippines and Thailand.
The case will be sent back to the independent tribunal to determine if Hong Kong have breached tournament regulations.
Pakistan has been largely starved of international sport since armed gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore in 2009. Six players were hurt while two civilians and six security officials were killed in that attack.
A tour by Zimbabwe's cricket team in 2015 was almost disrupted when a suicide bomber killed two security officials near a stadium.
Cricket is by far the most popular sport in Pakistan, but their national team have played all their home matches at neutral venues abroad ever since the 2009 attack.
Earlier this month, several overseas cricketers withdrew from Pakistan's domestic Twenty20 cricket league final after their cricket board announced the match would be held on home soil.
The final, which was the first-ever Pakistan Super League match to be played in the country, went ahead in the eastern city of Lahore on March 5.

Manchester United's German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has signed a one-year deal to join Chicago Fire, the Major League Soccer club announced on Tuesday.
The 32-year-old World Cup winner, who joined United at the start of last season, has ended a difficult spell under coach Jose Mourinho, having fallen out of favor since the Portuguese arrived at the club at the start of the current campaign.
"I am sad to leave so many friends at Manchester United," Schweinsteiger told the club website (www.manutd.com).
"But I am grateful to the club for allowing me the chance to take up the challenge at Chicago Fire.
"I have enjoyed working with the manager, the players and staff here and wish them all the best in the future. But I have to reserve special thanks to the United fans -- whose support has been a very special part of my time in Manchester."
Fire's general manager Nelson Rodriguez believes the club are getting a proven winner in the former Germany midfielder, who must pass a medical and get a visa before joining.

HISTORIC MOMENT
"This is a historic moment for our club," Rodriguez said on the official Fire website (www.chicago-fire.com).
"Bastian’s talents, attitude, and character will be a perfect complement to our squad as we continue building a championship program."
Schweinsteiger spent 13 seasons with Bayern Munich before joining United, winning eight Bundesliga titles, seven German Cups and the Champions League in 2013.
He was also part of the 2014 World Cup-winning squad and represented his country 121 times before announcing his international retirement last July.
But he never got a chance under Mourinho, with Germany coach Joachim Loew saying Schweinsteiger could have helped United.
"I talked with him and he said he gave it everything in the past few months. There was some hope but for the longer term Manchester United were maybe planning without him," Loew told reporters on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's friendly with England.
"It is a shame that it ended that way at Manchester. He could have helped them, in my opinion. He could have been their organizer in that midfield position."
Chicago have finished last overall in the MLS for the past two seasons.

Puerto Rico made it to their second straight World Baseball Classic final on Monday with a 4-3 extra-innings win over the Netherlands at Dodger Stadium.
Eddie Rosario's sacrifice fly drove in Carlos Correa in the bottom of the 11th inning to seal the semi-final triumph and set up a decider against the United States or Japan, who square off in the other semi on Tuesday.
“We want to win it all, that’s our goal,” Correa said after scoring the winning run. “This is one of the best moments of my baseball career so far.
"Doing it for my country means everything to me.”
Correa opened the inning at second base and Enrique Hernandez was placed at first in a game played under international tiebreaker rules.
Yadier Molina's sacrifice bunt moved the runners before Javier Baez was intentionally walked by Loek Van Mil (0-1).
Rosario hit the first pitch to send Puerto Rico to the title game for the second consecutive tournament after they fell to the Dominican Republic in 2013.
“Unfortunately, (the last time) didn’t go our way. (But), the fact that we were able to get this win today, I know Puerto Rico is celebrating and we’re excited for them,” said Carlos Beltran.
“The future is so bright for Puerto Rico.”
Netherlands outfielder Wladimir Balentien gave his team a 2-0 lead in the opening inning with a two-run homer off right-hander Jorge Lopez.
Correa responded for Puerto Rico in the bottom of the first with his third homer of the tournament to tie the score at 2-2.
T.J. Rivera gave Puerto Rico a 3-2 lead with a solo homer in the second inning, but the Netherlands tied it in the fifth on an RBI double from Shawn Zarraga.

SEOUL South Korea is taking steps to ensure the safety of its soccer players and fans as national men's and women's teams prepare for matches in China and North Korea amid tense diplomatic relations between the Asian neighbors.
Seoul's Unification Ministry said on Tuesday it had asked North Korea to provide safety assurances for its players ahead of next month's AFC Women's Asian Cup qualifier in Pyongyang.
"The government has asked North Korea to provide written assurances for the safety of South Korean football players," Yonhap quoted a ministry official as saying.
With the countries still technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce and not a peace treaty, the Seoul government must sign off on the team's trip to Pyongyang.
Earlier this month, a men's Asian Cup qualifier between North Korea and Malaysia was postponed after the Malaysian FA asked for the game to be moved away from Pyongyang following a breakdown in relations.
The countries have become embroiled in a simmering row after Malaysia accused North Korea of assassinating Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of Pyongyang ruler Kim Jong Un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13.

'EXTRA CAUTION'
The Seoul Unification Ministry's comments follow reports that the South Korean embassy in Beijing had issued a safety warning ahead of the men's 2018 World Cup qualifier in Hunan province on Thursday.
Relations between Seoul and Beijing became strained after South Korea reached an agreement with the United States on the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system.
The United States and South Korea say THAAD is for defense against North Korea but China fears its powerful radar can probe deep into its territory and compromise security.
Yonhap said the embassy had issued a warning to South Korean nationals in China to exercise caution ahead of the AFC third round Group A encounter in Changsha.
"South Koreans staying in or visiting China must ensure they cheer on the national team in as orderly a fashion as possible," the embassy's message read.
"Please take extra caution not to cause trouble with the Chinese people with unnecessary words or actions."

SYDNEY International Olympic Committee vice president John Coates has welcomed the decision of the club which will host the golf tournaments at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to admit women as full members.
The private Kasumigaseki Country Club took the decision to change its bylaws at an extraordinary board meeting on Monday after being told last month that the IOC would find another venue if the policy remained unaltered.
"As we have said all along, gender equality is a fundamental principle of the Olympic Movement and an important part of Olympic Agenda 2020, and we believe this decision now reflects this," Coates, the head of the IOC coordination commission which advises Tokyo Games organizers, said.
"While we had made our position on non-discrimination clear as soon as we became aware of their rules, it was important that the members of the club be given the opportunity to make the change in their good time.
"It is their club and at the end of the day we had to be welcomed by them."
The club in Saitama prefecture, which is scheduled to host both men's and women's tournaments in July and August 2020, had forbidden women from playing on Sundays or becoming full members.
Several notable golf clubs have changed their policies to allow female members in recent years.
In 2014, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews decided to allow women to join following 260 years of exclusion, after Augusta National, home of the U.S. Masters, had ended its men-only membership two years earlier.
Last week, Muirfield voted to admit women members, scrapping a policy that led to the historic Scottish links course being stripped of its eligibility to host the British Open.

TOKYO Japan captain Makoto Hasebe has withdrawn from the squad for this week's World Cup qualifier against the United Arab Emirates, averting a potential standoff with his German club Eintracht Frankfurt over a knee problem.
The 33-year-old, who has been Japan skipper since 2010,arrived in the UAE late on Sunday despite his Bundesliga club saying he needed an operation on a knee injury sustained in a 3-0 defeat by Bayern Munich on March 11.
On Monday, though, the midfielder said he had traveled to join the squad with the blessing of Eintracht but would now go to Japan to get another diagnosis of the injury.
"There is a good chance I will go under the knife. I'll return to Japan for a third opinion with a trusted doctor," Hasebe told reporters in Al Ain according to Kyodo news.
"I'm leaving the team just before this crucial match and I feel really bad. Obviously, I am very disappointed and it has been a very difficult decision to make.
"But I don't think this will have too much of a negative impact on the team. I trust my team mates 100, 120 percent."
Japan are second in Group B of Asia's qualifying tournament for the Russia 2018 finals, level on points with Saudi Arabia and one ahead of third-placed Australia and the UAE. Only the top two teams are guaranteed to qualify for the finals.

KEY FIGURE
Hasebe has been a key figure for Japan for much of the last decade, helping the team win the 2011 Asian Cup and qualify for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.
"Hasebe is a very strong captain for us," said coach Vahid Halilhodzic when he announced his squad last week. "Having a team without him in it is unthinkable."
The former Urawa Red Diamonds standout was injured when he collided with a post while clearing a Thomas Mueller shot off the line against Bayern.
He was taken to hospital after the game to have a wound on his left shin stitched but later broke down in training and the club decided he would need an operation.
Halilhodzic, who took over as Japan coach following Javier Aguirre's departure in early 2015, has been under pressure following several unconvincing displays, including a shock 2-1 loss to the Emirates in the opening match of the round.
"Ever since losing the first game against the UAE at home I have wanted to come here and erase the disappointment of that defeat," Hasebe added.
"I have played well with my club with that feeling in mind and to get this injury just before the game is heartbreaking."
Japan, who are seeking a sixth straight appearance at the World Cup, take on the UAE on Thursday before returning home to face Thailand on Tuesday.

Leicester City's Jamie Vardy has said he was subjected to death threats and his wife targeted by aggressive motorists after allegations that he contributed to the sacking of manager Claudio Ranieri.
The 30-year-old striker, on England duty for this week's friendly with Germany and World Cup qualifier against Lithuania, said he had suffered abuse walking along the street and also said his wife had been repeatedly "cut up" while driving.
Ranieri left the Midlands club in February, just nine months after winning the Premier League title, with Leicester 17th in the standings and battling relegation. Vardy has since faced accusations of influencing the decision to sack the Italian.
The allegation he attended a meeting called by Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha at East Midlands airport hours after the 2-1 defeat at Sevilla in a Champions league last 16 first-leg tie on Feb. 23 had prompted the abuse, Vardy said.
Several Leicester players, backed up by Ranieri's successor and former assistant Craig Shakespeare, have denied media reports that there was a player revolt against Ranieri.
"It is terrifying," Vardy told the BBC on Monday.
"I read one story that said I was personally involved in a meeting after the Sevilla game when I was actually sat in anti-doping for three hours.
"But then the story is out there, people pick it up and jump on it and you're getting death threats about your family, kids, everything."
Vardy has not accused Leicester fans of the abuse and has not considered reporting it to the police.
Asked where the abuse came from, Vardy said: "On social media, you name it – walking down the street.
"To be honest I get them (taunts) every week. Football fans don’t seem to like me. I just get on with it but when people are trying to cut your missus up while she’s driving along, with the kids in the back of the car it’s not the best. It’s happened plenty of times."
Vardy said there was no problem between Ranieri and the Leicester players during the Italian's time in charge.
"No, not at all. Basically if there was an issue you went and did it in the gaffer’s office, man-to-man. Or you went and did it on the tactics board, because he was happy for you to come in and put your opinion across," he added.
"The stories were quite hurtful to be honest with you. A lot of false accusations were being thrown out there and there was nothing we, as players, could do about it."

The U.S. women's ice hockey team threatening to boycott the world championships over a wage dispute held productive talks with USA Hockey on Monday and will continue discussions this week in the hope of reaching a deal.
Nearly 20 players and their lawyers met with USA Hockey executives in Philadelphia to discuss "equitable support and fair wages" in a last-ditch effort to reach a deal before the tournament in Michigan begins on March 31, the team said.
"The discussions were productive and will continue this week, with the goal of reaching an agreement that would allow the players to get to camp in time to train for and compete in the world championships," said a team statement.
"The players are hopeful they will get to take to the ice and represent their country."
The women's team, citing a lack of progress in year-long negotiations, threatened not to report for training camp on Wednesday unless adequate progress in the dispute was made.
USA Hockey then imposed a deadline of last Thursday for the team to decide whether to play in the tournament being hosted by the U.S. but the players opted to let that deadline pass.
Players are under contract to USA Hockey only during years when the Winter Olympics are held and are seeking a deal that would compensate them during non-Olympic years.
USA Hockey also called the latest talks productive and confirmed that further discussions will continue this week.
"Our goal remains to have the players we previously announced as the U.S. Women's National Team be the group that represents our country at the upcoming 2017 IIHF Women’s World Championship," USA Hockey said in a statement.

Reuters photographer Paul Hanna covered this month's FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboard World Championships in Spain's Sierra Nevada mountains. Below is his account of capturing the breathtaking mid-air images.

Photographing sports usually includes a mixture of patience, timing, positioning, perseverance, access, knowledge - and sheer luck.
Knowing how a sport unfolds and how to position oneself to capture the key action moment or emotion before it is gone is essential.
When it comes to winter sports, the job usually involves skiing into position with a heavy backpack carrying all the day's camera gear. Photographers also needs crampons to stop them sliding down into the course from their shooting position.
With such technical and physical demands, covering a competitive winter event such as the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboard World Championships can be a grueling physical feat.
The key to capturing the beauty of freestyle skiing is about getting the images of competitors flipping and twisting their way through the evening sky. The amount of time the competitors spend in the air is impressive.
The photo of China's Qi Guangpu performing an aerial during the men's aerial training was taken as the sun was setting over the mountains. But capturing the aerial as well as the fading sunset was difficult as there was no vantage point to get the two elements in the same frame. Cables blocked the view to the jumps and my position was too low to capture very high jumps.
A small scaffolding tower holding a few cables up became my best bet.
Without waiting to see if anyone would object and laden with cameras, I managed to scale the tower and photograph a handful of athletes before the light disappeared.
It was not the most comfortable shooting position with one foot wedged between a bar and the other leg wrapped around another bar for support.
At times during the event, I was also allowed underneath the jump to shoot pointing straight up as the athletes shot off the ramp into the night sky. The spray of snow appeared like stars  - a picturesque setting for the athletes' impressive feats.

The New England Patriots jersey that vanished after quarterback Tom Brady wore it in the team's fifth Super Bowl victory last month has been found in Mexico, officials said on Monday.
The jersey and a second one Brady wore in a championship victory two years earlier were taken by a former Mexican media executive who had been credentialed to cover the February game in Houston, according to the National Football League and law enforcement officials.
Mexican authorities found the missing jersey at the home of Martin Mauricio Ortega, a former director of Mexico's La Prensa newspaper, in a raid following a Federal Bureau of Investigation request, a government source told Reuters.
Ortega has not been arrested because he has not yet been charged, the source added, but the investigation is ongoing.
Ortega could not be reached for comment on Monday.
The Houston Police Department and league security were involved in the investigation, along with the FBI.
"You don't come to Texas and embarrass us here on our own turf," Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told reporters on Monday. He said the case, while not a major crime, had been investigated because "the only blemish that we had from the Super Bowl was these jerseys that were stolen from the locker room."
La Prensa said in a statement it had been informed that Ortega had been involved in the theft.
"If it turns out to be true, (La Prensa) strongly rejects the conduct of Martin Ortega ... who took advantage of the position he had to use the La Prensa newspaper to get accreditation and gain access to the field," it said in a statement.
Ortega resigned last Tuesday, citing personal reasons.
The jersey could have been sold to a collector for "great monetary gain," Acevedo said.
Brady told reporters the morning after the Patriots' 34-28 overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons that he had packed up the jersey bearing his No. 12 after the game, but it had disappeared.
"It's unfortunate, because that's a nice piece of memorabilia," he told reporters at the time. "Those are pretty special ones to keep. What can you do? I'll take the ring and that's good enough for me."
While the 39-year-old quarterback still has his Super Bowl rings, the team's owner, Robert Kraft, is lacking one of the diamond-encrusted mementoes.
Russian President Vladimir Putin walked away with Kraft's ring commemorating the team's 2005 Super Bowl win over the Philadelphia Eagles when the two met later that year. Kraft has said he intended only to show Putin the ring but the leader kept it.

Iraq may ask United States-born striker Justin Meram to rethink his decision not to join up with the squad for their World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia next week.
With the Iraqis' qualifier against Australia on Thursday being played in Tehran due to long-standing security concerns in Iraq, Meram decided not to accept last week's call-up.
Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order temporarily banning the entry of travelers from six Muslim-majority countries, including Iran.
Saudi Arabia is not on the list, and with several Iraqi players at risk of picking up suspensions against Australia, officials at the Iraq FA hope Meram will change his mind and travel to Jeddah for the game on March 28.
"We talked to the team's head coach in this regard two days ago," a team spokesman told Reuters.
"He has not made a final decision, but he may recall him because 11 players currently with the team have been cautioned in previous matches and the coach fears maybe one or more of them will receive another yellow card that will suspend them for the match against Saudi Arabia."
Meram, who was born in Michigan to Iraqi parents, had said in an earlier statement on his Instagram page that he would not participate in the qualifiers due to reasons beyond his control.
"I have spoken with our manager, Radhi Shenaishil, and I appreciate his, and the IFA's, understanding of my difficult situation," he wrote.
"This is certainly not a permanent break from the national team and I look forward to representing my country again in the future."
Iraq are trying to qualify for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 but have picked up just one win in their opening five games and are in fourth place in their group.
They trail joint-leaders Saudi Arabia and Japan by seven points with five games remaining. Only two teams qualify automatically for Russia 2018, with the third-placed team entering into playoffs.

ANKARA Turkey's president, who has angered European allies with charges of fascism and anti-Turkish skullduggery, took grievances to the sporting arena on Monday, accusing the International Olympic Committee of playing tricks to stop Istanbul hosting the event.
Since the early years of his political career, Tayyip Erdogan has longed to bring the Olympics to Turkey, making it the first predominantly Muslim country to stage the event. Turkey has had five failed bids in the last six votes.
"We may not have been able to bring the Olympics to our country yet, but you also know about the tricks being played here... I've experienced it myself," he told an International soccer summit in Istanbul, without specifying what the tricks might be.
"They did not give us the Olympics even when we had the right. They gave the Olympics for the second time to those who hosted it before."
Erdogan has sought to raise Turkey's international profile and influence, not shrinking from conflict with allies.
This month, he has accused Germany of backing a network he blames for a failed coup and charged the Netherlands and Germany with fascism in banning Turkish politicians campaigning with Turkish expatriates for a referendum on new presidential powers. Europe, he says, is mired in racism.
In 2013, Tokyo won the 2020 Games, beating rival bids from Istanbul and Madrid. Turkey's chances were seen as having been dented by mass anti-government protests in Istanbul.
Erdogan, who previously served as mayor of Istanbul, said Turkey had proven its ability to host major events, adding its sports infrastructure had grown dramatically in his 14 years in national government.
Turkey hosted the European Youth Olympic Festival in its eastern province of Erzurum in February 2016. The event marked the first time Turkey hosted the event in 25 years.

ZAGREB Croatia will play to their first full home crowd at a competitive match for almost two and a half years this week, in a World Cup qualifier which coach Ante Cacic hopes will show his side has healthy support.
Hooliganism meant fans were banned from several home matches - the last time they had a full home crowd was in a 6-0 win over Azerbaijan in October 2014 - but Friday's clash against Ukraine will give them a chance to refute claims that Croatians are not fond of the national side.
"Finally, we will have the massive home crowd support we need," Cacic told a news conference after naming his squad to face the Ukrainians on Friday. The Croatians top Group 1 with 10 points from four games, two more than second-placed Ukraine.
"I am confident the match against the Ukrainians will deny a loud minority claiming that most Croatian football fans don't like the national team and want to boycott us," Cacic said.
Croatia last enjoyed partial home support in March 2015 at a 5-1 win over Norway in Zagreb's Maksimir stadium, where a section of the ground was closed for the Euro 2016 qualifier after fans had caused crowd trouble in a 1-1 draw at Italy.
The match against the Norwegians was marred by racist chants and that forced the Croatians to play their next home game against Italy behind closed doors in Split, where a swastika emblazoned on the pitch by a chemical agent days before the kick off became visible during the game.
"I am a man of the people and I can see for myself how much the people love the national team," Cacic said. "The team means a lot more to our nation than some people suggest with their poisonous attitude."
Cacic will be forced to field a makeshift side against Ukraine, with defenders Sime Vrsaljko and Vedran Corluka injured and winger Ivan Perisic suspended.
Asked whether he considered recalling Liverpool's out-of-favor defender Dejan Lovren, Cacic said:
"Not now, but if he is fit and playing for his club in May, he will be in contention."

LONDON Drug use in amateur sport in Britain is 'fast becoming a crisis', UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said on Monday in response to a BBC poll that revealed widespread use of performance enhancing substances at grassroot levels.
Some 35 percent of the 1,025 adult men and women members of amateur sports clubs, teams and gyms who were polled said they personally knew someone who had doped, and eight percent had taken steroids.
Half felt the use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) was widespread among those who played competitive sport and 49 percent thought drugs were easily available.
The online poll was carried out by ComRes between Jan 27-31, 2017.
"The figures as regards the prevalence of performance-enhancing substances at an amateur level are incredibly alarming," UKAD chief Nicole Sapstead told the BBC.
"I don't think any sport can say that they don't have a problem at an amateur level."
Sapstead said UKAD needed greater powers and extra cash from individual sports governing bodies to "address what is fast becoming a crisis for sport".


ZURICH FIFA has banned a Ghanaian match official from soccer for life after he took part in match manipulation during a World Cup qualifier, the sport's governing body said on Monday.
Joseph Odartei Lamptey was found guilty of breaching FIFA's disciplinary code during the game between South Africa and Senegal on Nov. 12, 2016.
Zurich-based FIFA said it was dismissing all charges against another Ghanaian match official, David Lionheart Nii Lartey Laryea, following an investigation.

SAO PAULO Brazil visit Uruguay on World Cup duty this week, with midfielder Casemiro suggesting the absence of Luis Suarez will give the five-times champions an advantage in the top-of-the-table clash in Montevideo.
The Barcelona striker has scored 31 goals in 41 appearances for his club this season but will miss the Brazil game after picking up a yellow card in Uruguay's last World Cup qualifier, a 3-1 defeat by Chile.
It was only his second yellow in eight games but came at an opportune time for Brazil, Casemiro said.
"We can't deny it, of course it's better playing Uruguay without Suarez," the Real Madrid player said on Brazilian radio on Monday morning. "Suarez is a great player."
The striker missed the first four games of the South American qualifiers as part of a nine-game international ban imposed after biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in the 2014 World Cup.
Uruguay won three of their first four qualifiers without him and have continued their run of good form to sit second in the 10-team South American qualifying group with 23 points from 12 games.
Brazil, who have won their last six qualifiers under new manager Tite, top the table with 27 points and believe they are just a point or two away from securing one of the four automatic qualification places for Russia 2018.
Twenty-eight points was enough to qualify the fourth-placed team for the 2010 and 2006 tournaments, the last time all 10 South American nations played the qualifiers.
"We hope to qualify now," said defender Gil. "Our thoughts are always on winning and we hope to cement our place for the World Cup, and a draw (could do that)," he said.
After the Uruguay game, Brazil face Paraguay in Sao Paulo five days later.

LONDON Formula One's new rules are "just what the doctor ordered", even if rival teams have become more competitive, according to Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff.
The Austrian said in a preview for Sunday's Australian season-opener in Melbourne that Mercedes, the dominant team of the past three years, faced a big challenge.
"We have been very successful over the last three years through stable rules -- but no team has ever maintained its success over such a big regulation change before," said Wolff.
"In a way, it's just what the doctor ordered. To have such a challenge is good for the team.
"We have done the best job we possibly could over the winter and, if we are not the fastest in Melbourne, then it's about finding out why and what needs to be done to get us back to that top spot."
Ferrari emerged from pre-season testing with the quickest times, although the Mercedes pairing of triple champion Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas did the most laps with impressive reliability.
Bottas, previously with Williams, has replaced 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg, who retired days after winning his first title.
Hamilton, winner of 53 grands prix over his career to date, starts the season as favorite for a fourth championship and to win the opening race.
Bookmakers William Hill have the Briton at 10/11 for Melbourne, with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel second favorite at 7/2 and Bottas at 6/1.
"We believe that it is going to be another Mercedes procession but the Australian Grand Prix is often unpredictable," said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams.
Wolff said testing in Barcelona had indicated "that the margins at the front of the field have shrunk," although there was no way of knowing for sure.
Teams use testing to experiment with fuel loads and power unit settings.
Mercedes have won 51 of 59 grands prix since the 1.6 liter V6 turbo hybrid units were introduced. The team also started all but one of last season's races on pole position.
Ferrari and Red Bull are the only teams to have beaten Mercedes since 2013.

The club scheduled to hold the 2020 Tokyo Olympics golf events voted to admit women as full members on Monday, scrapping an all-male policy that had been heavily criticized and put its hosting rights in jeopardy.
The private Kasumigaseki Country Club took the decision to change its bylaws at an extraordinary board meeting after being told last month that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would find another venue if the policy remained unaltered.
The Saitama prefecture venue is scheduled to host both men's and women's tournaments in July and August 2020 but rules forbidding women from both playing on Sundays or becoming full members had been roundly condemned, leading to Monday's vote.
"We are pleased to learn that the Kasumigaseki Country Club voted today... to amend the club's membership policy in keeping with the spirit of the Olympic Charter," Tokyo Games chief Yoshiro Mori said in a statement.
"On behalf of the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, I'd like to extend my gratitude to the members of the club for their understanding and cooperation.
"I also would like to express my admiration for the club's endeavor to come to an agreement in such a short period of time."
The club was closed due to a national holiday on Monday, meaning no one was available for comment when contacted by Reuters.
IOC vice president John Coates had last month said that organizers would seek an alternative venue if the club could not achieve gender equality and Olympic chief Thomas Bach reiterated the governing body's stance last week.
"Kasumigaseki Country Club is an outstanding venue with excellent courses, and we are proud it will be hosting world's top-tier golfers from all over the world for the Olympics Games," Mori added of the decision.
"I truly appreciate the numerous efforts that the club's senior leaderships and all the club members have made so far to meet the requirements for hosting Olympic competitions."
Several notable golf clubs have changed their policies to allow female members in recent years.
In 2014, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews decided to allow women to join following 260 years of exclusion, after Augusta National, home of the U.S. Masters, had ended its men-only membership two years earlier.
Last week, Muirfield voted to admit women members, scrapping a policy that led to the historic Scottish links course being stripped of its eligibility to host the British Open.

SYDNEY John Coates, an IOC vice president and one of the most influential sports administrators in the world, is facing a challenge to his role as Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) president for the first time since winning the role in 1990.
Olympic hockey gold medalist Danni Roche launched her surprise bid for one of the top jobs in Australian sport on Monday and is calling for an overhaul of the organization's leadership.
Roche, who won gold with the Hockeyroos at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was nominated by her sport on Monday to contest the election for a four-year term at the AOC's Annual General Meeting on May 6.
Coates, a former rowing cox, played an integral role in Australia winning the right to host the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and delivering a highly successful Games.
The 66-year-old is also the head of the IOC's coordination commission for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and president of the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
He has, though, become embroiled in a public feud with the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) head John Wylie since the Rio Olympics and last month accused the head of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), Matt Favier, of plotting to depose him.
Roche, who sits on the board of the ASC, said her goal would be to build bridges between the various stakeholders in the Australian sports environment.
"The Australian Olympic Committee needs new leadership," Roche said on Monday.
"It needs make sure that every available resource is directed to sports and athletes. It needs to lead a new culture of collaboration in Australian sport."

'ON THE CHEAP'
Roche said she would reduce the AOC's administrative costs to 30 percent of revenue and shift that funding back towards sports.
The 46-year-old also took aim at the A$700,000 Coates receives each year as a consultancy fee, saying she would work for free.
AOC media chief Mike Tancred told reporters on Monday that his mentor and boss was "probably worth 10 times" the amount he receives.
"John Coates is a world leader in sport, he's highly respected, he brings a lot of corporate dollars through the door," he said.
"If he was a banker, he'd be getting bonuses of 10 times that amount. We're getting John Coates on the cheap."
Tancred added that he thought the feud with Wylie had led to Roche's candidacy, and said Coates had been looking for a successor for a number of years.
"He doesn't want to hand it over to the first Tom, Dick, Harry, Janet or Tracey who comes along," he added.
"This is his baby. He lives it, he eats it. He's not just going to be pushed aside by someone suddenly saying to him, 'Your days are up mate, see you later, go.'"
Sports-mad Australia has traditionally punched above its weight at the Olympics but 10th place on the medals' table in Rio last year continued a decline from fourth in Sydney in 2000 and Athens four years later.

More than 5,000 miles separate the Swedish city of Eskilstuna from Phoenix, Arizona but for Anna Nordqvist, victory at the LPGA Founders Cup over the weekend felt like a win on home soil.
The 29-year-old, who enjoyed a successful college career at Arizona State University, claimed her seventh LPGA Tour win on Sunday after a final round of 68 at the Wildfire Golf Club saw her finish two shots clear of the field on 25-under-par.
Stacy Lewis, South Korea's Chun In-gee and Thai Ariya Jutanugarn finished in a three-way tie for second on 23-under, with three more South Koreans - Park In-bee, Jang Ha-na and Ryu So-yeon - two shots further back.
Nordqvist, who is projected to move up two places in the world rankings to 11th and set a tournament record of 11-under with a 61 in the third round, said winning in Arizona was a different feeling.
"Of all my wins this is probably going to be the one that's the most special," she said in a televised interview.
"If it wasn't for me getting an opportunity to come to Arizona State University about 10 years ago, I wouldn't be here today.
"This truly still feels like home, even though I'm based in Florida.
"I wasn't even going to play (here) a couple of weeks ago and just ended up adding it at the last minute, so maybe it was meant to be," added Nordqvist, who picked up $225,000 for the win.
Nordqvist was always going to struggle to match Saturday's effort, when she carded nine birdies and an eagle in a flawless third round, but she did enough to protect the two-stroke lead she started out with.
Last season's Evian Championship winner Chun laid down the strongest challenge with four birdies in her first seven holes but her momentum then stalled and she picked up just two more shots over her last 11 holes.
Nordqvist, who picked up her only major at the 2009 Women's PGA Championship, opened with a birdie, picked up four more at the fifth, 10th, 13th and 17th holes, before ending the round on a sour note with a bogey on 18.
"I think I could only have dreamed of winning on what feels like for me home soil," said Nordqvist, adding that she decided to play the event after learning a tournament in Australia would not count towards her bid to make Europe's Solheim Cup team.
"Obviously I had a great round yesterday shooting 61 and my phone was blowing up ... I knew there was one more round play so I kept my head down. It's been such an amazing week."
The LPGA Tour moves to California next week for the $2.7 million Kia Classic.

NEW YORK Srisaket Sor Rungvisai of Thailand won a majority decision over Nicaraguan champion Roman "Chocolatito" Gonzalez in a bloody, 12-round slugfest to win the World Boxing Council super flyweight title on Saturday.
It was non-stop action at Madison Square Garden with both boxers punching relentlessly, and the previously unbeaten Gonzalez covered in blood from a clash of heads that gave him a deep gash near his right eyebrow in the third round.
Two judges scored it 114-112 for Srisaket, while the other judged it 113-113.
Srisaket improved to 42-4-1, while Gonzalez dropped to 46-1 in the co-featured bout on the card ahead of the middleweight championship match between Gennady Golovkin and Daniel Jacobs.
Srisaket set the tone early, knocking Gonzalez down with a  short, powerful right to the body in the first round, the first time since 2006 that the Nicaraguan had hit the canvas.
An accidental butt of heads in the third round opened a deep gash on Gonzalez, who fought with heightened urgency from then on as blood covered the right side of his face.
The Thai left-hander kept working on the area of the cut, and the corner had trouble stemming the flow of blood.
Gonzalez had Srisaket in trouble in sixth when he followed up a thudding left to the body with a left to the jaw. Trapped in the corner, the challenger knocked heads again and was deducted a point for the head butt.
Chocolatito fought on gamely despite the blood that also stained his chest as the two battled fiercely to the end.
Earlier on the undercard, Carlos Cuadras, who once owned WBC  crown improved to 36-1-1 mark with a 10-round unanimous decision over gritty fellow Mexican David Carmona, who slipped to 20-4-5.
Undefeated Ryan Martin improved to 18-0 by stopping fellow American Bryant Cruz (17-2) at 45 seconds of the eighth round in a 10-round lightweight clash.
Irishman Andy Lee (35-3-1) won a unanimous points decision over American KeAndrae Leatherwood (19-4-1) in an eight-round middleweight bout.

(The Sports Xchange) - Nigel Hayes scored 19 points and made the winning layup with 11.4 seconds remaining as eight seed Wisconsin upset defending champion Villanova 65-62 in an NCAA Tournament second-round game on Saturday.
"Seeds don't matter," Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said after his team beat the top-seeded Wildcats. "I told these guys, I don't care where we're seeded. We have to win six games. Let's start with these two this weekend."
Bronson Koenig added 17 points, including two late three-pointers, for the Badgers (27-9), who are returning to the Sweet 16 for the fourth straight season. Ethan Happ had 12 points and eight rebounds and Vitto Brown scored 10 points.
The loss ended top-seeded Villanova's quest to become the first repeat national champion in 10 years.
Josh Hart had 19 points for the Wildcats (32-4). Donte DiVincenzo added 15 points and Jalen Brunson had 11.
"Give them all the credit," Hart said. "They're a heck of a team. They made great adjustments."
This was Wisconsin's third victory over a number one seed in the last four years.
"All those games we've been the underdog," Hayes said. "You have all types of ranking systems, statistics, analytics guys that they put. The thing with all those algorithms, they can't calculate heart, will to win, toughness, desire. They can't put that into a formula to come out with a percentage chance to win, and that's the thing that we have."
Wisconsin shot 53 percent, improving to 17-0 this season when making more than 45 percent of its field goals.
Neither team led by more than eight points in a game that went down to the wire.
After DiVincenzo stole the ball at midcourt and made one of two free throws to tie the score, Hayes drove the baseline and scored on a reverse layup to put Wisconsin ahead 64-62.
Hart worked his way into the paint to try and tie the score for Villanova, but Happ held his ground inside and Hart lost the ball.
Brown was fouled but missed the second of two free throws with 3.4 seconds remaining. DiVincenzo grabbed the rebound, but Villanova was unable to get off a shot.

Charley Hoffman sank a 70-foot birdie at the final hole to tie Kevin Kisner for the third-round lead at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida on Saturday.
Hoffman read a big left-to-right break perfectly, his ball curling into the center of the cup on the same green at Bay Hill in Orlando where Tiger Woods holed so many clutch putts to clinch his eight victories in the event.
Hoffman carded one-under-par 71, while Kisner fired a 68 to tie it up at 11-under 205 with one round left.
The two Americans have a three-shot lead over Englishmen Tyrrell Hatton and Matthew Fitzpatrick and Australian Marc Leishman.
World number three Rory McIlroy (65) soared to the edge of contention, the day's equal best score lifting the Northern Irishman within five shots of the lead.
Halfway leader Hoffman made a demoralizing start with two straight bogeys, and further bogeys at the 14th and 15th holes left him in danger of falling off the leaderboard.
"I knew I needed a good finish to run down Kisner," he told PGATour.com after turning his fortunes around with birdies at the final three holes.
He has birdied the par-four 18th all three rounds.
"Hopefully I don't need a birdie tomorrow but at least the feelings are good going into it," he said.
Co-leader Kisner said he had learned that protecting a lead rarely works against the best players in the world.
"I've learned these guys don't back up, so you've still got to make birdies and attack," said the 33-year-old from South Carolina, whose sole PGA Tour victory came late in 2015.
"There's no protecting leads out here, so I'm going to go play my game and make as many birdies as I can."
McIlroy is among those chasing the leaders on Sunday.
"I just played better, holed some putts," said the man who needs to win next month's Masters to complete the career grand slam of all four major championships.
"It's a score I was waiting on. I felt is was in there. It was just a matter of putting it all together and today I did. At least I've given myself a decent chance. I can take a lot from today."
This is the first staging of the event that carries his name since he died last September aged 87.
He was invariably at the 18th green to greet the leaders at the end of each round.

Roger Federer continued his sizzling form on Saturday to set up an all-Swiss final against Stan Wawrinka at the BNP Paribas Open in California.
Federer did not face a break point in his semi-final victory over American Jack Sock 6-1 7-6(4) on the hardcourt at Indian Wells.
Less than two months after claiming the 18th grand slam title of his career at the Australian Open, ninth seed Federer delivered another virtuoso performance.
He ripped through the first set against 17th seed Sock in barely 20 minutes, before the American regrouped to make the second set more competitive.
With both players holding serve, the set went to a tiebreak, where Federer prevailed in front of a sun-baked crowd of 16,000 that included Rod Laver and Bill Gates.
"Overall I played a good match, struggled a bit in the second set but Jack got into it," 35-year-old Federer said in a courtside interview.
"It was tough in the end. I don’t think I played the best tiebreaker but it was enough to get through and I’m super happy to be in the final."
Wawrinka was even more dominant in the other semi, demolishing Spanish 21st seed Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3 6-2.
Federer has a 19-3 career record against Wawrinka, and has never lost to his compatriot on hardcourt.
They met most recently at the Australian Open, where Federer prevailed in five sets in a semi-final.
With Federer winning the Australian Open and Wawrinka claiming last September's U.S. Open, Sunday's final will bring together the two most recent grand slam champions.
Federer said Wawrinka would present a different type of challenge than Sock.
"Jack tries to really come over the ball and create a lot of topspin whereas Stan blocks his first-serve return usually.
"He’s very steady off the baseline and can play from really deep in the court. I’ve got to play aggressive and play like I’ve been doing all week and hope it’s enough."
Wawrinka earned his first Indian Wells final in style.
He broke Carreno Busta three times, and never faced a break point himself.
“I mixed a lot of speed and spin," Wawrinka said. "It’s not always easy here. I was mixing it up, so it was not easy for him to find a solution."
It was a much easier victory for Wawrinka than his fourth-round match against Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka, who came within two points of an upset earlier in the week.

Slovakia's Petra Vlhova spoiled U.S. ski queen Mikaela Shiffrin's bid for victory in the final slalom race of the World Cup season on Saturday.
Vlhova shook off a second-run challenge by Shiffrin, the overall winner of the crystal ball, to claim Saturday's race in Aspen, Colorado, by 0.24 seconds in 1:32.00.
Overall giant slalom winner Marcel Hirscher of Austria was more successful, scoring a half-second victory over Germany's Felix Neureuther in the men's race.
The 22-year-old Shiffrin stood third after the first run in softening snow, trailing Vlhova by 0.07 seconds.
The American temporarily grabbed the lead on the second run with a total time of 1:32.24 with only two skiers left.
But one of those skiers was Vlhova, who produced a strong finish to claim the victory.
Sweden's Frida Hansdotter finished third in 1:32:35.
Despite the loss, Shiffrin became only the third U.S. woman to win the overall title. Her closest rival, Ilka Stuhec, withdrew from the slalom on Friday.
"It’s been a goal and a dream of mine since I was five years old, and it’s really difficult to understand something that finally happens after 20 years," said Shiffrin when asked about winning the first crystal globe of her career.
She finished the season with 840 points in the slalom standings with Veronika Velez Zuzulova of Slovakia second at 565
and Wendy Holdener of Switzerland third with 455.
Shiffrin also hopes to have a say in the women's giant slalom on Sunday as she chases season leader Tessa Worley of France.
Hirscher needed an impressive second run to capture his third consecutive giant slalom race.
The Austrian had been 0.01 of a second behind Neureuther after the first run, but dominated the second.
His total time of one minute, 49.79 seconds easily gave him the win over Neureuther (1:50.32)
France's Mathieu Faivre joined them on the podium with a total time of 1:50.98.
For the season Hirscher claimed his sixth consecutive overall World Cup title and fourth in grand slalom.
Hirscher finished the giant slalom season with 733 points for a dominant victory over Faivre with France's Alexis Pinturault third.
"I’m super, super happy protecting the globe from Alexis Pinturault this season," Hirscher said.
"It means a lot to me because at the beginning of the season he was unbelievably fast, so I proved myself to be pretty good during the season."

Team Sky's Michal Kwiatkowski pipped world champion Peter Sagan in a thrilling finish to the Milan-San Remo race on Saturday.
Slovakia's Sagan launched a superb attack on the final Poggio climb near the end of the 291km race and was joined by Kwiatkowski and Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe.
Sagan (BORA-Hansgrohe) was the first to make his move in the dash to the finish but Poland's Kwiatkowski surged through to take the first Monument classic of his career.
It was a welcome respite for Britain's Team Sky who have been under intense scrutiny after an investigation into a medical package delivered to former rider Bradley Wiggins at the  2011 Criterium du Dauphine.
"Winning Milan-San Remo is an incredible feeling. I'm really thankful for my team mates," Kwiatkowski said.
"They did an incredible job today. I didn't expect Sagan would go on the Poggio. It looked like it was leading to a bunch sprint. I felt pretty strong and it was amazing to be there with Sagan and Alaphilippe. It's unbelievable."

NAIROBI Kenya's national Olympic committee has escaped the threat of suspension after failing to adopt a new constitution but funding will continue to be withheld until further notice, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Saturday.
The IOC froze financial support to Kenya nine days ago, after the country's troubled national committee (NOCK) failed to adopt a revised constitution, and said it would discuss the matter at its executive board (EB) meeting in Pyeongchang this week, leading to speculation that it might ban the country.
However, IOC Deputy Director General Pere Miro said a Kenyan undertaking to bring in the new constitution at a meeting later this month meant the IOC had stayed the threat of further action.
“The IOC EB noted, with disappointment, that your NOC failed to adopt its revised constitution at its meeting on 7 March 2017,” Miro said in a letter to NOCK President Kipchoge Keino.
“However, the IOC EB welcomed the recent positive developments, as mentioned in your letter dated 14 March 2017, in particular the firm commitment from your NOC to rectify the situation and the resolution signed by the members of your NOC Executive Committee to support the adoption of this revised constitution at its next Extraordinary General Assembly already reconvened by your NOC on 28 March 2017.
“In view of this significant progress, no further action will be taken at this stage by the IOC. Nevertheless, the IOC EB has confirmed that all payments of subsidies to your NOC continue to be on hold until further notice,” said the letter.
“The IOC will continue to monitor closely the completion of the entire process -- including the adoption of the revised NOC constitution, as a first step, and the holding of your NOC Elective General Assembly, as a second step - in accordance with the road map established in September 2016,” the letter said.
The IOC wants the body to adopt a new constitution barring incumbent officials from casting their vote during general assemblies, which some have been accused of using to prolong their own terms in office.
Kenya last month accepted a local high court decision
overruling last year's government order to disband its Olympic
committee after accusations that it had poorly handled
arrangements for the 2016 Rio Games.
Sports Minister Hassan Wario had ordered that the NOCK be
disbanded last August, saying the body had not arranged adequate
accommodation and travel for the Olympic team in Rio and had mishandled other issues.
Despite problems in the build up to Rio, the East African
nation enjoyed its most successful Olympics, winning six gold
medals, six silvers and one bronze, all in track and field.

Puerto Rico clinched a berth in the semi-finals of the World Baseball Classic with a 6-5 win over the United States in San Diego on Friday and remained unbeaten in this year's tournament.
Puerto Rico, runners-up to the Dominican Republic in the 2013 Classic, joined Japan and the Netherlands into the championship round leaving one spot available for the final games at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles next week.
The last semi-final berth will go to the winner of Saturday's showdown between the U.S. (1-1) and the Dominican Republic (1-1).
The victory at Petco Park by Puerto Rico, 2-0 in second-round play and 5-0 overall in the tournament, dashed the long-shot hopes of Venezuela (0-2) advancing.
The U.S. team kept battling back throughout the game and threatened to erase Puerto Rico's lead in the ninth when Brandon Crawford's two-RBI triple cut the deficit to one and put the tying run at third base.
However, Seattle Mariners closer Edwin Diaz preserved the victory by striking out Josh Harrison.
Puerto Rico raced to an early 4-0 lead with singles from each of their first six batters off U.S. starter Marcus Stroman.
A throwing error by third baseman Nolan Arenado in the sixth inning gave Puerto Rico two runs, which they ended up needing to withstand the late U.S. rally.
Seth Lugo earned the victory for Puerto Rico for 5 2/3 innings of work in which he surrendered three runs and five hits.
Carlos Correa and Carlos Beltran each had two hits and a run batted in for the winners, while Buster Posey and Adam Jones homered for the United States.

Twice grand slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova and 14th seed Elena Vesnina posted hard-fought, straight-set wins in Friday's semi-finals to set up an all-Russian final in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.
Kuznetsova played exceptional defense and used her strong serve and a varied groundstroke attack to edge third seed Karolina Pliskova 7-6(5) 7-6(2) in a tense showdown following Vesnina's 6-3 6-4 win over Kristina Mladenovic.
The 31-year-old eighth seed Kuznetsova rose to the occasion in the tiebreakers, storming out to a 6-2 lead in each.
Nerves struck in the first-set decider as she netted two backhands and produced an embarrassing double fault that made it 6-5 before rifling a forehand passing winner to end it.
There were no dramas after taking the big tiebreak lead in the second set and she raced along the baseline for another retrieval that induced a wide forehand from the disgusted Czech, who flung down her racket as Kuznetsova rejoiced.
"I was looking to defend good because it's really hard to overpower her," Kuznetsova said in an on-court interview.
"So I had to put lots of pressure on her and put as many balls back as I could."
The 24-year-old Pliskova, the ace leader on the women's tour last year and again so far in 2017, had 10 aces and a slew of inside-out forehand winners but was often let down by her backhand.
Vesnina, a three-times grand slam doubles champion, reached her first Premier Mandatory final with victory in the California desert over 28th seed Mladenovic.
Driving winners off both wings, Vesnina raced to big leads in each set, then held off the battling Mladenovic.
Vesnina claimed a 5-0 lead in the first set, breaking her French opponent twice before letting her onto the scoreboard.
Mladenovic broke back in the seventh game, but it was too late to deny the set to Vesnina.
Vesnina dominated again at the start of the second set, breaking Mladenovic's first two service games in building a 5-1 lead.
Swinging more freely, Mladenovic fought off one match point with a volley winner while serving down 2-5, broke the Russian in the next game and then held serve to make it 4-5.
Vesnina finally closed it out when Mladenovic netted a second serve return, sending the beaming Russian into a jump for joy.

Jack Sock celebrated a pair of firsts on Friday by powering past fourth seed Kei Nishikori 6-3 2-6 6-2 to book a date with Roger Federer in the semi-finals of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California.
Relying on his big serve and blistering forehand, the 17th-seeded American finally reached a Masters 1000 semi-final in his 28th appearance and notched his first ever victory against a top-five opponent in eight attempts.
"I've given everybody their money's worth, a three-setter every match so far," the 24-year-old Sock said in an on-court interview.
"I feel like I'm playing some great tennis right now."
Sock's stock has been soaring this year, claiming tournament titles last month at the Delray Beach Open in Florida and at the Auckland Classic in January.
Eighteen-times grand slam winner Federer advanced to the semi-finals without lifting a racket as suspected food poisoning forced Australian Nick Kyrgios to withdraw from their much anticipated quarter-final.
Kyrgios, who beat Novak Djokovic for the second tournament in a row to reach the last eight, took to twitter about an hour before the scheduled start of the match against the Australian Open champion to announce his withdrawal.
"I'm so sorry but I can't play today," he said. "After a restless night of being sick I have nothing left and to play a great champion like Roger, I need to be at my best to have a chance.
"I don't take this decision lightly, these are the matches we train for but I'm in no fit state to take the court."
Sock had no such problems and he hit the mark right at the start of deciding third set by breaking Nishikori in the opening game as the world number five struggled to find the range on his usually pinpoint groundstrokes.
The American earned the important second break against a battling Nishikori by converting his fifth break point of a marathon fifth game before going on to serve out victory in one hour 48 minutes.
"I think he served really well," said Nishikori. "I was having a really tough time with my return, missing a lot, and giving him a lot of short balls. And he was attacking really well, first and third sets.
"I didn't play my best tennis today, but I think he played good tennis also."
Sock has lost his two previous matches against Federer, including a 6-3 6-2 decision at Indian Wells in 2015.
"The last time I played him here I didn't really go out on court thinking I had much of a chance," said Sock. "He's playing some good tennis, I'm playing some good tennis, so I'm really looking forward to a battle."

Crystal Palace risk suffering a mass exodus of players at the end of the season if they lose their Premier League status, manager Sam Allardyce said on Friday, ahead of Saturday's vital match against Watford at Selhurst Park.
Palace, who currently hover only a point and a place above the bottom three, have had players including French goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and winger Wilfried Zaha linked with moves away from the club by the British media.
"Securing our position in the Premier League will mean the majority of players will still be here. I dread to think what will happen if we don't secure our status," Allardyce told reporters.
On-loan Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho's composure in the heart of defence has been instrumental in Palace winning back-to-back games for the first time since Allardyce's appointment in December.
Allardyce admitted he would like to secure the French centre-back, who joined the club in January, on a permanent deal if Palace stay up, although the price is likely to be high.
"That would be a big negotiation if we're still in the Premier League at the end of the season," the former England manager said.
"At this moment in time he chose Crystal Palace to play first-team football. He's worked extremely hard at getting himself fitter... He's shown he is not just a good defender but also his capabilities on the ball."
Palace have been in the Premier League since they beat Watford in the play-off final in 2013.
Watford, who are currently 13th in the Premier League, were eventually promoted in 2015.

ZURICH Titleholders Real Madrid must face their former coach in the Champions League quarter-finals after they were drawn against Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern Munich on Friday.
Ancelotti led Real to the 10th of their 11 European Cups in 2014, inflicting Bayern's heaviest European home defeat on the way with a 4-0 win at the Allianz Arena in the second leg of the semi-final.
Barcelona were pitted against Italian champions Juventus in a repeat of the 2015 final which the Spanish side won 3-1.
Rank outsiders Leicester City will take on Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid, runners-up in two of the last three seasons,
with the first leg at the Vicente Calderon where no English side have won.
Borussia Dortmund face AS Monaco who upset Manchester City in the previous round.
Bayern will host the first leg against Real as the two sides renew one of European soccer's oldest and most bitter rivalries.
They have met 10 times in two-legged European ties with each progressing five times. Real have reached the last six Champions League semi-finals and Bayern the last five.
Their first meeting in 1976 set the tone when Real's Roberto Martinez broke his nose in a collision with Bayern goalkeeper Sepp Maier and a fan known as The Bernabeu Madman ran on to the pitch and attacked Austrian referee Erich Lineayer and Bayern striker Gerd Mueller.
"The match against Real Madrid will be special for me," Ancelotti said. "We have a lot of confidence and want to win the Champions League this season. I think we have the ability to beat Real Madrid. But they have a fantastic team with a fantastic coach."
Juventus will host the first leg against Barcelona and the second will see their full back Dani Alves return to the Nou Camp where the Brazilian made 247 appearances in eight years.
Dortmund chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke was relieved not to draw Bundesliga rivals Bayern.
"We wanted to avoid Bayern, and I think they wanted to avoid us. From that perspective, it is a good draw," he said.
"I saw Monaco's match against Manchester City and I am aware that they have a goal difference of +58 in the league. It's a difficult match. At this level, it doesn't really matter if you play at home first."
Three-times European Cup winners Manchester United were drawn against Belgian league leaders Anderlecht in the Europa League quarter-finals.
Ajax Amsterdam will meet Germany's Schalke 04, French club Olympique Lyon face Turkey's Besiktas and Spain's Celta Vigo take on Belgian side Genk.

ZURICH Sponsors, officials and corporate hospitality programs have been allocated 24,500 of the 66,000 tickets for this year's Champions League final in Cardiff, UEFA said on Friday.
Meanwhile, prices for the match at the National Stadium on June 3 will range from 60 pounds ($74.20) for the cheapest seats to 390 pounds ($482.27) for the most expensive, European soccer's governing body said.
UEFA said that 41,500 tickets would be available for fans and the general public. The two finalists will receive 18,000 each to distribute to their fans and a further 5,500 will be offered for sale to fans worldwide through UEFA's website.
"The remaining (24,500) tickets are allocated to the local organizing committee, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality program," UEFA said.
Last year, 71,500 tickets were sold for the final in Milan with 46,000 offered to the general public.
Ticket distribution for major soccer matches is often a sore point with fans who complain that not enough are made available for the public.

STOCKHOLM Pep Guardiola must address his side's defensive woes if Manchester City are to have any chance of adding another Premier League title, former assistant manager Hans Backe said.
The 65-year-old Swede, who spent a year at City as assistant to Sven-Goran Eriksson and also managed FC Copenhagen, the New York Red Bulls and the Finnish national team, said Guardiola's defense was the weak link in an otherwise strong side.
"It's OK if you look at the attacking play, the technical skill and the way Guardiola wants to play, with a goalkeeper playing out from the back," Backe told Reuters.
"But when they lose the ball, they are far too vulnerable. I'm convinced he's going to put his mark on the team with some buys, and I think it will be players in the back four."
Third-placed City, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, host Liverpool on Sunday and need a win to keep their faint hopes of another league title alive.
Backe is a firm believer that it takes a year for players and managers to adapt to the rough and tumble of the English top flight, and said Manchester City had adopted part of Guardiola's high-pressure defensive doctrine, but not all of it.
"Their initial press is fine and the midfield's pressure is good, but when teams play past that, the back four is exposed. A good back four can manage that, but City don't really have that quality in their defense at the moment," he said.
City's frailties were brutally exposed in midweek by French side Monaco in the Champions League, as they overturned a 5-3 deficit and won 3-1 at home to go through to the quarter-finals on away goals.
Though he and Eriksson left Manchester City almost 10 years ago, Backe has fond memories of his time there.
"It was the biggest thing in my career, I can say that much. I was at a horse race in Halmstad when Sven-Goran Eriksson called saying he'd signed as manager for City," Backe said.
"He said 'I want you as my assistant, think about it'. I told him, 'I don't have to think about it.' It took 10 seconds - the Premier League has always been number one for me."
Under then-owner Thaksin Shinawatra there was money available to the new coaches, but Backe says the sums they spent were modest in comparison with Guardiola's resources.
"Many said that we had a huge budget, but that wasn't quite correct. We got the TV money to spend but it wasn't even close to what City spend now.
"We left after a year, and two months later the current owners came in with all these resources - that's a bit hard to take at times," he said ruefully.
For Backe, a lifelong fan of English soccer, being immersed in that culture was a high point.
"People talk about football 24/7, it's everywhere," he said.
Now back in Sweden and working as a television pundit on domestic, European and international soccer, Chelsea supporter Backe says he still enjoys watching the English games most of all.
"There is no tougher league, regardless of who you meet," he said.

ADDIS ABABA, - African soccer faces an uncertain future after Confederation of African Football (CAF) President Issa Hayatou was swept from power and a raft of new officials were voted into powerful positions.
New president Ahmad promised widespread consultation as he seeks to make the game more inclusive after his shock presidential victory on Thursday at the CAF Congress.
“We need to be open to discussion again and open to advice on how to improve. We want to talk to Africa’s top players to see how we can run the game better. We want anyone with a love for football and ideas on how to improve the game to feel they can come and discuss this with us,” Ahmad said on Friday.
On a day of seismic shock for the African game, Hayatou was deposed after 29 years and replaced by the unknown Malagasy, who has served as sports and fisheries minister in his native Madagascar but only as a CAF executive for the last four years.
The diminutive Ahmad, 57, initially looked as bewildered as his predecessor after the result of the vote handed him an upset 35-20 victory in a clear repudiation of Hayatou’s long standing rule.
But Ahmad quickly flexed new-found muscle as he persuaded delegates at the CAF Congress to overrule Hayatou, who continued to chair the rest of the meeting despite his election defeat, and postpone important votes on the appointment of independent auditing and oversight structures.
Also left over were changes to the confederation’s statutes that had been requested by FIFA, but did not receive a two-thirds majority from a rebellious Congress.
If the drastic changes at FIFA, where a raft of senior staff have been removed since Gianni Infantino was elected last February, are any indication to go by, CAF’s administration in Cairo is also set for a shake-up.
Its new-look executive committee has little experience after Hayatou’s allies were summarily removed in elections that followed his own dramatic fall.
Infantino called for support for the new CAF president after witnessing Thursday’s coup.
“Now that the elections are over, everyone should be focusing on a bright future for African football,” he told reporters at the end of the Congress.

The Masters, with its famed azaleas, precisely manicured greens and towering trees is bigger than any one golfer, even Tiger Woods.
With the first major of the year three weeks away, Woods is still nursing an ailing back and his chances of teeing it up at Augusta National, where he is a four-time winner, do not look promising.
Even if Woods does play, his chances of making the halfway cut and playing on the weekend appear bleak.
But sports industry analysts say an absence of Woods from Augusta National will not have nearly as much of an impact as in 2014 when, as the world's top-ranked golfer, he missed the Masters for the first time.
"Everybody knows the course. It's just so gorgeous and there's so many famous holes there that people can't wait to see," Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco, told Reuters.
"So as long as it's competitive and you've got a couple of big-name players in there on the weekend I think they are going to get solid ratings."
The absence of Woods from the Masters would once have been a ratings disaster but it appears the golf world, helped by some likeable players atop the world rankings and the continuing competitiveness of gallery favorite Phil Mickelson, has grown accustomed to him missing majors.
When Woods, as world number one, missed the 2014 Masters while recovering from back surgery, ratings for CBS's weekend coverage was 8.6 million viewers, the lowest since 1993 when 7.9 million viewers in the United States tuned in before Woods burst onto the scene.
Now ranked 734th in the world and a creaking shadow of his former self, Woods, who has missed the last four majors and six of the last 12, no longer strikes fear in fellow golfers but still has the potential to generate healthy ratings.
"The thing is he still bumps the ratings. If he's playing, and if he's in the final group on the weekend he definitely still makes a difference," said Dorfman.
"People are maybe not expecting him to win anymore but there is still an excitement and hope that he is going to do well on one side. One the other side it's 'gee let's watch and see what happened to this guy.' There's a curiosity about how far he's fallen off."
Woods made his return to the PGA Tour in January after an absence of 17 months and promptly missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open.
He shot an opening-round 77 a week later in Dubai before withdrawing due to a back spasm. He has since withdrawn from a handful of tournaments to focus on further rehabilitation on his back and his return date is uncertain.
But with or without Woods, the Masters offers something many golf fans simply cannot resist, a tradition-rich tournament played on the same course each year that signals the start of spring for most of the country.
"We're dealing with a unique property, tradition unlike any other. And while 10 years ago our audience would be surprised if Tiger was not playing I think given his history over the last year and a half that the audience would be pleasantly surprised if he does play," former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson told Reuters.
"The young professionals who have collectively taken Tiger's place -- Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and Dustin Johnson, among others -- certainly have a following and they will bring a substantial audience to Augusta whether or not Tiger plays."

BARCELONA Chelsea forward Pedro received a recall to the Spain squad on Friday for the World Cup qualifier against Israel and the international friendly against France after nearly nine months out of the national team.
AC Milan winger Gerard Deulofeu meanwhile returns to the squad for the first time since 2014 and Real Sociedad midfielder Asier Illarramendi has earned his first call up.
Pedro was a key member of the Spain team that won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championships in 2012 but had yet to be called up by new coach Julen Lopetegui, who took over from Vicente del Bosque last summer.
Pedro had been criticized for reacting badly to being left out of the starting line-up during the 2016 European Championships in France, telling reporters in June he did not want to be part of the squad if he did not play.
The former Barcelona forward struggled in his first campaign at Chelsea since leaving the Catalans in 2015 but has had a new lease of life under Antonio Conte, scoring 11 goals and providing seven assists in all competitions for the Premier League leaders, who are also in the FA Cup semi-finals.
Spain, who are top of World Cup qualifying Group G but level on 10 points with Italy, host Israel, third on nine, on March. 24 before traveling to France for a friendly on March 28.

BARCELONA Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta and team mates Ivan Rakitic and Gerard Pique have all given their backing to assistant coach Juan Carlos Unzue potentially taking over from Luis Enrique as head coach of the Spanish champions.
Unzue is one of the two leading candidates to succeed Luis Enrique, who announced this month he will leave at the end of this season, along with Athletic Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde.
Unzue, a former Barcelona goalkeeper, worked as the Catalan club's keeping coach from 2003-10 and again in the 2011-12 season after an unsuccessful stint in charge of Numancia. He became Luis Enrique's number two at Celta Vigo in 2013, joining him at Barca in 2014.
Barca have won eight out of 10 trophies under Luis Enrique and could yet win a second treble in three years, with the club second in La Liga, in the King's Cup final and in the last eight of the Champions League.
"Unzue knows everything about the club very well and how it works, he worked at the club for a long time and is working with us now. He's a qualified and experienced coach and is now excited about finishing the season and helping us meet our objectives," Iniesta said.
The Barca and Spain midfielder also praised Valverde, who was reportedly close to becoming Barca coach in 2013 when Tito Vilanova was forced to leave due to ill health but had already committed to taking charge of Athletic.
"At the moment these are hypothetical conversations but if that was the case, he'd be a great coach. He has always done well wherever he has been. He has a recognizable style," Iniesta added on Valverde, a former Barca striker.
Barca defender Pique is also backing Unzue.
"He's spent many years at the club, not just with Luis Enrique but also with Pep and I'm sure he would be a good candidate," Pique told reporters.
Croatian midfielder Rakitic said Unzue had a good understanding with the players.
"I have a very good relationship with him, he knows us very well, we have maximum confidence in him," Rakitic said in an interview with radio station Cadena Ser on Friday.
"Luis Enrique has his staff but Unzue has his own ideas. It's the same philosophy, but each coach has his own style."

Swansea City's fight to stay in the Premier League will not let up until the season ends, said manager Paul Clement, who urged his players to remain calm and focus on getting positive results ahead of Saturday's trip to Bournemouth.
Swansea, who are 16th in the table and three points off the drop zone, seemed destined to pull away from the relegation dogfight, winning four of their last six games before last weekend's 2-1 loss at third-bottom Hull City.
"We were nowhere near safe before Hull or after the game, and more than likely we will not be safe until right up to the end of the season," Clement told the club's website.
"We were disappointed with the Hull result but we are still confident. We have 10 games to go and there is still going to be a lot of movement."
Despite the setback at Hull, Clement saw no reason why the defeat should thwart Swansea's momentum heading into their clash against 14th-placed Bournemouth on Saturday.
"If we pick up the same sort of number of points, we will be fine. There's absolutely no need to panic," Clement said. "There's no need to lose confidence because one result didn't go our way."
Swansea are winless in their last four games against Bournemouth and have not won at the south coast side's ground since 2007.

ZURICH Mali has been suspended from international soccer after the West African country's sports minister sacked the executive committee of its soccer federation, soccer's governing body FIFA said on Friday.
The decision means that Mali, placed 61st in FIFA's world rankings, cannot play international matches including World Cup qualifiers until the dispute is resolved to world governing body's satisfaction.
Mali are bottom of African Group C with one point from two games although their next match is not until the end of August when they play away at Morocco, giving them plenty of time to find a solution.
FIFA blamed the actions of sports minister Housseini Amion Guindo after he "decided to dissolve the executive committee of FEMAFOOT (the Malian FA) and appoint a provisional committee mandated to run the association."
It said Guindo had also ordered the election of a new executive committee within one year.
Soccer's governing body insists that its member FAs must be able to manage their affairs independently without government interference.
The rule is a controversial one as it means that national governments are powerless to intervene in their country's soccer federation even when they suspect cases of mismanagement or corruption.
"The suspension will be lifted once ministerial decisions are nullified and the executive committee of FEMAFOOT and its president, Boubacar Baba Diarra, is reinstated," said FIFA.
There is a very fine dividing line in African countries between governments and soccer federations, who often depend heavily on the sports ministry for funding.

LONDON Jolyon Palmer, by his own admission, did not make much of a mark on Formula One last season.
But the "other Brit" on the starting grid, now that Jenson Button has departed and left Lewis Hamilton as the country's only active world champion, is hoping to leave a stronger impression second time around.
"One point. Yeah. I didn’t make a big dent into it," the Renault driver said of his 2016 tally from 21 grands prix
"I’m really confident that it will be a much better season. I haven’t got a lot of doubt about it."
Last season was a hard slog in a car best forgotten.
Announced by Lotus as a driver before Renault completed their takeover of a team in desperate need of finance, Palmer was in danger of being squeezed out after the French manufacturer signed Nico Hulkenberg for 2017.
Instead, it was Denmark's Kevin Magnussen who left for Haas and Palmer the one who stayed. Which was just as well, because he had no Plan B.
"I feel like it’s completely different sat here now," he told Reuters in an interview during winter testing.
"I honestly think you learn more in the difficult times. And really, last year there were times where I had to pull myself together.
"The year started quite difficult and I had to regroup and get my head straight for doing what I could the rest of the year. And having come through that, now I’m sat here with that experience which a lot of drivers don’t have.
"You’re on the back foot and in a fight for survival. I’ve come through that and now hopefully we are going to have a much stronger year, and I know I can dig deep and when the pressure’s on, shine through."
Renault are aiming for fifth place overall, a big improvement from ninth last year, but Palmer will still be occupying a very different space from Hamilton.

BLING-FREE ZONE
There are no gold necklaces, Hollywood red carpets or private jets in the life of one of the few F1 drivers with a university education. Mention the word "bling" and he smiles.
"You know what, I think that’s a long way away," said Palmer, who shares an apartment in London with his sister when not living out of a suitcase.
"If that happens, then someone needs to give me a bit of a shove back into reality."
"I can’t see myself living in Monaco, but maybe in one year’s time I’ll suddenly have a change of heart and Nico convinces me it’s really good and I move there."
Somehow, you suspect not.
A champion in the GP2 feeder series at the fourth attempt in 2014 -- Hamilton won it first time out in 2006 -- Palmer acquired a reputation for steady improvement that was also evident last year.
He will need to shift up a gear against Le Mans winner Hulkenberg, who brings a wealth of experience from Williams and Force India and will be expected to lead the team, but Palmer said he felt a lot more relaxed.
"I know what to expect, I know how it works and I’ve got a good relationship with the management here," he said.
"I feel like hopefully we’re set up for the future as a team now.
"Last year was Renault’s first year back, no-one knew really what to expect, the pressure was big on both drivers. And this year everything just feels a bit more comfortable."

LONDON While Formula One's new American owners seek to add races and razzmatazz in the United States, the boss of the sport's only U.S.-owned team is more focused on what the rest of the world can do for him.
Gene Haas, the California-based machine tools magnate with a winning record from NASCAR, has a clear agenda as Haas F1 prepare to start a second season at next week's Australian opener in Melbourne.
"It’s actually very important to have more image in the rest of the world," he said in a sit-down during recent testing in Barcelona.
"Most of the manufacturing is in the rest of the world ... manufacturing has been on the decline in the United States for 100 years and it’s on the increase in the rest of the world. So we want to be in the rest of the world."
Liberty Media, who took over as Formula One's commercial rights holders in January, have targeted new races in North America and a push to build a broader fan base there.
Haas, a co-owner of the Stewart-Haas Racing NASCAR team, can play a part in that as the first U.S.-owned F1 outfit in 30 years.
But promoting Haas Automation, a company with $1 billion in annual sales, remains the focus. And in the owner's view, Formula One is an advertising vehicle like no other.
"If we got on a podium or something like that, that would probably be worth all the advertising in the world," he said.
Haas certainly got noticed last March when Frenchman Romain Grosjean finished sixth on the Ferrari-powered team's debut in Melbourne -- a result that he said was like a win for the newcomers.
A red flag stoppage played into their hands with the tyre strategy then, but Haas went one better in the next race in Bahrain when they finished fifth.
"If we can get a red flag, and then change tyres right at the red flag it would be perfect," Haas said of the chances of repeating the feat.
"I doubt very much we can repeat what we did. Coming in sixth in Australia, for a brand new team, that was very unique."

POWERFUL NEW ENGINE
Haas ended up a solid eighth overall at the end of the season, and the target now is to keep moving up.
Brake issues remain a worry but the Ferrari engine is more powerful and Haas are now the only customer of the Italian manufacturer to have the latest version, with Sauber using last year's model.
"Our goal would be maybe to move up a position or so and then possibly if we could snatch a podium, that would be a real accomplishment," said Haas.
"We are not here to run in the back forever because that’s generally a very slow and painful way to race. We know we have to perform and I think we’ve got the basic structure to do that."
Danish driver Kevin Magnussen has replaced under-performing Mexican Esteban Gutierrez alongside team leader Grosjean, and the car is one of the better-looking of the new crop of challengers.
"In general, we are pretty confident we are in the mid pack," said team principal Guenther Steiner. "But are we at the top of the midpack or at the back? I don’t know yet."

Emiliano Grillo, his hands numb from the cold, recovered from a dismal start to tie Matthew Fitzpatrick for the lead after the first round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando on Thursday.
On an unseasonable, chilly Florida morning, the Argentine made two early bogeys before storming back with seven birdies for a five-under-par 67 on the Bay Hill course.
Low scores were hard to come by in the first staging of the event since the September death of Palmer, with only seven players breaking 70.
Defending champion Jason Day coped with what he described as "brutally chilly" conditions to shoot a respectable 70.
"I couldn’t feel my fingers the first five or six holes," world number 32 Grillo told PGATour.com.
"A couple of mistakes from the middle of the fairway ... but I’m really happy with the way I played after that."
Co-leader Fitzpatrick enjoyed the milder afternoon weather, notching five birdies in a bogey-free round.
"I played nicely all day. Didn't hit too many loose shots," said Fitzpatrick, 22, who won the European Tour's season ending event in November.
It was only a few degrees above freezing when Day teed off about an hour after sunrise, and he had to adjust quickly to the shorter ball carry with, he said, his mid-irons traveling about 20 yards less than usual.
Day used last year's Palmer Invitational as a springboard to a sizzling spring, the first of three victories in six starts.
Though he is still ranked second in the world behind Dustin Johnson, who is not playing this week, Day has not been in top form so far this year.
"Hopefully I'll be ready by Augusta," the Australian said.
"Golf is a funny game. You can go on spells where everything is ... not going the way you want it to and you’re thinking, 'will I ever dig myself out of this hole'. And there are some times you’re going, 'I can’t miss a putt, I can’t miss a drive, I’m playing the greatest golf of my career.'"
The tournament started in a reflective mood in the absence of Palmer, one of golf's greatest players, whose immense popularity drew a legion of fans to the game.
His passing was honored on Wednesday by a ceremonial succession of drives, led by Palmer's grandson, PGA Tour player Sam Saunders.
Saunders shot 74 on Thursday, but offered no excuses.
"I hit three balls in the water," he said. "It's unacceptable."

Danny Willett, already in mediocre form ahead of his Masters defense, suffered a potential setback when he pulled out of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, citing illness on Thursday.
Willett withdrew shortly before his scheduled tee time, allowing an alternate to take his place in the field at Bay Hill in Orlando, Florida.
"Really sad to withdraw," the Englishman said on Twitter.
"I've been up all night with terrible sickness. Not ideal but felt it worse ... to take spot from reserve if I wasn't able to finish."
Willett still has three weeks to hone his game for the year's first major championship.
He has played only five tournaments worldwide this year, with one finish inside the top 50 -- a tie for fifth at the Maybank Championship in Malaysia.

ZURICH Schalke 04 hit back from two goals down to draw 2-2 and overcome fellow Germans Borussia Moenchenglach on away goals in their Europa League last 16 tie while Manchester United edged Rostov 1-0 to progress on Thursday.
Juan Mata's second-half goal gave the English Premier League's only survivors in the competition a 2-1 aggregate win over the Russians.
Olympique Lyon clung on to eliminate AS Roma 5-4 on aggregate despite a 2-1 defeat, while former European trophy winners Ajax Amsterdam and Anderlecht also went through along with Racing Genk.
Russia's interest in this season's European competitions ended as Krasnodar threw away a promising position at home to Celta and lost 2-0 for a 4-1 aggregate defeat.
Besiktas hammered Olympiakos Piraeus 4-1 (5-2 on aggregate) despite having Vincent Aboubakar, scorer of their first goal, sent off six minutes before halftime.
Schalke, trailing at halftime to a deflected shot from Andreas Christensen and a 30-metre rocket from Mahmoud Dahoud, were helped by a bumpy pitch as they hit back against Gladbach.
Leon Goretzka's low shot appeared to be going straight to Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer but hit a divot and looped over the Swiss and into the net in the 54th minute. "It's tough, I can't say anything other than that," said Sommer.
Dahoub then turned villain as his handball led to a Schalke penalty converted by Nabil Bentaleb in the 68th to give the Royal Blues an away goals win after a 3-3 aggregate draw.

MATA STRIKES
Manchester United, who held Rostov 1-1 on a difficult pitch in the first leg, needed a 70th minute goal from Juan Mata, who turned the ball home from Zlatan Ibrahimovic's back-heel, and two good saves from Sergio Romero.
However, midfielder Paul Pogba was forced off with an injury in the second half, putting a dampener on the win.
Lyon took a 4-2 lead to the Stadio Olimpico and quickly added to it when Mactour Diakhaby was allowed a free header from six meters in the 16th minute against Roma.
Kevin Strootman leveled within a minute, turning in Daniele De Rossi's free kick at the back post, and it was one-way traffic after that as the home side poured forward.
Lyon's Lucas Tousart turned Stephan El Shaarawy's cross into his own net to put Roma 2-1 ahead on the hour and the hosts thought they had done enough to progress with an Edin Dzeko effort but the Bosnia forward was ruled offside.
First-half goals from Bertrand Traore and Kasper Dolberg gave Ajax a 2-0 win over FC Copenhagen which took the four-times European champions through 3-2 on aggregate.
Frank Acheampong's second half goal was enough for former European Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup holders Anderlecht to beat APOEL 1-0 and go through2-0 on aggregate.
Racing Genk coasted through 6-3 on aggregate against fellow Belgians Gent after a 1-1 draw.
Besiktas, who drew 1-1 at Olympiakos last week, got off to a flying start as Aboubakar and Ryan Babel scored inside the first 22 minutes.
The Greek side pulled one back with Tarik Elyounoussi's acrobatic volley in the 31st and were given more hope when Aboubakar was dismissed for violent conduct eight minutes later.
But Olympiakos left themselves too open and further late goals from Babel and Cenk Tosun saw the Turks ease through.
The draw for the quarter-finals will be held on Friday.

Manchester United have lots of enemies, manager Jose Mourinho said after they scraped past Russian side Rostov to reach the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday.
The Portuguese did not say who the club's enemies were but he was clearly angry that his team had to play at Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Monday, then Rostov and must next visit Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Sunday.
"We have lots of enemies. Normally the enemies should be Rostov but we have a lot of enemies," Mourinho said after a 1-0 win over the Russians sent United through 2-1 on aggregate.
"It's difficult to play Monday with 10 men (after Ander Herrera was sent off at Chelsea), it's difficult to play now, it's difficult to play 12 o'clock on Sunday.
"A lot of people might say we should have scored more goals (against Rostov). But a lot of things are going against us. The boys are amazing boys. We will probably lose the game on Sunday. Fatigue has a price."
Mourinho explained that Marcos Rojo ate a banana during the match because he was "at the limits."
"The player asks for a banana. It is not to laugh at all. It is to respect the players and their limits, they give everything."
He admitted the United were "afraid" of extra time.
"They (Rostov) are fresh, they had a winter break, they had winter pre-season, they play one match per week, they played against Terek Grozny Sunday afternoon, we played Chelsea Monday night," he said.
"If the game goes to extra time it would be an advantage for them because my players were at the limits. In the first half, we were much better and we should be winning but we weren't and then the game was open until the end."
He added: "I will remember forever when I spoke to the UEFA delegate in Rostov. He told me if any of our players gets injured, the insurance pays. Whoever decided the Monday and Sunday games probably thinks the same way."

The U.S. women's ice hockey team have decided to stand fast in their wage fight with USA Hockey as they let a deadline pass on Thursday without confirming whether they will play in the upcoming world championships.
"We were aware of USA Hockey's deadline and have allowed it to pass," the players said in a statement released shortly after a 5 p.m. ET deadline set by USA Hockey on Thursday. "We are focused on the issue of equitable support and stand by our position.
"We continue to be grateful for the encouragement and loyalty of our fans."
While the deadline has passed, USA Hockey said the door remains open for a settlement and hopes the current team will be on the ice when the week-long tournament begins March 31 in Michigan.
"We are committed to resolving this," USA Hockey Dave Fischer told Reuters. "But there is no question the clock is ticking."
USA Hockey denied suggestions that it has a Plan B in place and said reports they have contacted other players about playing in the March 31 tournament are "completely inaccurate."
The deadline comes a day after the defending world champions, citing a lack of progress in year-long negotiations, said they will boycott the tournament unless their demands for higher wages are met by USA Hockey.
"We have heard that USA Hockey is attempting to field an alternative team to play in the world championship games," the players said. "We regret that they have not instead chosen to reconsider their treatment of the current world championship-winning team."
Players are under contract to USA Hockey only during years when the Winter Games are held and are seeking a deal that would compensate them during non-Olympic years.
USA Hockey maintains that its role is to support players as they prepare for competitions not to employ them.
USA Hockey said the support they will provide ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics includes a six-month training camp, stipends and incentives for medals that could result in each player receiving nearly $85,000.
Members of the national team dispute those figures claiming USA Hockey has coupled their contributions with payments made by the U.S. Olympic Committee, which pays gold medal-winning athletes more than $60,000.

LONDON Former Team Sky rider Josh Edmondson has said that he broke cycling's no-needle policy to inject himself secretly with vitamins.
Edmondson, who rode for Team Sky in 2013 and 2014, told the BBC in an interview it was the pressure to be selected for the 2014 Tour of Spain that led him to break the rules.
The rider said he confessed to Team Sky at the time but there was a cover-up by senior management.
The team doctor at the time, Steve Peters, was quoted by the BBC on Thursday as saying: "It's not a cover-up. Once you use that word you are saying there was an intent behind us to conceal and that was never the case."
Vitamins and a needle were found in Edmondson's room by a team mate but Team Sky said they did not report the incident because Edmondson had denied using them and amid concerns that he was depressed and could be "pushed over the edge".
It is not against International Cycling Union (UCI) rules to take vitamins but in 2011 the world governing body introduced an anti-doping rule prohibiting the use of needles.
Team Sky said on Thursday that they had immediately launched an investigation and, while there was a breach of their own policies, they found no evidence of an anti-doping violation.
"We are satisfied that this incident was handled correctly and we believe that it stands as an example of the robust procedures Team Sky has in place for any concerns to be raised, investigated and properly dealt with," they said in a statement.
Edmondson told the BBC: "In 2014 I was under a lot of pressure, not just from the team but from myself.
"I went to Italy to buy the vitamins that I was going to later inject...
"I bought butterfly clips, the syringes, the carnitine (a supplement), folic acid, 'TAD' (a supplement), damiana compositum, and (vitamin) B12, and I'd just inject that two or three times a week maybe. Especially when I wanted to lose weight, I'd inject the carnitine more often because it was very effective."

EDMONDSON DEPRESSED
Team Sky have come under the microscope in recent months after a UK Anti-Doping investigation was launched into a package ordered by a team doctor and delivered to their former rider Bradley Wiggins at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine race.
Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford told British lawmakers that the package contained the legal decongestant Fluimucil, although the lack of a paper trail has called into question Sky's medical record-keeping. Sky denied any doping violations.
Edmondson said he suffered from depression after independently using Tramadol, an opioid sometimes used in the professional peloton to numb pain during races.
He said he stopped injecting himself with vitamins after a team mate caught him and reported him to team management.
Team Sky told the BBC that they took legal advice. The team said they had no obligation to report Edmondson because he denied to them having injected himself when questioned.
Peters said the team made "a judgment call which was difficult". He said the issue was discussed but they were concerned about the "welfare of the individual (Edmondson)".
Team Sky added in their statement: "...the decision not to escalate or make public the incident was taken with the team’s duty of athlete care in mind".
Edmondson said in the BBC interview that he told Team Sky's senior management he had self-injected at the time, but that there was a "cover-up".
"I think that would have meant a bigger admission for them," he said.
"They'd have had to say publicly a kid was injecting. Injecting anything's bad. It's not like they were banned substances but injecting is against the rules - to self-administer anything, I believe."

(The Sports Xchange) - Chicago Bulls guard Dwyane Wade will miss the remainder of the season with a fractured right elbow, the team announced on Thursday.
Wade underwent an MRI exam after sustaining the injury in the fourth quarter of Wednesday's 98-91 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. The results of the MRI showed a sprain in addition to a small fracture in the elbow.
A 12-time All-Star and three-time NBA champion, Wade said he sustained the injury when his elbow was caught awkwardly while battling Zach Randolph and others for a rebound.
The injury comes at a pivotal time for the Bulls (32-36), who reside a game behind the Detroit Pistons (33-35) and Wade's former team -- the Miami Heat (33-35) -- for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
Wade, 35, is averaging 18.6 points, 4.5 assists and 3.9 rebounds this season after signing a two-year, $47.5 million deal over the summer.
LOS ANGELES Milwaukee Bucks wunderkind Giannis Antetokounmpo is evolving at such a pace that he may soon outgrow his nickname of "The Greek Freak."
It is not difficult to imagine Antetokounmpo one day becoming the NBA's best scorer, defender, playmaker or all of the above.
But the athletic gifts that birthed Antetokounmpo's moniker were just the starting point for the 22-year-old Greek point-forward who is acquiring a full package of skills.
It was approximately a year ago that Bucks coach Jason Kiddtransitioned his 6-foot-11 star from a traditional forward to a primary ball handler.
Antetokounmpo, once a picture of gangly arms and legs soaring through the air on every possession, now mixes willing passes and timely decision-making into his high-wire act.
In his fourth NBA season, Antetokounmpo has made the leap from exceptional talent to realized basketball player.
"Being a point guard you have to think for your team mates and also about what the opponent is trying to do," Kidd told Reuters prior to Milwaukee's game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday. "That's helped him on both ends – having to think for so many people."
Antetokounmpo's maturation has also been Milwaukee's. He fills the stat sheets as one of the game's premier hybrid players, averaging 23 points, 8.5 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.9 blocks and 1.7 steals.
Meanwhile, the Bucks are rising despite the loss of second-leading scorer Jabari Parker to a season-ending ACL injury in February. Milwaukee (33-34) have won seven of eight games to reach the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference playoff race.
Antetokounmpo led the team's latest triumph, a 97-96 win over the Clippers, with a string of key passes late in the game that flaunted his versatility.
"I watch film to see where my team mates are," Antetokounmpo told Reuters following the win. "My team mates talk to me and tell me where they will be. They help me every day."
Antetokounmpo is helping them as well.
"Giannis is doing a great job finding everybody,” said Bucks guard Matthew Dellavedova. "He's unselfish, and when you have a guy like that he draws sometimes three, four (defenders). They're all sucking into the paint because he's so effective in there.
"He is just getting better every game."
The success Antetokounmpo is finding in the NBA is hardly by accident.
Born in Athens, Greece, as the son of Nigerian immigrants, little was given to Antetokounmpo. He sold watches and other items on the street to help his family's financial burden before basketball offered him a better life.
Antetokounmpo played for Greece's Filathlitikos B.C. as a teenager where his highlights and potential led the Milwaukee Bucks to draft him 15th overall in 2013.
Even now as a proven player, Antetokounmpo's hunger to be elite is evident. His pregame workouts can leave him drenched in sweat as he rehearses moves and hones his jump shot, an improving work in progress.
In February, Antetokounmpo played his first ever NBA All-Star Game as if it were his last, breaking the indifference of the defense-less exhibition.
He has trained with recently retired great Kevin Garnett this season and picks the brain of former passing maestro turned coach, Kidd.
“He’s not afraid to try something and he’s not afraid to ask (questions),” Kidd said. “That’s what makes him special, is he wants to be good.”

LONDON Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe returned to the England squad at the age of 34 on Thursday ahead of next week's friendly against world champions Germany and a World Cup qualifier at home to Lithuania.
Defoe has been in lethal form for his relegation-threatened club, scoring 14 of the Black Cats' 24 league goals this season but last appeared for England in November 2013 when he won his 55th cap.
"I didn't want to just look at his age and think he's finished with England," manager Gareth Southgate told reporters.
"I think you get young players with a point to prove and older players with a point to prove. I think he still feels that. I think he warrants the call-up."
England play Germany in Dortmund next Wednesday and Lithuania at Wembley on March 26.
Southgate said he had to look at the near term as well as long, even if England were "nodding towards the future" with some of the decisions.
"You need senior players within that to educate some of the younger ones, to show them some of the things they need to learn and also the competition's important," he added.
Southgate did not rule out Defoe for next year's World Cup finals in Russia, saying all of the players faced competition for their places.
"It can't be a comfortable environment where people think they are going to be in every time," he said.
Striker Harry Kane, who damaged ligaments in Tottenham Hotspur's 6-0 FA Cup quarter-final win over Millwall last weekend, is absent as was Manchester United's Wayne Rooney.
Southgate said he had talked with Rooney, who has recovered from injury, but his lack of recent game time told against him.
Defoe is the top English scorer in the Premier League after Kane, who has 19 goals to his credit.

PARIS When Michael Owen tweeted that Monaco were a "good draw" for Manchester City, the remark raised a few eyebrows in France, and one of the most exciting Ligue 1 teams in years will fear no one when the Champions League quarter-finals draw is made on Friday.
Relying on a bunch of hyper-talented youngsters, Monaco prevailed 3-1 on Wednesday to eliminate City on away goals after the tie ended 6-6 on aggregate, pressing and attacking like there was no tomorrow in a breathtaking first half.
Just as in the first leg, which they lost 5-3 after leading 3-2, they seemed to run out of steam in the second, but Tiemoue Bakayoko, one of five players aged 23 or under to start the game, headed the decisive goal with 13 minutes left.
It was the first time a team coached by Pep Guardiola had been knocked out as early as the Champions League last 16.
Asked whether Monaco should fear a team in the quarter-finals or whether it was them who should be feared, coach Leonardo Jardim said: "The second option.
"A lot of people thought we could not go through (after the first leg) but we are a great team. We had already scored three in Manchester.
"We dominated a club who is second in the Premier League. It is time to say that our league is competitive."
Once again, Monaco, who groomed World Cup winners Lilian Thuram, Emmanuel Petit, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, owed their success to home-grown players, with 18-year-old Kylian Mbappe standing out in the absence of the injured Radamel Falcao.
The forward's pace was too much to handle for City and Mbappe put Monaco in the driving seat with a goal after eight minutes, proving a nightmare for the visitors' defense.
In 17 starts this season, Mbappe has now scored 16 goals, earning him his first call-up to the France squad, along with team mate Benjamin Mendy, for a World Cup qualifier in Luxembourg and a friendly at home against Spain later this month.
"Mbappe is the DNA of our club. I am so proud that he is growing so fast," said club vice-president Vadim Vasiliyev.
"What he does at his age is just huge," said former France and Monaco winger Ludovic Giuly.

Liverpool midfielder Ben Woodburn has been named in Wales' squad for the first time ahead of their World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on March 24.
The 17-year-old Woodburn, who has made seven appearances for the Merseyside club this season, became Liverpool's youngest scorer when he scored against Leeds United in the League Cup in November.
"He's there on merit and we're looking forward to having him on board," Wales manager Chris Coleman told reporters on Thursday.
"He has done good things at Liverpool and everyone has been getting excited since he burst on the scene ... He won't be daunted by coming with us."
Coleman dismissed reports suggesting that he had picked Woodburn, who has represented Wales at youth level since he was 13, with the intention of preventing him from becoming an England player.
"It makes me laugh when people say we've got to get him in. If I thought it was too early for him I wouldn't put him in because this is a big game for us. There's no knee-jerk reaction to cap him," he said.
"But I see him as a Welsh international and he's good enough to be there. If Ben wanted to play for England there's absolutely nothing we could do about that."
Wales are currently third in Group D with six points, four behind leaders Republic of Ireland. Only the team that tops their group gains automatic qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

The full Welsh squad for the World Cup qualifier:
Goalkeepers: Wayne Hennessy (Crystal Palace), Danny Ward (Liverpool), Owain Fon Williams (Inverness).
Defenders: Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur), James Chester (Aston Villa), James Collins (West Ham United), Joe Walsh (Milton Keynes Dons), Chris Gunter (Reading), Jazz Richards (Cardiff City), Neil Taylor (Aston Villa), Ashley Williams (Everton).
Midfielders: Joe Allen (Stoke City), David Edwards (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Andy King (Leicester City), Tom Lawrence (Leicester City), Joe Ledley (Crystal Palace), Shaun MacDonald (Wigan Athletic), Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal).
Forwards: Gareth Bale (Real Madrid), Hal Robson-Kanu (West Bromwich Albion), Tom Bradshaw (Barnsley), Sam Vokes (Burnley), Ben Woodburn (Liverpool).

West Ham United manager Slaven Bilic said his side are braced to take on a "different" Leicester City, who have revived their fortunes since sacking their title-winning boss Claudio Ranieri last month, in the Premier League on Saturday.
Since Ranieri's sacking, Leicester have won both their league games to move three points away from the relegation zone and booked a place in the Champions League quarter-finals. In contrast, West Ham are winless in four league games.
"Leicester is a different team to four weeks ago, now they play extremely well," Bilic told reporters on Thursday. "Still I don't understand (Ranieri's sacking) but if we are talking about results, they got what they wanted.
"But it was a bad decision because we are talking about Ranieri... but it's that kind of job. You are the first one to pay the price. Now no one can say it was the wrong decision."
Bilic also praised midfielder Manuel Lanzini, who has scored two goals in his last five appearances, and said the Argentine has stepped up since Dimitri Payet's departure in January.
"He's that kind of a player that wants the ball all of the time and when he's on the ball he's a top player, he's got ideas, he sees the moves before," Bilic said.
"It's not because Payet left. Both of them played amazingly together, but now of course he is the one the players are looking to give the ball, if he is in a good position."
West Ham, who are 11th in the table, will look for their first victory since 2014 against 15th-placed Leicester when the sides meet at the London Stadium.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has refused to set a target for this season and hit out at critics, saying they are unlikely ever to be satisfied with anything the north London club achieves.
Criticism of Wenger, who has been in charge of Arsenal for two decades, has grown louder this month after his team went  out of the Champions League in the last-16 for a seventh straight season with a crushing 10-2 aggregate defeat by Bayern Munich.
"Nothing is good enough anymore. You try to do as well as you can," the Frenchman told reporters on Thursday. "Success is not down to me to judge. Our job is to do as well as we can until the end of the season."
Arsenal are fifth in the Premier League and trail fourth-placed Liverpool, who occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot, by five points but have two games in hand.
Arsenal are also in the FA Cup semi-finals where they play Manchester City next month.
Wenger, 67, admitted Arsenal might find it difficult to secure qualification for the Champions League.
"We want to play in the Champions League next season but we have a tough job because we have six or seven teams fighting for places, and how well we do until the end of the season will depend on that," he added.
A section of Arsenal supporters staged protests calling for Wenger, who is out of contract at the end of the season, to leave prior to home games against Bayern in the Champions League and Lincoln City in the FA Cup last weekend.
Wenger refused to comment on the protests.
"I have nothing to say about that (the protests) anymore. I have talked enough about that," he said.
Injured duo Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are doubts for Saturday's match against eighth-placed West Bromwich Albion but midfielder Mohamed Elneny has recovered from an ankle problem in time for the clash at the Hawthorns.

LONDON Middlesbrough sacked manager Aitor Karanka on Thursday and handed the Spaniard's assistant Steve Agnew the pressing task of trying to keep the relegation-threatened club in the Premier League.
"Both parties have agreed that it is in the best interests of the club to make this change," Middlesbrough, three points from safety and without a win in 10 matches, said in a statement.
The club, promoted last season after a seven-year absence from the top flight, thanked Karanka for his work over the past three-and-a-half years.
Middlesbrough are 19th in the Premier League, with a game in hand over Hull City who are two points above them but three adrift of 17th placed Crystal Palace.
With only 19 goals from 27 matches, and just four wins all season, 'Boro have scored the fewest goals in the top flight despite keeping a tight defense.
They were knocked out of the FA Cup after a 2-0 loss to Manchester City in last Saturday's quarter-final.
Agnew will take charge for Sunday's big home clash against Jose Mourinho's Manchester United, who are on an unbeaten 17 match league run but will be without suspended top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

CRITICAL OF SUPPORTERS
"I'd like to thank Middlesbrough for a wonderful opportunity and the players, staff and all the people at the club who I have worked with," Karanka, a former assistant to Mourinho at Real Madrid, said on the club website (www.mfc.co.uk).
"I'd also like to thank the fans for their support," added the north-eastern club's first non-British manager, who had said last week that he was confident he still had the backing of chairman Steve Gibson.
"This club will always hold a special place for me and I wish everyone connected with Middlesbrough Football Club the very best for the future."
Karanka had been critical of the club's supporters earlier this season, when they called openly for a change of tactics, and had bristled at the club's lack of activity in the January transfer window.
There have also been spats with high-profile players such as former England winger Stewart Downing, who has been dropped for recent games.
"We need to improve the team, and the club knew a month and a half ago the players that I wanted," Karanka had said at the end of January.
"Teams in our position are signing players for 14 million pounds ($17.17 million) -- we are signing players that didn't play in the (second-tier) Championship."

($1 = 0.8156 pounds)

BARCELONA Real Madrid have returned to the top of La Liga but need to halt their recent trend of leaking goals in games if they want to stay there in Saturday's trip to Athletic Bilbao, who have the second best home record in the Spanish top flight.
Zinedine Zidane's side have conceded 10 times in their last six games in all competitions, falling behind in five of those, and are increasingly relying on late escape acts to get them out of trouble.
Sergio Ramos came to their rescue in Sunday's labored 2-1 win over Real Betis with an 81st minute winner, while Alvaro Morata and Cristiano Ronaldo scored late against Villarreal and Las Palmas, salvaging a 3-2 win and 3-3 draw respectively.
Real leapfrogged rivals Barcelona at the league's summit after the Catalans' shock 2-1 defeat at Deportivo La Coruna and enjoy a two-point lead as well as having a game in hand in their pursuit of a first title win since 2012, although their defense is still vulnerable.
The spotlight has fallen particularly on goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who scored an embarrassing own goal against Betis and was fortunate not to be sent off, adding to costly mistakes against Las Palmas and in their 2-1 defeat to Valencia.
Real have won one of three visits to Athletic's new San Mames stadium, which opened in 2013, and the Basques have hit form, winning their last four league home games and beating local rivals Real Sociedad 2-0 in their last outing.
"We're playing well, we are very confident and the derby win gave us an extra boost. We want to keep up our great run at home and the fact we're playing Real Madrid makes us even more motivated," Athletic midfielder Benat Etxebarria told reporters.
Athletic have only lost one home game in all competitions, to champions Barcelona in August, and are set to welcome back top scorer Aritz Aduriz to the starting line-up for the first time in over a month after the veteran recovered from injury.
Barca host Valencia looking for a response from their surprise defeat to Deportivo, which came four days after their sensational 6-1 win over Paris St Germain in the Champions League. Barca are also set to welcome back Neymar, the hero of their amazing second leg comeback, after a thigh problem.
Sevilla are third in the standings, having slipped five points behind Real with two consecutive draws. Their promising season further unraveled on Tuesday with a 2-0 defeat to Leicester City and elimination from the Champions League.
Jorge Sampaoli's side visit Atletico Madrid, who are fourth in the standings and can cut the distance with Sevilla down to two points with a win.

LONDON If the Premier League contained only the current top six then Liverpool, not Chelsea, would be heading for the title.
In nine games against those teams this season Liverpool are unbeaten and have taken an impressive 19 points which is why they will travel to third-placed Manchester City on Sunday brimming with confidence.
Victory over City, which would be their sixth in seven against the Sky Blues in the league, would propel Liverpool above Pep Guardiola's side in what has become a five-club battle for second, third and fourth spots behind leaders Chelsea.
The higher caliber the opposition, the better Liverpool have played this season, with notable victories over Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, a double over Arsenal and a narrow home win over City who will also be deflated by their Champions League loss to Monaco.
Juergen Klopp's side labored to a 2-1 win over woeful travelers Burnley last weekend, when all the sides around them were in FA Cup action, but former Liverpool striker John Aldridge said points, not style, are now the priority.
"It was a crucial three points in terms of pushing for a Champions League spot," Aldridge, who won the title with Liverpool in 1987-88, told the club's website.
"Mentally, it was a big step forward for this Liverpool side. I know we've played two games more than both Arsenal and Manchester United but I'd rather have the points on the board than fixture congestion."
Liverpool, who were neck-and-neck with City at the top of the table after 10 games of the season, are fourth with 55 points from 28 games, one less than City and second-placed Tottenham Hotspur, both of whom have played a game fewer.
Significantly, they have a five-point cushion on Arsenal and six over United. What is more, Liverpool can concentrate on their final 10 games without the distractions their top-four rivals must contend with.
While bookmakers have not stopped taking bets on Chelsea winning the title yet, a 10-point lead with 11 games to go makes them overwhelming favorites.
One thing is certain, though, two of Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and United will be shut out of the top-four this season.
Tottenham can increase the pressure on City and Liverpool when they host Southampton earlier on Sunday chasing a 10th consecutive home victory in the Premier League, although they will be without injured top scorer Harry Kane.
Manchester United, for whom the top four has remained just out of reach since very early in the season, are away at relegation-threatened Middlesbrough on Sunday in their third game in six days.
Antonio Conte's Chelsea, who beat United on Monday to set up an FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham, are away to Stoke City on Saturday looking to open a 13-point gap.
Fifth-placed Arsenal begin the weekend schedule at West Bromwich Albion - a side they have never failed to score against in 21 previous Premier League clashes.
Three defeats in their last four league games, however, mean Arsene Wenger's side have precious little margin for error in their quest for a 21st consecutive top-four finish.

Burnley have the perfect chance to get their first away win in the Premier League and end a five-game winless streak when they face bottom-placed Sunderland on Saturday, defender Stephen Ward has said.
Burnley, who are 12th in the league, have drawn twice and lost 12 times in 14 away league games this term. Seven of these losses have come by a one-goal margin including their 2-1 loss to Liverpool last weekend.
"They will be well up for the game and have probably earmarked this one as a game they need to win to give themselves a good chance," the 31-year-old Ward told the club's website.
The two sides have met twice this season with Burnley winning at home 4-1 in the league before drawing away from home in the FA Cup and winning the following second leg at home.
"We performed very well up there in the FA Cup game," Ward added. "I feel if we an go with the same attitude, mentality and performance level we had at Anfield last Sunday, we will give ourselves a good chance of picking up something from the game.
"We have lost a couple on the bounce now and had a couple of draws, so we need to get back to winning ways as soon as possible and hopefully we can do that this Saturday."

Striker Enner Valencia is focused on using what is left of the season to secure European qualification at Everton and said he would love to stay on at the club when his loan deal ends.
Valencia, who joined Everton on a season-long loan from West Ham United, has struggled for game time since making the switch, but is hoping he gets more minutes over the last 10 games of the season.
"There are 10 games in which I could play. And those 10 games are vital because what we have to do is seal qualification for one of the European competitions," Valencia, who has made three league starts, told the club website. (www.evertonfc.com)
"I'm all about being positive and the best possible way of looking at things. I'm really keen to play."
The Merseyside club have an option to make Valencia's move permanent and the Ecuador international is open to staying at the club.
"It's all about focusing on the present rather than the future," Valencia added. "But I can say from my point of view that I would love to stay."
Seventh-placed Everton host 18th-placed Hull City in the league on Saturday, before visiting local rivals Liverpool on April 1.

The U.S. women's national ice hockey team will boycott the 2017 world championships unless their demands for higher wages are met by USA Hockey, lawyers for the players said on Wednesday.
The defending world champions, citing a lack of progress in year-long negotiations, indicated they will not report for training camp on March 21 unless adequate progress is made.
The world championships begin March 31 in Michigan.
"We are asking for a living wage and for USA Hockey to fully support its programs for women and girls and stop treating us like an afterthought," U.S. captain Meghan Duggan said in a statement. "We have represented our country with dignity and deserve to be treated with fairness and respect."
Players are under contract to USA Hockey only during years when the Winter Games are held and are seeking a deal that would compensate them during non-Olympic years.
USA Hockey said in a statement it is their responsibility to provide support for athletes as they prepare for competitions but that they are not in the job of employing players.
"In our role as the national governing body, USA Hockey trains and selects teams for international competition," said USA Hockey President Jim Smith. "USA Hockey's role is not to employ athletes and we will not do so."
USA Hockey said the support they will provide ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics includes a six-month training camp, stipends and incentives for medals that could result in each player receiving nearly $85,000.
That sum, according to USA Hockey, is in addition to a housing allowance, travel allowances, meal expenses, medical and disability insurance and the infrastructure that includes elite-level support staff to train and prepare the players.
The national team immediately issued a statement disputing USA Hockey's figures.
"It suggests that USA Hockey is prepared to pay the players $85,000 during the Olympic year," said the players. "That is simply not true and no such offer was ever extended.
"In its public statement, USA Hockey has coupled their contributions with payments made by the U.S. Olympic Committee, which pays gold medal-winning athletes more than $60,000.
"Further, it covers only the Olympic period and does not offer anything for each of the other three years during which a world championship is played."

Muirfield golf club may have scrapped its all-male policy and been welcomed back into the British Open rotation but world number three Rory McIlroy said on Wednesday he is not ready to toast a new era.
The Northern Irishman, speaking a day after Muirfield voted to admit women members, remained critical of the years women were denied membership and did not sound like he would be changing his opinion anytime soon.
"We'll go back there for The Open Championship at some point, and I won't be having many cups of tea with the members afterwards," McIlroy, 27, said as he prepared for Thursday's opening round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando.
Muirfield had a male-only membership policy since the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which controls the course, was founded in 1744. Women are allowed to play there, but an initial ballot to allow women members failed in May last year when only 64 percent voted in favor.
But centuries of discrimination ended when the necessary two-thirds majority had been reached, with 80.2 percent of members voting in favor of change on Tuesday.
The R&A, the body that organizes The Open, then declared Muirfield back on its list of eligible courses, having said last year it would not stage the tournament at a venue that did not admit female members.
"I still think that it got to the stage, this stage, is horrendous," said McIlroy, a four-times major winner who won the 2014 British Open at Royal Liverpool.
"And yeah, I mean, we'll go back and we'll play the Open Championship, because they will let women members in, but every time I go to Muirfield now I won’t have a great taste in my mouth."
Muirfield has hosted the Open 16 times, most recently in 2013 when it was won by American Phil Mickelson.

MONACO Monaco swept into the Champions League quarter-finals and left Manchester City to pick up the pieces of another failed European campaign after a 3-1 victory on Wednesday sent them through on away goals.
Monaco needed to overturn a two-goal first leg deficit but French prodigy Kylian Mbappe, Fabinho and Tiemoue Bakayoko scored on a memorable European night for the principality club, who underlined their growing status as one of the continent's most exciting sides.
City, who won the first leg 5-3 in Manchester, were completely overwhelmed in the first half and fell two goals behind, but reacted after the break and Leroy Sane reduced the arrears as Monaco seemed to run out of steam.
Bakayoko, however, headed home in the 77th minute to ensure the Ligue 1 club were celebrating at fulltime after the tie finished 6-6 over two enthralling encounters.
"We deserve this. There is a lot of pride," said Bakayoko, whose goal ensured Monaco are the only French side left in the competition after Paris St Germain were knocked out by Barcelona.
It was the first time City boss Pep Guardiola had been eliminated in the competition's last 16, while City became the first team to exit the Champions League after scoring five goals in the first leg.
City, who have consistently been one of Europe's biggest spending clubs, have now failed to get past the last 16 in four of the last five years.
"The second half we had the chances and we didn't take them and that is why we are out. And set-pieces are so important at this level," said Guardiola.
"Barcelona and Real Madrid scored from them last week. We were not there."
Leonardo Jardim's team, who were without the injured Radamel Falcao, started brightly and pressed high as Mbappe's pace forced City to sit deep.
The 18-year-old then opened the scoring, turning in Silva's low cross from the left from close range after eight minutes.
City barely set foot in Monaco's half and in the 29th minute, Fabinho fired home from Benjamin Mendy's inch-perfect center.
City were looking to hit Monaco on the break, but the hosts managed to keep wingers Sane and Raheem Sterling in their own half.
The visitors, who failed to have a shot in the first half, gained some control early in the second as they played higher up the pitch and pegged their opponents back.
Andrea Raggi made a crucial interception to deny Sergio Aguero, who had been teed up by Sterling, and keeper Danijel Subasic then produced a superb save to deny the Argentine striker in a one-on-one.
Monaco were suffering before City reduced the arrears in the 71st minute when Sterling's shot was parried by Subasic into the path of Sane, who fired into the roof of the net.
That put City in front on aggregate, but Monaco, who eliminated Manchester United in the quarter-finals in 1998 and Chelsea in the semis in 2004, turned the tie back in their favor when Bakayoko headed home from a Thomas Lemar free kick.

TORONTO Arun Daniel and his mom, Suguna, first touched Canadian soil two weeks ago and, on Wednesday, they first touched ice, sliding on one knee and pushing a 40-pound granite rock across a rink.
Arun, an 11-year-old from Sri Lanka, was learning to curl alongside 45 other resettled refugees. Some had come to Canada just days before.
Arun had seen curling on TV before. It didn't seem like a real sport.
"It looked like not that fun. I was like, 'Why is it taking such a long time?' It felt like hockey is better. But when I came and really did it, I felt like, 'Oh, I shouldn't say that'."
Even a minor wipeout, smashing his mouth to the ice when a stone hit his foot, wasn't enough to curb Daniel's enthusiasm.
The event at Toronto's Royal Canadian Curling Club was the brainchild of Anna Hill and the Together Project of which she's the director.
She founded the group last fall to fill a need: Government-assisted refugees lack social supports when they arrive in Canada, she said.
The group's previous outings include trips to taste maple syrup or to the Royal Ontario Museum. This was their first curling excursion.
"Curling is a fantastic, very Canadian winter sport, and we thought that they might be interested in learning about winter sports in Canada since we have quite a long winter here," Hill said.
People making refugee claims in Canada after crossing the border illegally have dominated the news. But these individuals, like most Canadian refugees, were hand-picked from pools screened by the United Nations.
That day in the curling club they were like movie stars, swarmed by curious journalists asking how they liked Canada in general and this quintessentially Canadian sport in particular.
One young woman, who came to Canada last month from Iraq with her sisters, nephews and niece, spent hours on the ice, sliding forward with a stone in each hand, cackling with delighted laughter at her own wipeouts.
"I'm slowly learning. The first time is fun, because you keep falling and it's funny. ... I want to learn it all. I'll be back to learn this better."
Her family's caseworker advised against using their names: Their case is still uncertain. But the young woman said the Canadians she's met have made her feel right at home.
"They're very respectful. They're like our sisters and brothers."

MADRID Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak was the hero as the Spanish side reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the fourth year in a row after drawing 0-0 with Bayer Leverkusen in an open last-16 second leg on Wednesday.
Slovenia international Oblak made an outstanding triple save to deny Julian Brandt and Kevin Volland in the second half and he made further impressive stops late in the game to shut out the Germans and secure a 4-2 aggregate success.
Atletico had the better of the first half and it took a top- class save from Oblak's opposite number Bernd Leno to prevent Angel Correa giving the Spaniards the lead before the break, flying to his left to tip away a goalbound shot.
The impressive Correa nearly crafted an outstanding goal in the second half but could not find the target while top scorer Antoine Griezmann also came close to putting Atletico out of sight, sending a classy chip just wide.
Atletico's ruthless counter-attacking in Leverkusen meant the second leg was always going to be less tense than the last time the sides met at the Vicente Calderon in 2015, when the Spaniards sneaked through to the last eight after a penalty shootout.
Playing their first European game under new coach Tayfun Korkut, Leverkusen sought an early advantage and had the chance to do so when Volland broke into the area but flashed a shot beyond the far post.
The Germans had more wayward efforts but Atletico came closer at the other end, first Koke drawing a save from Leno then Correa forcing the Germany international into action.
The most stunning intervention between the posts, however, came from Oblak who made himself big to deny Brandt before getting up immediately to dive in front of Volland's shot and blocking the German forward's follow-up.
Oblak then thwarted Karim Bellarabi on two separate occasions, keeping an exciting end-to-end spectacle goalless.
"It feels great for Atletico to reach the quarter-finals four years in a row, it's very important for us and we have had to fight to get there," said Oblak, who was on the losing side in last year's Champions League final with Atletico against Real Madrid.
"It hasn't been easy at all to get this far four years in a row and I hope we continue to grow as we have done in those years."

Former American great Chris Evert has no issue with tournaments handing Maria Sharapova wildcard entries as the Russian former world number one makes her way back from a doping ban, she said on Wednesday.
Evert, an 18-times grand slam champion who retired in 1989, was the latest to weigh into a debate in which many leading players have criticized tournament organizers for not making Sharapova earn her way back.
Wildcards are currently the only way Sharapova, who is unranked and serving a 15-month ban, can play in the big events and she has accepted invitations to tournaments in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome in the next two months.
"You can't blame the tournaments really for wanting to be successful and wanting to enhance their tournament by having a big draw like Maria Sharapova," Evert said on a conference call from Indian Wells, where she is a television commentator for ESPN at the BNP Paribas Open.
"She is doing everything within the rules and she (will have) fulfilled her obligation of 15 months so I am not critical of that decision that the tournament made whatsoever."
Sharapova was among the top 10 players in the world when she tested positive for the banned substance meldonium at last year's Australian Open.
The 29-year-old Russian's two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation was later reduced to 15 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Sharapova said this year that she would return to competition at the Stuttgart Grand Prix, the main draw for which starts on April 24, the penultimate day of the five-times grand slam champion's ban.
Men's world number one Andy Murray said he wished players would not get any favors on returning from bans regardless of their popularity while Dane Caroline Wozniacki called the decision to allow Sharapova to play "disrespectful".
At the moment, Sharapova would need a wildcard from the French Tennis Federation to play in the French Open. Her performances in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome could avoid forcing the All England Club into making the same decision regarding this year's Wimbledon.
"It's completely within the rules and fair for the tournament to reward whoever they want," former top-10 player Brad Gilbert said.
"It will be interesting to see what the slams do."

LONDON Former world champion Stuart Bingham is facing a disciplinary hearing after falling foul of the sport's betting laws, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) said on Wednesday.
The governing body said in a statement that it had investigated a breach by England's 2015 world champion and that "there was a case to answer".
Bingham, 40, has admitted breaking WPBSA rules, but there is no suggestion of match-fixing.
"This was just a case of me not being clear on the rules," world number three Bingham told the BBC.
"I did not know I was not allowed to bet on other players' matches. I thought it was just my own I could not bet on, and I have never done that."

Emotions will run high at the Arnold Palmer Invitational this week as golfers pay tribute to seven-times major champion Palmer who died last year as they hone their games for next month's U.S. Masters.
Given this is the first Palmer Invitational since one of golf's greatest players died at the age of 87 in September, many expected a stellar field but world number one Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Phil Mickelson are among those skipping it.
Defending champion Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Hideki Matsuyama and British Open champion Henrik Stenson are, however, among the big names taking part.
"There's not a player out here who doesn't respect Arnie, everybody loved him," Briton Ian Poulter, who received a sponsor's exemption into the event, told Golf World.
"The course might not suit everybody's eye and because of that some guys might not play. What's also difficult is it's a busy calendar."
Australian Day returns after his wire-to-wire win in Orlando last year when tournament host Palmer watched on as he clinched a one-stroke victory by getting up-and-down from a greenside bunker at the final hole.
The world number two has struggled in 2017, however, and will be eager to rediscover his form after missing the WGC-Mexico Championship due to an ear infection.
Swede Stenson could also be one to watch as he finished inside the top 10 at last week's Valspar Championship in Palm Harbor, Florida, and has been in the top eight at Bay Hill every year since 2013.
McIlroy looked impressive in his return from a rib injury at the WGC-Mexico Championship, where he made his first start on the PGA Tour in 2017 and finished on 10 under par, four shots behind winner Johnson.

LONDON Jamaican sprint great Usain Bolt has already ruled out competing at next year's Commonwealth Games in Australia's Gold Coast but organizers are still hoping he will make an appearance of some sort.
"He won't be competing, you all know that, but we are trying to get him to come in some capacity," Gold Coast organizing committee chairman Peter Beattie told reporters on Wednesday.
"(GOLDOC chief executive) Mark (Peters) has met with the (athlete's) manager on a couple of occasions and we will continue those discussions.
"We will do everything we can to get Usain Bolt to the Gold Coast for this event."
The 30-year-old world record holder, who completed a "treble treble" of 100m, 200m and 4x100m Olympic titles at the 2016 Rio Games, said in February he had no plans to extend his career beyond this year's world championships in London.
The sport's great entertainer competed in Melbourne last month at the first Nitro Series meeting with a team of international "All-Stars".
Bolt is also contracted to bring his All-Stars to Australia for the next two years.

Italy's Peter Fill stole the Alpine World Cup downhill title from Norway's Kjetil Jansrud on Wednesday with a second place finish behind team mate Dominik Paris in the final race of the season in Aspen, Colorado.
Fill, who started the day 33 points behind Jansrud and as the only skier with a chance of denying the Norwegian the downhill crown, blitzed down the America's Downhill course in a time of one minute, 33.15 seconds, crossing just .08 seconds behind the winner Paris.
Jansrud, who has already wrapped up the Super G title, could do no better than 11th, ending his hopes of adding the downhill crystal globe that goes to the discipline champion to his collection.
Fill picked up 80 points for his second place, pushing his season total to 454, while Jansrud earned just 24 for his finish, dropping him into second on 431.

Bournemouth are hoping to distance themselves from the Premier League's bottom three as they look to secure back-to-back wins for the first time this season when they host relegation rivals Swansea City on Saturday, captain Simon Francis has said.
Bournemouth ended an eight-game winless run in the league with an emphatic 3-2 win over West Ham United last weekend. The victory takes them to within three points of 10th-placed Southampton and six points clear of the relegation zone.
"We need those back-to-back wins. They can take you from looking behind you to looking ahead of you," the 32-year-old defender Francis told British media.
"We've not been looking behind us but you can't help notice those teams have been picking up points.
"While a lot of people outside the club have been saying we are in a relegation battle, we are trying to stay confident, look ahead of us and see who we can catch."
Bournemouth are 14th in the table with 30 points, three ahead of 16th-placed Swansea with 10 games remaining.

ZURICH The two FIFA ethics chiefs responsible for banning some of the sport's most prominent figures following a corruption scandal face an uncertain future and may not have their mandates renewed, sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.
Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, his right-hand man Jerome Valcke and former European soccer boss Michel Platini are among dozens who have been banned by the ethics committee in the last four years.
The scandal has also led to the indictment of several dozen soccer officials, mainly from Central and South America, in the United States. Blatter, Valcke and Platini, who have denied any wrongdoing, were not among them.
The sources said that a change of personnel could lead to a two-year delay in ongoing investigations as the new incumbents would have to familiarize themselves with both the ethics committee set up and the cases themselves.
The mandates of Cornel Borbely, a Swiss attorney who heads the investigatory division of the ethics committee, and Hans-Joachim Eckert, a German judge who heads the adjudicatory chamber, expire in May.
The sources told Reuters that neither have so far been invited to the next FIFA Congress on May 11 in Bahrain, where their mandates would be extended for another four years.
According to the FIFA statutes, the 37-member FIFA Council has responsibility for proposing candidates for the two roles and the final decision is made at the Congress by representatives of the 211 national federations.

CONSULTATION PROCESS
FIFA would not comment directly on whether Borbely and Eckert would be nominated for reappointment, saying in a statement that the continental confederations had been asked to put forward names.
"In line with our good governance processes, a consultation process has started and the confederations have been asked to provide candidates," it said.
"Please understand that we can’t speculate about any matters that are subject to the decision of the Congress’ delegates. We have no further comments."
Sources said that both Borbely and Eckert wanted to continue. Under FIFA statutes, they are each entitled to two further four-year mandates.
The sources said that FIFA president Gianni Infantino could easily end speculation about their future with a statement of support and an invitation to Congress but this had not been forthcoming.
FIFA reformed the ethics committee in 2012 in response to a series of corruption cases.
Eckert has headed the adjudicatory chamber since then while Borbely has led the investigatory chamber since 2014 after the resignation of the original head Michael Garcia.
Infantino has already overseen a drastic restructuring of FIFA since he was elected in February last year and several key heads of department have left, in some cases abruptly.
Last year, the committee investigated Infantino's own conduct, focusing on some of the flights he had taken during the opening months of his presidency and his failure to sign an employment contract. It found no evidence of wrongdoing.
Last May, the FIFA Congress gave the FIFA Council power to appoint or dismiss members of independent bodies such as the ethics committee and the audit and compliance committee.
Domenico Scala resigned as head of the latter in protest, saying FIFA had taken away the independence of its watchdogs.

Liverpool defender Ragnar Klavan believes the side can qualify for next season's Champions League and hopes that the Merseysiders can become a regular feature in Europe's elite club competition.
With just three wins from last nine league games, Liverpool have seen their title bid fade but back-to-back victories over Arsenal and Burnley have helped strengthen their grip on a top-four spot.
"We want to be at a consistent level where we play in Europe every season... I still think we have a great chance to finish in the top four," Estonian Klavan told British media.
Liverpool are fourth in the table and have a five-point lead over fifth-placed Arsenal, although the north London club have two games in hand.
"I believe the Champions League is the biggest measurement of where you stand in Europe. At Liverpool, we are working every day to achieve that goal," Klavan said.
"Everybody here wants to be playing in the Champions League."
Liverpool's five league losses have come against teams in the bottom half of the table, including defeats to relegation-threatened sides Hull City, Swansea City and Leicester City.
"If we play against lower teams that are not doing so well this season we are expected to win, but these teams still have really good quality," Klavan added.
"That makes English football so attractive to watch and it also makes it difficult to be consistent in the Premier League."
Liverpool's slump since the turn of the year may have dashed hopes of silverware but Klavan felt there was enough time left for the club to salvage their stuttering campaign.
"The season is not a sprint, it's a marathon, and you have highs and lows. It is a long season and you only know in May how well you've really done," he said.
Liverpool travel to face third-placed Manchester City on Sunday.

Puerto Rico handed the Dominican Republic their first World Baseball Classic (WBC) loss since 2009, beating the defending champions 3-1 in their Pool F opener at Petco Park in San Diego on Tuesday.
Puerto Rico, who lost the 2013 WBC title game to the Dominicans, were led by a stellar performance by their bullpen and a great all-round game from veteran catcher Yadier Molina.
Molina homered, drove in two runs, denied a base-runner with a pivotal out late in the game and helped guide the pitching staff through nine innings of one-run ball.
Puerto Rico's victory snapped an 11-game WBC winning streak for the Dominican Republic, who swept to the 2013 crown with an 8-0 record and won their three games in this year's first round.
The Puerto Ricans improved to 4-0 with their win and took a large step closer to the semi-finals in Los Angeles. They and Japan, playing in Pool E in Tokyo, are the only remaining unbeaten teams in the tournament.
Tuesday's contest was an uncharacteristically low-scoring game for two high-powered offenses. Puerto Rico have outscored  opponents, 29-7, in pool play, while the Dominican Republic produced seven or more runs in each of their first-round wins.
Puerto Rico broke a 1-1 tie with a run in the fourth and Molina, a seven-time All-Star with the St Louis Cardinals, gave them some breathing room in the sixth with a solo blast.
Molina, who also delivered the game's first run with an RBI-single against his St Louis team mate Carlos Martinez in the first, is batting .417 (5-for-12) with five RBIs and four runs so far in the tournament.
Nelson Cruz homered in the second for the Dominicans' only run.
Japan began Tuesday's action with an 8-5 victory over Cuba in Tokyo that put them on the brink of reaching the championship round in Los Angeles.
Tetsuto Yamada homered twice for the winners, including a two-run shot that capped a three-run outburst in the eighth that broke open a 5-5 game.
Japan, 2-0 in the second round, can secure a semi-finals berth with a win against Israel (1-1), who could end up in a Pool E tie-breaker game as the Netherlands (1-1) face winless Cuba.

Hull City's 2-1 win over Swansea City in the Premier League last weekend has given the relegation-threatened team a confidence boost ahead of Saturday's tough trip to seventh-placed Everton, on-loan defender Omar Elabdellaoui said.
Eighteenth-placed Hull ended a run of three games without a win against Swansea to keep their hopes of escaping the drop alive but Everton have lost only one game at Goodison Park this season.
"We weren't happy with the couple of results before we played against Swansea last weekend, but we went out there with the belief that we could get a big result and we achieved that," Elabdellaoui told the club's website.(www.hullcitytigers.com)
Hull have won three and drawn two of eight league games under new manager Marco Silva, including an impressive 1-1 draw at Manchester United and a 2-0 win over Liverpool, but have won just once on the road all season.
"Of course we are going to be in for a very tough game at Everton," the 25-year-old added.
"They are a good side in good form, especially at home, so it will be a big challenge for us. But our confidence is good and I feel that the confidence and belief has always been there."
History is not on Hull's side. In nine trips to Goodison Park stretching back to 1927, Hull have only won once, in the old Division Two back in 1952.

Russia's Elena Vesnina ousted German second seed Angelique Kerber 6-3 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, California on Tuesday.
The victory was the 14th-seeded Vesnina's first against a top-three player and put the doubles specialist into a last-eight showdown against Venus Williams.
"I think I played a really good match," the Russian said in her courtside interview.
Vesnina blasted 28 winners to 21 unforced errors and broke Kerber's serve five times to forge ahead before holding off a late rally by the German, who will return to number one in the world rankings next week despite her early exit in California.
"I was a little nervous at the end of the match," she said about Kerber winning eight of nine points to recover from 4-1 to 4-3 in the second set. "So I'm really happy that I closed that match."
Seven-times grand slam winner Williams, the 12th seed, recovered from a slow start to grind down China's Peng Shuai.
After battling back from match-point down earlier in the week against Jelena Jankovic, Williams executed another turnaround against Peng to win 3-6 6-1 6-3.
"There were some up-and-downs and errors," Williams told reporters. "But I feel like I got my focus more in that second set and towards the end of the third."
Vesnina leads their head-to-head 3-2 and won their most recent match at last year's Miami Open.
World number three Karolina Pliskova advanced to the last eight after 15th seed Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland retired from their match while trailing 5-1 in the first set.
The Czech will face reigning French Open champion Garbiñe Muguruza of Spain, a 7-6(5) 1-6 6-0 winner over in-form Ukrainian Elina Svitolina.
Caroline Wozniacki, the 13th seed and 2011 champion, reached  the quarters with a 6-4 6-4 victory over ninth-seeded American Madison Keys. The Dane will meet Kristina Mladenovic of France, who beat American Lauren Davis 6-3 6-3.
Eighth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, 31, was the first to advance with a 6-1 6-4 win over Caroline Garcia of France.
Kuznetsova has reached the quarters in six of her last eight tournaments, dating back to Tianjin in October 2016.
"I have fallen in love with the game again," she said of her resurgence.
Kuznetsova will compete in an all-Russian quarter-final against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, a 6-4 3-6 6-2 upset winner over fifth seed Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia.

Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal powered to third-round wins at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Tuesday to set up a mouth-watering rematch of their recent Australian Open final.
Fifth seed Nadal defeated fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-3 7-5, while ninth seed Federer served impeccably to get past American Stevie Johnson 7-6(3) 7-6(4) and book the 36th showdown of their famous rivalry.
The last time they met, Switzerland's Federer claimed a record 18th grand slam title in a rousing 6-4 3-6 6-1 3-6 6-3 triumph over Nadal in Melbourne in January.
Federer, 35, lost only five points on his first serve in his double tie-breaker win over Johnson in a match completed without a service break.
Fourteen-times grand slam winner Nadal, 30, was comfortable as usual in the California desert, dismissing compatriot Verdasco to keep his Round of 16 date with the Swiss maestro.
It was the 50th win at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden for Nadal, who has lifted the trophy three times, in 2007 (over Novak Djokovic), 2009 (Andy Murray) and 2013 (Juan Martin del Potro).
"History says that this tournament works well for me," Nadal, who holds a 23-12 winning record over Federer, told reporters.
Federer has also enjoyed his time at Indian Wells, winning four times with the last triumph coming in 2012.
Three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic also had reason to celebrate as the second seed ran off the last five games to overcome big-hitting Juan Martin del Potro 7-5 4-6 6-1 in a bottom half of the draw stacked full of top players.
"It was definitely difficult to overcome this challenge tonight," Djokovic said. "The third set was probably the best tennis that I played this year and I'm just glad I was able to pick up my game."
The victory gave Djokovic a chance for revenge as he next meets young Australian Nick Kyrgios, who defeated the Serb at this month's Mexican Open on his way to the semi-finals.
Kyrgios prevailed 6-3 6-4 over Alexander Zverev in an entertaining first tour-level meeting between the young guns.
A controlled Kyrgios put on a masterful display, mixing strong serving with an array of showman shots to beat Germany's 19-year-old Zverev, a friend from their junior tennis days.
"I thought I just competed well," Kyrgios, 21, said. "He's got a big game. I was happy with my performance."
Fourth seed Kei Nishikori of Japan also cruised into the fourth round with a 6-2 6-2 rout of Gilles Muller of Luxembourg.
Muller, who won his first ATP World Tour title in Sydney at the start of the year, made only 49 percent of his first serves and Nishikori broke him four times.
Nishikori next faces American Donald Young, who needed seven match points to complete a 6-4 1-6 6-3 victory over 14th-seeded Frenchman Lucas Pouille.
American Jack Sock joined the Round of 16 by knocking out Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, edging a third-set tie-breaker to advance 3-6 6-3 7-6(7).

LONDON Carlos Sainz is a happy eater again and the Spanish Formula One driver's mother is delighted.
Heavier, faster and more physical, the 2017 cars are subjecting drivers like the Toro Rosso youngster to far greater G-forces through corners that can now be taken flat out on fatter tyres.
As a result, Sainz and others have been putting on muscle over the winter to gain upper body strength. Previously they were more preoccupied with losing weight in a sport where the lightest men have enjoyed an advantage.
Sainz, whose father and namesake was a world rally champion, was vocal last year about the dangers of shedding too much but he told Reuters during testing in Barcelona that the situation was now much healthier.
"This year I have had diets but diets to be fit, not diets to be as slim and as skinny as possible...and because of that, I am a much happier person," said the 21-year-old.
"At the end of 2016 my mum could tell me, every time I was coming home: ‘You look like you are not yourself, you look very skinny, you can see your bones here.’ It’s not normal.
"She’s extremely happy and she now sees a smile on my face when I eat her food, while before I was sitting there sad with a piece of chicken and I was completely annoyed about it."
A year ago, Sainz and other drivers such as Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo were being pushed to shed kilos to gain performance.
Formula One cars have a minimum weight limit, minus fuel but with driver included, and designers aim to get it down as far as possible so that additional ballast can be distributed around the car to improve handling.
In 2014, the first year of the V6 turbo hybrid era, the limit did not compensate sufficiently for the heavier engines and drivers had to lose weight - in some cases an unhealthy amount.
Now, it is important to be strong enough to get to the finish.
"I think this year they will be proper gladiators out there, you know," commented Mercedes's reigning but retired champion Nico Rosberg.
"The cars will take them to their physical limits and we might even see drivers losing race wins because of just being 'game over' physically."
Pit crews have also been busy in the gym to practise manhandling the heavier and larger Pirelli tyres.
If there are any complaints, they come from drivers like Force India's lanky Frenchman Esteban Ocon who has had to eat more than he would wish.
"I had to eat so much food," the 20-year-old said of winter training that has seen him add five kg. "I was force-feeding, because you can't take on weight if you don't do that. It's been very hard from all aspects but I've been progressing so much."
Britain's Jolyon Palmer, preparing for his second year with Renault, has put on three to four kg.
"I had the full works at Christmas (dinner)," he said. "Christmas was anything goes."

LONDON The old ringmaster has gone, pushed aside by Formula One's new American owners, and the marketing men have moved in with a mission to overhaul the circus and give spectators something more modern for their money.
If an era ended in January with the exit of Bernie Ecclestone, following Liberty Media's takeover, the Formula One season starting in Australia on March 26 marks a bright new dawn.
The cars are faster, wider and more aggressive-looking with  fatter tyres and revised aerodynamics but, behind the scenes,  more far-reaching changes are being mapped out to drive expansion.
Sean Bratches and Ross Brawn have been appointed managing directors for the commercial and sporting sides respectively, under chairman Chase Carey, and sponsorship and research executives recruited.
The sport is set to accelerate further away from the Ecclestone era, one in which the 86-year-old controlled  everything with a famous reluctance to delegate.
"There will be a point in the season...where we start to effectuate change," Bratches told Reuters. "We are going to be very aggressive. We are going to try new things, all in the spirit of better serving Formula One fans."
In the short-term that means building up the race weekend, adding in entertainment and events along the lines of SuperBowl week, exploiting digital platforms and building fan engagement through social media. [nL3N1GC4RX]
Longer term, expect new races - with Las Vegas and other U.S. destination cities high on the wish list - closer ties to  promoters and a push to maximize revenue.
"We are not yet really even a player in the digital media landscape, so that's an opportunity for us to add some digital dimension to our traditional broadcast media," Carey said in January.

SLOW BURN
Brawn, the former Honda and Mercedes boss who won titles with his own BrawnGP team and was previously Ferrari technical director, has a three and five-year plan on the sporting side.
It has to be slow burn because of contracts that run to 2020 but he is looking at everything from the format of races to how the sport should look and sound.
"In the five-year program we’ve got to identify what sort of engine we want in the future, because that’s the sort of timescale it takes, and list the things that are important," he told an audience at a talk in Oxford this month.
In the near term, he is putting together a group of engineers to try and come up with "a more intelligent design of car".
Leveling the playing field, allowing smaller teams a chance to compete against wealthy manufacturers, and keeping traditional races on the calendar are high on the agenda.
"I think for sure the philosophy of Liberty and the management now in FOM is to look at things in a more complete way," Brawn said.
"Not just the amount of money we can get from a race but what does it offer Formula One, what opportunities?
"Do we become partners in promoting the races? Because up until now most of the consideration has been how much they can pay. And we want to change that balance a bit."
"Where the race is, and how it’s held are going to be vital for the future," said the Briton.
Ensuring the 20 drivers were the best in the world, free of commercial considerations, is another box yet to be ticked and one linked to the thorny subject of a fairer distribution of revenues.
Brawn said that only truly applied to the top half of the grid at present.
"We should have a true meritocracy in Formula One. But you can’t do that because some of the teams rely on the commercial input of their drivers, else they wouldn’t survive," he said.
"So you have to create a platform where the small teams can survive and then you can start to insist that they pick drivers on merit and not on what money they bring with them."

Colombian Nairo Quintana laid down an early marker for the Tour de France when he won the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race after holding on to his overall lead at the end of the final time trial on Tuesday.
Australian Rohan Dennis (BMC) prevailed in the 10.5-km solo effort against the clock to finish second overall ahead of France's Thibaut Pinot (FDJ).
Quintana (Movistar), a twice Tour de France runner-up who built his victory with a win in the main mountain stage that ended up the Terminillo pass, finished with a 25-second advantage over Dennis, with Pinot ending up 36 seconds off the pace.
World champion Peter Sagan, one of the top favorites for Saturday's classic Milan-San Remo, was nearly taken down when a lady with a dog walked on a pedestrian crossing just in front of him.

BUENOS AIRES Divisions of U.S. media companies Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) won a joint contract to  broadcast Argentine soccer matches for five years from next season, the Argentine Football Association said on Tuesday.
Fox Sports Latin America, a unit of Fox, and Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System Latin America Inc won a three-way race for television broadcast rights against the United States' ESPN and Spanish company MediaPro.
Terms of the deal were not released, but local media reported that Fox and Turner would pay $206 million per year and some $77.2 million as a guarantee. The channels will begin broadcasting when the 2017-18 season begins later this year.
The companies will also take on the court case brought by Argentine media company Grupo Clarin SA (CLA.BA) against the soccer association, which sold ownership rights to the federal government for its subsidized, free-to-view Futbol para Todos (Soccer for All) program in 2009.
Former left-wing President Christina Fernandez's move to bring top-flight matches into the households of soccer-obsessed Argentines for free was widely considered a political masterstroke and emblematic of her populist policymaking during her eight years in power.
The new center-right government of President Mauricio Macri, a former chairman of top club Boca Juniors who took office in December 2015, made a deal with the association last month to rescind the contract, which had been due to run until 2019.
Macri has focused on reducing subsidies to cut Argentina's wide fiscal deficit.
The broadcast deal comes a week after Argentine players ended a strike that delayed the start of the season by more than a month. Many players in the financially troubled league, especially in the lower divisions, were owed up to five months in salaries.

LONDON Force India's Formula One cars will sport a new pink livery this season after the team signed a sponsorship deal with Austrian water technology company BWT.
Team co-owner Vijay Mallya said in a statement on Tuesday that the deal, which will make the cars stand out at the Australian season-opener next week, was one of the most significant partnerships in Force India's 10-year history.
No financial details were given.
"Changing the color of our cars is an indication of the strength of this new partnership and a real statement of intent from BWT," added Mallya of the pink, magenta and silver color scheme.
Mexican driver Sergio Perez and French team mate Esteban Ocon will also feature pink on their helmets. Mercedes-powered Force India finished a best-ever fourth overall last season.

SAO PAULO Brazilian federal police on Tuesday arrested two people accused of taking bribes in return for infrastructure contracts in Rio de Janeiro, including the construction of a new subway line for the 2016 Olympic Games.
The police operation targeted Luiz Carlos Velloso, a former undersecretary of transportation for the state government, and Heitor Lopes de Souza, a director for subway operator Riotrilhos, police sources said. Their lawyers could not be reached immediately for comment.
The two men will be charged with money laundering and taking bribes, according to a police statement. Bribes were often tied to fraudulent contract extensions for the subway line, police said.
The subway connecting downtown Rio to the Olympic Park in Barra de Tijuca was inaugurated days before the Games started in August, after a series of delays and budget overruns doubled the cost to nearly 10 billion reais ($3.2 billion).
The police action is a part of the sweeping "Operation Car Wash" investigation into corruption and political kickbacks throughout Brazil, which has snared dozens of senior politicians and business executives over the past three years.

DURBAN South Africa’s government has expressed disappointment at the decision to strip Durban of the right to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, saying the budget it had guaranteed for the event was sufficient.
The Commonwealth Games Federation said on Monday it was seeking a new host because the coastal city had failed to deliver on the promises it had made in its bid, including on governance, venues, funding and risk management.
But South Africa’s Minister of Sport, Fikile Mbalula, said the financial demands of the CGF were excessive, and that in a tough economic climate the country would not leave itself exposed to an "open-ended guarantee" on the event's budget.
He said the government disagreed with the CGF's statement, while respecting its decision as the rights holder.
"Our country is regrettably not in a position to make huge financial commitments given the current competing socio-economic needs and global economic downturn," he told reporters on Tuesday.
"In the interests of fiscal discipline and financial prudency, our government has considered all options and remains confident that we have acted in the best interest of South Africa."
Durban missed deadlines last November to sign the host city contract, establish an organizing committee and make contracted payments to the CGF.
Mbalula said the government had approved a budget of 4.32 billion rand  (270.08 million pounds) which it believed was ample, using the country’s hosting of the All Africa Games 18 years ago as a yardstick.
"The 1999 All Africa Games are comparable in size, the number of athletes, the number of technical officials and the duration, to the planned Commonwealth Games of 2022," Mbalula said.
"South Africa successfully hosted the All Africa Games with a budget of 252 million rand. Should it be compounded at 6  percent per annum over a period of 21 years, it will amount to 808 million rand in 2022.
"The actual cost of the [All Africa] Games is an illustration that a multi-code sport event can be successfully hosted within an affordable budget."
Birmingham and Liverpool have expressed an interest in stepping in to replace Durban in 2022. The 2018 event will be held on Australia's Gold Coast.

Briton Joanna Rowsell Shand announced her retirement from international cycling on Tuesday, calling time on a stellar 10-year career that garnered two Olympic golds and five World Championship triumphs.
The 28-year-old track and road cyclist, who is also a four-times European champion and won the individual pursuit at the last Commonwealth Games, claimed gold in the team pursuit at the 2012 London Olympics and repeated the feat in Rio last year.
"Today I am announcing my retirement from international cycling competition," Rowsell Shand said in a statement.
"I have enjoyed this fabulous career and the decision to step away has been the hardest I've ever had to make, but now is the time for me to move on. I'm now looking forward to the next phase of my life and new challenges."
In retirement, Rowsell Shand plans to establish a cycle-coaching business.
"I won't be stepping away from the cycling world completely and I'm enjoying doing some coaching work including setting up my own company," she added.
Team mate Laura Kenny, who raced alongside Rowsell Shand on both Olympic successes, offered her tribute on Instagram.
"Congratulations on such a wonderful career. I have been lucky enough to have you there when my own journey began and have loved every minute of it. Good luck in your next chapter," Kenny said.

Venezuela rallied for three runs in the ninth inning to beat Italy 4-3 in a tie-breaker game in Guadalajara, Mexico to advance to Round Two of the World Baseball Classic on Monday.
Italy led 2-1 going into the ninth, but on the second pitch of the final frame, twice American League MVP Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers hit a towering home run to tie it.
Rougned Odor singled off the top of the outfield wall to score Victor Martinez with the go-ahead run and Odor later scored on a suicide squeeze bunt by Alcides Escobar to give Venezuela an insurance run, which proved necessary.
Italy's Alex Liddi homered to lead off the bottom of the ninth against closer Francisco Rodriguez, but the right-hander held on for the save.
John Andreoli homered to break a 1-1 tie in the bottom of the seventh, briefly giving the Italians hope of making the second round for the second straight Classic.
Andreoli stepped to the plate with two outs in the ninth, but Rodriguez got him to ground out to third.
Both Venezuela and Italy entered the game with 1-2 records. The win sent Venezuela to San Diego for Round Two and a game against Team USA on Wednesday. Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic play the Pool F opener at Petco Park on Tuesday.
Earlier, Didi Gregorius homered and drove in five runs as the Netherlands crushed Israel 12-2 in Tokyo to move closer to a semi-final spot.
The win left the Netherlands with a 1-1 record in second-round play, behind Pool E leaders Japan, who won their opening game.
The loss was the first of the tournament for Israel, who dipped to 1-1 and play Japan in their Pool E finale while the Netherlands take on winless Cuba.
The top two teams in the pool advance.
Jair Jurrjens, who pitched in Major League Baseball for eight seasons, gave the Netherlands six solid innings of work, limiting Israel to one run on five hits.
Dutch bats, meanwhile, pounded Israel pitching for 15 hits with Andrelton Simmons, Wladimir Balentien and Yurendell de Caster each collecting three.
But it was Gregorius who did much of the damage, the New York Yankees shortstop keying a four-run fourth inning with a three-run blast into the Tokyo Dome's right field seats.

Second seed Angelique Kerber put on a determined display to rally past France's Pauline Parmentier 7-5 3-6 7-5 in the scorching desert heat to reach the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open on Monday.
Kerber, who will reclaim the world number one ranking next week from the absent Serena Williams, reeled off the last three games to take the opener after facing a set point, and was a point from trailing 5-2 in the third before surging to victory.
"It was a tough match and a high-level match from both of us," the German said on court after her two-hour, 33-minute victory. "Pauline played unbelievably from the first ball, and we both battled until the end."
Other seeds advancing included Venus Williams, Madison Keys and Caroline Wozniacki, while fifth seed Simona Halep and sixth seed Agnieszka Radwanska were ousted by France's Kristina Mladenovic and China's Peng Shuai, respectively.
The ultra-fit Kerber persevered despite seeing her opponent save 13 break points in the match.
"She is a really tricky opponent," the German said. "She played a lot of spin, especially from the forehand side.
"I'd had great practices in the last few months so I'm ready to stay on court for three hours."
Williams saved three match points in her opening match but the 12th seed faced no such drama in her 6-4 6-2 victory over Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic.
Next up for the 36-year-old American will be Chinese qualifier Peng, who eliminated Poland's Radwanska 6-4 6-4.
Peng, working to regain form since undergoing back surgery in 2015, knows she is capable of holding her own against the top seeds, having twice beaten Radwanska at the U.S. Open and defeated Williams at last year's China Open.
"I'm really happy that I can come back and play this tournament again -- after my back surgery I almost ended my career," she said in an on-court interview. "But I spent a lot of time and fight hard to be here."
Halep, playing her first event in five weeks due to a knee injury, fell 6-3 6-3 to 28th seed Mladenovic, who is riding high after notching her maiden WTA title at St Petersburg, which she followed up by reaching the Mexican Open final.
Next up for Kerber will be 14th-seeded Russian Elena Vesnina, who recovered from a bout of dizziness to beat 25th seed Timea Babos of Hungary 6-4 1-6 6-4.
American ninth seed Keys routed 19-year-old Naomi Osaka of Japan 6-1 6-4 to reach the Round of 16 against 13th seed Wozniacki, a 6-3 6-1 winner over Czech Katerina Siniakova.

Stan Wawrinka breezed into the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open on Monday and saw another seed removed from his path to the final when lucky loser Yoshihito Nishioka of Japan turned his match against Tomas Berdych upside down.
The Swiss third seed romped past Philipp Kohlschreiber 7-5 6-3 and will next face Nishioki rather than Berdych after the 21-year-old Japanese overcame a 6-1 5-2 deficit for a stunning 1-6 7-6(5) 6-4 win over the 13th seeded Czech.
The top half of the draw has already lost world number one Andy Murray and offers rather smoother sailing than a bottom half, which features multiple grand slam winners Novak Djokovic, Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer.
Wawrinka needed just 78 minutes to improve to his career record against Germany's Kohlschreiber to 5-0, whipping a trademark backhand winner down the line to end the third round contest at Indian Wells.
"I was serving well," the 31-year-old said. "I think I'm moving better and better, and it's all positive so far.
"I'm feeling good in my body, so that's the most important."
Nishioka, who gave Nadal a run for his money in Acapulco at the start of the month, surprised even himself with his victory over Berdych.
"I tried to do my best, but today I couldn't figure out how could I beat Berdych," Nishioka said. "I tried to find a way, and then I think he give me a little bit of a chance.
"My body was feeling like I cannot move that much, but I just stayed focused and tried to fight. And then I found a way."
Berdych held match point on Nishioka's serve in the 10th game of the second set, before the Japanese rallied to level the contest in a tie-break.
After trading breaks at the start of the decider, Nishioka broke again for a 2-1 lead and did not look back.
Eighth seed Dominic Thiem of Austria made it through to the fourth round by beating Mischa Zverev 6-1 6-4 in less than an hour.
Two days after ousting top seed Murray, Vasek Pospisil's run in Indian Wells came to an end as he fell to fellow qualifier Dusan Lajovic of Serbia 6-7(4) 6-3 7-5.
Pospisil served for the match at 5-3 in the third set but was broken to love and the Canadian also squandered a match point in the 10th game before Lajovic prevailed.
Lajovic, ranked 106, will face Pablo Carreno Busta, who earned a free pass into the fourth round after fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut withdrew before their match due to an abdominal muscle injury.

TORONTO Ed Whitlock, an English-born Canadian runner who became the first septuagenarian to run a marathon in under three hours, died on Monday aged 86.
Whitlock, and accomplished British club runner who grew up in London before moving to Canada after university, died of prostate cancer in a Toronto hospital a week after his 86th birthday, his family said in a statement.
Whitlock, at 72, became the first septuagenarian to crack the three-hour mark with a world marathon record of two hours 59 minutes 10 seconds at the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon.
He then set world master's marathon records for ages 75-plus, 80-plus and, most recently, 85-plus with a time of 3:56.38 in Toronto last October.
"This is an enormous loss to Canada and the global running community," Alan Brookes, race director of the Toronto Waterfront Marathon said in a statement.
"Somehow we thought Ed would just go on setting records forever. We are especially saddened at Canada Running Series."
After university, Whitlock put the sport on hold while he embarked on an engineering career in Canada and only returned to running in his 40s. He held daily training sessions at a cemetery near his home in Milton, Ontario.
Whitlock was popularly known not only for his endurance but also his modesty. He had said he was often uncomfortable by all the attention he garnered from other runners, many who considered him an inspiration.
"I don’t know how to respond to them. Well how do you respond to that?” he once said. "I suppose it's nice for people to say I inspire them but I am somewhat embarrassed and I don’t know what the appropriate response is to that."

- As Barcelona stumbled to a 2-1 defeat by Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday, many put their struggles down to the absence of Neymar. But the hole left at the back by the missing Samuel Umtiti was just as telling.
Brazilian forward Neymar, inspirational in Wednesday's stunning 6-1 Champions League win over Paris St Germain, was unavailable in Galicia with a thigh injury, leaving the team lacking inspiration in attack.
In defense they were notably fragile without French center-back Umtiti, who has played a crucial part this season in his first campaign since joining from Olympique Lyonnais last summer for 25 million euros  ($26.7 million).    Barcelona have won every one of the 16 league games in which he has featured, while emerging triumphant in just two of 11 games without him.
His absence had a direct impact in the defeat by Depor, with both of the hosts’ goals coming from set pieces.
Javier Mascherano botched an attempted clearance that led to Joselu’s opener, while Umtiti’s replacement Jordi Alba was left rooted to the spot as Alex Bergantinos outjumped him to head the winning goal.
Playing center-back is a tricky assignment at Barcelona, as highlighted by the string of defenders - from Dmytro Chygrynskiy to Thomas Vermaelen - who have attempted to perform the role but failed to make a mark at Camp Nou.
Umtiti took to it like a fish to water, playing with supreme confidence for a 23-year-old, and relishing the attacking responsibilities as much as the defensive ones.
Strong in the air, he is also extremely comfortable on the ball and can take it past opponents to find the right angle for a pass to help build attacks from the back.
"To be honest I am surprised by Umtiti’s quick adaption," said coach Luis Enrique. "It’s a position where the club has always had handicaps."
Although both of them were excellent against PSG, Mascherano is the victim of Umtiti’s success, with a clamor growing for the Frenchman to be Gerard Pique’s partner while the Argentine gets benched.
It hasn’t been a flawless season for Umtiti, with poor performances against PSG in the 4-0 defeat in Paris and the 2-1 first leg defeat by Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey last 16.
But these missteps do little to mask the quality and calmness he has brought. He could be a rock in the defense for  years to come.

LONDON Three times Tour de France winner Chris Froome spoke out in support of his embattled Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford on Monday while apologizing to fans who felt let down by mistakes over anti-doping and testing practices.
Froome added in a statement that the team "need to do better" in future.
"It disappoints me hugely to see the way in which Team Sky has been portrayed by the media recently. It does not reflect the support crew and the riders that I see around me," said the rider.
"At the same time, I completely understand why people feel let down by the way in which the situation has been handled, and going forward we need to do better.
"I would like to apologize for this on behalf of myself and the other riders of Team Sky who feel passionately about our sport and winning clean. I believe in the people around me, and what we are doing," added Froome.
Former British Cycling performance director Brailsford has come under fire for failing to prove what was in a medical package ordered by a team doctor and delivered to Bradley Wiggins at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine race.
Brailsford told lawmakers that the package contained the legal decongestant Fluimucil - although the lack of a paper trail has called into question Sky's medical record-keeping.
Team Sky and British Cycling have both been subject to an investigation by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) into allegations of wrongdoing in the sport. Both have denied any doping violations.
Several Team Sky riders have expressed support for Brailsford, who launched the team in 2010 and has led it to four Tour triumphs, although Froome had kept his silence on the matter until Monday.
"With respect to Dave Brailsford, he has created one of the best sports teams in the world. Without Dave B, there is no Team Sky," he said.
"He has supported me throughout the last seven years of my career and I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunities and the experiences I've had.
"By his own admission, mistakes have been made, but protocols have been put in place to ensure that those same mistakes will not be made again."

Bournemouth's Jack Wilshere has delayed a decision on his Arsenal future as the on-loan midfielder focuses on helping the south coast club to retain their place in the Premier League.
Once regarded as one of the brightest young hopes in English soccer before a series of injury setbacks, Wilshere has a year remaining on his Arsenal contract but British media reported that the north London club are yet to open talks regarding a new deal with the 25-year-old.
"I'm not thinking about my future," Wilshere told British media.
"My main concern at the moment is trying to keep Bournemouth in this league. I've got a year left at Arsenal. As soon as the season ends, I'll sit down and I'll think about it."
Bournemouth, who ended an eight-game winless run in the league in Saturday's 3-2 victory over West Ham United, are still in danger of being dragged into the relegation battle, with just six points separating them from the bottom three.
Wilshere, who left Arsenal in search of for more game time, has been relegated to the bench in Bournemouth's last two league games.
"No matter what happens next year - if I'm here, if I'm not, if I'm at Arsenal, whatever - no-one wants a relegation next to their name," Wilshere added.
"You don't want to be involved in a team that got relegated. We're trying to put Bournemouth in a good position. At the end of the season I'll have a think about it."
Bournemouth, who are in their second season in the Premier League, host relegation rivals Swansea City on Saturday.

ZURICH The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday upheld a lifetime ban levied against Sergei Portugalov, former chief of the Russian Athletics Federation's Medical Commission, for his role in providing illicit substances to Russian athletes.
Lausanne-based CAS upheld the ban as part of an arbitration involving the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) and the Russian Athletics Federation, citing in a statement "clear evidence" that he violated IAAF doping rules governing possession and trafficking of prohibited substances.
In a 2015 report, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) wrote that Portugalov supplied performance enhancing drugs to athletes and coaches, administered doping programs and "even injected athletes himself".

Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino has backed striker Son Heung-min to step up in the absence of Premier League joint-top scorer Harry Kane, who is sidelined with an ankle injury.
Kane left the field just 10 minutes into a 6-0 FA Cup thrashing of Millwall on Sunday, but a hat-trick from Son and goals from midfielder Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and striker Vincent Janssen ensured Spurs' progress to the semi-finals.
"I'm very happy with Son. He can play like a striker. One of our best performances was against Manchester City and he was the striker when Harry was injured," Pochettino told British media.
"I think we have different possibilities, to play different formations. Of course I'm disappointed by Harry's injury but now we have to find solutions and see which is the best player to replace him."
Kane's injury could also provide an opening for Janssen, who scored his first goal from open play against Millwall, and Pochettino believes the Dutchman could prove to be an important figure in Spurs attempt to finish the season strongly.
"In the last few months he's stepped up and started to work better and I was happy in the way he was performing on the training ground," Pochettino added.
"Janssen was working very hard, today was a great opportunity to score and he scored."
Second-placed Spurs, who are 10 points behind league leaders Chelsea, will host 10th-placed Southampton on Sunday.

Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp has praised midfielder Emre Can's resilience for playing through calf problems throughout the season after the German scored the winner in the Premier League victory over Burnley on Sunday.
Can's long distance strike on the hour completed a 2-1 comeback victory for the Merseyside club after fellow midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum had canceled an early strike from Burnley's Ashley Barnes.
"He had a few problems with his calf in the last few months which we couldn't sort quickly enough because sometimes he had it and sometimes not," Klopp told the reporters.
"We had a lot of specialists look at it to try to find out. We couldn't say 'go on holiday for four weeks and see if it gets better', we couldn't do that.
"It looks like we have found the solution now and he doesn't have the problems any more."
The German international was partially responsible for Burnley's opener, allowing visiting full-back Matthew Lawton the space to cross for Barnes to score but Klopp opted to focus on Can's positive performance in the second half.
"In the first half, for their goal, he should have made the challenge before they made the cross," Klopp added. "We have to react, and he reacted well second half."
Liverpool, who are fourth in the league, visit third-placed Manchester City on Sunday before hosting seventh-placed Everton in Merseyside derby on April 1.

Undefeated Dominican Republic erupted for seven runs in the 11th inning as the defending champions beat Colombia 10-3 in the World Baseball Classic in Miami on Sunday.
Welington Castillo belted a bases-loaded, two-run single to break a 3-3 tie and Jean Segura's double added three more runs as Dominicans completed first round play 3-0.
They topped Pool C, while the United States also advanced to the final eight, thanks to an 8-0 shutout of Canada.
Colombia (1-2) and Canada (0-3) were eliminated.
Also on Sunday, undefeated Puerto Rico (3-0) beat Italy 9-3 to top Pool D, while Mexico edged Venezuela 11-9 in Jalisco, Mexico.
The result means Mexico (1-2) and Italy (1-2) will have a play-in game on Monday to join Puerto Rico in the final eight. Venezuela (1-2) are done and dusted.
Castillo, the Dominican Republic catcher, also made a key defensive stop with a tag at the plate to complete a ninth-inning double play that forced extra innings against Colombia.
A novel tournament rule designed to cut down on long extra inning games helped set the stage for the outcome.
Runners were placed on first and second base to start the 11th under the rule and after a sacrifice bunt by Mel Rojas Jr, Colombia intentionally walked Gregory Polanco to load the bases.
Castillo then singled to left to drive in Jose Bautista and Carlos Santana.
Colombia could have won the game in the ninth but Oscar Mercado was called out at the plate on a tag by Castillo.
Colombia protested the call to no avail as Reynaldo Rodriguez and outfielder Tito Polo were ejected.
Meanwhile, U.S. starting pitcher Danny Duffy notched seven strikeouts in four innings, giving up two hits, to get the win as the Americans blanked Canada.
Third baseman Nolan Arenado hit a three-run home run as the U.S. raced to a 7-0 lead after two innings.
"I've been swinging the bat well. It was nice to get one out of there," Arenado told MLB Network.
"We are really enjoying this time together and we want to keep going."
Much has been made of the decision of many top U.S. pitchers to skip the tournament, but Arenado praised the pitchers who have turned up, including Duffy, Chris Archer and Marcus Stroman.
"They have been unbelievable," he said. "They are setting the tone. We are really enjoying this time together and we want to keep going."
Japan and surprising Israel also are undefeated in the tournament.
Japan moved to 4-0 with an 8-6 second-round victory over the Netherlands in 11 innings in Tokyo. Sho Nakata delivered the winner, a two-run single to left field.
Israel won their fourth straight with an unexpected 4-1 victory over Cuba, also in Tokyo.
The 38-year-old Jason Marquis showed he was one still to be reckoned with as the right-hander allowed just one run and four hits in 5 2/3 innings for Israel.

French Open champion Garbine Muguruza got a fright from Kayla Day but outlasted the precocious American teenager 3-6 7-5 6-2 to reach the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open in California on Sunday.
Day took the first set from the seventh seed and had two break point opportunities at 5-5 in the second but the 17-year-old was unable to hammer home her advantage.
Muguruza used her experience to get out of trouble, eventually set up a meeting with Ukrainian 10th seed Elina Svitolina in just over two hours under a relentless sun at Indian Wells.
"I started a bit off," the 23-year-old Spaniard said. "My shots weren't there. The experience of keeping calm and fighting helped; it's no secret.
"I think I'm improving in general a lot of things, but I know that maybe two years ago this match I wouldn't turn it around. I think that's experience."
Muguruza was impressed with Day, the U.S. Open junior singles champion.
"She reminds me a little of me, when I was super motivated and playing very good," she said.
Day hoped to learn from her defeat.
"I was pretty upset after my match, because it didn't go the way I wanted it in the end but if you look at the big picture, I was able to push a top 10 player really far," she said.
On a day when three matches went to third set tiebreaks, there ultimately were no big upsets, with Czech third seed Karolina Pliskova and Russian eighth seed Svetlana Kuznetzkova also winning.
And fifth seed Slovakian Dominica Cibulkova also advanced, if only barely, saving a match point in a 2-6 7-6(5) 7-6(4) win over left-handed Czech Kristyna Pliskova, whose 18 aces were not enough.
Pliskova also had 13 break opportunities in the third set alone, but converted only two.
In an even closer encounter, Swiss 15th seed Timea Bacsinszky survived four match points to beat Dutch 18th seed Kiki Bertens 6-3 5-7 7-6(8).
Eleventh seed Johanna Konta was the highest ranked player to fall, the Briton edged 3-6 6-3 7-6(1) by Carolina Garcia of France.

Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal are on course for another showdown after winning their opening matches at the BNP Paribas Open in the California desert on Sunday.
Less than two months after Federer claimed an 18th major title in a classic Australian Open final, the two great rivals could meet again, this time in the fourth round at Indian Wells.
Both won in style on Sunday, with Spanish fifth seed Nadal pouncing on Guido Pella's serve to break the Argentine five times en route to a 6-3 6-2 victory in sizzling afternoon heat on the stadium hard court.
Federer enjoyed the relative cool of an evening match but was back in the locker room before working up a major sweat, easing to a 6-2 6-1 win over Frenchman Stephane Robert in front of an appreciative capacity crowd of around 16,000 spectators.
"The beginning was difficult, just because I’ve never played him before so I’m not sure about his patterns," ninth seed Federer said in a courtside interview.
"I was very happy I was able to loosen up and play good tennis. I started to serve really well, move around the court great."
While it was Federer's first match against Robert, he is far more familiar with Nadal. They have met 35 times, with Nadal holding a 23-12 edge.
Needing to win their respective third-round matches for a 36th meeting to happen, Nadal next faces 26th-seeded compatriot Fernando Verdasco, while Federer plays American 24th seed Steve Johnson.
"For sure I saw the draw," a relaxed Nadal said, adding that he was not really focused on Federer.
"I go day-by-day. That's my way, to focus on my next match. I played I think a solid match (today)."

BIG TEST
The path to the final on that side of the draw is littered with tricky obstacles, however, as second seed Novak Djokovic and in-form Australian Nick Kyrgios lie in wait as potential future opponents.
Djokovic, however, must next negotiate a dangerous third-round opponent in Argentine Juan Martin del Potro after the three-times defending champion advanced with an unconvincing 6-4 7-6(5) victory over Briton Kyle Edmund.
"First match, already a big test," the Serb said at a tournament where all the seeded players had first-round byes. "Throughout most of that second set, he was a better player. I got lucky to pull through in straight sets.
Marin Cilic was the only top-ranked player to lose on Sunday, the Croatian sixth seed beaten 4-6 7-5 6-4 by American teenager Taylor Fritz.
The tournament lost its top seed on Saturday when Andy Murray was upset 6-4 7-6(5) by Canadian Vasek Pospisil, who rushed the net whenever the opportunity arose and also feasted on the Scot's second serve.
Murray praised his conqueror, while at the same time lamented an off night with his second serve.
"I have never really practised playing against serve-and-volleyers in my career but when I have come up against them, it's normally been a game style I have enjoyed playing against," Murray said.
"It wasn't so much the serve-volley that was the problem. It was my own serve and not getting enough opportunities when he was serving."

Venezuela international Josef Martinez scored a hat-trick as Atlanta United won a battle of Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion teams with a 6-1 blitzing of Minnesota United in heavy snow on Sunday.
Atlanta produced a blizzard of goals and were 3-0 up inside 27 minutes as their home opener in Minneapolis turned into a nightmare for Minnesota on the snow-covered pitch.
Minnesota have leaked 11 goals in their first two matches.
Paraguay international Miguel Almiron added two goals for Atlanta, who bounced back after losing at home in their MLS debut last week.
Sunday's match was played with an orange ball in sub-freezing weather and play had to be stopped several times for the snow to be cleared from the touchlines.
In other games, New York City FC hammered D.C. United 4-0 at Yankee Stadium, with Spanish veteran David Villa scoring twice.
Villa, who netted 23 times last season, bagged his first goal of the new season with a well-placed header, before adding a second with a left-footed strike from an acute angle.
In sunny southern California, Portland Timbers edged Los Angeles Galaxy 1-0, Colombian midfielder Diego Chara scoring the early winner on the break.
Los Angeles played nearly an hour with only 10 men after Belgian defender Jelle Van Damme was sent off for two yellow cards.
The Galaxy almost equalized in the dying seconds, with Portland keeper Jake Gleeson making a fine reaction save from a Jose Villarreal glancing header.
After two rounds, the Timbers are one of four teams with perfect 2-0-0 records, along with Houston Dynamo, San Jose Earthquakes and New York Red Bulls.

(The Sports Xchange) - Key forward LaMarcus Aldridge of the San Antonio Spurs is out indefinitely because of a minor heart arrhythmia, the team announced on Saturday.
"All parties have concluded that at the current time it is best for Aldridge to refrain from play until further tests and examinations are completed," the Spurs said in a press release.
The 6-foot-11, 260-pound Aldridge, a five-time All-Star,
has the Spurs' second leading averages in both scoring (17.3) and rebounding (7.4).
At the end of his rookie NBA season when he was with the Portland Trail Blazers, Aldridge was diagnosed in April 2007 with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which is an abnormality that can cause a rapid heartbeat.
He underwent a procedure to fix the problem and missed the final nine games of the season. Four years later, he underwent the same procedure and missed time at the start of the 2011-12 season when there was a recurrence of his condition.
The Spurs are already without forward Kawhi Leonard, their leading scorer, because of a concussion.

NICE, France Team Sky came close to winning a fifth Paris-Nice title in six years when Sergio Henao claimed the overall lead on Saturday, with the Colombian hoping to dedicate a victory to under-fire team principal Dave Brailsford on Sunday.
Henao, who finished fourth in the seventh stage won by Australian Richie Porte, leads Ireland's Dan Martin by 30 seconds and Spaniard Alberto Contador by 31 seconds going into Sunday's final stage, a 115.5-km ride featuring two category-one ascents.
"I’m really happy with the team and with Dave Brailsford.  We’re all with Dave. Dave is going through some tough moments," Henao told reporters.     "As a rider, I’ve been through extremely tough moments, so I really hope to stay in yellow tomorrow and to dedicate the victory to Sky and to Dave."
Brailsford has come under fire for failing to prove what was in a medical package ordered by a team doctor and delivered to Bradley Wiggins at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine.
Team Sky and British Cycling have both been subject of an investigation by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) into allegations of wrongdoing in the sport. Both have denied any doping violations.
Several Team Sky riders tweeted their support for Brailsford, although three-times Tour de France champion Chris Froome stayed quiet on the matter.
Henao, however, was focused on the bike, even if he could not follow Porte or Contador in the finale of Saturday's stage that ended up the col de la Couillole, a 15.7-km climb at an average gradient of 7.1 percent.
Porte (BMC) salvaged his Paris-Nice campaign with the win after he dropped out of contention in the second stage.
"It was such a sweet victory after the disaster we had earlier in the week," said Porte. "I take my hat off to the team, they never lost faith in me."
Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe (Quick Step Floors) started the day with the yellow jersey but cracked in the final climb.

NICE Australian Richie Porte salvaged his Paris-Nice campaign when he powered to victory in Saturday's seventh and penultimate stage ending up the col de la Couillole.
The BMC rider, who dropped out of contention in the second stage, attacked with 3.2 km left and crossed the line 21 seconds ahead of Spain's Alberto Contador (Trek Segafredo).
Dan Martin (Quick Step Floors) of Ireland was third after jumping ahead of Colombian Sergio Henao on the line, but the Colombian took the overall leader's yellow jersey as Team Sky closed in on a fifth victory in six years in the Race to the Sun.
"It was such a sweet victory after the disaster we had earlier in the week," said Porte. "I take my hat off to the team, they never lost faith in me."
Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe (Quick Step Floors) started the day with the yellow jersey but cracked in the final climb, a 15.7-km ascent at an average gradient of 7.1 percent, and dropped to fifth overall.
Henao, who was dropped by Contador with 1.2 km left, leads Martin by 30 seconds and the twice Tour de France champion by 31 seconds.
Contador and Martin are expected to be on the attack in Sunday's final stage, a punchy 115.5-km trek with two category-one climbs.

BARCELONA Spanish arch-rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona will meet in a pre-season friendly in Miami on July 29 in the first "Clasico" to take place outside Spain for 35 years.
The game is part of the International Champions Cup, an annual pre-season tournament which has been going since 2013, and will take place at 65,000-capacity Hard Rock stadium, home of NFL franchise the Miami Dolphins.
Barca and Real, first and second respectively in the La Liga standings, have amassed 56 domestic titles and 16 European Cups between them. They have only met on foreign soil once before, in Venezuela in 1982.
Real have been visiting the United States for their pre-season campaign since 2009, although did not go there in 2015, which is the last time Barca played in the U.S.
Barca have sought to increase their profile in America recently, opening an office in New York and setting up a youth academy in Charlotte, North Carolina last year, adding to an existing academy in Miami.
"I think today we are writing a crucial chapter in football history in the United States as this match will be a big opportunity to promote the game in this country," Barca marketing director Manel Arroyo said in a statement.
"This is something we are hoping to achieve at FC Barcelona and the recent opening of our New York office is testament to this. The match on the 29th is not only a friendly, it is much more than that: it is a game which is always passionate and one which all fans will be able to enjoy, especially here in Miami."

Karolina Pliskova roared back from a set down to outlast Olympic gold medalist Monica Puig 1-6 6-4 6-4 as the Czech third seed avoided a major upset at the BNP Paribas Open in California on Friday.
Pliskova, after falling behind 3-0 in the third set, fought through a long sixth game to help turn the tide and won six of the last seven games to advance to the third round.
"I'm definitely happy I had my serve today; it was working with me, especially in the third set when I was 0-3 down," she said in a courtside interview.
"She was playing really well, hitting the balls really fast and deep, making it tough for me to play my game."
Puig, from Puerto Rico, had never taken a set from Pliskova, but broke her Czech rival four times to sweep the opening set.
Pliskova used several service breaks of her own and served out the second set to level the match.
The Czech had 19 winners to 34 unforced errors and converted five of her seven break point opportunities in the match.
Puig's 37 unforced errors canceled out her 32 winners.
French Open champion Garbine Muguruza, the seventh seed, had slightly easier time as the Spaniard survived some nervous moments before defeating Belgian Kirsten Flipkens 6-2 6-3 in her opening round match.
The win set up a meeting with U.S. teenager Kayla Day, who surprised Australian Open semi-finalist Mirjana Lucic-Baroni of Croatia in three sets 6-4 5-7 7-5.
After taking the first set and grabbing a 5-0 lead in the second before Flipkens rallied, Muguruza broke through for the sixth and final time in the match, striking 24 winners to 28 unforced errors.
"It was a difficult match," Muguruza said post-match. "She's very talented and she can hit some critical shots and she can be tricky."
The Spaniard won her third straight match against her rival on a hard surface after splitting their first four meetings, losing twice on grass.
"It's always difficult to close out your first match," Muguruza said. "She's a very talented player, unbelievable, with a very different game. I got nervous!"
Day, 17, won the final four games of her match with the 32nd-seeded Lucic-Baroni to claim victory.
"I started to really believe I could win at 6-5 in the third," said Day. "It was still a really tough game, because I was a little bit tight to close it out. But my serve had been giving her a lot of problems, so I knew if I stuck to my game it might work out."
Among other top-seeded players, Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia and Ukrainian Elina Svitolina had the toughest assignments.
Fifth seeded Cibulkova outlasted Latvian Jelena Ostapenko 6-4 3-6 6-3 and the 10th seeded Svitolina needed three sets to defeat Wang Qiang of China 3-6 6-3 7-6(3).
Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, the eighth seed, defeated Johanna Larsson of Sweden 7-6(3) 6-4, and 11th seeded Johanna Konta prevailed 6-4 6-4 over Heather Watson in a meeting of British players.

Pitching dominated a tense 3-2 U.S. win over Colombia in Miami on Friday, settled by a 10th-inning, walk-off single by Adam Jones that ignited an emotional celebration  by the Americans.
The victory in the opening World Baseball Classic (WBC) game for the hosts of Pool C was a major relief for the U.S., who have not done better than fourth place in the three previous WBC competitions.
Colombia starter Carlos Quintana held the Americans hitless into the sixth inning before leaving when he approached the 65-pitch limit. U.S. starter Chris Archer tossed four perfect innings and left amid a scoreless tie after 41 pitches.
The U.S. had six hits in the game, one more than Colombia.
In Mexico, 2013 runners-up Puerto Rico walloped Venezuela 11-0, ending it in the seventh inning on T.J. Rivera's two-run homer that invoked the 10-run 'mercy' rule.
Puerto Rico jumped out to a 2-0 lead against starter "King" Felix Hernandez in the third and added three in the sixth on the way to victory as their pitchers stymied a Venezuela lineup that included Miguel Cabrera, Jose Altuve and Carlos Gonzalez.
Earlier in Tokyo, Alfredo Despaigne's fifth-inning grand slam gave Cuba all the runs they would need in a 4-3 win over Australia to reach the second round for a fourth consecutive tournament.
Despaigne's blast put Cuba ahead 4-1 and they held on to finish second in Pool B with a 2-1 record, setting up a showdown with surprise Pool A winner Israel on Sunday at Tokyo Dome.
For Australia, who have competed in the WBC all four times, the loss denied them a maiden berth in the second round.
Japan, who had already clinched first place in Pool B and a spot in the second round, routed China 7-1 to remain undefeated through three games.
The two-times WBC champions, who won each of their opening round games in dominant fashion, will open second-round play against the Netherlands on Sunday in Tokyo.
Defending champions Dominican Republic play the United States in one of four first-round games on Saturday.

Canada's Adam Hadwin turned red hot at the turn, reeling off five birdies in a row from the 10th on his way to a seven-under-par 64 on Friday for a one-stroke lead at the halfway mark of the Valspar Championship in Florida.
Hadwin, who has a knack for going low as evidenced by the 59 he fired in January in finishing second at the CareerBuilder Challenge, held a 36-hole lead for the first time at a PGA event as he sought a maiden victory on the tour in his 78th start.
"I hit some more quality golf shots today, gave myself a ton of looks out there and the putter stayed hot," Hadwin, who needed just 25 putts, told Golf Channel.
Right behind the bearded Canadian was first-round leader Jim Herman, who followed a brilliant opening 62 on the tree-lined Copperhead course with a level par 71 for a nine-under 133 total at Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor.
"I didn't hit the ball as close as I did yesterday," said Herman, who opened with 11 straight pars. "But I'm happy with my position so close to the lead."
Another shot back was South African Tyrone Van Aswegan, who started at the 10th and made the turn at five-under 30 on his way to a 65 for 134.
Lurking three strokes off the pace was British Open winner Henrik Stenson, a late starter who struggled with the swirling breezes after opening with a 64.
The Swede reached only 11 of 18 greens in regulation as he posted a 71 to stand tied for fourth.
"Slightly gusty conditions," said Stenson. "It's not blowing a lot. . . But it keeps on swirling and turning on us.
"So it's quite tricky out there in the afternoon. I thought I kept my patience. Yeah, I could've been a shot or two better, but that's golf."
Seventy players made the cut set at even par 142.
Among those going home were double Masters winner Bubba Watson (71-144), former world number one Luke Donald (73-144) and three-time winner this season Justin Thomas (74-145).

Newly-appointed U.S. women's basketball head coach Dawn Staley said on Friday she knows better than to mess with a winning formula that has resulted in a run of six consecutive Olympic gold medals.
The University of South Carolina women's coach, a three-time Olympic gold medallist player with the U.S. team who was enshrined into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, said she will not bring in a new coaching philosophy.
"I don't think it's any different. I think the players have made sacrifices and commitments to USA basketball, so whatever was said before is going to be the same thing that's going to be said moving forward," Staley, 46, told a conference call.
"We have to have the participation of the players in order for us to continue to be successful. So, if it isn't broken we got to continue to do what's worked for us."
Staley, who on Friday was named as the team's head coach through 2020, succeeds Geno Auriemma, who led the United States to gold medals at the past two Olympics and world championships and will serve as a special advisor.
The new coach was a point guard on U.S. teams that won Olympic gold in 1996, 2000 and 2004. She also served as an assistant on the 2008 and 2016 teams that also won Olympic gold.
Staley has coached the Gamecocks' women's team since 2008 and led them to four straight Southeastern Conference regular-season titles and three consecutive SEC Tournament crowns.
She takes over a national team in transition as four-times Olympic gold medallist Tamika Catchings has retired while some key players have not committed to playing again.
But that uncertainty is not altering Staley's approach.
"We'll cross that road when we get there," said Staley. "Players haven't committed yet nor have they told us they are not going to come back and play, so until we are at that crossroad we are going to act as if we are going to have our best players representing the USA."
The United States and Staley will first look to triumph at the 2018 FIBA Women's World Cup of Basketball in Spain where the winning team will receive an automatic berth to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
If they fall short in Spain the United States can earn an Olympic berth at either the 2019 FIBA AmeriCup or 2020 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament.

BARCELONA Formula One wrapped up pre-season testing on Friday with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen setting the pace with the fastest lap yet around the Circuit de Catalunya.
The Finn's best effort of 1:18.634 seconds, on supersoft tyres in the morning, was the first below the 1:19 barrier and 0.804 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen on the same tire compound in 1:19.438.
Raikkonen's team mate and four times world champion Sebastian Vettel had been fastest on Thursday in 1:19.024.
Before that, Mercedes had set the pace with Finland's Valtteri Bottas lapping in 1:19.310 on Wednesday. Triple champion team mate Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest on Friday.
The early signs from testing, which can be deceptive, are that champions Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull remain on a different level to the rest but that last season's gaps have closed at the top.
The season starts in Australia on March 26.
"Between the top three and the other ones it is between one second and 1.5 seconds, I think," said Haas team principal Guenther Steiner.
"There is no surprise that Mercedes and Ferrari and Red Bull came out better than everybody else. They have more resources to do more testing and that is what it is."
Haas driver Romain Grosjean brought out the red flags to stop the morning session twice on Friday, with troubled McLaren doing likewise as Spaniard Fernando Alonso had another tough session.
The team said the double world champion had experienced the same intermittent electrical shutdown that hampered Belgian rookie team mate Stoffel Vandoorne on Thursday.
"Various electrical components in the power unit and chassis were changed overnight, and the team are making further changes to eliminate variables and identify the source of the problem," said a spokeswoman.
Alonso was bottom of the timesheets, by more than a second, 4.1 seconds off Raikkonen's pace and with only 19 laps to his credit at lunchtime. He ended the day 11th with 43 laps.

NFL teams violated federal laws governing prescription drugs, according to a Washington Post story based on sealed court documents contained in a federal lawsuit filed by former players against the league and reviewed by the newspaper.
The documents showed that the league disregarded guidance from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on how to store, track, transport and distribute controlled substances, the Post said.
The National Football League denied the allegations made in the lawsuit which was brought against the league by a group of retired players.
"The allegations made by plaintiffs are meritless and the league and its clubs will continue vigorously to defend these claims," NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told Reuters on Thursday in an e-mail when asked for comment.
"The NFL clubs and their medical staffs are all in compliance with the Controlled Substances Act."
"The NFL clubs and their medical staffs continue to put the health and safety of our players first, providing all NFL players with the highest quality medical care. Any claim or suggestion to the contrary is simply wrong."
The sealed court filing, which includes testimony and documents by team and league medical personnel, describes multiple instances in which team and league officials were made aware of DEA guidelines and were either slow in responding or failed to comply, the Post said. 
The suit also contained data showing widescale use by medical staff at teams of painkillers and anti-inflammatories, the newspaper said.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegations in the suit.

LONDON Russian weightlifting is hoping to persuade the sport’s world governing body to overturn a planned new one-year ban after starting an anti-doping program that it says is an example others could follow.    Less than a year ago, Russia was banned from the Olympic Games and severely criticized by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) for its "shocking and disappointing statistics" on doping.    Now Russia is one of nine nations due to be suspended for a year because it had 10 weightlifting positives in the retesting of samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.
Any nation with three or more positives in those retests will be banned, but the start date for the exclusions will not be known until the retesting process and all appeals have been completed, probably within the coming weeks.
The new president of the Russian Weightlifting Federation, Maxim Agapitov set out to change the culture of the sport after the Olympic ban, imposed by the IWF for bringing the sport into disrepute. Many top coaches have been suspended since he took charge in November.
Agapitov is hoping he can persuade the IWF to rescind the new ban.
“We hope the suspension will be overturned by the IWF,” said Agapitov, who is seeking support from other federations.
“I have asked to speak about the suspension at the IWF executive committee when it meets in April. We hope that the IWF takes into account the changes we have instituted and the progress we have made, and that it also takes into account that we have already been penalized, severely, by being banned from the Rio Olympics.
“We have spoken to major federations about their support for our participation.”
The IWF has did not respond to requests for comment about Russia's proposal to put its case at the meeting.

COACHES REPLACED
While Kazakhstan - which has the worst doping record in the past five years, with 23 lifters banned and 10 more caught in the retests - has yet to announce any findings from an internal inquiry held six months ago, Russia has taken action.
The head coaches of Russia’s national men’s and women’s teams have been replaced. All coaches of the 30 Russian dopers sanctioned since 2008, including the 10 who were caught in the retests, have been suspended pending further investigation.
A new body will investigate how teams were prepared for past competitions and "create, if necessary, new methods", said Agapitov, who has also introduced an anti-doping exam. Any lifters who fail it will not be allowed to compete.
Half of the 98 doping positives in the retests, carried out by the International Olympic Committee, came from weightlifters. The other nations facing one-year bans are China, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey, Ukraine and Moldova.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport has yet to announce the result of appeals against the bans by Kazakhstan and Belarus.
Agapitov, a world champion in 1997 when he was promoted from third place because of doping by the two ahead of him, was himself banned for two years in 1994 after testing positive.
"I don’t know how it happened,” he said. "There were some political games going on at the time, and it’s still a secret to me."
Lack of knowledge about banned substances and regulations has been a huge problem in Russian weightlifting culture, said Agapitov. "The most important thing is education," he said.
"Russia loves weightlifting and wants it to be fair for everyone. We are making good progress, and setting an example others could follow. We need a level playing field for all weightlifters from all countries."
That last comment has been made by others in the sport for years. Paul Coffa, head of the Oceania Federation who has been involved in weightlifting for more than 50 years, labeled the former Soviet Bloc “the Doping Bloc” last year. More than half of all positives in the past 10 years have been from former Soviet Bloc countries.
Coffa said Russia's reforms were "very impressive" but he could make no meaningful judgment early in a reform program necessitated by decades of doping.

Hull City goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic has urged his team mates not to be weighed down with pressure ahead of Saturday's vital Premier League clash against relegation rivals Swansea City.
Following a promising start to manager Marco Silva's reign, Hull are winless in three games, a run which has left them second-bottom in the table, four points adrift of safety with 11 games remaining.
"Everybody needs to be cool and easy, it's just another game," Jakupovic told reporters on Friday. "I have a feeling we have to take the pressure from our heads out."
Swansea have won five of their last eight league games to climb to 16th.
"We knew before the start of the season, we would be down there," the 32-year-old Jakupovic added.
"We have to fight. I make the pressure for me, because I know that if we keep a clean sheet tomorrow we're going to win."
Hull have not lost a league a game at their KCOM Stadium this year.
"We still have six games at home, and three over the next four weeks. We feel good when we play at home," Jakupovic said.
"We respect our opponent, but it is a really important game for us against Swansea and one that we need the points from."
Hull defender Curtis Davis, who has not played since January, has recovered from a hamstring injury and will be available to face Swansea.

LONDON Embattled Team Sky principal Dave Brailsford denied he was close to quitting on Friday despite this week admitting mistakes had been made over the "jiffy bag" saga.
The former British Cycling performance director, who has plotted four Tour de France triumphs for Team Sky, has come under fire for failing to prove what was in a medical package ordered by a team doctor at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine.
"Of course I'm not hiding. I'm fine in myself and I've got confidence in my team," Brailsford said in an interview with magazine Cycling World at the Tirreno-Adriatico race.
"No (I'm not quitting). My thoughts are about what's good for the team and what's right. We're just here to win as many races as possible and do it the right way and that's my primary concern and that's what I think about."
Team Sky and British Cycling have both been subject of an investigation by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) into allegations of wrongdoing in the sport. Both have denied any doping violations.
British lawmakers have also carried out an inquiry into a newspaper allegation suggesting the package ordered by Dr. Richard Freeman and administered to Bradley Wiggins was the powerful corticosteroid triamcinolone - the same product Wiggins took using a WADA-approved therapeutic use exemption (TUE) before winning the 2012 Tour.
Brailsford told lawmakers that the package contained the legal decongestant Fluimucil - although a lack of a paper trail has called in to questions Sky's medical record keeping.
The 53-year-old said he was "disappointed" that the start of the season had been overshadowed by the furor and said it should not reflect badly on his riders.
"This has nothing to do with them," Brailsford said. "On the other hand we've got to move forward. Personally, I'm fine."
Several Sky riders offered support for Brailsford on social media this week, although triple Tour winner Chris Froome was not one of them, leading to speculation that the relationship between the pair was under strain.
"We had a good conversation, that's it," Brailsford said.
Brailsford said he welcomed UKAD's investigation but insisted there had been no wrongdoing.
"On a personal level, I've been through a lot over the years and it's important to make sure that you can look at yourself and say that there has been no wrongdoing," he said.
"I'm confident of that."
Brailsford's highly successful time with British Cycling has also been scrutinized in a UK Sport investigation into the culture within the governing body's elite program following the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton.
On Friday, British Cycling responded to a leaked draft of a report into the investigation published by the Daily Mail in which Brailsford was described as "untouchable".
"(The) World Class Programme leadership focused on medal delivery without sufficient care and attention to the overall staff and athlete culture and environment," it said.

Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said he will not have a back-up plan in case thing go wrong in Sunday's Premier League clash against Burnley at Anfield despite his side struggling against teams near the foot of the table.
Liverpool are unbeaten against the current top six, but their five league losses have come against teams in the bottom half, including defeats to relegation-threatened sides Hull City, Swansea City and Leicester City.
"I know what people say and is not the first time people have said something like this, but I don't have a Plan B in my mind," Klopp told reporters on Friday.
"We've spoken about the things we have to do, but not in the case of a team against the lower part of the table. We know how to play but in the end you have to make the right decisions.
"My job is to help them make the right decisions more easily. That is what training is for. It is a challenge."
Klopp paid tribute to James Milner, who has played as a left back this season, as the versatile midfielder prepares to make his 600th league appearances on Sunday.
Captain Jordan Henderson and forward Daniel Sturridge will miss the clash at Anfield through injury while striker Roberto Firmino is a doubt with a thigh problem after last weekend's win over Arsenal.

LONDON Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane says a new diet is behind his run of 14 goals in 12 games since the turn of the year.
Kane is on course to win the Premier League Golden Boot award for the second successive season and needs only seven more goals to surpass the 25 he netted in the league last season.
He bagged two against Everton last weekend and already has three hat-tricks - two in the league and one in the FA Cup - since his brace on Jan. 1 against Watford.
"My diet has changed since January," Kane told Tottenham's website (www.tottenhamhotspur.com).
"I've got a new chef who I've been working with to help with my nutrition, to get me a bit leaner and quicker and that seems to be working."
The razor-sharp 23-year-old will be hoping to add to his haul on Sunday when Tottenham host third-tier Millwall in the FA Cup sixth round at White Hart Lane.
Kane once impressed on loan at the south London club as a teenager and has since become one of the most lethal strikers in Europe. After claiming the Premier League Player of the Month award on Friday he paid tribute to his team mates.
"They are creating so many chances, with the likes of Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli, so I give all my thanks to my team mates," the England international said.
Tottenham's tie against Millwall will be their last in the FA Cup at White Hart Lane as it will be demolished next season to make way for a new 61,000-seater stadium.

ZURICH World soccer's ruling body FIFA, stung by criticism that it overlooks human rights in countries staging its tournaments, has set up an advisory panel to address the issue.
South Africa and Brazil, which hosted the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, were criticized over alleged human rights violations while there are also concerns about Russia and Qatar which are  staging the next two global showpiece tournaments.
In particular, the plight of migrants in 2022 hosts Qatar has alarmed human rights and labor organizations.
FIFA said the new panel will meet for the first time on Monday, "providing FIFA with advice on all issues that the board members may consider relevant for the implementation of FIFA’s human rights responsibilities".
Issues on which the panel could provide advice include labor standards, health and safety, property rights, security, discrimination and freedom of expression.
"It is the first advisory board of its kind for any sports federation, and we look forward to the pioneering work we will jointly undertake,” FIFA secretary general Fatma Samoura said in a statement.
The panel will include representatives from FIFA sponsors Adidas and Coca-Cola, corruption watchdog Transparency International, the United Nations (UN) and the world players' organization FIFPro.
"Football has a huge global following, cutting across all social boundaries," said panel member Lene Wendland, UN advisor on business and human rights.
"There is therefore huge potential for FIFA to play a dynamic role in standing up for human rights."
Amnesty International reported an increase in police harassment of informal traders, homeless South Africans, and refugees and migrants living in shelters or inner-city areas before the 2010 tournament.
Meanwhile, human rights groups condemned the detention of protesters, including lawyers and professors, in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the 2014 tournament, and evictions of slum residents related to building work in the run-up.
Russia, the host of next year's World Cup, has been frequently criticized for its record on racism in soccer and its treatment of gay people.
Qatar has faced criticism of its treatment of foreign workers from Amnesty International, the Building and Wood Workers' International organization and others.
The Qatari government introduced a new law in December which it said would replace the controversial "kafala" or sponsorship system that forces foreign workers to seek their employer's consent to change jobs or leave the country.

BERLIN Germany will kick off 2018 with friendly internationals against Spain and Brazil as the reigning world champions prepare for their title defense at the World Cup in Russia a few months later, the German Football Association (DFB) said.
The Germans will host Spain on March 23 in Duesseldorf and then take on Brazil four days later in Berlin.
The DFB said it was a request from the team's coaching staff to secure top opponents for their few opportunities for friendly matches ahead of the World Cup.
"The matches against Spain and Brazil will certainly offer a taste of what is to come at the World Cup in Russia where the team under Joachim Loew will give everything it has to defend the title," DFB President Reinhard Grindel said.
Germany have not yet booked their ticket for the World Cup but are top of their qualifying Group C with four wins out of four matches, five points ahead of second-placed Northern Ireland.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has been named the Premier League manager of the month for February, while in-form Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane picked up his fourth player of the month award.
City, who are third in the table, were unbeaten last month, winning all three of their Premier League games, scoring eight goals and conceding once, against West Ham United, Swansea City and Bournemouth.
Guardiola, who picked up the award for the first time, beat Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte and West Bromwich Albion boss Tony Pulis.
Meanwhile, the 23-year-old Kane received his award after propelling Tottenham to second in the table by netting four goals in three league matches, including a hat-trick in last month's win over Stoke City.
"It's a great honor," Kane told the Premier League's website. "I'm in good form at the minute, I feel confident going into every match."
The England forward won the award by edging out Manchester City duo Gabriel Jesus and David Silva, West Brom defender Gareth McAuley, Hull City goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic and Everton striker Romelu Lukaku.

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe says defender Tyrone Mings is a "gentle giant" despite his five-game ban for violent conduct in last weekend's Premier League draw at Manchester United.
Mings landed on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's head with his studs just before half time and the United striker caught the left back in the face with his elbow soon afterwards. Neither incident were seen by match officials but caught on video.
Ibrahimovic received a three-match ban and Mings was banned for five.
"Although he (Mings) is a beast in stature he is certainly a gentle giant on and off the pitch," Howe told reporters on Friday.
"We are disappointed for Tyrone, we feel it was accidental. I don't think he has that kind of streak in him. It's a real shame for him.
"I see a defender who has made a very good tackle trying to get back to his goal as quickly as possible. His focus is on the ball, not on what lies beneath him."
Mings, who will be unavailable for selection until the trip to Tottenham Hotspur on April 15, said his actions were not intentional.
"I am extremely disappointed at the FA's decision to ban me for five matches, following what was an accidental collision with Zlatan Ibrahimovic," Mings said in a statement.
"Conduct like that is not part of my game. My only focus was to get back in and defend."
Bournemouth, in 14th, host 11th-placed West Ham United on Saturday.

KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia's 2019 Asian Cup qualifier against North Korea due to be played in Pyongyang later this month has been postponed, the Asian Football Confederation announced on Friday.
The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) had made a request not to play the March 28 fixture in the North Korean capital under pressure from its government following the recent breakdown in relations between the two countries.
The countries have become embroiled in a growing row after Malaysia accused North Korea of assassinating Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of Pyongyang ruler Kim Jong Un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13.
"The Asian Football Confederation Competitions Committee have today decided to postpone the AFC Asian Cup UAE 2019 Final Round Qualifier between DPR Korea and Malaysia," the regional governing body said in a statement.
"The match was scheduled to be played in the DPR Korea capital Pyongyang on March 28... but the AFC Competitions Committee have taken the decision to postpone the tie after escalating diplomatic tension between the Governments of DPR Korea and Malaysia.
"A new date for the game will be announced in due course."
The two nations were due to open the final phase of qualifying for the Asian Cup finals hosted by the United Arab Emirates with a Group B encounter at Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Stadium.
FAM reacted by releasing a statement saying the AFC had acted appropriately given tensions had yet to subside.
"FAM welcomes the decision made by the AFC because it is seen as the most appropriate measures for the safety of the players and team officials," the association said.
Hong Kong and Lebanon will also play in North Korea during qualifying for the 2019 Asian Cup, the continent's equivalent of the European Championships.
Hong Kong FA chief executive Mark Sutcliffe on Thursday also called for the match to postponed, adding that the tie could be played in Pyongyang at a later date when relations between the countries had improved.
Despite the postponement of the North Korea tie, Malaysia still plan to travel to the Philippines for an international friendly against their Southeast Asian neighbors at the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila on March 22.

BERLIN The International Olympic Committee froze financial support to Kenya on Thursday after the country's troubled Olympic Committee refused to make changes to its constitution - a decision that could lead to a ban.
The IOC said it would discuss the matter at its executive board meeting in Pyeongchang next week to decide on any further action.
The IOC wants a series of new regulations addressing issues of good governance within the country' Olympic committee (NOCK) which has been dealing with problems regarding doping, mismanagement and political pressure for some time.
But the NOCK has yet to approve them.
"The IOC is extremely disappointed by the outcome of the National Olympic Committee extraordinary General Assembly which did not address governance issues in the appropriate way," the IOC said in a statement.
"This goes against the tripartite agreement (IOC-NOC-Government authorities) reached in September 2016 in Lausanne and the roadmap and discussions with the NOC over the last few months."
National Olympic committees divide up about $1.0 billion in IOC revenues every four years, their share from the marketing revenues of the Olympics while the IOC also supports thousands of athletes, coaches and staff through its Olympic solidarity fund.
Kenya last month accepted a local high court decision overruling last year's government order to disband the Olympic committee (NOCK), after accusations it had poorly handled arrangements for the 2016 Rio Games.
Sports Minister Hassan Wario had ordered that NOCK be disbanded last August, saying the body had not arranged adequate accommodation and travel for the Olympic team in Rio, and had also mishandled other issues.
Despite problems in the build up to Rio, the East African nation enjoyed its most successful Olympics, winning six gold medals, six silvers and one bronze, all in track and field.
"The IOC is now putting on hold all payments of subsidies to the NOC of Kenya until a decision of the IOC Executive Board is taken at its meeting next week," the IOC said.
A possible ban would mean Kenya would not be allowed to send a team to the Olympic Games with its athletes forced to compete under as independent athletes under the Olympic flag.
The country would also not take part in any IOC-sanctioned event or meeting and would also not benefit from IOC funding of any form, including athletes' support and training.
NOCK secretary general Francis Kinyili Paul said the body's officials were ready to quit “if this is in the interest of Kenyan sports”.
“Fighting all the time doesn’t make sense. We are ready to quit if this will be the solution of problems of Kenyan sports in general and Olympics in particular,” Paul told Reuters on Thursday.
Andrew Mudibo, President of Kenya Table Tennis Association, which is among the affiliates opposed to NOCK, welcomed the move by IOC.
“On behalf of NOCK affiliates we welcome the move that IOC has taken and we would like to see the executives resign from their positions,” he said.
The IOC suspended Kuwait in October 2015, accusing the government of interference in its national Olympic committee and its athletes competed as independents in Rio.

BARCELONA Sebastian Vettel lapped fastest for Ferrari on the penultimate day of Formula One's pre-season testing on Thursday but refused to accept the mantle of favorite from Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton.
The four-times champion wrapped up his preparations for the opening Australian Grand Prix on March 26 with the fastest lap yet around Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya -- a one minute 19.024 effort.
The German also completed a mammoth stint of 156 laps, equivalent to two and a half race distances in the space of a day.
Triple champion Hamilton was second quickest in 1:19.352, 0.328 slower, with both men lapping on the fastest ultrasoft tyres.
The Briton, who did 52 laps but shared duties with Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas, had said on Tuesday that "Ferrari must be the favorite" and he saw nothing to change his mind two days later.
"I think Ferrari are bluffing and that they are a lot quicker than they are showing," said the Mercedes driver, who won 10 races last year but still lost out in the title battle to now-retired team mate Nico Rosberg.
"They're very close to us. It's difficult right now to say exactly who is quicker. But they are very close, if not faster."
Bottas said Mercedes were not relaxing and "not in a comfortable situation at all.
"Ferrari are looking very strong, Red Bull can always surprise, and other teams can be strong. But Ferrari look solid, strong and fast -- and who knows what people will bring to Melbourne," added the Finn.
Ferrari, the sport's glamor team who are still hurting after a 2016 season without a win that left them third overall, have gone about testing with minimum fanfare and little in the way of media activity.
With plenty of pressure on them, they have also tried to play down expectations -- which Vettel continued to do on Thursday.
"I think if you look at the amount of laps Mercedes has done, if you look historically how slow they were going in the test, how much they were able to ramp it up for the races...I think they're the ones to beat," he said.
McLaren, struggling to get their Honda engine up to speed, had another difficult day with Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne seventh fastest but doing only 48 laps and twice bringing out the red flags in the morning session.

QUINCIE EN BEAUJOLAIS, France The scrutiny Team Sky are facing may be the result of the British outfit's perceived arrogance, sports director Nicolas Portal said as the squad weather a "hurricane" in the shape of an anti-doping investigation.
Sky have been under fire since Britain's Department of Culture Media and Sport select committee and UK Anti-Doping started to investigate the delivery of a package to Bradley Wiggins at the Dauphine in 2011.
UK Anti-Doping chief Nicole Sapstead has said that no proof has been brought that the package, handed to team doctor Richard Freeman, contained a legal decongestant, as no records were kept.
"It's a hurricane (in Britain)," Frenchman Portal, who led Chris Froome to his three Tour de France titles, told Reuters on Thursday before the start of the fifth stage of Paris-Nice.
"It's annoying because some of the things being said are untrue. We're under the impression that what is being said has nothing to do with reality."
Team principal Dave Brailsford on Tuesday defended the team's medical procedures, saying there had been "process failures" rather than "wrongdoing".
Portal, who rode for Sky one season before becoming a sports director in 2011, admitted he felt bitter, arguing that Sky had been leading by example since they started cycling in 2010.
"We helped the sport develop in terms of antidoping, we're always cautious," he said.
"I feel like the more we do, the more we try to lead by example, the more we are being criticized. Maybe we should not do it because we're being even more criticized."
In 2010, Sky raised a few eyebrows in the world of cycling when they said they wanted to produce a British Tour de France champion within five years.
They achieved their goal after three years when Wiggins prevailed in 2012.
"Maybe it was seen as arrogant and now we're paying for this," said Portal.
"There has always been suspicion around this team - motors in the bikes, riders sleeping in hypoxic chambers, organized doping.
"We're used to it but it's sure that in the long run, it's a heavy burden."
While Michal Kwiatkowski won the Strade Bianche classic last weekend and Geraint Thomas claimed the second stage of Tirreno Adriatico on Thursday, Sky have massively underperformed in the weeklong Italian race on Wednesday, finishing 18th in the opening time trial.
Asked why Sky were not a member of the Movement for Credible Cycling (MPCC), which sets tougher anti-doping rules than the World Anti-Doping Agency, Portal said: "I am convinced that we should have one set of anti-doping rules.
"Look at the MPCC - when teams are convicted of breaking the ban on corticoids, they don't pull their riders like they are supposed to. This movement is nothing."

LONDON The United States would have to grant entry to players, officials and fans from any country that qualified if it won the right to host the 2026 World Cup finals, soccer body FIFA said on Thursday.
Responding to a question about President Donald Trump's order banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the United States, FIFA boss Gianni Infantino said any nation bidding for the tournament would have clear rules.
"We are now in the process of defining the bid requirements," he said.
"In the world there are certainly many countries with travel bans, visa requirements and so on and so forth.
"What is obvious is that when it comes to the World Cup, like the Olympic Games ... any team, including the supporters and officials of that team who have qualified, need to have access to the country. Otherwise there is no World Cup."
CONCACAF, the governing body for soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean, is mulling a three-way joint bid for the 2026 World Cup between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
FIFA has ruled out a bid from Europe or Asia, leaving the CONCACAF region as frontrunner for a tournament set to expand to 48 nations from 32.
The United States last hosted the World Cup in 1994 and Mexico in 1986.
Los Angeles is also bidding against Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics with a vote on that due in September.
Victor Montagliani, the CONCACAF president, said last month that a wall planned by Trump along the U.S.-Mexico border would not present an obstacle to co-hosting the event.
Regional soccer officials have, however, been tight-lipped about the executive order.
The head of European soccer body UEFA warned last month that restrictions could damage any U.S. bid.
"It will be part of the evaluation, and I am sure it will not help the United States to get the World Cup," UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin told the New York Times.
"If players cannot come because of political decisions, or populist decisions, then the World Cup cannot be played there."
Iran, one of the six countries named, have played in three World Cups including the 2014 finals in Brazil while Syria beat China last October in a qualifier.
"The requirements will be clear. Then each country can make up their decision whether they want to bid or not," said Infantino. "It's nothing to do with the U.S. or not the U.S., it's a general sporting criteria."

French motorcycle rider Anthony Delhalle, a five-times endurance world champion, died after a crash in private testing at the Nogaro circuit in south-west France on Thursday, Le Mans organizers said.
The 35-year-old Suzuki rider had been preparing for the Le Mans 24 Hours motorcycle race in April.
"He is a part of the history of the Le Mans 24 Hours Moto and will be sadly missed by his endurance racing family," said Automobile Club de l'Ouest president Pierre Fillon in a statement.

LONDON Davis Cup matches are set to be played as best of three sets instead of five in future as part of reforms endorsed by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) on Thursday.
The ITF said a meeting of its board of directors in Indian Wells had unanimously backed reforms for both the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
"Further discussions on the implementation of best-of-three-sets matches across either two or three days are continuing with all stakeholders," it added.
The recommendations will be put to the ITF's annual meeting in Vietnam in August, with all changes requiring a formal vote of approval.
Leading players have called for changes to streamline the format of a team tournament run throughout the year.
"I think they should cut it down to two days, best-of-three (sets). Have two singles and one doubles, those kind of things," world number two Novak Djokovic said in November.
Top players have often skipped Davis Cup ties, especially when they are scheduled soon after the conclusion of a two-week grand slam tournament, as they feel it can be too taxing to fit it into their ATP Tour schedules.

PARIS This was supposed to be the year Paris St Germain joined the European elite with a statement victory in the Champions League, yet the French champions fluffed their lines in spectacular fashion and were trampled in the dust by a Catalan juggernaut.
After swatting aside Barcelona 4-0 in an exhilarating first leg display, an incredible meltdown in the latter stages of Wednesday's return leg ended with the home side marching triumphantly into the quarter-finals with a 6-5 aggregate win.
Qatar-backed PSG have invested heavily in a squad designed to compete at the highest level, yet once again they were found wanting against the very best and were eliminated by Barcelona in the knockout stages for the third time in five years.
The French side paid for their passive approach as Barcelona raced to a 3-0 lead before striker Edinson Cavani netted what appeared to be a decisive away goal mid-way through the second half to leave the home side needing to score three more.
The visitors held on until the 88th minute but Barcelona simply refused to be denied and when Sergi Roberto prodded home the side's third goal in a devastating seven-minute spell, Paris St Germain were left licking their wounds once more.
"I want to apologize to the fans," said midfielder Marco Verratti, who had been instrumental in the first leg but was a pale shadow of his brilliant self in the Nou Camp.
"We are ashamed."
Sports daily L'Equipe needed just one word to sum up the capitulation with the headline "Unspeakable".
The statistics do not make pretty reading for PSG, who completed just four passes, three of them kickoffs, from the 85th minute as midfielder Adrien Rabiot struggled to come to terms with the shocking denouement.
"Between 3-1 and 6-1, I do not know what happened," he said. "We were not supposed to sit back like this, it was not the plan."
PSG were furious that a theatrical Luis Suarez tumble was rewarded with a stoppage-time penalty that Neymar converted to put Barca within one goal of victory, but first-season coach Unai Emery said the game was lost elsewhere.
"The referee's decisions were against us but this is not why we are eliminated," the three-times Europa League-winning coach with Sevilla admitted.
Fullback Thomas Meunier bemoaned the sides lack of professionalism, while the club's hierarchy said PSG needed to reluctantly accept the result
"It is a nightmare. I don't believe this happened but we are not going to look for excuses," club president Nasser al Khelaifi lamented.
PSG now face a tricky end to the season to salvage some pride and appease their supporters.
In recent years they were almost guaranteed a Ligue 1 title to soothe the disappointment of regular early Champions League exits but this time they trail an impressive Monaco side by three points.
"I hope this setback will not weigh on us mentally," winger Hatem Ben Arfa said.

LONDON Barcelona's astonishing comeback win over Paris St Germain in the Champions League is a reminder of soccer's enduring ability to surprise and rule changes should be handled with care, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on Thursday.
After losing 4-0 in the first leg in France, Barcelona scored three times in the last seven minutes to win a thrilling last 16 home game 6-1 on Wednesday and march into the quarter-finals.
The feat was hailed as the greatest comeback in Champions League history.
"What you saw was an incredible match," Infantino told reporters after a FIFA executive soccer summit near London's Heathrow airport. "This shows that football is really a fantastic game."
Barcelona were helped, to the fury of PSG fans, by a theatrical Luis Suarez tumble that was rewarded with a stoppage-time penalty for Barcelona's fifth goal.
Video replays indicated the Uruguayan had made minimal contact with the defender.
"Whether that particular case was an injustice or not, we can leave it to the judgment of the referee at this stage," said Infantino.
The game's law-making body IFAB agreed to live trials of video assistant referees (VAR) last year, allowing match referees to consult a video official in four "game-changing" scenarios: when a goal has been scored, penalty decisions, sendings-off and mistaken identity.
Infantino, who has backed VAR, said Wednesday's game highlighted the need for care - something he had discussed at dinner with senior English and Scottish officials.
"We were saying we have really to be careful in the IFAB if we want to touch the rules, because football is such an incredible game," he said.
"Whenever you have the feeling you have seen everything, something else comes that you have never seen before.
"VAR will be there in future, hopefully, to correct, clear mistakes of the referee. In this case I don't know whether it was a clear mistake or not. But in future when there are clear mistakes this will be corrected."

Swansea City manager Paul Clement said securing the club's Premier League status for next season remains his top priority and reminded his in-form side that things can go awry quickly for teams involved in the relegation battle.
Swansea have won five of their last eight league games, a run of form which has propelled the Welsh club from the depths of the table up to 16th, five points ahead of the bottom three with 11 games remaining.
"Our target is to finish 17th or above, nothing more than that," Clement told reporters on Thursday when asked if Swansea can manage a top-half finish.
"At any time the gaps (between teams) can change, both for us and against us. It is still very close and those gaps can change at any time, both for you and against you."
Fernando Llorente, who is the club's top scorer with 11 goals this season, has excelled under Clement's stewardship and the manager said he ranks the Spain striker among the best headers of the ball in world football.
"When you get crosses in, he is very, very good," the former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich assistant added.
"Of the other players I have worked with, (Cristiano) Ronaldo is fantastic in the air, (Gareth) Bale is good, then you have John Terry and (Sergio) Ramos who do well when they go forward. But Llorente is a wonderful header of the ball."
Swansea will be without full-back Kyle Naughton, who is nursing a minor hamstring injury, for Saturday's trip to face relegation rivals Hull City, while midfielder Ki Sung-Yueng and winger Jefferson Montero will have late fitness tests.

POMARANCE, Italy Britain's Geraint Thomas won the second stage of the week-long Tirreno-Adriatico race in convincing fashion on Thursday, a welcome boost in the Team Sky rider's preparations for the Giro d'Italia.
Thomas, who has made the Giro his main goal this season and will not ride the Flanders classics, attacked with about four kilometers left and never looked back.
Dutchman Tom Dumoulin (Sunweb) took second place ahead of world champion Peter Sagan (Bora Hansgrohe) of Slovakia, with Olympic champion Greg van Avermaet (BMC) of Belgium taking the overall leader's blue jersey.
Thomas, however, remains far adrift of the overall leaders after Sky endured a catastrophic opening team time trial, finishing one minute 41 seconds behind stage winners BMC on Wednesday.

RIO DE JANEIRO Nine Australian Olympic athletes had their passports returned on Sunday, a team official said, after an accreditation problem at the Rio Games earlier saw them risk missing their flight home.
The nine athletes were briefly detained by police, collectively fined 90,000 reais ($28,000) and had their passports seized after entering the basketball arena without proper accreditation on Friday night.
"We resolved the issue," spokesman Mike Tancred told Reuters Sunday afternoon. "We paid the 90,000 reais and we've been to the courthouse today and [have] spoken to the judge."
The money was deposited in a court account, Tancred said.
"Once they saw the receipt they were happy to resolve the matter with us," he added.
All nine athletes plan to attend tonight's closing ceremony and will be on the Australian team's charter flight that leaves Monday.
The ordeal is the final frustration in Australia's troubled Games, starting with complaints over the standard of their accommodation, theft and a small basement fire. One of their swimmers was mugged a few days before the nine athletes were detained. The team also returns home with a disappointing medal count.
Australian Olympic mission chief Kitty Chiller had previously said she feared it would not be possible to get the passports back in time for the charter flight, due to a public holiday in Rio Monday.
"I'm embarrassed that they had to go through that," she said. "Security was a massive challenge, transport had its problems ... At every level this has been an enormously difficult Games to deliver."
The Australian Olympic Committee is investigating the accreditation problem but Chiller has said the athletes were not to blame.

Karolina Pliskova won her biggest title and denied Angelique Kerber the world number one ranking with an emphatic 6-3 6-1 victory in Sunday's final of the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati.
The 15th-seeded Czech registered her sixth career title and second this year, following a win at Nottingham, with her total demolition of the second-seeded Kerber.
Pliskova, who leads the WTA Tour in aces, hammered home seven aces, the last one securing her stunning victory over the 28-year-old German, who had so much on the line.
"Of course I'm disappointed, but still she played a great match and a great tournament and deserved the win," Kerber told ESPN.
Kerber, who committed 32 unforced errors, most coming from her forehand, was on the podium last Sunday accepting the silver medal after falling to Puerto Rico's Monica Puig in the women's final at the Rio Olympics.
"I'm really tired," she said. "I played the 11th match in 13 or 14 days. I really enjoyed the week. I really tried my best today, but sometimes you have days when it's not working so good.
"I will try to maybe get another chance, go in fresh to the U.S. Open, she said about the year's last grand slam tournament, where she will again have a chance to dethrone Williams.
Kerber seemed out of sorts from the start, while Pliskova looked comfortable and quickly found the range with her big forehand.
The German was broken in the first game at love and lost her next serve in falling behind 4-0. Kerber rallied to draw within 3-4 after a service break in the sixth game but Pliskova won the next two games to end the set.
Pliskova, 24, broke Kerber again in the second game of the second set and dominated the rest of the way.
It was the first premier tournament victory for the tall, slender Czech, who trotted over to hug her coach after the match.
"Angie played an amazing week and I think the whole year she's doing a great job," Pliskova said at the trophy presentation after registering 24 winners against 16 errors and saving four of five break points she faced.
"I know she was playing for the world number one. I think you deserve to be No. 1," she added. "But maybe next time."
The result allowed Serena Williams to push her reign on top of the rankings to 184 consecutive weeks, two weeks away from tying the all-time mark held by Steffi Graf.

RIO DE JANEIRO Uzbekistan's Fazliddin Gaibnazarov won the Olympic light-welterweight gold by beating Azerbaijan's Cuban-born Lorenzo Sotomayor Collazo on a 2-1 split decision on Sunday.
The gold was Uzbekistan's second of the afternoon and third of the boxing tournament.
Russia's Vitaly Dunaytsev and Germany's Artem Harutyunyan won the bronze medals.
Sotomayor, whose father is a cousin of Cuba's 1992 Olympic high jump champion Javier Sotomayor, had beaten Gaibnazarov before and shed tears of disappointment at the upset.
"In the second round he surprised me with a hit but in the third one I think I was able to get ahead," added the man who beat Cuba's Yasnier Toledo in the quarter-finals.
Taller and with a greater reach than his opponent, Sotomayor had hoped to give Azerbaijan, his home since moving from Havana in 2013, the country's first boxing gold but it was not to be.
"The judges saw it differently and it's their decision and it's the kind of decisions that happen in boxing," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO The "Great Haul of China" in 2008 was seen as something of an aberration, 2012's success was surely all through home advantage but, after their best medal return from an overseas Games, Britain is indisputably back as an Olympic superpower.
Twenty years ago, long before marketers invented "Team GB", Britain trudged home from Atlanta with a solitary gold medal courtesy of rowers Steve Redgrave and Matt Pinsent and just 15 in all, placing a humiliating 36th in the medal table.
They leave Rio with 67, including 27 gold, sitting proudly second, above China and behind only the all-powerful United States.
Remarkably that tally surpasses the 65 with 29 gold from the home Games of four years ago and is topped only by the London Games of 1908 when they won 146, 56 of them gold - totals inflated somewhat by many events where barely anyone else took part.
"It makes me bloody proud," Sebastian Coe, the former head of the London Games organizing committee said this week.
"What a legacy. We wanted to ensure not just participation but to inspire people.
"We are winning medals across sports you would not have even have dreamed of even 10 years ago."
When Britain started to begin punching its weight again in Sydney 2000, with 11 golds, the hosts joked that they could win only in sports where you have to sit down.
While it is true that cycling, rowing, sailing, equestrian and canoeing have continued to provide the bulk of the golds, the joke no longer holds water as Britain have won in Rio across 15 sports, more than any other nation. They also medaled in 18 of the 23 sports entered.
Track cycling was again the cash cow, as every member of the team came home with something in a haul of six golds, four silvers and a bronze.
Among those winners were Bradley Wiggins, who now has the most medals of any British Olympian with eight, including five gold, and Jason Kenny, who joined Chris Hoy on six as winner of most golds. Laura Trott's double in Rio made her the all-time leading woman with four.
Rowing brought home three more, athletics, through Mo Farah, sailing, canoeing and equestrian, two each.
There were single golds in taekwondo, hockey, golf, tennis, swimming, boxing and triathlon but perhaps the most eye-catching performances came in gymnastics, where Max Whitlock won two golds and the country seven medals in all having never previously stood atop the podium.
The reasons behind Britain's turnaround are varied but one constant and key driver has been the huge financial support offered by national lottery funding, which began in 1997.
That has enabled a wide variety of sports to invest hugely in facilities, coaching and all the other costly support network necessary to compete at elite level.
"Our high performance system is the envy of the world, thanks to sustained investment by our Government and The National Lottery," said Liz Nicholl, chief executive of UK Sport.
"The world-leading coaching, science, medicine and technology provided has enabled talent and potential to translate into world-beating performances."
Bill Sweeney, British Olympic Association CEO added:
"It has been a brilliant Games but this is not an overnight success ... this is 20 years in the making and we've now enjoyed five successive Games of medal growth.
"No-one has come close to that and it's an unbelievable achievement."

RIO DE JANEIRO Kyle Snyder of the United States won the last wrestling gold medal of the Rio Olympics on Sunday but Mongolia provided the most vivid drama when two of its coaches stripped off in protest at their man's defeat in an earlier bout.
Snyder fought a cagey, low-scoring contest in the 97 kg category against Azerbaijan's Khetag Goziumov, hanging in to defend his 2-1 lead as his opponent pressed hard in the closing seconds in a bid to lift and throw him.
"He was really strong underneath there. I was like, wow, this guy's really crazy strong in that position. But I wasn't going to let another point go up on that board unless it was me scoring," said the 20-year-old American, who had lost to the same opponent a month earlier.
Azerbaijan were also forced to settle for silver in the earlier 65 kg final, where Russia's Soslan Rakhmonov defeated Toghrul Asgarov.
It took the Russian male wrestlers' total to four golds, two ahead of Cuba, to confirm their pre-eminence in what wrestlers say is one of the oldest sports known to mankind.
With an arcane points system based on immobilizing the opponent on the mat or forcing him out of the ring, wrestling can be a challenge for the uninitiated spectator.
The sport was nearly ejected from the 2020 Games in Tokyo on the recommendation of the International Olympic Committee's executive board, but the IOC later granted it a reprieve.

INTENSE MOMENT
There was certainly plenty of excitement for the crowd on Sunday, but the most intense moment did not involve actual wrestling.
Two Mongolian coaches stripped off and hurled their shoes in protest after their man, Mandakhnaran Ganzorig, was denied victory for running away from his Uzbek opponent in the dying seconds of their 65 kg bronze medal contest.
Ganzorig, leading Ikhtiyor Navruzov by seven points to six, taunted him by dancing around in the last 18 seconds and was penalized for 'fleeing the hold' or evading contact, which caused him to lose 8-7.
Both coaches tore off their shirts and flung down their shoes in fury in front of the judges, with one stripping down to his trunks.
Snyder said he had witnessed the bizarre scene while warming up for his own match.
"That's pretty crazy... I wonder what that means in Mongolian," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO A delighted Denmark won their first gold medal in men's handball on Sunday, overcoming the defending French champions to win 28-26 in a thrilling Olympic final.
The score was tight throughout the game at Rio's Future Arena, where a mostly France-leaning crowd chanted for their "Bleus", but the Danes managed to pull ahead, in part thanks to brilliant saves by 2.01 meter-tall keeper Niklas Landin.
When the breakneck game was finally over, the Danish team poured onto the court hugging, high-fiving, and clasping their hands on their heads in disbelief.
"It was just perfect to finish it off like this,” said Denmark's Mads Christiansen, gold medal hanging around his neck after the game, adding it was especially sweet to beat the defending champions.
For the French, who won gold in London 2012 and Beijing 2008, defeat to the Danish underdogs was bitter. It came a day after the French women also lost the final, settling for silver against Russia.
Earlier on Sunday, Germany's men's team overcame Poland 31-25 to win bronze.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's men's volleyball team defeated Italy on Sunday to win their third gold medal in the sport and cap their country's best Olympic performance with a total of seven golds in the Rio Games.
The Brazilians had lost to the Italians in a pool match but won the final in straight sets 25-22 28-26 26-24, handing Italy its third silver medal in men's volleyball.
Brazil struggled in the pool stage, losing two matches, to the U.S. and Italy, and only making it into the knockout rounds after a tense victory over France in the last game.
But having emerged from the pool, Brazil began to show its class and fueled by raucous home support dropped just one set between the quarter-finals and clinching gold.
The Brazilian victory was largely due to a barrage of winning spikes, serves and blocks by its outstanding outside hitter Wallace de Souza, who scored 20 of Brazil's points.
"The Brazilian team played very well and definitively deserved to win. My team gave it all they had, but Brazil was superior and dominated," said Italian coach Gianlorenzo Blengini.
Brazilian fans that packed Rio's Maracanazinho stadium erupted with joy, chanting "The champ is back." Cheering was heard in neighborhood streets across Rio.
In the audience to witness the win was Brazilian soccer star Neymar, fresh from Saturday's gold-winning final against Germany.
Brazil last won volleyball men's gold in 2004 when it beat Italy in Athens, and took its first at Barcelona in 1992.
Earlier on Sunday, the United States men's volleyball team recovered to defeat defending Olympic champions Russia in a five-set battle for the bronze medal.
The U.S. lost the first two sets but came back to win 23-25 21-25 25-19 25-19 15-13, with an ace in the tie-breaker by top scorer Matt Anderson helping to seal the victory.
The Americans, a young team with eight players who had never competed in the Olympics, came to Rio seeking a fourth U.S. gold medal in the sport and were favorites after winning the World Cup last year.
They lost their first two matches against Canada and Italy, who beat them again in the semi-finals.
The U.S. women's volleyball team also went home with bronze after failing to win an elusive first gold for their country.

RIO DE JANEIRO Two Mongolian coaches stripped off and hurled their shoes in protest on Sunday after their wrestler Mandakhnaran Ganzorig was denied victory for running away from his Uzbek opponent in the dying seconds of their bronze medal contest.
Ganzorig, leading Ikhtiyor Navruzov by seven points to six, taunted his opponent by dancing around him in the last 18 seconds of their 65kg match and was then carried around the ring in triumph by one of his coaches.
But the judges then adjusted the score to 7-7, penalizing the Mongolian for 'fleeing the hold', or refusing to engage with his opponent. They then added a further point to the Uzbek's score after the Mongolian corner challenged the decision and had the challenge rejected.
Ganzorig crouched head down on the mat in disbelief at the reversal as both coaches advanced toward the judges, stripped off their shirts and shoes and hurled them to the floor.
With the crowd erupting, one of them then took off his track pants and remonstrated with the judges wearing nothing but a pair of trunks.
One of the coaches, Byambarenchin Bayaraa, told reporters later: "This was a protest. There was a problem with the refereeing... Three million people in Mongolia waited for this bronze medal and now we have no medal."
Navruzov, the victor, celebrated by wrestling his coach to the floor and then kneeling on the mat as if in prayer.
"He tried to run (away). This cannot happen. I have little respect for him and for his trainer," the Uzbek said.

RIO DE JANEIRO France's Tony Yoka beat Britain's Joe Joyce to win the men's Olympic super-heavyweight title on Sunday and match the lightweight gold medal won by girlfriend Estelle Mossely earlier in the week.
Now half of a golden couple, Yoka becomes the first Frenchman to win gold in the heaviest division.
Croatia's Filip Hrgovic and Kazakhstan's Ivan Dychko took the bronze medals as losing semi-finalists.
Britain's Anthony Joshua, the 2012 champion, turned professional after the London Games.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's men's volleyball team defeated Italy in straight sets on Sunday to win their third gold medal in the sport.
The Brazilians had lost to the Italians in a preliminary match but won the final 25-22 28-26 26-24, handing Italy its third silver medal. Brazil won gold in 2004 when it beat Italy in Athens.

RIO DE JANEIRO China's young women's volleyball team overcame a surging Serbian side on Saturday in four sets to take their country's third Olympic gold medal in the sport.
Serbia was competing for the first time for an Olympic medal and had beaten China in the preliminary round, but the Asian powerhouse prevailed in the final by 19-25 25-17 25-22 25-23.
The United States won bronze earlier on Saturday after beating the Netherlands, a consolation for the world's top-ranked team in their pursuit of an elusive gold.
China, coached by former top player Lang Ping, last won the gold medal in Athens in 2004. They won their first gold in Los Angeles in 1984 when Lang was on the team.
"Before the tournament we never thought we could win the gold," Lang, who coached the United States to a silver medal in 2008, told reporters after the match. "I think we were lucky.
"Our young players did not play well at the beginning, but they did at the important moment."
Serbia won the opening set with powerful serves and spikes by top scorer Brankica Mihajlovic, but China took control of the match in the key third set.
Serbia beat off an 8-point run by China and went down to an unstoppable spike by top Chinese scorer Zhu Ting.
Serbia eliminated Russia in the quarter-finals and then dispatched the favorites, the United States, from the Rio Games on Thursday in a five-set upset when the U.S. team lost their top scorer Foluke Akinradewo to a leg injury.
With their star middle blocker back on the court on Saturday, the Americans beat the Dutch women 25-23 25-27 25-22 25-19 in the bronze medal match.
Akinradewo said some therapy on her left leg put her back in competition for the bronze medal game, as she shed a tear over missing another opportunity to capture the gold.
"That's what we want, of course. No team comes here not wanting to win the gold," she told Reuters. "But this bronze is just as special for me because we were able to fight back from a disappointing loss. We were so close," she said.
The United States reached the finals in the two previous Olympics in London and Beijing, but were defeated by Brazil both times.
At the Beijing Olympics, the U.S. team coached by Lang beat China in the semi-final, cementing her reputation as one of the best women's volleyball coaches.
Lang, 55, won her second gold on Saturday, this time as the coach of young crop of Chinese athletes that had a shaky start in Rio with losses to the Netherlands and Serbia.
"With a young team, you never know. One day is great, the next is not," Lang said. "We have to be patient and just had to go one game at a time.
"I am very happy for the young girls. They trained so hard."

RIO DE JANEIRO Neymar shed tears of joy after delivering Brazil's first men's soccer gold medal with the winning penalty in a 5-4 shootout triumph over Germany after a thrilling final ended in a draw following extra-time on Saturday.
Brazil had lost the Olympic final three times - in 1984, 1988 and 2012 - but they finally got the gold they craved on a dramatic night at the Maracana stadium in which they outplayed the Germans but were saved three times by the woodwork.
Neymar had put the hosts ahead with a superb free kick after 27 minutes but Germany captain Maximilian Meyer equalized just before the hour to take the game into the extra period at 1-1.
There were no more goals so the match went to penalties with Nils Petersen missing Germany's fifth spot kick leaving Neymar, who appeared to injure himself late in the game, to limp up and coolly score from the spot to send the capacity crowd wild.
The victory gave Brazil a measure of revenge for their humiliating 7-1 defeat by eventual World Cup winners Germany in the semi-finals on home soil in 2014 - a game the frustrated Neymar had to watch from the sidelines due to injury.
"Yesterday we were criticized," the 24-year-old Barcelona forward said in reference to Brazil's poor start to the Olympic tournament in which the home side drew 0-0 with South Africa and Iraq. "We have replied with good football."
Brazil coach Rogerio Micale added: "We had players who were extremely dedicated, professional and with great technical skill. I'll leave here with the sensation of having done my duty."
The win means a unified Germany are now the only World Cup winners never to have won the Olympic gold medal and the loss robbed them of a chance to complete the male and female double after their women's team beat Sweden 2-1 on Friday.

PASSIONATE CROWD
With a passionate crowd behind them, Brazil took the game to their opponents and dominated possession and territory.
However, they struggled to make chances and it was the Germans who almost opened the scoring after 10 minutes when Julian Brandt smacked the bar with a lovely curling shot from outside the box.
Brazil kept pushing forward and just before the half-hour mark they got the goal that their play deserved.
Neymar was brought down almost 25 meters from goal and, although the angle was tight, he curled a spectacular strike into the net off the underside of Timo Horn's bar.
The goal shook Germany into action and they pushed forward more and hit the bar twice more before the half was out.
Brazil still looked the hungrier side but it was Germany who got the next goal with an hour gone. Jeremy Toljan sent in a low cross from the right and captain Maximilian Meyer swept home a lovely finish from about 10 meters.
Gabriel Jesus almost put Brazil ahead when he touched a Renato Augusto cross wide after 64 minutes and Felipe Anderson should have given the hosts the lead 13 minutes later but he was caught in possession with only the keeper to beat.
Anderson then almost scored 16 minutes into extra time but Horn got down superbly to block his shot as he raced in on goal.
With the sides still level after extra time, the stage was set for Neymar to step up and strike the winning spot kick to send the whole of Brazil into raptures as the country finally captured the Olympic title they had so desperately craved.

RIO DE JANEIRO Germany refused to be intimidated in the hostile cauldron of Rio's Maracana stadium but they faced an uphill task against 11 Brazilian players roared on by 80,000 vengeful and passionate fans.
In the run-up to Saturday's Olympic men's soccer final, both coaches had played down the idea that it was all about Brazil exacting revenge for a 7-1 home defeat to Germany in the World Cup two years ago.
But no one had told the fans, who booed the German players throughout the 120 minutes of play and the tense penalty shootout in which Nils Petersen's miss set up Neymar to score the winning spot kick for Brazil.
"It is very difficult," Petersen told Reuters TV at an after-match celebration for the German team. "When there are 80,000 people against you it's not nice.
"If we had won the penalty shootout in the end it would all have been fine, it would have been a nice feeling, we unfortunately had to bow down to the Brazilian audience.
"At first there is always some pain when you have the chance to win gold. Now we have to accept it and just take it.
"It hurts a bit but we are still proud about the medal."
Coach Horst Hrubesch said he had steeled his players for the reception they would receive by trying to harness the energy of the crowd.
"I said to my players before the game: this is your stadium, go out and you'll see 80,000 people to welcome you," he said.
"You can turn it around and make something positive out it, or you cave in and lose your nerve and then you can't play football."
And play they did.
Apart from the Max Meyer goal that canceled out Neymar's free kick, they hit the bar three times in the first half, and Julian Brandt posed a repeated threat in attack, including with an extra-time volley attempt.
Underlining their fighting spirit, Meyer staged a demonstrative celebration in the corner, right in front of a sea of yellow-shirted Brazil fans, after slotting in his goal from the edge of the box.
In the end it was not quite enough, but the Germans sportingly picked themselves up and walked around the stadium after the match to applaud the fans.
"We had our chances, we could have scored at least three times. I think we could have won but there's a lot of luck with penalties. You have to be a good loser too," defender Lukas Klostermann said.
Hrubesch said it was not a bitter moment.
"Actually we have to say that if someone had told us this beforehand, then we would have gone with it, and we would have gone along with everything and done it just like that," he said.
"But at the end of the day I must also say that if you look at today's game and the way we have played the entire tournament, I don't know what I can say about this team.
"It was amazing."

RIO DE JANEIRO Spaniard Ruth Beitia leaped into the Rio night to win Spain's first Olympic gold medal in women's athletics and claim her first global outdoor high jump crown at the age of 37 on Saturday.
The three-times European champion cleared 1.88m, 1.93m and 1.97m at her first attempts and became the oldest Olympic champion in the jumps on countback when all four remaining athletes failed to get over two meters.
"I'm happy," she said. "Never did I think I'd be competing again after the London Olympics. My dream has become a reality."
Mirela Demireva of Bulgaria took silver ahead of 32-year-old former world champion Blanka Vlasic of Croatia, who added bronze to the silver she won at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
American mother-of-three Chaunte Lowe was the one jumper of the quartet who cleared 1.97m to miss out on a medal.
Like 32-year-old Lowe, Beitia was appearing at her fourth Olympics having finished 16th in Athens, seventh in Beijing and fourth in London.
She always looked like continuing her upward trajectory in Rio after clearing 1.88m with a minimum of fuss.
Extending her arms out in front her body and twitching her fingers before starting her run, Beitia charged toward the bar with her pony tail bouncing behind her before also successfully clearing the next two heights.
Beitia became the oldest medalist in the women's high jump by six years and was also a year older than Heike Drechsler when the German won long jump gold at the Sydney Olympics.
"I'm aware that I'm 37 years old," she said. "I think I'm one of the oldest women to win an Olympic gold medal. Of course, I'm very proud to still be continuing up to now. Even at my age, I have the same enthusiasm and happiness."
Twice world champion Vlasic also made her Olympic debut in Athens in 2004 but missed the London Olympics because of the Achilles problem that has blighted the latter part of her career.
Vlasic returned to competition this year but was clearly still feeling the injury in her third Games.
"This medal is a badge of honor, it's a reward for being brave given the circumstances," she said.
"The doctor didn't tell me to stay out of the Olympics, but they told me it would hurt, and it did."
London 2012 champion Anna Chicherova was unable to take part in the Games because she was suspended after a retested sample from the 2008 Olympics tested positive.
World champion Mariya Kuchina was also unable to take part because of the almost blanket ban on Russian athletes.
It was the lowest winning height in an Olympic final since 1980 and two athletes jumped higher in the Rio heptathlon, but that did not bother the medalists.
"I am extremely happy," said Demireva, the youngest of the final four at 26.
"It is a dream come true. Since I got selected for the Olympic Games in Rio I knew they would be my Olympics. I put all my heart and emotion into this silver medal."

RIO DE JANEIRO LaShawn Merritt ran a blistering anchor leg to return the men's 4x400m title to the United States, and win his third Olympic gold medal, in the final athletics event of the Rio Games on Saturday.
Before Matthew Centrowitz's shock victory in the 1,500m earlier in the evening, the American men had been limited to one gold medal on the Rio track through Kerron Clement in the 400 meters hurdles.
The U.S. have never gone two Games without winning the men's one-lap relay, however, and after being upset by the Bahamas in London four years ago, were determined to secure the title for a 17th time.
Arman Hall, Tony McQuay and Gil Roberts combined over the first three laps to give Merritt a two meter lead and the former 400m Olympic and world champion extended that to seven to win in two minutes, 57.30 seconds.
"This was about Team USA, a great bunch of guys that I work with," said Merritt.
"The guys made it easy for me. We wanted this gold, I've been running a lot but I was going to give that anchor leg all I had. Every man did his job and we're bring that gold back to the U.S."
Javon Francis stormed down the final straight to give Jamaica the silver in 2:58.16, while the Bahamas ran 2:58.49 to pip Belgium, who ran a national record 2:58.52, for bronze.
"I have only good feelings," said Francis. "I said to myself 'Usain Bolt did it' so I need to work for a medal."
Merritt, who arrived in Rio with hopes of an individual  400-200 double, will return to home with a second career 4x400m relay gold and a bronze from the one-lap event.
"For me, this is what the Olympics are all about, representing your country," he added. "I went for it every time I went on the track."
Chris Brown anchored the Bahamas team to win a record fourth medal in the event after a gold in 2012, silver in 2008 and a bronze in the 2000 Sydney Games.
Kevin Borlee, who was running in the Belgium team with his brothers Jonathan and Dylan, said it was tough to miss out on a  medal by 0.03 seconds.
"It's hard now but in a couple of days I think there will be only good memories," he said.
"It's the Olympic Games, we had the chance to compete, we enjoyed it and hopefully we will be back."

RIO DE JANEIRO American Matthew Centrowitz pulled off a shock victory in the 1,500m final on Saturday, stunning pre-race favorite Asbel Kiprop of Kenya to secure his country's first gold medal in the event since 1908.
In the run-up to the Games few expected the 26-year-old to challenge for a medal as all the focus was on Kenya's former Olympic champion Kiprop, who had won the last three world titles.
But after a pedestrian race that was won in a time 24 seconds outside world record pace, Centrowitz held off defending champion Taoufik Makhloufi of Algeria to cross the line in 3:50:00.
"It's been a dream come true," Centrowitz told reporters. "Doing my victory lap, I literally kept screaming to everyone I know 'Are you kidding me?'"
Britain's double 1,500m Olympic champion Sebastian Coe, the current IAAF President, awarded the gold medal to Centrowitz.
"Seb Coe came up to me and said 'Welcome to the club', which I thought was very cool," Centrowitz said.
Centrowitz, who won a world championship bronze in 2011 and silver in 2013, ran the final lap in 50.62 seconds to take gold in a field stacked with African talent.
New Zealand's Nick Willis, who took silver at Beijing in 2008, overcame several injury-plagued seasons to snatch a bronze medal in his fourth Olympic games.
"After 2008, I had three different surgeries, it took me four years to get back into form," the 33-year-old Willis said, hinting that he may compete at the next Olympics in Tokyo.
"A lot of people write you off in your 30s. This is for all the 30-year olds."
Kiprop, who had run the fastest time of the year, faded in the final lap to finish sixth. His compatriot Ronald Kwemoi took a tumble early in the race and Kiprot said that affected his tactics.
"When I saw Kwemoi floored on the track, I kind of felt very lonely," Kiprop said.
But Willis, who has often raced Kiprop, was not surprised by the result.
"Having been around with Kiprop since 2007 ... what's most consistent about Kiprop is his inconsistency," Willis said.
"He is extremely talented and probably the best in the world, but can also lose concentration."

RIO DE JANEIRO Caster Semenya won the 800 meters final in a personal best time of 1:55.28 on Saturday, claiming her first Olympic gold medal and using her podium platform to call for unity in sport.
Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba finished in 1:56.49 to claim the silver, her country's second medal in any sport at the Olympics. Kenya's Margaret Wambui won bronze in 1:56.89.
Semenya has dominated the event this season, with three of the fastest four times, but has had to contend with renewed controversies about her gender.
After winning the 2009 world title as a 19-year-old, tests reportedly revealed that she is hyperandrogenous, resulting in her body producing an abnormally high amount of testosterone, which makes her more powerful than her rivals.
An International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) rule limiting the amount of naturally occurring functional testosterone for female athletes appeared to have restricted Semenya's prospects but the rule was quashed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport last year.
In Rio, France's Justine Fedronic, who failed to qualify for the 800 final, said she had sympathy for Semenya's situation but did not consider competing against her a fair fight.
"I just want to be a better athlete. The main focus here was just to run a championship," Semenya told reporters. "The coaches told me: just focus on running, nothing else."
"Sport is meant to unite people," she added. "I think that's what we need to keep doing."
The 25-year-old South African won the silver medal in London four years ago. Ahead of the 2016 Games, there was speculation she could break Czech Jarmila Kratochvilova's world record of 1:53.28 set in 1983. It is the longest-standing athletics world record.
"To be honest, we're really not focused on breaking the world record," she said. "We are focused more on being the best we can be."
Staying with the pack for the first lap, Semenya let Niyonsaba lead the race up to the 600-metre mark before pulling ahead with an injection of pace to take the gold.
"The race was really quick. The first 400 we were pushing ourselves, it was great," Semenya told reporters.
"It was just about being patient ... I have a very quick last 200, I just have to utilize it."

RIO DE JANEIRO The United States maintained their iron grip on the Olympic women's 4x400 meters relay on Saturday when they held off Jamaica for their sixth straight victory in the event to give anchor Allyson Felix her sixth career gold.
The U.S. finished in 3 minutes 19.06 seconds. Jamaica took silver in 3:20.34 and Britain the bronze in 3:25.88.
"It's really special," said four-time Olympian Felix who had started the Games somewhat frustrated after missing out on qualification for the 200m.
"I can look back on the things that I've accomplished and really be proud and really grateful for what track and field has brought to my life"
Her team mate Courtney Okolo set the stage for the win by grabbing the lead in the opening stage and the U.S. never relinquished it, pushed by Jamaica but well clear of the rest of the field by the halfway point.
Felix held off a late challenge by Jamaica's Novlene Wiliams-Mills to claim her third medal of the Rio Olympics having won gold in the 4x100m relay and silver in the individual 400m.
The U.S. gold streak in the event started at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
"It's amazing to come together with these women tonight and be able to finish it off," Felix said. "It was a good night."
Natasha Hastings and Phyllis Francis rounded out the U.S. team.
Jamaica's silver was their fifth straight medal in the event, following silver in 2000 and bronze in 2004, 2008 and 2012 while Britain claimed their first medal since 1992.


RIO DE JANEIRO Briton Mo Farah became only the second man to retain both Olympic track long distance titles on Saturday when he produced an utterly dominant performance to add the 5,000m gold to the 10,000 he collected a week ago.
Farah followed Finland's Lasse Viren, who won both titles in 1972 and 1976, and having also done the double twice at the world championships he has now earned his place among the all-time greats of his sport.
Farah dealt with everything the field could throw at him on Saturday, and even took up the pace midway through the race to stamp his authority on the field.
As ever, when it came to a last-lap showdown, nobody could live with his speed and he surged clear of Kenyan-born American Paul Chelimo and Ethiopian Hagos Gebrhiwet.
Things were never going to be easy for Farah as Ethiopian trio Dejen Gebremeskel, Muktar Edris and Gebrhiwet all passed up the 10,000m to concentrate on the shorter distance, and all three boasted faster personal bests than Farah.
After so many races where the rest of the field played into his hands by going steadily and opening the door for a last-lap burn-up, Farah was initially presented with a different challenge as Gebremeskel and Gebrhiwet set off at a hot pace from the start.
However, by the halfway point they seemed to have given up on that approach and Farah moved to the front to push the pace and as it reached the final lap he was, as always, unbeatable.
"I can't believe it. My legs were a bit tired after the 10k I don't now how I recovered," he told reporters.
"It shows I didn't just fluke it in London, to do it again is incredible. I just want to see my kids and hang this medal around their necks.
"I was surprised by the first lap, I thought it was going to be a slow race. They had a plan, they wanted to take the sting out of me but when I hit the front, I wasn't letting anyone past me."



RIO DE JANEIRO Just to prove it was no fluke four years ago on home soil, Mo Farah summoned his last reserves of energy to complete the Olympic distance double-double on Saturday and cement his place among the all-time greats of track and field athletics.
The Somali-born Briton burned away the opposition on the last lap of the Olympic 5,000m to follow up his 10,000m victory earlier in the week.
In repeating his heroics of 2012, when he established himself as a national treasure, Farah also became the first British track athlete to win four Olympic gold medals.
He matched Lasse Viren, the Flying Finn, who won both 5,000m and 10,000m in 1972 and 1976, and surpassed Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele who only managed three quarters of the double-double at Athens and Beijing in 2004 and 2008.
The 33-year-old was as humble as ever, however, after yet another textbook run by the athlete who also boasts consecutive 5,000m-10,000m doubles in the world championships.
"I can't believe it. My legs were a bit tired after the 10k -- I don't now how I recovered. People were bringing me food in my hotel room," he told reporters.
"It shows I didn't just fluke it in London, to do it again is incredible. I just want to see my kids and hang this medal around their necks."
Even before a beaming Farah had finished his lap of honor holding aloft a British flag, the great and good of the country's track and field fraternity were heaping on the praise.
"Mo Farah, for services to athletics deserves to be Sir Mo Farah. He is, for me, the greatest British athlete," BBC pundit Brendan Foster, who won 10,000m bronze in 1976, said.
"He controlled that race tonight. We will never see anyone like him again."
While Farah made it look easy on Saturday, he admitted to fatigue in the build-up after recovering from a fall in the 10,000m final and getting clipped in the heats of the 5,000.
It should have been a chance for his rivals to hunt him down but once again he proved that whatever strategy they put in place he had the answers, producing a devastating 52-second final lap.
"They had a plan, they wanted to take the sting out of me but when I hit the front, I wasn't letting anyone past me," said Farah, who behind the nice guy exterior is a ruthless track warrior. "I hate to lose. Even in school I hated losing.
"I have that drive, it is just me."

RIO DE JANEIRO Chen Aisen claimed Olympic gold in the men's 10 meter platform event on Saturday to help China take home seven out of Rio's eight diving golds, while Mexico's German Sanchez and American David Boudia took the silver and bronze.
Chen, at his first Olympics, showed consistency throughout his dives, gaining high scores to total 585.30 with his tight spins and clean entries into the water even as his rivals,  including team mate Qiu Bo, stumbled.
"I didn't think I would win two gold medals," said Chen, who with Lin Yue won the 10 meter synchronized event. "I just wanted to dive well in the individual event, to show off my ability... I managed to win because I was calm throughout."
His win meant that the only diving gold China failed to take in Rio was in the men's 3 meter springboard event where they took the bronze instead.
Boudia, who won gold in London, recovered from a poor semi-final performance, where he finished 10th, to acquire 525.25 points. His final lower-scoring dive pushed him down to third position at the last minute behind Sanchez who scored 532.70.
"This dive has been a thorn in my side," Boudia said of his sixth dive, a forward 4-1/2 somersaults tuck, which gave him his lowest score of 68.45.
"My take-off is absolutely perfect but I cannot find the bottom to save the life of me. But I chose to do it at the end of this competition because I wanted that pressure... It didn't go my way this time," he said.
For some at home in Mexico, Sanchez's second place was a surprise as he had gone into the final in ninth place and had finished the earlier synchronized event with partner Ivan Garcia in fifth. Garcia had qualified third from the semi-final but eventually finished 10th.
"Actually after the last event there was a lot of talk about me and of course there were a lot of comments," said Sanchez. "But of course we know that there's a saying that God will never let his children be humiliated.
"When I won (silver) I felt very peaceful and it's fantastic to go back home with my medal; it's a privilege, it's an honor."
London 2012 silver medalist Qiu, ended the competition in fifth place despite scoring a perfect 10 from all six judges on his third dive, after low scores of 47.25 and 47.50 on his second and fifth attempts knocked him out of the running for a podium spot.
Tom Daley of Britain, who had been expected to be a strong medal contender, was ousted in the semi-finals after he botched three of his six dives to come in last. He had topped the preliminaries on Friday.
"There are always a lot of frustrations and difficulties when you're pursuing a dream, it wouldn't be called a dream if it was that easy to fulfill," said Qiu, when asked how he felt about missing the Olympic gold medal for the second time.
"I had some issues with my state of mind when competing today but I don't want to find excuses because I didn't dive well. I can only accept today's result. I've worked hard, I have no regrets."
Boudia said such surprises were intrinsic to the sport.
"It's a long 24 hours... you're doing 18 dives off a three-storey building, your body's beat up, you're tired, mentally exhausted.
"On any given day anyone can win. You just saw what Qiu Bo did, you just saw what Tom Daley did, get 18th place in the semi-finals. This is a hard, hard sport, and that's what we love about it."

RIO DE JANEIRO Born in Moscow to a Bangladeshi father, rhythmic gymnast Margarita Mamun showed off her exquisite balancing and twirling skills as she captured what she called "a victory for two countries" in the individual all around event at the Olympics.
The 20-year-old Russian goes by the nickname of 'The Bengal Tiger' but rather than knocking over her rivals with brute force, she simply left them chasing shadows as she produced four dazzling routines with the hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon to win her first global all around title.
To do that she beat overwhelming favorite and three-time world champion Yana Kudryavtseva, who surrendered her title hopes when her twirling act with the clubs went horribly wrong in its dying seconds.
Throwing the club high into the air, she rolled over on the floor ready to catch it as she went to strike her final pose, only to have the apparatus land beyond her outstretched hand.
"It was quite unexpected for me to win the gold medal today because before today Yana beat me and win each time in the all around. Hence I wasn't really thinking about winning the gold medal today," said the 20-year-old Mamun, who earned Russia a fifth successive gold in the discipline.
That error knocked a distraught Kudryavtseva, who was leading at the halfway point of the competition, off the top and allowed Mamun to grab the top prize with a total of 76.483.
So had Mamun instantly been aware of Kudryavtseva's mistake?
"I wasn't aware of Yana's mistake because I was backstage changing costumes for my next ribbon routine," she said after relegating her Russian teammate to the silver.
"I only saw Yana's score when I and Yana had both finished performing with the ribbon (about 30 minutes later and her score flashed up).
"I was really surprised Yana made the mistake as she is usually so focused and never shows any nerves."
Mamun, who had represented Bangladesh as a junior, was also delighted that her victory was also being celebrated in her father, Abdullah Al Mamun's, homeland.
"I'm really happy knowing that I have a lot of fans in Bangladesh who have been supporting me," added Mamun in Russian.
"I can count one to 10 in Bengali. When I was younger my dad used to teach me Bengali but I have forgotten it all."
And why did she chose to represent Bangladesh as a junior considering she was born and raised in her mother's homeland?
"I had dual citizenship so that's why I decided to represent Bangladesh in one competition as a junior. I came back to represent Russia as I always lived and trained in Russia."
Bangladesh have never won an Olympic medal.

GREENSBORO, North Carolina The normally self-effacing Luke Donald carded a six-under 64 at the Wyndham Championship on Saturday, before offering a Ryder Cup sales pitch to European captain Darren Clarke.
Donald cannot make the European team automatically, even if he wins on Sunday, so instead will have to rely on earning one of Clarke's three captain's picks.
"I think I have the best record in European history as a player," Donald told reporters at Sedgefield Country Club.
"Obviously I'll bring a lot of experience."
Donald has played in four Ryder Cups, on the winning team each time, with a stellar individual record of 10 wins, four losses and one halved match.
But he knows his past history alone is not enough to justify a berth for the biennial event against the United States in six weeks.
He had missed two cuts before finding form this week, standing equal third heading into the final round here, five strokes behind leader Kim Si-woo.
"I need to win probably tomorrow and probably need to have a good chance to win (next week's) Barclays to have a chance (of earning a captain's pick)," said the former world number one, whose current ranking is 90.
"It's been a slow season for me," he admitted. "It hasn't been consistent but I've been working extremely hard and it's nice to see some form coming into play."

RIO DE JANEIRO A display full of grace and elegance allowed Margarita Mamun to capture the individual all-around gold on Saturday and stretch Russia's dominance in rhythmic gymnastics into a fifth straight Olympics.
A total score of 76.483 carried Mamun to the top of the podium after three-time world champion Yana Kudryavtseva surrendered her title hopes when her twirling act with the clubs went horribly wrong in its dying seconds.
Throwing the club high into the air, she rolled over on the floor ready to catch it as she went to strike her final pose, only to have the apparatus land beyond her reach.
That error knocked a distraught Kudryavtseva, who was leading at the halfway point of the competition, off the top and she settled for silver with a total of 75.608.
Ukraine's Ganna Rizatdinova edged out South Korea's Son Yeon-jae for the bronze.
Saturday's result meant former Soviet states have won every individual Olympic medal, 18 in total, in the event since 1996.
Despite owning a haul of seven world titles, the 20-year-old Mamun had long lived in the shadow of her younger rival as she had arrived in Rio never having won a world all-around title.
At the halfway point of the competition it appeared as if that trend would continue as Kudryavtseva, dubbed the "Angel with iron wings", fluttered above the rest of the field thanks to exquisite displays with the hoop and ball.
Chants of "Rus-si-a, Rus-si-a" echoed around the arena as she leapt around the mat rolling the ball across her body before arching her leg back into a fast-paced Biellmann spin holding the ball aloft.
But all her hard work came crashing down following one dropped catch with the club.
Having earned top marks of 19.225 (hoop) and 19.250 (ball), she bit her quivering lower lip as she walked off the floor following her mishap in the third rotation. She slumped over and stared at the floor as she waited for her score with the clubs to come up and her misery was complete when 17.833 allowed Mamun to overtake her.
Although the 18-year-old was back in the arena 40 minutes later to draw another top mark of 19.250 with the ribbon, it was not enough to topple Mamun.
A day after Mamun sent a club flying out of bounds during qualifying, she got the crowd clapping along to the beats of "We Will Rock You" as she performed a rousing routine with the same apparatus.
The gymnast known as "The Bengal Tiger", because her father hails from Bangladesh, knew that the gold would be hers if she avoided any glaring errors and so it proved to be.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russian whistleblower Yulia Stepanova may be in danger after her revelations on doping in her country that triggered a massive scandal and forced her to flee, but it is not the International Olympic Committee's responsibility, the IOC said on Saturday.
Middle-distance runner and former drugs cheat Stepanova helped uncover a state-backed and systematic doping program that saw more than 100 Russian athletes banned from the Olympics, including essentially the entire track and field team.
She was then forced to go into hiding in the United States with husband Vitaly, a former Russian anti-doping official, after giving evidence that her government for years facilitated widespread cheating across nearly all Olympic sports.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said last week her online doping management account, which includes her location and address, had been illegally accessed.
IOC president Thomas Bach, responding to a question about a perceived lack of support from the IOC for Stepanova, said: "I have to reject this. We are not responsible for dangers to which Ms. Stepanova may be exposed."
Stepanova said this week that the accessing of her account was done to discover her whereabouts. She has been branded a traitor by many people back home in Russia.
"If something happens to us then you should know that it is not an accident," Stepanova said in a conference call days ago.

NO CHANGE
She had been praised by the sport's governing International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and cleared to compete in Rio but the IOC banned Stepanova due to her doping past and instead sent her an invitation to attend as a guest.
"The ethics commission had to answer the question whether it was appropriate to change the constitution of the IOC for Yulia Stepanova in order to be able to allow her to compete (in Rio)," Bach said. "It came to the conclusion this would not be appropriate.
"We invited her to come and we offered her support if she should need it. Not only support for her life but also for her future (sporting career)."
Stepanova's revelations, along with those of the former head of the Sochi 2014 winter Games drugs-testing laboratory, triggered a series of investigations including one from the WADA.
The so-called McLaren report issued last month described, among other things, how Russians were replacing positive doping samples with clean ones during the Sochi Games with the support of the Russian secret service.
Despite WADA's call for a blanket ban, Bach defended the IOC's decision to allow some Russians to compete after international federations cleared them saying it was a decision to protect clean athletes.
"We have taken a decision there in the interests of athletes, defending the individual rights of these athletes and not making athletes be responsible for irregularities of their government," Bach said.
He said all samples from Russian athletes at Sochi would be retested, adding that they would also be checked for any tampering, as described in the report.
"You can be sure all samples of all Russian athletes participating in Sochi will be analyzed. They will also be analysed with regard to tampering," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russia won its first Olympic gold medal in women's handball on Saturday, overcoming France 22-19 in a tight, fast-paced final in front of a rapturous crowd.
The Russians led by several points through much of the game, although the French roared back in the middle of the second half to level at 14-14 before again trailing to a fierce attack.
When the final whistle was blown, Russia's players fell to the ground and embraced, while the disappointed French walked off, some wiping away tears.
"We did what we wanted... everything for me is like a dream," Russia's beaming Anna Sen, 25, told reporters, adding the team sang 'We came here to win' in the locker room.
France had strong support from the mostly packed arena, with shouts of 'Les Bleus!' from their fans, but although they won their first Olympic women's handball medal there were regrets.
"We had the way to beat them, but we failed at some of the shots," said France's Tamara Horacek. "The Russians play from all sides, they know how to do everything."
Earlier on Saturday, defending champions Norway found some solace for not making it into the final by overpowering the Netherlands to take bronze.

RIO DE JANEIRO World champion Arlen Lopez beat Uzbekistan's Bektemir Melikuziev on a unanimous points decision to win the Olympic middleweight title on Saturday, Cuba's third gold medal of the boxing tournament.
Azerbaijan's Kamran Shakhsuvarly and Mexico's Misael Rodriguez, his country's first medalist in the division since 1968, took the bronze medals as losing semi-finalists.
Fighting half an hour after compatriot Robeisy Ramirez had won bantamweight gold, Lopez ensured Cuba won two of the day's three finals by taking the opening rounds before easing off slightly in the third.
The top seed coming into the tournament, Lopez always looked the more polished fighter in what was a repeat of the 2015 world championship final and he closed out the draw with a 3-0 win.
The 23-year-old caught Melikuziev with his arm in the third round, leading to a brief pause while the Uzbek had medical attention for a gash above his eye.
Cuba have now won middleweight gold five times, equaling the United States and Britain.
"There was some information from people in the stands through signals that I was ahead and that encouraged me and I knew the victory was in my hands," said Lopez, who celebrated with a forward roll on the canvas.
Japan's Ryoto Murata won the title in 2012 and then turned professional.

RIO DE JANEIRO A mock favela built on Copacabana beach to protest the lack of an Olympic legacy for Rio de Janeiro's poor was broken up by police on Saturday, who said it was blocking access to the beach.
Activists of the group Rio de Paz, which uses protest art to highlight social issues such as violence against women and public security, erected mock shacks, a polluted open sewer and a Brazilian flag peppered with bullet holes on the beach during the early hours of Saturday.
At 0800 local time, municipal security officials of the National Guard arrived and asked protesters to pull down the installation. After an hour-long stand-off, the officials started taking down the artwork which was supposed to be on display until early Saturday evening.
Activists sat on the sand - many of them with tape over their mouths to symbolize a lack of voice for Rio's excluded - as guards pulled apart the wooden shacks built next to the Olympic rings which have become a popular tourist spot on the beach.
"This is the first time that we've ever had a protest on Copacabana stopped like this since we started in 2007," said Antonio Carlos Costa, founder of Rio de Paz. "It shows how much officials are preoccupied about the public image of the city at the moment."
In a statement, the National Guard said "it had not stopped the protest but only removed structures erected on the sand as they were blocking access for beachgoers."
For Costa, the Olympics in Rio have brought little gain for the city's poor who continue to live in precarious conditions in favelas, or slums, without proper sanitation or security.
"Never before has the Olympics been held in such an unequal city" and the "the public money spent on the Games has left no legacy at all for the poor of Rio," Costa said.
The Olympics is costing Rio about $12 billion. Although nearly 60 percent of that was funded privately, critics argue the public investment has not benefited the wider population.
Instead, they say, investment has improved transport for the city's elite and benefited construction companies which provided funding to build venues in return for real estate contracts.
"We wanted to show the reality of Rio's favelas, the rats, the shacks, the bodies covered by bin bags, the stray bullets," Costa said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Inbee Park has two words for doubters who thought she should sit out the Olympics and give her spot to another South Korean: gold medal.
Park's commanding five-stroke victory in the first Olympic golf tournament in modern times was a surprise to those who follow the sport closely and knew Park had not been playing like herself this season.
Plagued by a thumb injury, she missed two months of competitive play including two majors this year. Then, when she returned to the game in a South Korean event two weeks before the Olympics, she missed the cut.
"Back in Korea, when I made my decision, a lot of people were saying maybe it might better for a fellow South Korean player to be in the field. That is understandable, but I wanted to play well this week to show a lot of people that I still can play," Park said.
Park, who adds a gold medal to seven major wins and the honor of being the youngest Ladies Professional Golf Association hall of fame qualifier at 28, was in vintage form in Rio.
She announced her arrival by firing a bogey-free opening round on Wednesday on the first day of the tournament. She went on to shoot a five-under 66 for three of the four rounds, and only stumbled with a 70 in the third round in very windy conditions.
How did Park come back from oblivion?
"I have been working with two coaches since last month. Because of the injury, my swing wasn't swinging the way I wanted and I didn't know exactly what the problem was. My new coach, my husband's friends, found some new points in my swing and we worked on that so I was hitting the ball much better than I was a couple of months ago," she said.
Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee called Park's win "definitely an 'in your face victory' given all the pressure she was facing."
In the end, she can't stay mad at South Korea, especially with so many fans from her country following her on the course and chanting her name after the gold medal ceremony.
"Being able to hear the national anthem on the golf course on the 18th hole was an unforgettable moment," she said.

RIO DE JANEIRO A day after a near-disaster with a dropped baton, defending champions the United States made no mistake on Friday when they won the women's Olympic 4x100 meters relay and Allyson Felix became the first woman to collect five athletics gold medals.
The U.S. team of Tianna Bartoletta, Felix, English Gardner and Tori Bowie clocked 41.01 seconds, the second-fastest time ever after the U.S. world record set in London four years ago, to beat Jamaica on 41.36 and Britain on 41.77.
"It's very special. It was great to join these women tonight. It's just a very unique experience," Felix said of her milestone.
"The adversity yesterday made us even more determined. We just kept fighting the whole way through," she said, referring to the 'crazy freak accident' in the Thursday morning heats when the baton dropped to the ground as she handed over to Gardner.
The Americans appealed successfully, arguing that Felix had been impeded by a Brazilian runner, and went through at China's expense after being allowed to race by themselves in a solo heat in the evening.
They sailed through in the final despite the disadvantage of racing in the tightest lane, number one, fueled by determination not to repeat Thursday's mishap.
"It really made us focus and buckle down on executing the race," Bartoletta said.
Jamaica's Elaine Thompson, running the second leg after Christania Williams before handing over to Veronica Campbell-Brown and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, narrowly missed out on matching compatriot Usain Bolt's sprint treble after her victories in the 100 and 200.
"Wonderful experience. My first Olympics. Two golds, a silver, I can't complain," she said.
The British team of Asha Philip, Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita came third to take their country's first medal in the event since 1984.
Felix had previously won golds in the 200m and the 4x100 and 4x400 relays in 2012, and the 4x400 in 2008, and was narrowly denied in the 400 earlier this week when Shaunae Miller of the Bahamas defeated her with a desperate dive for the line.
She has a shot at another medal on Saturday in the 4x400 relay.

RIO DE JANEIRO Liam Heath brought home Britain's 25th gold medal on Saturday, winning the men's K-1 200-meter sprint in a neck-and-neck battle with France's Maxime Beaumont.
Heath, 32, claimed victory in 35.197 seconds, just 0.165 seconds faster than silver medalist Beaumont.
Spain's Saul Craviotto and Germany's Ronald Rauhe tied for bronze, with identical finishing times down to the thousandth of a second.
Heath said he was overjoyed by the results.
"I could be up with Jesus Christ looking down," said Heath. "It's an absolutely incredible feeling. Hard to put into words."
The British paddler won silver in the men's K-2 200m race on Thursday. In the 2012 Games, he took bronze in that same event.

RIO DE JANEIRO The dark horses from Japan may have failed to spoil Usain Bolt's send-off party, but lightening team work helped them pull off a massive shock by upstaging North American sprinting giants to win Olympic silver in the 4x100 meters relay on Friday.
On their own, the Japanese sprinters did not stand a chance against the likes of Bolt, American Justin Gatlin or Canada's Andre De Grasse.
None of the four Japanese men -- Aska Cambridge, Yoshihide Kiryu, Ryota Yamagata and Shota Iizuka -- have run 100m in under 10 seconds, nor got a sniff of an individual Olympic final.
But what they lack in raw speed, they made up for in seamless baton changes on Friday and gelled to break the Asian record with a time of 37.60 seconds.
It was not only the best Japan has done in the event -- they won bronze in Beijing in 2008 -- they also did the unthinkable and beat the U.S. into bronze.
The Americans were then later disqualified for stepping into Bolt's lane and Canada, led by De Grasse, were promoted into third place.
"This is fantastic. This is really fantastic," said Aska Cambridge, who has a Jamaican father and a Japanese mother.
The Jamaican-born runner, whose personal best of 10.10 seconds is some way behind Bolt's world record of 9.58 seconds, held his own as he brought the Japanese team home.
"I'm really proud to have been part of a team in Japan," said Cambridge, laughing off suggestions that due to his heritage he should be called 'Japan's Bolt'.
Though few fans outside Japan will recognize the faces of the silver medalists, the outgoing Sprint King was not surprised to see Japanese runners hot on his heels.
"Hats off to them," said Bolt, who won his third 4x100m relay Olympic gold.
"The baton changes are always good and that's what always helps them, and I think they executed it well today, so I'm not shocked."
After winning gold, the Jamaicans admitted they had relatively few training sessions for the relay this year and only once with Bolt.
The Japanese team, by comparison, had been working on perfecting their baton handovers since March.
"We've been practicing all the time for about six months," said Iizuka, who ran the second leg. "That's why we've done a pretty good job."
The sleek baton transfers by Japan are also in stark contrast to problems faced by the U.S., who have been disqualified or bungled handovers eight times in Olympics and world championships since 1995.
They were also disqualified twice more after clinching medals before team members tested positive for drugs.

Washington Redskins running back Matt Jones suffered a sprained left shoulder in a preseason game against the New York Jets on Friday, putting his availability in doubt for the start of the regular season.
Jets defensive back Calvin Pryor pushed Jones out of bounds before landing on him to force the rusher out of the game in the opening quarter.
Redskins coach Jay Gruden said Jones has a slight separation but does not think he has a long term injury.
"When I went down, on a (pain) scale from 1 to 10 it was about a seven," Jones told reporters. "As it settled down (the pain went down). I still have some flexibility in it now so it's not as bad as it was."
Jones is slated to be the top runner in Washington this season.
The second-year player rushed for 490 yards last year while splitting time with running back Alfred Morris who has since left to sign with the Dallas Cowboys.

RIO DE JANEIRO U.S. Olympic swimmer Jimmy Feigen has passed security at Rio international airport and is waiting to board a flight home to the United States, a member of airport staff said on Friday.
Earlier on Friday, Feigen paid 35,000 reais ($11,000) to a sporting charity in Rio de Janeiro on the order of a Brazilian judge, after police said he and team mate Ryan Lochte lied about being robbed at gunpoint at the weekend.

RIO DE JANEIRO An epic Olympic journey that started on a balmy Beijing evening when a 21-year-old stunned the world by smashing the 100 meters world record came to an end after nine finals and nine gold medals in Brazil on Friday night.
In the intervening eight years, Usain Bolt has enthralled hundreds of thousands in stadiums in Beijing, London and Rio as well as billions around the world on television, bestriding his sport and the Games like a colossus.
The final act came when the fastest man who ever lived, who will be 30 on Sunday, anchored Jamaica to the 4x100 meters relay title to claim an unprecedented third successive sweep of all three Olympic sprint titles - the triple-triple.
Ahead of Bolt is another year of competition leading up to the world championships in London, followed by retirement.
"I just have mixed feelings now," he told reporters.
"Relief. I've had all this pressure over the years... I will definitely miss the sport, miss the Olympics because it's the biggest stage.
"Not going to miss these interviews. I've done like 500 since I've been here. But I'm definitely going to miss the crowd and the energy and just the competition.
"I love competing. So I'm going to miss all of that. But it's been a great career, I've done all I can do. I've proven to the world I'm the greatest in the sport, so it's mission accomplished pretty much."
For Bolt, it was a particular pleasure to sign off with former world record holder Asafa Powell, his training partner Yohan Blake and Nickel Ashmeade as part of a team representing their country.
"I love competing with the team, because in this sport you're always by yourself, so competing with four of the best in Jamaica is always wonderful," he added.
"I try to live up to my country's needs and I've always tried to be the best ambassador I can be for my country...
"I'll continue doing that even after I retire from sport, I'll continue to uplift my country."
There are fears that without by far its best known name and with the doping scandal continuing to hang over it like a black cloud, the sport of athletics may spiral into a serious decline.
Bolt, who has never failed a dope test unlike five athletes in just the American and Jamaican teams in Friday's relay final, had a more upbeat assessment.
"I think we've been through some rough patches but we're on the right track with the youngsters that we have," he said.
"We only can go up now, the bad times are behind us... we just put the bad times behind us and move forward, but I think we're going in the right direction now."
As for the future for Bolt himself, he said he was looking forward to getting "a lot of love" when he gets back to Jamaica and would then start thinking about his post-athletics life.
"I have to make a new bucket list now," he said.
"I've accomplished what I wanted to in track and field. I just have to make new goals and a new bucket list but first I just want to go on vacation and relax."

Andy Murray continued his golden run on Friday with a 6-4 6-4 victory over Australia's Bernard Tomic to move into the semi-finals of the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati.
The world number two pushed through the fatigue of an arduous schedule and overcame a 4-3 deficit in the second set where he won the final three games to continue his spectacular run, that has included his second Wimbledon crown and defense of his Olympics singles title.
"I think the conditions here help a little," Murray said.
"It's pretty quick and there are not a lot of long rallies. That helped me tonight. I played the big points well and that was the difference. That comes from winning big matches and making better decisions."
Murray was last defeated by Novak Djokovic in the French Open final in June and will now meet Milos Raonic in the semi-finals after the big-serving Canadian beat Austrian eighth seed Dominic Thiem.
Raonic lost to Murray in the Wimbledon final.
"He's got one of the biggest serves in the game," Murray said. "I'll need to (return) well if I want to win."
Raonic unleashed 17 aces and did not face a break point during the 68-minute match that put him within two wins of his first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title.
"I've practiced with him many times, so to some extent I have an understanding of his game, like he has of mine," Raonic told the ATP Tour website.
"But it's different come match time, so I did a little bit of studying. I feel like I took that all in and adapted well."
Raonic skipped the Olympics and instead spent time with coach John McEnroe and the two discussed the disappointment of losing to Murray in his first career grand slam final appearance.
"There were some very prolonged discussions about how I can make a difference on that (mental) part," Raonic told ESPN.
"There were certain moments when I was in the (Wimbledon final) and I thought I was really putting out all the intensity mentally. He (McEnroe) told me he felt I missed a few important moments where I could have showed some intensity. I re-watched the match and saw seven key moments.
"If I want to make the steps forward in the big tournaments, that's going to make the biggest difference."
In other quarter-final action, Croatian 12th seed Marin Cilic advanced when compatriot Borna Coric retired with a knee injury after dropping the first set 6-2 while unseeded Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov beat American Steve Johnson 7-6(8) 6-2.

MIAMI/RIO DE JANEIRO A U.S. Olympic swimmer has accused his team mate, Ryan Lochte, of playing a key role in an incident that has tainted South America's first Games, saying he tore a poster off a wall and argued with armed security guards at a Rio gas station.
In his first account of last week's incident, the youngest of the four swimmers involved, Gunnar Bentz, 20, said the guards confronted them after they had urinated behind some bushes and Lochte tore a metal-framed advertising poster from a wall.
It is the first time any of Lochte's companions has spoken publicly of the 32-year-old's role in the incident, and it contradicts Lochte, one of America's most decorated swimmers, who told U.S. television that he and his team mates were robbed at gunpoint.
Brazilian police have denounced Lochte's account as a fabrication designed to cover up for the group's bad behavior after a night spent partying until dawn, prompting apologies from both Lochte and the U.S. Olympic Committee this week.
Bentz said he, Lochte and two other swimmers - all gold medalists at the Rio Games - had been in a taxi when they stopped at the gas station to use the bathroom, contradicting Lochte's initial account of being pulled over by gunmen posing as police.
"There was no restroom inside, so we foolishly relieved ourselves on the backside of the building behind some bushes," Bentz said in a statement issued via the University of Georgia, where he attends college.
"I am unsure why, but while we were in that area, Ryan pulled to the ground a framed metal advertisement that was loosely anchored to the brick wall."
Armed security guards then challenged the swimmers and one of them drew a gun and demanded they sit down, but Lochte then stood up and yelled at one of the guards, Bentz said, adding that he and team mate Jack Conger had tried to restrain him.
"After Jack and I both tugged at him in an attempt to get him to sit back down, Ryan and the security guards had a heated verbal exchange, but no physical contact was made," Bentz said.

'THE UGLY AMERICAN'
The U.S. Olympic team has sought to draw a line under the scandal which has embarrassed the host city and angered ordinary Brazilians who jeered Bentz and Conger, calling them "liars" and "fakes" as they made their way out of Brazil on Thursday.
Bentz, who said he never gave a false account to police, and Conger arrived in Miami on Friday on an American Airlines flight. They sat in curtained-off seats for much of the journey.
The fourth member of the group, Jimmy Feigen, was set to leave the country on Friday night after agreeing with a judge to donate $11,000 to a sporting charity, a condition of police returning his passport.
Lochte returned to the United States on Monday, a day after the incident and before police denounced his version.
In his apology, Lochte said he should have been more careful and candid in his account but it had been traumatic to have a man point a gun at him in a foreign country and demand money.
"I want to apologize for my behavior of last weekend," Lochte said as a social media storm gathered over him at home and in Brazil. He did not say why he embellished details of the encounter, nor why the act of vandalism occurred.
"Regardless of the behavior of anyone else that night, I should have been much more responsible in how I handled myself and for that I am sorry to my team mates, my fans, my fellow competitors, my sponsors and the hosts of this great event."
U.S. tabloid press dubbed him "The Ugly American" and "The Lochte Mess Monster", turning on the once-beloved champion and saying his behavior fed the worst stereotypes of Americans abroad.
The incident followed a series of muggings and armed robberies of high-profile athletes and visitors in Rio, including two government ministers - security scares that detracted from the image Games organizers hoped to portray.
The International Olympic Committee said on Friday it had set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the incident and could sanction the swimmers if they considered their behavior violated the Olympic charter in some way.
The U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Swimming have said they will consider whether to take action against the swimmers. Lochte has said that he hopes to represent the United States at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

RIO DE JANEIRO Greece's Ekaterini Stefanidi won the Olympic pole vault on Friday and her country's first athletics gold since the 2004 Athens Games, then defended its integrity after barred Russian Yelena Isinbayeva blasted the event as sub-par without her in the field.
Stefanidi cleared 4.85 meters to beat American Sandi Morris, who took silver.
"Every single athlete in there would have wanted her to be there and have a chance to beat her," Stefanidi said of the two-time Olympic champion, who was excluded from the Rio Games as part of a mass ban on Russian athletes over a doping scandal.
"Things are how they are and we had nothing to do with it."
The competition took place hours after Isinbayeva announced her retirement and said that whoever won would not have earned "a proper gold medal" due to her absence.
Stefanidi, a 26-year-old who lives in the United States, shouted in ecstasy as she cleared the bar at 4.85m and celebrated before she even landed.
"I can't believe what's happened. It's amazing, the crowd were amazing, my parents are here," Stefanidi told reporters. "I'm glad to make my country proud."
Morris, 24, also cleared 4.85 but took silver because of more failed attempts earlier in the competition.
In a show of sportsmanship, she could be seen clapping along with the crowd as Stefanidi prepared for her final, ultimately failed, attempt.
The American also fired back at Isinbayeva's criticism.
"Her comments can be disrespectful and hurtful to the people who were out there tonight," Morris said. "She is someone that I looked up to my entire life and it's kind of disappointing to hear things like that."
New Zealand's Eliza McCartney, 19, cleared 4.80m to tie her national record and take bronze.
American Jennifer Suhr, 34, who won gold in London in 2012 and silver in Beijing in 2008, competed despite fighting illness since arriving in Rio.
She successfully completed only one vault, at 4.60m, after her husband and coach Rick Suhr reported on Twitter on Friday morning that she had woken up "coughing up blood".
As she fought back tears, Suhr said: "After warm-ups, everything just shut down. My muscles, I've never had them shake. I don't know what happened.
"It is such a crappy feeling to know you have worked for years for this and this to happen. It's embarrassing."

Angelique Kerber moved within two victories of the world number one ranking when she beat Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro in their quarter-final at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati on Friday.
The German second seed overcame a slow start before finding some form and outlasting ninth seed Navarro 4-6 6-3 6-0 in a match that never reached any great heights in front of a small crowd in steamy afternoon heat.
Kerber's task was perhaps made easier by an apparently injured Navarro, who moments after losing withdrew from her doubles match, citing a thigh complaint.
If Kerber wins on Sunday, she will displace Serena Williams as world number one, ending the American's run of 183 consecutive weeks at the top.
Williams was a late withdrawal from Cincinnati, citing a shoulder injury.
To overtake Williams, Kerber must first get past Romanian Simona Halep who defeated Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska 7-5 6-1 to reach the semi-final.
Kerber and Halep last met in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon, where the German prevailed in two tight sets, but Halep has not lost a match since en route to victories at the Bucharest Open and Rogers Cup in Montreal.
Kerber has played a heavy schedule over the summer, and it showed in her sluggish start on Friday.
"It was really difficult to go out there," she told the WTA website.  "I'm playing like I don't know which day ... every day, it's the same. When I'm waking up it's the same routine I have ... Of course it's really hot out there."
The other semi-final will pit fourth seed Garbine Muguruza against 15th seed Karolina Pliskova.
Spaniard Muguruza, the French Open champion, beat Hungarian qualifier Timea Babos 6-4 6-3, while Czech Pliskova upset Russian seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-3 4-6 6-2.
Pliskova credited her victory to improved serving as the match progressed.
"In the first set I tried to play aggressive and not give her time to dictate the game," she said of Kuznetsova.
"My serve wasn't that good in the first two sets, but in the third it improved a lot."

RIO DE JANEIRO The runners who have lost to Usain Bolt for the past dozen years showered the Jamaican superstar with praise on Friday, after he completed his historic "triple-triple" in what he has said will be his final Olympics.
From the 2008 Beijing Games onwards, the 29-year-old has dominated sprinting, winning every Olympic gold in the 100 meters, 200m and 4x100m to make history as he eliminated other nations' chances of standing atop the podium.
American Tyson Gay, who made his Olympic debut in 2008 as Bolt began his astonishing medal sweep, described the Jamaican's greatness as "just self-explanatory".
Gay, 34, added: "Words can't describe that type of a guy and what he's done for the sport. Everybody just appreciates what he's done."
Bolt's popularity was vividly illustrated this week at Rio's Olympic Stadium. While the 60,000-seat facility was never full, the crowds were largest on nights when Bolt was racing, and notably empty when he was absent.
"Man's a legend," said American Trayvon Bromell, a 21-year-old who faced Bolt twice during his Olympic debut in Rio, in the 100m and 4x100m.
Noting that early in Bolt's career experts dismissed the idea that a 1.96m (6'5") tall athlete could be an effective sprinter, Bromell pointed out the irony that people now suggest he and Canada's Andre de Grasse, 1.76m (5'9"), are too short to succeed.
"He (Bolt) broke the barrier and showed people that anything is possible," said Bromell, 1.73m (5'8"). "So it gives me hope to show the world that the impossible is possible."
De Grasse, also 21 and in his Olympic debut, came the closest to challenging Bolt in Rio, pushing the pace in the 200m semi-final and trying to challenge him again in Thursday's final, where he won silver.
"No one will be able to tell him ... that he's not he greatest," de Grasse said. "He's proven it over and over, every time. He's one of the best and I don't know what else he has to prove."
Indeed, that is the justification Bolt uses for his decision to make Rio his last Olympics, though he has committed to running at next year's world championships.
Gay, part of the U.S. 4x100 team that was disqualified in Friday's final, held out hope that with Bolt's pending retirement, he would have a chance at gold in Tokyo in 2020.
"I didn't plan to keep running until I was 38, but it seems that I've got to get another medal," the American sprinter said.

RIO DE JANEIRO The U.S. women's gymnastics team got far more of the limelight, and household names like swimmer Michael Phelps got immeasurably more TV coverage.
But no U.S. Olympic team, or individual athlete, outmatched competitors as resoundingly as a women's water polo squad that won the gold medal on Friday.
By a score of 12-5, the U.S. steamrolled Italy, an experienced team that had gone undefeated in Rio until meeting the United States in the final.
With the victory, U.S. women's water polo claimed their second straight Olympic gold, becoming the first ever to repeat the feat.
U.S. men and women have won gold medals in nine different sports so far during the Rio Games, but in no other sport has their performance been so dominating.
Following his team's loss a stunned Italian coach, Fabio Conti, summed up the U.S. team's abilities this way: "They are from out of this universe."
Water polo is a rough-and-tumble game where, during 32 minutes of sprinting, grappling, shooting and gasping for air, athletes never touch the bottom of the pool.
Much of the highly physical action takes place beneath the pool surface, a reason why the game does not typically lure millions of prime-time viewers.
But on Friday, Team USA put on quite a show in the same pool where Phelps had swum for roaring crowds a week earlier.
The team's recent record, including a winning streak of at least 22 games, has rarely been matched in the history of the sport, which only added women's play to the Olympics in 2000.
During a Rio Games in which the U.S. women played six matches, they outscored their opponents by more than 2-to-1.
Against Italy, eight of its 13 players scored, despite the European team's reputation for stellar defence.
With 12 U.S. goals in the final, it was the highest goal count ever by a women's water polo team in a gold medal match, and the widest margin of victory.
Their dominance is more remarkable considering 9 of the 13 Team USA players were competing in their first Games, and the average age of players on the team is 23.

MOURNING A BROTHER AND GOING FOR GOLD
The leader of the U.S. crew is Adam Krikorian, who also led the American women's team to victory in London in 2012.
To prevail here, the tight-knit team had to play through tragedy. Krikorian, 42, was told on Aug. 3, just before the Games began, that his older brother Blake had died suddenly of a heart attack in California.
Krikorian left to be with family, but rejoined the team a few days later.
"It would be very selfish of me to let what happened to me personally and my family ... the grieving and the mourning, affect what we've set out to do," Krikorian said on Friday.
Many of the team's players, he said, had trained their whole lives for a chance at Olympic gold.
Following the U.S. victory, the players hung their medals around Krikorian's neck. The coach fought back tears as he spoke to the press.
"I think it's going to hit me pretty hard later today," he said. "How hard this journey has been."
Team captain Maggie Steffens, who also helped win gold in London, said the victory proves that U.S. women's water polo is going through a golden age.
"What we did is really hard to do," Steffens said.
Of Krikorian's resolve, she said "I would probably be bawling in a corner ... he really kept it together."



RIO DE JANEIRO American Alise Post's joy at winning a silver medal in the women's BMX final was tempered shortly afterwards on Friday as Australian husband-to-be Sam Willoughby finished off the podium.
Minutes after Post crossed the line second behind winner Mariana Pajon, she watched Willoughby launch off the start ramp bidding to go one better than the silver he won in London.
It was not to be though and he finished sixth despite winning each of his three semi-final laps.
"I'm proud of my U.S. team mates but my heart is with Sam," the 25-year-old told reporters after giving her fiance a consoling hug in the finish area.
"But it's BMX and its one of those sports where anything can happen. He rode a phenomenal effort. I guess we'll chat about it over dinner.
"It's funny I was kind of joking that I didn't want to one-up him today, I just wanted to match his London result so we could have matching hardware in the trophy room.
"But I'm very proud of him and myself. Obviously he's very disappointed."

RIO DE JANEIRO An ambition he scrawled on a wall of the family garage as bike-mad teenager was realized by American Connor Fields on Friday as he won the gold medal in the Olympic BMX competition.
In fact, he even surpassed it with a stunning ride at Rio's spectacular X-Park, surging to victory after trailing teammate Nicholas Long out of the start gate.
"I'm going back next week and I'll help my dad move some stuff around in the garage, there's still a Sharpie (marker pen) in there that says 'One day I will be national and world champion'
"I can't wait to take a photo of myself next to it with the medal. If only my 14-year-old self could see this now."
Fields, 24 next month, suffered disappointment four years ago in London when, after dominating his semi-final runs, he failed to finish on the podium.
This time, with Australians Anthony Dean and Sam Willoughby setting a hot pace in the semis and looking favorites for gold, Fields stole their thunder with a perfect ride in the one-off climax to a thrilling couple of days.
"I knew it was all about getting to the finals, then everything is wiped off the board," Fields told reporters.
"It was one shot for glory. Once I got in the final I smiled and said right I'm going to put all my cards on the table and have a crack at it.
"I had the best start probably in my entire life then I found a hole and got in front. When I exited the last corner I realized I knew an Olympic gold medal was 70 meters in front of me. I was like 'Get to the line, get to the line.'"
Fields' place in Rio was in doubt after he broke his wrist in a crash in April - an injury that required surgery.
Afterwards he said the bone was actually still 'broken' and that he had gambled on himself to win a medal.
"It's not healed yet," said the Las Vegas-based speedster who took up BMX at the age of seven.
"I had a great doctor, Randy Viola, who I owe a lot of this to. He was instrumental in putting me back together and giving me a chance to get to the start gate.
"I had to bet on myself because if I had hit the wrist again I risked permanent damage. But if I'm not going to bet on me who will bet on me? So I trusted my ability."
Dutchman Jelle van Gorkom was second with Colombia's Carlos Alberto Ramirez Yepes third after edging out Long in a photo finish.
While Fields won his country's first Olympic BMX gold, compatriot Alise Post was runner-up in the women's event behind Colombian Mariana Pajon.
"It was a long four years after London 2012," said Post, who like Fields suffered heartache in London when tipped for gold. "Very proud of my team mates."

MANCHESTER, England Jose Mourinho says Manchester United's rehabilitation will be a steady process but Friday's 2-0 win over Southampton indicated the team are quickly rediscovering their vim and verve under the new manager.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice while Paul Pogba, the world's most expensive player, impressed on his first outing in his second spell at the club, prompting the kind of atmosphere  that has been increasingly rare in recent seasons of toil at Old Trafford.
Mourinho, who replaced Dutchman Louis van Gaal in the close season, has called on the squad to bring the fear factor back to the stadium and even at this early stage of their development there seems to be an aura about United again.
"The players are happy with some details which belong to the nature of this club," said Mourinho after his side made it two wins from two Premier League matches this season.
"We can't be the same United of the 80s, 90s and early 2000s as soccer has changed a lot.
"There is an evolution in things and we have to go in relation to that. It's a natural evolution, step by step," added Mourinho.
"We brought to the game some aspects of the United culture, the first goal is a great example of that."
Ibrahimovic, who met Wayne Rooney's fine cross with a thumping header in the 36th minute, led the line with an Eric Cantona-esque air of self-belief as United played with the swagger that has been missing since the retirement of all-conquering former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013.

BIG PUZZLE
"We need to get used to winning," said Ibrahimovic, "the mental part is important.
"Everything is new. It's like a big puzzle, we need to put the puzzle together."
For the first time since 2000, the world's most expensive footballer has not been signed by Real Madrid, and while Pogba is a 'Galactico' in every sense, his return "home", as Ibrahimovic described it, can provide United with a big lift.
"I came here to win, that's what I always wanted," said the France midfielder who has gone back to his first club from Juventus for a fee of 89 million pounds ($116.35 million).
"We need to get used to winning and carry on like this. We dream big. United are a big club, I know we will do big things this season."
Pogba gave a dynamic display, managing more interceptions than any other player and completing more dribbles.
There was more than a hint of fellow countryman Patrick Vieira about his performance and United fans will be hoping they have finally found a long-awaited successor to former Ireland midfielder Roy Keane who shone under Ferguson.


RIO DE JANEIRO DeAndre Jordan may not have been the starting center when Team USA arrived in Rio but the lowest drafted player among his Olympic teammates is the reason they will be playing for a third consecutive gold medal.
The unassuming Jordan, in only his second start of the Rio Games, gave the American men's basketball team much more of a defensive identity and was often the best player on the court in a hard-fought 82-76 semi-final victory over Spain on Friday.
The Los Angeles Clippers' big man dominated the boards, pulling down a U.S. Olympic record 16 rebounds, had nine points and kept Spanish center Pau Gasol from doing more damage in a scrappy contest.
"We would not be playing for the gold medal if DeAndre did not play that well," said U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski.
Former NBA Most Valuable Player Kevin Durant singled out Jordan's role by saying "DJ was great with 16 rebounds and we are going to need that in the next game."
Jordan, 28, might not have even won a place on the team if not for the decision of several higher-profile players to bow out of these Games.
On a squad packed with NBA players who were top-10 draft picks, you have to look way down the 2008 class before you find Jordan's name at number 35.
While others handle the scoring, Jordan does the dirty work under the net and led the NBA in rebounds in 2014 and 2015.
The 2.11 meter Texan was modest about his success on Friday, saying his "number one job here is to come out and play with as much energy as I can.
"Giving the guys touch shots, blocked shots, that's the kind of player that I am. It just comes naturally."
Krzyzewski called Jordan "such a good team mate" and his NBA peers have found it very easy to play with him.
Jordan said the Olympic tournament might be the height of his career, something he dreamed about as a child.
Asked if the tough weeks of playing in Rio might affect his early season back with the Clippers, Jordan said his plan is to play as many games as he can.
"I am 28 years old, I am still a little young," Jordan said.
To which, Krzyzewski, 69, replied: "You are very young."

RIO DE JANEIRO Veteran swimmer Ryan Lochte's brush with Rio police has already hurt his appeal to sponsors - but for two lesser-known team mates, it means they may never get a chance to sign their first major deal.
Lochte has several major sponsors, including fashion house Ralph Lauren Corp, which took down any reference to the gold medalist on its website on Friday, and swimwear company Speedo which has said it is following the situation.
But for team mates Gunnar Bentz, 20, and Jack Conger, 21, who are also embroiled in what social media has termed #LochteGate, going professional and scoring future business opportunities are now next to impossible, marketers say.
Unlike Lochte, who won the first of his six career gold medals in Athens in 2004, the pair were competing in their maiden Olympics and were yet to reap the commercial benefits of standing atop a Games podium.
They swim at U.S. college level, which means they cannot earn money. They stood next to Michael Phelps on the podium after winning gold in the 4x200m relay, so it was possible they would have been able to go pro after Rio.
But, after earning more notoriety for allegedly lying to Brazilian police than their performance in the pool, sponsors are now unlikely to put their dollars behind them, said Matt Delzell at The Marketing Arm, an Omnicom Group Inc agency that advises brands on sports endorsements.
"It's relatively hard for any swimmer to break out and to attract sponsors, but if you couple it with how they all corroborated a fabricated story, it's a black eye," Delzell said.
Before they walked into the gas station with Lochte in the early hours of Sunday morning, the road for Bentz and Conger to attract big sponsorship deals was already paved with obstacles.
Millionaire Michael Phelps is an exception rather than the rule in Olympics swimming. While the most decorated Olympian in history commands large endorsements with companies such as Under Armour Inc and watchmaker Omega, many Olympic swimmers get by with few sponsorship deals in their career.
Swimming is one of the most watched sports in the Olympics, but it is not followed year round by a mainstream audience that can be easily commercialized.
The vast majority of Olympians make a fraction of what top athletes in professional sports generate in endorsement income on a year-round basis, says Peter Land, who works with Olympic and Paralympic sponsors for communications firm Finsbury.
"While these athletes are the best in the world at their craft, the massive global spotlight shines on them for a few weeks every four years," said Land.
That means the stakes are even higher when swimmers have their time to shine in the Olympic sun, which is why some have found the scandal surrounding the U.S. swimmers so unfortunate.
"This situation has adversely impacted all areas of the Games, since it has distracted attention from other athletes, sports and stories," said Phelps' agent, Peter Carlisle at talent agency Octagon.
"The cumulative quality and nature of the exposure related to swimming certainly influences the level of interest among brands."
It may have been possible for Conger and Bentz to land smaller marketing deals in their home towns after a medal win, making money from local appearances or radio ads, said Delzell. Now, even those opportunities have likely dried up, he said.
A fourth swimmer involved in the gas station incident, Jimmy Feigen, has a deal with swimsuit maker TYR Sport, signed after the 26-year-old won a silver medal at the London 2012 Games.
TYR Sport could not be reached for comment on Friday.
Feigen paid 35,000 reais ($11,000) to a Brazilian sporting charity on Friday, a condition of reclaiming his passport from Brazilian police and being able to return home.
Medal bonuses could be in jeopardy for all four swimmers. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pays $25,000 for gold medal winners, $15,000 for silver medals and $10,000 for bronze.
When asked whether the swimmers' bonuses were at risk, a USOC spokesman responded by pointing to a paragraph from an USOC statement that said the swimmers' behavior was unacceptable and any "potential consequences" for them would be reviewed.
Whatever the consequences for the four swimmers, Phelps' agent hopes the story will start to recede from the news agenda.
"At this point, it seems as though the story is limited to the individual athletes involved, and hopefully it will soon give way to other, more positive stories coming out of Rio," Carlisle said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Claressa Shields had awarded herself a "C" after her first fight in Rio on Wednesday but it was "A" for achievement on Friday after the U.S. boxer punched through to a second successive Olympic middleweight final.
Shields, now one fight away from becoming a double Olympic champion, blasted past Kazakhstan's Dariga Shakimova in convincing fashion, forcing a standing eight count at the finish.
"I give it A minus," said the 21-year-old fighter from Flint, Michigan. "I did great. I went out there, showed my skill, showed my class. I showed I was the better, stronger and more skilled fighter.
"I actually could have stopped her, but I was having so much fun out there I was like, why do that?
"I wanted her to throw her punches at me so I could show her I'm faster than you, I punch harder than you. It was a great match."
Shields, who could become the first U.S. boxer to win two golds since 1904, is the second member of the current team to reach a final with bantamweight Shakur Stevenson going for his gold on Saturday.
The thought of that was enough for Shields to turn all musical.
"Just the two of us," she sang, getting into the swing of a familiar tune.
"We can make it if we try, just the two of us. Just the two of us. Me and Shakur. Building gold medals in the sky, just the two of us."
Shields, who will face Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands in the gold medal bout, will certainly be the favorite to repeat her London 2012 exploits and she is hungry on more than one level.
"I was questioning myself about my first fight, and why I was so tired," she said. "When I thought about it, the day before my last fight I didn't eat, I didn't drink the right way. I was starving my body.
"I just can't stand the food at the canteen any more at the Olympic village," she said. "I'm not going to walk all the way over just to find I'm not going to eat anything and go back to my room.
"The day before the (last) fight I drank some chocolate milk and that was it. So yesterday I made sure I ate two or three whole meals, and a lot of water."

NEW YORK Muhammad Ali's 1974 WBC heavyweight championship boxing belt and a handwritten letter about his conversion to Islam are among items that will hit the auction block in September, in the biggest such sale since Ali's death in June.
Heritage Auctions said on Friday that the auction will include the trunks Ali wore for his "Rumble in the Jungle" victory over George Foreman in Zaire in 1974. The gloves worn by Sonny Liston when he lost his title to Ali in 1964 are also among 79 lots in the Sept. 10 auction.
Ali's 1964 letter to Life magazine, in which he talks about his conversion to Islam and changing his Cassius Clay birth name, is expected to fetch upwards of $100,000, the Dallas-based auction house said.
The one-time Christian Baptist became the most famous convert to Islam in American history when he announced he had joined the Black Muslim movement under the guidance of Malcolm X.
Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions, said the Feb. 18, 1964 letter followed an interview the boxer had done the same day with Life magazine announcing he was changing his name.
"The editors, especially Jack McDermott, were worried that he would disavow saying that when the actual Life magazine article came out. So he ripped off a piece of paper and had him (Ali) sign an affidavit that said clearly he was changing his name," Guzman said.
Heritage said the World Boxing Council belt is the first of those won by the three-time world heavyweight champion to come to auction, and is expected to sell for some $600,000.
Ali's death on June 4 at age 74, after a long battle with Parkinson's disease, prompted an outpouring of grief and tributes worldwide, culminating in an elaborate public funeral in his Louisville, Kentucky hometown.
"With the recent passing of Muhammad Ali, we have received telephone calls from collectors all over the world seeking important pieces from his life and career,” said Chris Ivy, director of Heritage Sports Collectibles.
Heritage Auctions said most of the items came from collectors, with nothing coming from Ali's family, who have a number of significant artifacts in their keeping.
Ali's "Rumble in the Jungle" trunks are expected to sell for $150,000, and Sonny Liston's gloves have an estimated sale price of $100,000, Heritage said.
Earlier this month, Ali’s fight-worn boxing gloves from his famed 1971 encounter with Joe Frazier sold for $606,000 at a different auction house.


RIO DE JANEIRO Double Olympic champion Ashton Eaton threw out a challenge on Thursday to come up with ways to make the decathlon more exciting, suggesting that most spectators fail to grasp the intensity of the arduous event.
Spread over two days, the decathlon tests the attention span of sports fans and is based on a complex points system that computes the athletes' total rankings across 10 track and field disciplines.
"I think there is a way to make this event and the (women's) heptathlon also wildly more exciting than it is for spectators to watch," the 28-year-old American said after clinching his second consecutive Olympic decathlon gold medal.
"I don't have time to think of the way, because we're training. But somebody should because ... I don't know, it's just awesome.
"One of the best tweets I saw I think was (comedian) Bill Murray, and he said we should put an 'Average Joe' in every event to give a reference. He was talking about sprinting and all that but that'd be pretty sweet to see in a decathlon."
Bronze medalist Damian Warner of Canada, addressing the same theme, told reporters one factor that dampened fans' enthusiasm was that decathletes cannot match the performance of those who specialize in a single event.
"So we throw the shot put 14 meters and they throw 22 meters, and they think 'that's not very special' or you see us run 1,500 (meters) in 4.20 and we are lying on the ground dying, and people out there can run it a lot faster," he said.
"But think what people don't understand, and the kind of lack of education that Ashton was talking about ... we have a very small amount of time to work on those events, and we are doing 10 different events.
"I think that's where the 'Average Joe' thing could come in and people could see how tough it is. Once people see how tough it is, they get a lot more excited."

RIO DE JANEIRO When an angry crowd of Brazilians jeered U.S. Olympic gold medal swimmers Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, calling them 'liars' and giving one of them a tug on the ear, the young Americans looked shocked by the ferocity of their reaction.
What they appeared not to realize was that a fabricated story about how they and two team mates had been robbed at gunpoint - allegedly told to cover up an act of vandalism at a Rio gas station - hit a raw nerve in this South American nation.
Brazilians are deeply proud of their country - its infectious music, sun-kissed beaches, five World Cup victories and its status as a regional heavyweight - but are acutely aware of its problems: deep-rooted corruption, poverty and the crime that stalks the slums of its megacities, like Rio de Janeiro.
Brazil looks northward to the United States - like itself, a big country built on successive waves of immigration - with a mixture of respect, admiration, envy and resentment.
The complicated relationship has led to episodes - some minor, others deadly - involving Americans flaunting Brazilian law to the ire of those living here. The swimmers' scandal neatly fits Brazil's stereotypical view of "Ugly Americans".
"Brazil is a country that already has an inferiority complex when it comes to the United States," said Esther Solano, a sociologist at the Federal University of Sao Paulo who was in Rio for the Games.
"So people here feel vulnerable and angry when Americans come down here and act like they can do whatever they want, with no respect for rules or regard for the locals."

BRAZIL'S COMING OF AGE
In 2009, when Brazil was chosen to host the Games, the economy was booming. The then president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, said it showed Brazil had become a "first-class" country.
But as the Games finally arrived, preparations were immersed in a corruption scandal over infrastructure and criticism over failures to clean up the raw sewage pouring into Guanabara bay.
The two weeks of competition were overshadowed by armed robberies of foreign government ministers, athletes and tourists, as well as long queues at stadiums and lack of food.
The American swimmers' allegations appeared to be the final humiliation.
When their fabrication was uncovered, the immediate reaction of many here was "imagine what would happen to a Brazilian if they did that in the U.S.?". It was a question posted by legions of Brazilians on social media in recent days.
"The impression is that they arrived thinking this was a country without law and that they could do whatever they wanted and get away with it," said Marcelo Vieira, 33, in the Olympic Park.
Yet Brazilians also showed their playful side. Memes involving gold medal swimmer Ryan Lochte, accused by police of being the "protagonist" of the vandalism and ensuing lie, flooded Facebook feeds and Twitter, many depicting him as fiction's most famous liar, Pinocchio.
"Those of us living in Rio are used to gunfire, assaults, with everything that is bad," said Paulo Henrique Cunha, a 73-year-old accountant. "But to have these gringos show up and invent this story they were robbed? Ah, that's just too much."

MEDALS ARE FOR HONOR
The Brazilian government has never backed down from taking on Washington, from trade complaints to visa policy.
Brazil requires American tourists to have visas and that they cost the same as Brazilians pay to visit the United States
In 2004, Brazil implemented a policy of fingerprinting and photographing American tourists on arrival, in response to the United States doing the same for all foreigners entering America after the Sept. 11 attacks.
A few weeks after Brazil's policy took effect, an American Airlines pilot was arrested at Rio's airport because he made an obscene gesture with his middle finger while being photographed.
The photo of the pilot, Dale Hirsch, was printed above the fold in Rio's main O Globo newspaper - and was widely perceived as the embodiment of American arrogance.
The pilot was freed after paying a fine of $13,000 to avoid the possibility of facing two years in prison for showing "contempt for authorities" - a crime in Brazil.
On Friday, the swimmer Lochte issued an apology on his Twitter account, but it did little to quell the anger.
It was blasted on social media by Brazilians and Americans alike as a lukewarm, half-hearted mea culpa, doubly so as it contained a line about it being "traumatic" to be out partying in a foreign country where one does not speak the language.
"Medals are for honor," one person wrote on Twitter directly responding to Lochte's post, referring to the 12 he has won at four Olympics. "Lochte has none."

MOSCOW The first Olympic champion in the history of the Soviet Union, the discus thrower Nina Ponomareva, has died at the age 87, the All-Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF) announced on its website www.rusathletics.com on Friday.
At the country's debut Olympics in Helsinki in 1952, she won with an Olympic record of 51.42. 
Ponomareva also won a bronze at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne and a gold four years later in Rome.
After finishing her competitive career, she began coaching Soviet athletes.

ABOARD FLIGHT AA990 Standing on a podium in Rio last week with gold medals draped around their necks, swimmers Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz were the pride of America as they sang along to the "Star Spangled Banner."
On Friday, both swimmers arrived back on American soil aboard Flight AA990 to Miami, a curtain draped around them with a "Do not disturb" label on it, an attempt by airline staff to shield them from a controversy that has embarrassed Team USA and engulfed the Rio Games.
"I can't, I'm sorry, I can't," Conger, 21, told a Reuters reporter on the flight when asked what it felt like to be arriving home after Brazilian police had accused them of lying about being robbed at gunpoint.
Hours earlier, he and Bentz, 20, were jeered and booed by Brazilians as they left a Rio police station having revised their statements to authorities. On Wednesday night, they had been pulled off a plane as they tried to leave the country.
Passports back in their hands, they were among the last passengers to board AA990 on Thursday night, both wearing hoodies, as they settled into the third row from the back in economy, with a female passenger between them.
The swimmers spent some of the nine-hour trip poring over newspapers that were plastered with headlines about their Rio escapade. Flight attendants were determined to keep reporters away, forming a barrier when Reuters attempted to speak to them.
After trays of cheese ravioli and beef stew were served at midnight, it was lights out in the cabin. By the time the lights were turned on again in the morning, the two swimmers had been whisked up to business class and hidden behind the curtain.
Airline staff slipped trays of cheese omelets, croissants and fruit through a small gap in the curtain, trying to hide the young men from public glare. When they arrived in Miami, customs agents helped shield them from a reporter as they made their way to a connecting flight.
Just 10 days earlier, Conger, a University of Texas champion, and Bentz had stepped into the spotlight after a stunning Olympics debut, winning gold in the 4x200m relay alongside veteran swimmers Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps.
Bentz bragged on Twitter that he and his fellow "Bulldogs", from the University of Georgia, had won more medals in Rio than many nations.
By the time they were taking off on Thursday night, the U.S. Olympic Committee had released a statement to the Games host nation apologizing for the swimmers' behavior. Both the USOC and USA Swimming said they were considering actions against the athletes, who are both college amateurs.
Lee W. McNutt, a 61-year-old Silicon Valley salesman, had traveled to Rio from Menlo Park, California, to see the Games. He said he spoke to Conger and Bentz on the flight back home.
"I just said, 'Don't let this get you down. I don't think real sports fans are going to worry about this. You're young and this will pass. I told them to take tonight off. Tomorrow start training for Tokyo," he said.
"I've got boys that age. They're college guys and they've just been on a big high winning those Olympic medals and now they're down in the valley over whatever this incident might have been."

RIO DE JANEIRO When Pusarla Sindhu won a gold medal at the 2012 Asian junior badminton championships, her cricketing hero Sachin Tendulkar presented her with a car.
One can only guess at the reception the 21-year-old player will receive when she returns into the arms of 1.3 billion Indians after becoming the country's most successful female Olympian with her silver-medal performance in Rio.
The fact that she had been beaten 19-21 21-12 21-15 by Spanish world number one Carolina Marin in the final mattered little for a country that until Friday had won a solitary bronze at these Games.
The Hyderabadi got a taste of what her life will be from now on when she was pulled and prodded as she made her way through a throng of reporters desperate to hang on to every word coming out of her mouth.
"I'm really, really happy because my ultimate goal was to get a medal at the Olympics," she said as she clung on to the silver medal around her neck.
"I thought it would be a gold but never mind, it's still a silver. I never thought I would make it to here... overall I am happy."
For most of her career Sindhu has largely remained in the shadow of fellow Indian and former world number one Saina Nehwal.
In fact Sindhu was lost in the crowd as India sent a record  120-odd athletes to Rio with high expectations of topping their haul of six medals at the 2012 London Games.
Along with Nehwal, who won a bronze four years ago, medals were expected from 2008 shooting gold medalist Abhinav Bindra, mixed doubles tennis pair Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna, pistol shooter Jitu Rai, boxer Vikash Krishan and shooter and 2012 silver medalist Gagan Narang to name just a few.
With five days to go till the closing ceremony, however, that goal seemed way off target as all those tipped for success had departed empty handed.
It prompted Indian novelist Shobhaa De to tweet: "Goal of Team India at the Olympics: Go to Rio. Take selfies. Come back empty handed. What a waste of money and opportunity."
Freestyle wrestler Sakshi Malik finally ended the barren run on Wednesday with her bronze before Sindhu, who is mentored by 2001 All England Badminton champion Pullela Gopichand, doubled the medals tally on Friday.
With no Indian woman ever having won an Olympic gold, Sindhu was now hot property and it seemed everyone, from reporters to Indian businesswoman and socialite Nita Ambani, wanted to hug her or take a selfie with the daughter of former volleyball players.
"I am the first Indian to get a silver medal at these Olympics so that's great to hear and I'm really very proud of my country," she added.
"This medal was important to inspire Indians as there are many players coming up who in the future will succeed."

RIO DE JANEIRO The suspension of canoe sprinter Serghei Tarnovschi, Moldova's first medal winner of the Rio Games, for failing a drugs test has disappointed fellow competitors who are alarmed by the frequency of doping cases in the sport.
Tarnovschi claimed bronze in the men's C-1 1000-metre sprint on Tuesday but was provisionally suspended from the Rio Olympics two days later for failing a pre-Games drug test, the International Canoe Federation (ICF) said.
ICF Secretary General Simon Toulson told Reuters the status of Tarnovschi's medal would be determined by an International Olympic Committee-led hearing.
Tarnovschi could not be immediately reached for comment. The Moldovan National Olympic Committee said it had requested official information about the case from the ICF and the World Anti-Doping Agency.
The news has cast a shadow over Tarnovschi's fellow athletes, who have spent years preparing for their Olympic contests.
Isaquias Queiroz dos Santos of Brazil, who took silver over Tarnovschi in the 1,000m C-1 sprint, told Reuters the news was a disappointment.
“I think that he [Tarnovschi] made a mistake, maybe due to being young," said Queiroz dos Santos, 22. "I’m very sad that this type of thing is happening in our sport." who has
Filip Dvorak, a canoeist for the Czech Republic who came in second in his C-2 1000m semi-final heat on Friday, said he supported a "zero tolerance" policy toward doping.
Dvorak also called the frequency of doping cases in his sport "really alarming."
In July, the ICF said it removed five Russian sprint canoeists from the Olympics. Last October, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority gave a two-year ban to Olympic gold medal sprint kayaker Tate Smith for violations of a prohibited substance.
Doping cases overshadowed the run-up to Rio, with some 100 Russian competitors banned, and violations have continued to pile up.
Richard Pettit, ICF spokesman, said that the organization had a "robust zero-tolerance approach to doping violations."
"The fight to maintain clean sport is something that faces all International Federations and is an issue is taken exceptionally seriously," Pettit said.
The suspension prevented Tarnovschi and his brother Oleg from participating in Friday's men's canoe doubles 1000m heat at the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon.
Russia's Ilia Shtokalov, who finished fourth in Tuesday's race and narrowly missed out on a medal, could have a chance of bronze, depending on the outcome of Tarnovschi's hearing.
"He will have a lot of accusations going his way and I’m really sorry for the guy," said Shtokalov, 29. "But even if it’s confirmed, what can I say? He’s made his own choice here.”

RIO DE JANEIRO Carolina Marin overhauled a brave Pusarla Sindhu in the women's singles final on Friday to win Spain's first badminton title and crush India's hopes of a maiden gold medal at the Rio Olympics.
The top seed, known as the "Rafa Nadal" of badminton in Spain for her tenacity and fierce left-handed game, closed out a 19-21 21-12 21-15 victory over the 21-year-old Sindhu who was majestic in her Olympic debut.
"I'm very excited, I don't know how I'm feeling now but it is amazing that my dream has come true. I just had to believe in myself," Marin told reporters.
"It is more than a medal because of everything behind the medal. I have the best team behind me, they helped me a lot and were amazing."
Letting out a blood-curdling shriek with every winning point, the Spaniard was jeered by spectators at the Riocentro in a nerve-shredding deciding game as she pushed the bounds of good sportsmanship with constant stalling tactics.
But the ruthless 23-year-old got the job done, charging away to set up six match points and sealing it on the second with an imperious smash down the line that her opponent did well to get a racquet to.
Flag-waving Spanish fans jumped up and down as twice world champion Marin pumped her fists and bellowed in triumph, having survived a huge scare.
The flamenco-trained dancer from Andalucia beamed dry-eyed as she accepted the medal on the podium but wept freely as Spain's flag rose in the arena to the sound of the national anthem.
Roared to the finish by Indian fans, Sindhu will bow out with huge acclaim as her nation's first woman ever to win silver and having clinched the country's second medal at these Games.
It was also India's second medal in badminton, coming four years after compatriot Saina Nehwal grabbed a bronze in the same event in London.
Japan's Nozomi Okuhara won the Rio bronze in a walkover after her Chinese opponent, the 2012 singles champion Li Xuerui, pulled out of their playoff with a serious knee injury.
Sindhu, coached by the same man who took Nehwal to her London medal, was under huge pressure from the nation of a billion people to end India's agonizing wait for a Rio champion.
Despite bringing their biggest ever delegation, about 50 percent stronger than London where they won six medals, India had only celebrated a solitary bronze won by freestyle wrestler Sakshi Malik on Wednesday.
"I thought it would be a gold but never mind, I got a silver," the Hyderabadi shuttler said.
"I never thought I would make it to here."


NEW YORK The NBA awarded its 2017 All-Star Game to New Orleans on Friday, a month after removing the game from Charlotte, North Carolina, to protest a state law forcing transgender people to use public restrooms matching their gender assigned at birth.
The league also announced it will make an undisclosed financial contribution and provide other unspecified support for flood victims in Louisiana, where at least 13 people have died, 30,000 people were rescued and 40,000 homes were damaged due to recent historic rainfall.
The National Basketball Association had expressed its opposition to North Carolina's House Bill 2, or HB2, since it was passed in March and tried to work with state officials to change the law before ultimately making a decision to relocate its mid-February exhibition game.
Moving the event out of North Carolina follows similar moves by top entertainers who have canceled shows in North Carolina, including Bruce Springsteen, Demi Lovato, Nick Jonas, Boston, Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr and the circus group Cirque du Soleil.
The exhibition, seen as an economic boon to the city that hosts it, could be rescheduled for Charlotte in 2019 if there is an "appropriate resolution to this matter," the NBA has said.
Besides the Feb. 19 game, New Orleans will also host related events over three days, including slam dunk and long-range shooting competitions, an exhibition game of rising stars, an all-star practice and a celebrity exhibition, the league said in a statement.
New Orleans, which hosted the game in 2008 and 2014, had previously been identified in a Yahoo report as the leading candidate to be awarded the game.
HB2 made North Carolina the first U.S. state to require transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity.
Civil rights advocates have criticized the law as hostile  toward transgender people and praised the NBA for punishing the state. The law also has the effect of requiring transgender men, many of whom wear facial hair and obviously masculine clothing, to use the women's room alongside young girls.
Backers of the law, including North Carolina's Republican governor, Pat McCrory, have said boys and girls should be able to use public bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without fear of the opposite sex being present.

RIO DE JANEIRO The United States women's basketball team will be out to prove their credentials as one of the Olympics' great sporting dynasties on Saturday when they take on Spain in the gold-medal final.
A victory over Spain, who have never won a medal in women's basketball, would mark a sixth straight trip to the top of the Games podium for the all-conquering Americans, making them one of the greatest teams to ever grace the Olympic stage.
Only the U.S. men and India's male hockey players can claim such a run of domination in an Olympic team sport.
The U.S. men’s basketball teams earned seven consecutive gold medals from 1936-1968 while India won six straight men’s hockey golds from 1928-1956.
Riding a 48-game Olympic winning streak dating back to the 1992 bronze-medal contest, the American women have an overall record of 65-3, and Spain were not one of the teams to beat them.
The U.S. women, however, are taking nothing for granted as they zero in on gold number six.
"It’s going to mean a lot," said U.S. forward Angel McCoughtry. "We’re ready for the gold-medal game. We’re not going to come out playing (around), we have to be serious and really get this.
"People might say: 'Oh, they just played Spain and beat them by 40 points.' It’s going to be a different ball game on Saturday."
The United States and Spain played early in the group stage, with the U.S. romping to a 103-63 win, and few expect a different outcome on Saturday.
Heading into their semi-final the U.S. had outscored opponents in their first six games by an average of 41.7 points.
France provided the U.S. with their toughest test of the tournament but the Americans still walked off the court with a comfortable 19-point win.
Such has been the U.S. dominance that even some of the Spanish players give themselves little hope of pulling off what would be one of the biggest upsets in Olympic Games history.
"It is impossible to beat them," said Spain forward Laura Nicholls. "But this is a final you have to see, you have play and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. I'm sorry, but you have to be realistic.
"The United States is a dream team and it is going to be very difficult but we will fight and, above all, enjoy ourselves."

MIAMI/RIO DE JANEIRO Two U.S. swimmers accused of fabricating a story about being robbed at gunpoint during the Rio Games landed in Miami from Brazil early on Friday, a Reuters witness said.
Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz were moved to business class and covered themselves to avoid the media during an overnight flight, after they were jeered leaving the Rio airport.
Ryan Lochte, the most outspoken about the alleged robbery, is already in the United States and Jimmy Feigen was still in Brazil hoping to secure the release of his passport.
The incident, for which the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) apologised late on Thursday, has embarrassed the host city, angered the police and government and dominated news coverage of South America's first Olympics.
The Rio-based O Globo newspaper said a Brazilian judge had required Feigen to pay 35,000 reais ($11,000) to the Reaction Institute charity. Reuters did not independently have access to the judge's decision.
Lochte said in a statement on Sunday that a robber had put a gun to his forehead and demanded the group's wallets after going to a party after they finished competing.
His comments fuelled criticism of Games organisers after the sporting action has competed for headlines with a series of muggings and armed robberies of high-profile athletes and visitors in Rio de Janeiro, including two government ministers.
However, Brazilian police pulled Bentz and Conger off a plane on Wednesday night and took their passports, seeking clarification on the incident. Police said there was no robbery.
The USOC later confirmed police accusations, including that one of the swimmers had vandalised the gas station after the group stopped there to use the bathroom during a taxi ride back to the Athletes' Village on the way home from a night of partying.
In revised testimony that news site G1 had access to, Bentz and Conger said they were not robbed. Instead, they said Lochte had vandalised a local gas station early on Sunday and had an altercation with a security guard.
The three other swimmers in the car tried to leave as quickly as possible because they feared Lochte would cause more damage, according to the revised testimony.
Lochte has not been seen since he left Brazil, aside from giving an interview to NBC's Matt Lauer that has not aired.
The USOC apologised "to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil", adding: "The behaviour of these athletes is not acceptable..."
It said it would further review the incident and assess any potential consequences for the athletes. USA Swimming said it could also take possible action.
Bentz and Conger caught a connecting flight in Miami, walking through the airport in matching backpacks, a Reuters witness said. Conger kept headphones on and wore a bright orange team USA hooded sweatshirt.

RIO DE JANEIRO Two U.S. Olympic swimmers flew home from Brazil on Thursday after a local crowd jeered them, calling them "liars" and "fakes", and police accused them of fabricating a story about being robbed at gunpoint during the Rio Games.
Their departure marked what the U.S. Olympic team hopes will be the closing stages of an incident that has embarrassed the host city, angered the police and government, unleashed a storm on social media, and dominated news coverage of South America's first Olympics.
The U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) issued an apology after the departure of Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, who were among four U.S. swimmers shown to have lied about being stopped by gunmen posing as police in the early hours of Sunday.
"We apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence," USOC chief Scott Blackmun said in a statement.
Apart from Bentz and Conger, the incident involved gold medalist Ryan Lochte, one of America's most decorated swimmers and the most outspoken about the robbery, and Jimmy Feigen, who also won a gold medal in Rio.
Lochte returned to the United States on Monday. Feigen revised his police statement on Thursday in the hope of securing the release of his passport, the USOC said.
ABC News reported early on Friday that Feigen had agreed to pay $11,000 to a Brazilian charity to avoid prosecution in the case, citing his attorney Breno Melaragno Costa.
The outlet said the dispute would be settled, his passport returned, and Feigen would be allowed to leave the country once payment was made to the Reaction Institute charity.
Reuters could not independently verify the report.     Neither Feigen nor Lochte could be contacted for comment.
The USOC confirmed police accusations, including that one of the swimmers had vandalized the gas station after the group stopped there to use the bathroom during a taxi ride back to the Athletes' Village from a late-night party in the city.
After days of standing by the swimmers' story, the USOC also backed up other police evidence, including a security video showing the swimmers in an argument with staff at the Shell service station.
"An argument ensued between the athletes and two armed gas station security staff, who displayed their weapons, ordered the athletes from their vehicle and demanded the athletes provide a monetary payment," it said, adding that the guards allowed the swimmers to leave once some cash had been handed over.
The USOC said it would further review the incident and assess any potential consequences for the athletes. USA Swimming said it could also take possible action.

EMBARRASSMENT
During the two weeks of the Rio Games, the sporting action has been competing for headlines against a series of muggings and armed robberies of high-profile athletes and visitors in Rio de Janeiro, including two government ministers.
None created more embarrassment for Rio than Lochte's statement that a robber had at one point put a gun to Lochte's forehead and demanding the group's wallets.
Rio's police chief denounced the story on Thursday.
"There was no robbery as the swimmers described it," civil police chief Fernando Veloso told a news conference, adding that it would be noble and dignified if the swimmers were to apologize to the people of Rio.
Brazil's Presidential Chief of Staff, Eliseu Padilha, said the swimmers should be held accountable.
GloboNews reported that police were recommending prosecutors charge Lochte and Feigen with falsely reporting a crime. But a police source later told Reuters that this had not yet happened.
Bentz and Conger were interviewed at a Rio police station before heading to the airport. As they walked from the building, a waiting crowd shouted "liars" and "fakes". The pair had tried to leave Brazil on Wednesday but were pulled off their flight.
After checking in to the flight to Miami, Conger and Bentz were escorted by security to the airport lounge. Their lawyer, Sergio Riera, hugged them before they walked through customs.

CASH PAID IN COMPENSATION
Veloso, Rio's police chief, said police investigations had shown that the swimmers had broken a mirror and a soap-holder in the bathroom, adding that they then handed over a total of 100 reais ($31) and $20 in U.S. currency as compensation.
According to Lochte's account, $400 was stolen from them.
At one point, a security guard pulled a firearm after one swimmer behaved erratically, Veloso said, adding that the guard had not over-reacted: "From the moment the gun was pulled out, they calmed down. Once they were calm, the gun was lowered."
The security video, broadcast on Brazilian TV, showed three of the swimmers made to sit on the ground with their hands in the air. At one point, Lochte stands and appears to argue with the guards but is made to sit down again.
Staff at the gas station said on Thursday that the U.S. swimmers ripped an advertising plaque off a wall and urinated against the building. Security was called and an argument ensued, said one employee who declined to give his name.
A sign on one of the bathrooms read: "Please Do Not Enter".
Rio Games organizers on Thursday defended the four swimmers, saying they were just kids who made a mistake.
"They competed under gigantic pressure. Let's give these kids a break. Sometime you take actions that you later regret. They had fun, they made a mistake, life goes on," Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada told reporters.

U.S. Olympic swimmer Jimmy Feigen will pay $11,000 to a Brazilian charity to settle a dispute over what police called a fabricated story about him and his teammates being robbed at gunpoint during the Rio games, ABC News reported on Friday.
The announcement was made by Feigen's attorney, Breno Melaragno Costa, after meeting a judge and officials from the prosecuting ministry in Rio for hours, ABC News reported.
Feigen was among four U.S. swimmers shown to have lied about being stopped by gunmen posing as police in the early hours of Sunday. The U.S. Olympic Committee issued an apology over the incident.

RIO DE JANEIRO U.S. swimmers Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger arrived at Rio de Janeiro international airport and checked onto a U.S.-bound flight on Thursday night, after they were questioned by Brazilian police over an incident at a gas station.
The pair had tried to leave the country on Wednesday but were pulled from that flight by police. They and two team mates, including gold medalist Ryan Lochte, have been accused of lying to authorities and telling them that they had been robbed by gunmen posing as police.
Lochte returned to the United States on Monday. The fourth swimmer, Jimmy Feigen, remains in Brazil, police have said.

Rafa Cabrera-Bello boosted his Ryder Cup hopes with a sizzling start, earning a share of the first-round lead with American Kevin Na at the Wyndham Championship in North Carolina on Thursday.
The long-hitting Spaniard bagged an eagle and five birdies for a seven-under-par 63 in the first round at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro.
Cabrera-Bello and Na are two strokes ahead of a group of five that includes Englishman Luke Donald, whose cause was helped by a hole-in-one with a nine-iron from 163 yards at the par-three 16th.
American Jim Furyk, in his first round since carding a PGA Tour-record 58 in the final round at the Travelers 11 days ago, continued his machine-like ball-striking en route to a 66. He has hit 38 successive greens in regulation.
Cabrera-Bello received an invitation to play in Greensboro where he arrived in good form, coming off a tie for fifth at the Olympic golf in Rio.
As much as he enjoyed representing Spain, he also wants to be part of the Europe team for the Ryder Cup in six weeks.
He is currently on the borderline of earning selection, with the top nine players at the end of next week making the team automatically before captain Darren Clarke adds three more picks.
"Last week... was the first time I was really not playing for myself, just playing for my country and obviously it's a huge honor but also big responsibility and I wanted to do good and I was pleased with my result," Cabrera-Bello told reporters.
"I would have wanted to win a medal but given how it turned out it was a very good week and coming into this week, I felt the game was good."
World number 27 Cabrera-Bello said he decided to play in Greensboro this week instead of the European Tour's Czech Masters, because the stronger field offered more ranking points, and gave him a better chance to improve his Ryder Cup position.
"I also felt that it was going to be easier to travel South to North (America) than from Rio to Czech Republic, jet lag-wise," the 32-year-old added.
Cabrera-Bello is hoping to continue the Spanish success in Greensboro, where the late Seve Ballesteros won in 1978 and Sergio Garcia also lifted the Sam Snead Cup in 2012.
"Obviously an honor for me if I have a chance to put my name on a trophy where Seve and Sergio are also part of it," he said.
"Last tournament I won, two Spaniards had just won before me so if that record helps me get a little bit of luck and being in contention, then so be it, great."

RIO DE JANEIRO The week after winning his sixth career Olympic gold in Rio, U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte should have been doing a victory lap, cashing in on his performance with fresh sponsorship deals.
Instead, one of America's most decorated swimmers is accused by Brazilian police of inventing a story about an armed robbery to cover for some bad behavior at a gas station.
It could not come at a worse time for the 32-year-old.
One of his sponsors, swimwear company Speedo, said it was monitoring the situation. Another, mattress brand Airweave, was still trying to understand what had happened.
"I'm sorry about Ryan and I don't know about the situation and our position is not changing at this time," Airweave chief executive Motokuni Takaoka told Reuters.
After the Olympic cauldron is extinguished, a gold medalist only has a brief time to turn fame into commercial gain.
"That window of opportunity that you have to take advantage of your celebrity and your status is pretty small, realistically weeks," said Jim Andrews, senior vice president of sponsorship tracking firm IEG.
Lochte has said he and three team mates were robbed by gunmen early on Sunday, on their way back to the Athletes' Village from a party. Police denounced this version of events on Thursday, accusing Lochte and the others of lying.
Lochte returned to the United States on Monday, before authorities moved to prevent the four swimmers from leaving the country pending investigations into the incident - exactly the sort of high-profile scandal that the country hoped to avoid while hosting South America's first Olympic Games.
Lochte's sponsors include a small lineup of U.S. companies.
Apart from Speedo and Airweave, they include Marriott International, and Ralph Lauren Corp, according to his website.
Representatives for Marriott Rewards and Ralph Lauren could not be reached for comment on Thursday. Lochte's agent, CAA's Lowell Taub, could also not be reached for comment.
"His existing sponsors may not drop him, but they may determine that slow-playing the situation – reducing if not eliminating his presence – is the way to go," said David Carter, principal of the Sports Business Group consultancy.

ROAD TO REDEMPTION
Americans have forgiven Olympic swimmers for past indiscretions. Lochte's better-known teammate, Michael Phelps, was photographed smoking what appeared to be marijuana and arrested twice for drunk driving between Olympic appearances and he still kept a major deal with Under Armour.
But it can take time.
"He'll be toxic for a while," Gary Fechter, a lawyer with McCarter & English who has worked in corporate endorsements, said of Lochte. "Rightly or wrongly, until the full story comes out, he's tarnished."
Lochte's star peaked at the 2012 London Games where he had sponsorships with brands such as Nissan Motor Corp and AT&T that have since expired. His reality show on the E! network, "What Would Ryan Lochte Do?", was canceled in 2013.
Ahead of Rio, though, he was still one of the most recognizable faces on Team USA.
Sponsorship and endorsement deals typically include "morals clauses" that allow sponsors to terminate deals early if they feel the athlete has behaved poorly in public.
Doug Shabelman, president of Burns Entertainment, a firm that arranges endorsement deals, said that he would likely steer brands away from Lochte and toward other U.S. swimmers who did well in Rio such as Ryan Murphy, who has three gold medals.
But he said other athletes had bounced back from much worse situations and that Lochte could still repair his image.

RIO DE JANEIRO The United States grasped their second chance to reach the Olympic women's 4x100 meters final with both hands on Thursday, racing alone around the Rio track in 41.77 seconds to knock China out of the last eight.
The reigning champions appealed against the result of their morning heat, in which Allyson Felix bungled the second baton exchange, arguing that the four-times Olympic gold medalist had been bumped by a Brazilian athlete before the handover.
The appeal was upheld and the Americans were given a target of beating 42.70 seconds to qualify for the final in place of China, who were the slowest of the original finalists.
The time was easily within the capability of the world record holders and Tianna Bartoletta, Felix, English Gardner and Morolake Akinosun ensured there would be no mistake with the second fastest time of the year.
"Very relieved," Felix told reporters. "I just wasn't sure how a situation like that played out. I have never been in that situation before, but I am happy that we got a shot at it.
"I didn't want to bump anyone out of a slot but then again we were impeded."
The Chinese, who had unsuccessfully appealed against the successful American appeal, will have grounds for feeling hard done by after only being placed eighth behind the Canadians by six thousandths of a second.
The United States will join arch-rivals Jamaica, Britain, Germany, Ukraine, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago and Canada in Friday's final.
The most likely beneficiaries of the absence of the Americans would have been the Jamaicans, in particular Elaine Thompson.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce had anchored them to victory in the first heat in 41.79, opening the door for Thompson to sweep the sprint medals at the Rio Olympics.
Thompson won the 200 meters on Wednesday to add to the 100 title she took from Fraser-Pryce earlier in the week and allowing her a shot at matching Usain Bolt's feat at the last two Olympics.
"We are putting things together well but we'll have to change a few things for the final," said Jamaica's Veronica Campbell-Brown.
"There will be some changes that you will see tomorrow, Elaine will definitely be on."
The Jamaicans needed Fraser-Pryce's blistering finish to hold off Britain who were third-fastest in 41.93, ahead of Germany, who won the second heat in 42.18 after the Americans dropped out of contention.
Slow motion TV replays clearly showed Brazilian Franciela Krasucki bumping Felix just before she attempted to hand over the baton to Gardner.
A despairing Felix threw the baton in the general direction of Gardner as they approached the end of the handover zone but it missed its target and tumbled to the track.
After the initial shock, Felix had the presence of mind to get Gardner to pick it up and continue running so the team at least completed the race, albeit in last place.
"Everything was happening so quickly," the 30-year-old said.
"I knew what had happened, I knew that's not how it goes and I knew we had to finish in order to have a good shot at the appeal."

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's Presidential Chief of Staff Eliseu Padilha said on Thursday that U.S. Olympic swimmers had lied to Brazilian police about a robbery at the Rio de Janeiro Games and should be held accountable.
Rio's civil police chief, Fernando Veloso, had earlier told a news conference that U.S. gold medalists Ryan Lochte and Jimmy Feigen had lied about being robbed at gunpoint on Sunday morning along with two team mates.
Padilha also said funding was guaranteed for next month's Paralymic Games.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilian police have recommended that prosecutors bring charges against U.S. Olympic gold medalist swimmers Ryan Lochte and Jimmy Feigen for falsely reporting a crime, GloboNews television reported on Thursday.
The civil police chief of Rio de Janeiro, Fernando Veloso, had earlier told a news conference that Lochte and Feigen had lied about being robbed at gunpoint on Sunday morning along with two team mates.
The charge does not carry any prison time, Veloso said. Lochte returned to the United States on Monday, while Feigen remains in Brazil, police say.

RIO DE JANEIRO Highly-rated U.S. bantamweight Shakur Stevenson was given a walkover to an Olympic boxing final with Cuba's Robeisy Ramirez on Thursday after Russian opponent Vladimir Nikitin withdrew due to injury.
Nikitin was involved in the most controversial bout of the Games so far when he beat Ireland's world champion Michael Conlan on Tuesday in a quarter-final that triggered a storm over the new scoring system.
The withdrawal did not surprise the U.S. camp, with coach Billy Walsh quoted on Wednesday evening as saying the Russian's face was "a mess" from cuts sustained during the Conlan fight and two tough bouts before that.
Associate U.S. men's team coach Kay Koroma told reporters that they still had to plan on Thursday for the unlikely possibility of the Russian, who gets a bronze medal for his pains, turning up.
"I don't know how much we would have got out of the Russian because he's kind of beat-up a little bit," he said.
"There were rumors about it," he said. "But we stayed focused, we worked on the game plan, got there this morning and everybody was shaking his (Stevenson's) hand and saying 'congratulations, you move on to the next round'.
"And we were like 'hold on'. And then we looked at the paper and saw his (Nikitin's) name scratched out. He (Stevenson) wanted to fight but then he's like, 'man, I'm going to the finals and this is what I wanted'."
Ramirez, a southpaw who won gold at London 2012 in the flyweight category, beat Uzbekistan's Murodjon Akhmadaliev 3-0  for another shot at gold.
Stevenson has already caught the eye of visiting former professional world champion Floyd Mayweather, who is in Rio to seek out talent to promote and has apparently signed up the 19-year-old Newark, New Jersey-born boxer.
"I came all the way to Brazil to support the athletes of the United States, but while enjoying the events I had one goal in mind and that was to extend a warm welcome to Shakur Stevenson into The Money Team family," he said on Twitter, referring to his promotion company.
The middleweight final will be fought between Cuba's Arlen Lopez and Uzbekistan's Bektemir Melikuziev.
Mexico's Misael Rodriguez and Azerbaijan's Kamran Shakhsuvarly get the bronze medals.

RIO DE JANEIRO Two years after being shot in the street, stylish Cuban Julio Cesar La Cruz beat Kazakhstan's Adilbek Niyazymbetov to become his country's first light-heavyweight Olympic boxing champion on Thursday.
The 27-year-old, who was hit by a bullet above his left hip in his home town of Camaguey in 2014, completed the collection for a nation that has won gold in every other weight division over the years.
France's Mathieu Bauderlique and Britain's Joshua Buatsi took bronze medals as losing semi-finalists.
"I achieved my goal," said La Cruz, flashing a winning smile with golden canines glinting. "I am very happy to be the first in the history of Cuban boxing to win the Olympic title in the 81kg category.
"I have now won all the AIBA titles," added the triple world champion, who also won gold at last year's Pan-American Games. He dedicated his first Olympic medal to his compatriots and 90-year-old retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
The gold was Cuba's first in the ring at the Rio Games and La Cruz, fighting out of the red corner, won the first two rounds on every judge's scorecard.
He lost the verdict in the third as Niyazymbetov made more of an impression but the athletic Cuban knew he had the fight won, barring a knockout.
Relaxing his guard, hands down and almost egging his experienced opponent to take the initiative and have a go, he whipped in quick blows and darted away.
There were some boos from the sparse crowd but he shrugged them off.
"They can think what they want, I was just doing my job to win the fight," he said. "In the end it's the judges who decide and they had me as the winner unanimously. The fans can support whoever they want."
Thinking back to the shooting incident, which left him in hospital, he said he had recovered well thanks to family support.
"I feel that this medal is a reward for all the sacrifices and support," he added.
Niyazymbetov, also the silver medalist in London four years ago, had been hoping to become the second Kazakh boxing champion of the tournament after Daniyar Yeleussinov won welterweight gold on Wednesday.
He said he had mixed feelings on finishing runner-up again.
"When you are winning a silver for the second time it's a bit emotional. I've been training for four years and preparing myself for the gold medal and now I've got a silver," said the Kazakh.
Russia's 2012 light-heavyweight champion Egor Mekhontsev turned professional after the London Games.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil police could "in theory" charge a group of U.S. Olympic swimmers with giving false testimony and vandalism over an incident at a gas station in Rio de Janeiro last weekend, the head of Rio's civil police, Fernando Veloso, said on Thursday.
Police began investigating the incident after four swimmers, including gold medalists Ryan Lochte and Jimmy Feigen, said they been robbed by gunmen impersonating police officers in the early hours of Sunday, as they returned in a taxi to the Athletes' Village from a party in the city.
Veloso said there was no robbery as described by the swimmers and that they had instead offered to pay some money for damage to the gas station. Veloso did not give details on the alleged vandalism.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilian police accused a group of U.S. Olympic swimmers on Thursday of vandalism during an incident at a Rio gas station last weekend, saying they were considering whether to recommend charges against any of them.
Police began investigating the incident after four swimmers, including gold medalists Ryan Lochte and Jimmy Feigen, said they been robbed by gunmen impersonating police officers in the early hours of Sunday, as they returned in a taxi to the Athletes Village from a party in the city.

RIO DE JANEIRO/LONDON A British Olympic team athlete was involved in an incident of theft in Rio de Janeiro while returning to their accommodation, the British Olympic Association said on Thursday.
The Guardian newspaper reported a team member had been held up at gunpoint while returning from a night out and the incident had occurred early on Tuesday.
"There has been an incident of theft involving a Team GB athlete returning to their accommodation," an association spokesman said.
"All members of our delegation, including the individual concerned, are accounted for, and are safe and well," he said, without providing further details.
The incident comes after U.S. gold medallist Ryan Lochte and three team mates said they were robbed by armed men carrying police badges while travelling to the Athletes' Village in a taxi in the early hours of the morning after a party.
The incidents have stoked concerns about the safety of competitors and visitors to Rio for South America's first Games, which conclude on Aug. 21.
British track and field officials have advised athletes against going into the city, the newspaper said, referencing an email sent to athletes.
"Do not go out of the village wearing TeamGB kit or carry anything of value unless absolutely unavoidable – this makes you too big a target for theft/crime," they told athletes in the email according to the report.
"You MUST inform a member of team management if you are leaving the village and planning on staying out overnight – please do this BEFORE you leave."
"Rio is NOT a safe environment, and the level of crime has spiked in the last few days," the letter said.
"Think very carefully about whether it is worth the risk of leaving the village to celebrate after you have finished competing – BOA/UKA staff cannot guarantee your safety when away from the village/British School/British House.
"Our strong advice is that it is simply not worth the risk given the current climate in Rio."

RIO DE JANEIRO Like many black American women, Brianna Rollins, Nia Ali and Kristi Castlin have faced a good few hurdles of the metaphorical kind in their lives.
On Wednesday at the Rio Olympics, though, they successfully traversed 10 very physical barriers - 33 inches of polycarbonate and metal - to give the United States gold, silver and bronze in the 100 meters hurdles.
It was the first ever sweep of the podium in the Olympic high hurdles by women of one nation and illustrated the depth the United States have in an event where just making it through the national trials is an achievement in itself.
With world record holder Kendra Harrison and 2008 Olympic champion Dawn Harper failing to make the cut, the trio who did get their tickets to Rio decided to work together.
Gold medalist Rollins described it a "sisterhood", while Castlin added very much a 2016 twist in a phrase more often seen on social media with a hashtag in front of it.
"I think that it's just very good to be a part of this whole black girl magic movement," she said.
"We actually came into this not as individuals but as a team. We work together, we pray together and that is how we got this job done.
"It feels good to definitely be history-makers, trend-setters, moms, daughters, really just overcoming and just doing a great job and representing our country well."
Castlin dedicated her bronze medal to victims of gun crime, a cause very close to her heart after her father was murdered in a botched attempt to rob a hotel where he was the manager.
"Losing my father at the age of 12 to gun violence, I've overcome so much," said the 28-year-old. "I want to connect more with young people that have been victims of gun violence.
"I feel, when I was young, I definitely had a lot of good guidance but sometimes I didn't have someone of my age that I really could talk too."
Her fellow medalists have also had to deal with major challenges in their early lives - Ali when her father killed himself in a murder-suicide and Rollins when her father was sent to prison.
Ali's most recent challenge, though, was one faced by female athletes all over the world, getting back into world class condition after having a child.
Fifteen-month-old Titus now has two Olympic silver medalist parents as his father Michael Tinsley finished second in the 400 meters hurdles at the London Olympics.
"I knew it was going to be a difficult road back. I see mothers struggle to get their body back," said Ali.
"I'm happy that I was able to come back and come back so quickly.
"I have my son here with me and he plays a major role."

RIO DE JANEIRO German beach volleyball duo Laura Ludwig and Kira Walkenhorst took gold in the early hours of Thursday, beating Brazil in gusty conditions to win their country's first female Olympic medal in the sport and silence the partisan Copacabana crowd.
The Germans used the wind and their height advantage, with Walkenhorst's dominance at the net proving too much for Brazil's Agatha Bednarczuk and Barbara Seixas as they won 21-18 21-14 in the final that ended past midnight.
They were the second Brazilian team to lose on a night of heartbreak for the home crowd after America's Kerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross beat Larissa Franca and Talita Antunes to take bronze.
Bednarczuk and Seixas, world champions and playing on home sand, started out as favorites but the Germans quickly showed they would not be cowered by the odds or the hostile crowd.
"We worked on how to be self-confident even with this crowd," Ludwig said after the match. "The Brazilians were really loud, even I had goosebumps, it was really special."
The wind picked up just before the final, swirling around the temporary 12,000-seat arena and making playing conditions difficult. But the Germans dealt much better with the wind, serving three aces while the Brazilians faulted five times.
"There was a storm coming and I thought let's take this storm and make our own storm," Ludwig said.
The Brazilians were crestfallen not to win the country's first female beach volleyball gold since 1996, but admitted the Germans had been the better team.
"It was not good for us when the wind started," Bednarczuk said, explaining that they had struggled to adapt to the gusty conditions. "They deserved the gold medal today."
Earlier on, Walsh Jennings and Ross came from a set down to clinch the bronze.
Walsh Jennings, the sport's most successful player with three gold medals, dominated at the net during the second and third sets as the Americans overpowered Brazil's Larissa Franca and Talita Antunes 17-21 21-17 15-9.
For Walsh Jennings, it was not the fourth gold medal she had cherished, but she leaves Rio having lost only one Olympic beach volleyball match during her career, Tuesday's semi-final against Bednarczuk and Seixas.
Walsh Jennings made six blocks during the match, four of them coming in the final set, as the American showed her experience to keep cool in front of the partisan crowd that booed every U.S. serve and cheered the early Brazilian lead.

RIO DE JANEIRO Tianna Bartoletta shrugged off 100 meter disappointment to land the women's long jump gold medal on Wednesday, edging out defending Olympic champion and United States team mate Brittney Reese with a personal best leap of 7.17m.
Bartoletta, 30, the reigning world champion, produced her top mark in the fifth and penultimate round after the slow-starting Reese, who fouled with three of her first four jumps, had taken the lead with a 7.09m leap in the same round.
Reese, who has won more global long jump titles than any other woman, had one last chance to snatch gold but her final round jump of 7.15 was just shy of her compatriot's mark and she had to settle for a silver.
"I couldn't really celebrate. I kept thinking that at any moment (that) someone can jump something huge," Bartoletta told reporters.
It was the first time the U.S. had won gold and silver in the event.
"For Tianna to go out and throw up a big jump is really good and it just shows how dominant the USA is in jumps," Reese said.
"Tianna just out-jumped me this time. She deserves it and I'm just glad to be on the podium again."
Serbia's Ivana Spanovic took bronze with a national record of 7.08m.
It was a second Olympic gold medal for Bartoletta, who was part of the U.S. team who won the 4x100m sprint relay at the London 2012 Games.
She will start the defense of the relay title on Thursday after she disappointed herself by failing to make the final of the 100m earlier this week.

TRACK RETURN
Bartoletta had given up long jump to concentrate on sprinting after suffering a knee injury in 2006 but also took a break from the track after winning sprint gold at the 2012 Games, instead trying her hand at bobsleigh.
She returned to athletics in 2013 and landed her second world championship long jump title in Beijing last year, a decade after her first in Helsinki.
Also competing in Rio on Wednesday was her former training partner, Darya Klishina, Russia's only track and field athlete in Rio, who finished ninth after failing to make a mark beyond 6.63 meters.
Klishina had been carrying the medal hopes of her team mates who were excluded from the Games following revelations of state-backed doping in the country. Klishina only won an appeal against her own ban on Monday.
"I'm sure that I can jump further, just last week I didn't do good at practice ... because it was really hard mentally," she told reporters.
Russian Olympic officials told Reuters on Tuesday they were worried Klishina's performance would suffer due to the last-minute flip-flopping over her eligibility.
"Ten, fifteen years ago I couldn't imagine that my first Olympic Games would be like this. Because of the irregular situation, it was tough," Klishina said, adding she hoped the blanket ban would be lifted on Russian athletics soon.
"It's really hard for everyone," she added. "It was hard here for me without them and even harder for them at home."

Olympic and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray picked up where he left off in Rio by drubbing Argentina's Juan Monaco to take his place in the third round of the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati on Wednesday.
Murray, who with his gold medal triumph at the Rio Games became the first player to repeat as Olympic singles champion, notched his 19th successive match victory by a 6-3 6-2 margin in what amounted to a nice workout for the 29-year-old Scotsman.
The Wimbledon winner scored the first break of the opening set in the eighth game and served out the set.
After seemingly enjoying the long rallies, Murray had his right shoulder massaged on the changeover before the second set and rattled off four games in a row from 1-1 to turn it into a rout.
His victory set up a third-round match against South African Kevin Anderson with a berth in the quarter-finals at stake.
Top-seeded Murray's victory was in contrast to numerous big battles in the U.S. Open run-up event and a slew of tiebreakers.
Third-seeded Spaniard Rafa Nadal, winner of gold in the Olympic men's doubles, avenged a defeat to Pablo Cuevas in February with a 6-1 7-6(4) win over the Uruguayan.
Fourth seed Milos Raonic of Canada won a heavy artillery battle with John Isner 7-6(5) 7-6(5) for his first win after three career losses to the American.
Raonic said he had just spent 10 days in New York working with John McEnroe.
"John makes fun out of the practice, he challenges you in many ways," Raonic said. "He finds ways to point out things that I tried to bring to the match today."
Seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France enjoyed his own double tiebreaker win over American Reilly Opelka 7-6(5) 7-6(3).

MATCH CARRIED OVER
Second-seeded Swiss Stan Wawrinka overcame 18-year-old American wild card Jared Donaldson 2-6 6-3 6-4 in a match carried over from rainy Tuesday and will next face his doubles partner Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria.
Tiebreakers decided two three-set encounters.
Borna Coric, 19, of Croatia came back from 2-5 in a climactic decider against Australian Nick Kyrgios by winning five of the last six points to claim the tiebreak 8-6.
Kyrgios showed his displeasure after dropping an opening set tiebreaker by smashing three rackets during the changeover.
"You have to focus on yourself," Coric said when asked by Tennis Channel about the excitable Kyrgios. "I believe I did that unbelievably good today."
Next up for Coric is Nadal.
Steve Johnson, who with one more victory would leapfrog Isner to become the top-ranked American player, prevailed over France's Julien Benneteau 3-6 6-2 7-6(5).
Olympic bronze medalist and fifth seed Kei Nishikori of Japan, like Murray, took an easier route with a 6-3 6-2 win over Russian Mikhail Youzhny.

RIO DE JANEIRO The United States and Spain finally lived up to expectations, posting blowout wins on Wednesday to reach the semi-finals of the Olympic men's basketball tournament as France and Argentina lost much more than a game.
While the United States and Spain have struggled to reach their full potential at times on the Rio hardwood, Australia and Serbia have delivered much more than expected in also reaching the last four.
Even though the United States were the only team to finish group play without a loss, questions about their ability to claim a third straight gold swirled after three unimpressive narrow wins to close out the preliminary round.
Those questions were answered in the form of a 105-78 rout against Argentina as the U.S. extended their Olympic winning streak to 23 games.
"We got our swagger back, offensively and defensively," Team USA guard Paul George, a three-time NBA All-Star, declared to reporters.
Second-ranked Spain made a poor start to the tournament with losses to Brazil and Croatia before shifting into top gear with four straight wins, including a 92-67 victory over old foes France on Wednesday to ease into the last four.

MOUTH-WATERING SEMI-FINAL
Basketball fans can now savor the prospect of a mouth-watering semi-final between the U.S. and Spain that could double as an NBA All-Star game as both teams are stacked with NBA champions, All-Stars and most valuable players.
"This is another challenging team, so we have got to come in right," George said about Spain. "They're good. Another team full of pros.
"They have a little bit of everything. They have shooters, big men, ball handlers, scorers.
"All of those guys are pros and they have played together for a while so they have some experience."
Ranked 11th, Australia may be an underdog but they have been one of the top teams in Rio and punched above their weight on Wednesday with a 90-64 upset win over third-ranked Lithuania to close in on what would be a first ever Olympic basketball medal.
"It's another step on our journey," said Matthew Dellavedova, one of four members of the Australian squad who have NBA championship rings. "We've set the goal of winning a gold medal and today was just another step."
The next step for the close-knit Boomers is a semi-final meeting with Serbia, who came out on top after a hard-fought Balkan derby as they held off Croatia 86-83.
As France and Argentina made their quarter-final exits, they not only said goodbye to Rio but also bade farewell to standout players who put their respective countries on the basketball map.
Tony Parker, 34, confirmed after the loss that he had played his final game for France.
Just a few hours later, his 39-year-old San Antonio Spurs team mate Manu Ginobili followed suit by calling an end to his international career with Argentina.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brianna Rollins gave the United States its first track medal of the Rio Olympics when she won the 100 meters hurdles final on Wednesday, leading Nia Ali and Kristi Castlin across the line for an American podium sweep.
Favorite Rollins, who owned the fastest personal best in the field, ran an almost flawless race from lane six to add Olympic gold to her 2013 world title by a couple of paces in 12.48 seconds.
Ali was clear in second place when she crossed the line to take silver in 12.59 but Castlin, who was fourth over the final hurdle, faced a nervous wait before discovering she had done enough in the dash to the finish to take bronze in 12.61.
The trio of friends shrieked in delight and jumped up and down on the track in an embrace when the scoreboard confirmed they had secured the first Olympic podium sweep in the women's sprint hurdles.
"I knew I got the gold, I just wanted to make sure my team mates medaled as well," Rollins told reporters.
"It's like a sisterhood, Kristi and I train together and tonight we prayed together to give us the confidence we need to get us through these rounds and come out here and fulfill our dreams.
"I'm just so grateful we were able to accomplish this together."
Cindy Ofili, who was also born in the United States but has an English mother and elected to run for Britain, pushed Castlin right to the line with her best run of the year but lost out on a medal by two hundredths of a second in 12.63.

PARTY TIME
European champion Cindy Roleder of Germany was quickest out of the blocks but had to settle for fifth in 12.74, ahead of Pedrya Seymour of the Bahamas, who set a national record in the semis and was going well until she hit the penultimate barrier.
Ofili's sister Tiffany Porter, also American-born but racing for Britain, was seventh with Canada's Phylicia George finishing last.
Rollins's triumph put the United States top of the medals  table in the athletics at the Rio Games with five gold medals and 19 in total, ahead of Kenya and Jamaica on both counts.
The depth of the U.S. in the event was illustrated by the fact the world record holder Kendra Harrison and 2008 Olympic champion Dawn Harper missed the Games after failing to make the cut at the U.S. trials.
"We are just so strong, anybody in that trial was capable of winning a medal," Rollins added. "We just wanted to do our best and our best would get us on the podium."
Harrison and Harper were not the only notable absentees with world champion Danielle Williams failing to get through the Jamaican trials and Australia's Olympic champion Sally Pearson forced to withdraw from the Games with an injury.
Castlin said the three Americans who won together were now going to celebrate together.
"We are gonna have a great time, probably go out," she said. "Maybe we'll got the beach, get some dancing going, have a good time.
"Every night we are together is a girls night out."

RIO DE JANEIRO Mo Farah survived another stumble to battle through to the final of the 5,000 meters on Wednesday as the Briton remained on course for a prized Olympic distance 'double-double'.
Farah recovered from a fall to win the 10,000 gold last weekend and almost went down again on the last lap of his heat in the shorter race after being clipped by American Hassan Mead, who did fall and missed out on qualification.
An initial appeal by the Americans was rejected but a second plea, offering new video evidence, was accepted and Mead was installed in the field for Saturday's final.
Farah is seeking to become the second man after Finland's Lasse Viren in 1976 to retain both the 5,000m and 10,000m titles but said he still felt the strain of the longer race in his legs during Wednesday's run in 32 degrees Celsius heat.
"It's hot, I've just got to recover... I haven't recovered (from the 10,000m) as well as I'd wanted," Farah said.
"I got clipped, I just had to stay on my feet. But now I just have to recover, chill in my room."
Farah just about retained his balance after his stumble to qualify safely in a heat won by Ethiopian Hagos Gebrhiwet, who is likely to be one of his chief rivals in the final.
Gebrhiwet, 22, missed the 10,000m to concentrate his efforts on the shorter race after taking silver and bronze behind Farah over 5,000 in the last two world championships.
Dejen Gebremeskel, who took silver to Farah's gold in the London Olympics and also skipped the 10,000 in Rio, is also likely to challenge in the final, and qualified safely from the second heat.
Paul Chelimo, who switched allegiance from Kenya after joining the U.S. army, was the fastest qualifier, running a personal best 13 minutes 19.54 seconds, while another Kenyan-turned-American Bernard Lagat, appearing in his fifth Olympics, also advanced.
The 41-year-old Lagat won a bronze for Kenya in the 1500m at Sydney in 2000 and a silver in the same event in Athens four years later before he became an American citizen in 2005.

RIO DE JANEIRO A less experienced U.S. men's volleyball team demolished Poland in straight sets on Wednesday and moved up to the semifinals looking to avenge early upsets that almost knocked the Americans out of the Rio Games.
Brazil ousted their sport archrivals Argentina in a four-set battle in front of an ecstatic and boisterous home crowd of 10,000 at Rio's Maracanazinho stadium.
With eight of their 12 players competing in the Olympics for the first time, the United States outplayed Poland, 25-23 25-22 25-20, ousting a team that won the 2014 World Championship.
The U.S. team, formed from a crop of barely graduated college players, got off to a shaky start in Rio losing their first two games to Canada and Italy.
But they learnt fast from their mistakes and came back with a stunning win over hosts Brazil and then overpowered France to stay in Rio.
The United States will get a second crack at Italy in the semi-finals on Friday after the Italians defeated a strong Iranian team in three sets.
"I want them bad. We want a little revenge," said wing spiker Taylor Sander, among the top three U.S. scorers.
The increasingly confident Americans came into the game against Poland more aggressively than ever and appear to be reaching their best form as they enter the medal-winning phase.
"We are so aggressive, our blocks are in very good spots and defensively we are good because we are serving the ball hard," Sander told Reuters after the game.
U.S. coach John Speraw said his team were on a fast learning curve and responded immediately to some "deep" talks on their game that had given them new direction and "incredible" energy.
"We are all so new. With a team as young as they are, I had a hunch that, if we were going to reach our very best, it was going to take some adversity in this tournament," he said.
"We have made significant strides in our game and we are playing really hard," Speraw told a news conference.
"Our best is ahead of us."
Italy coach Gianlorenzo Blengini acknowledged that the United States had grown in the tournament after a bad start and would be a stronger adversary on Friday.
"They are a great team that has overcome their complicated beginning with much serenity," Blengini told reporters.
Iran lost four set points in an exciting first set and went down to Italy 31-29 25-19 25-17.
Current Olympic champions Russia eliminated Canada 3-0 and go on to face Brazil who overpowered Argentina 25-22 17-25 25-19 25-23.
Brazilian fans booed at every Argentine serve and erupted in cheers when the home team scored.
Borrowing a chant from their bitter soccer rivalry with Argentina, they sang "1,000 goals, only Pele scored 1,000 goals! Maradona is a cocaine snorter."

RIO DE JANEIRO Elaine Thompson maintained Jamaica's incredible stranglehold on Olympic sprinting on Wednesday when she added the 200 meters gold to the 100m title she collected earlier at the Rio Games, while Usain Bolt remains on course for a track 'triple-triple'.
After winning nine of the 12 sprint events in 2008 and 2012 combined, Jamaica have now won the first three in Rio and, with Bolt impressively advancing to the 200m final and their relay teams oozing talent, they could take all six.
While the days of the United States dominating sprinting are long gone, they can at least take some consolation from their own special sweep on Wednesday.
Brianna Rollins, Nia Ali and Kristi Castlin completed an unprecedented 1-2-3 in the 100m hurdles - the first gold on the track at the Rio Games for the United States.
The United States also took gold and silver in a fantastic long jump final through Tianna Bartoletta and Brittney Reese.
While Bolt is now one step away from securing a third Olympic sprint double, he had to give top billing on Wednesday to compatriot Thompson, who delivered gold in the 200 despite nursing a tight hamstring.
Thompson faced stiff opposition, particularly in the shape of Dafne Schippers, but after running a terrific bend she maintained her form to hold off the Dutchwoman and crossed the line in a season-leading 21.78.
Thompson become the first woman to win both the 100 and 200 since American Florence Griffith Joyner in 1988.
Schippers took silver and American Tori Bowie added a bronze to her silver from the 100.
There was no disputing the depth of 100m hurdles talent on the U.S. team, with world record holder Kendra Harrison and 2008 Olympic champion Dawn Harper failing to make the cut, but to take all three medals was more than they could have hoped for.
Rollins was the clear winner in 12.48 though Castlin had a nervous wait before discovering she had sneaked bronze.
In the long jump Bartoletta soared to a personal best 7.17 meters with her fifth jump to take gold, with defending champion Reese leaving it even later with a last-attempt 7.15 to snatch silver ahead of Serbia's Ivana Spanovic.
Darya Klishina, Russia's one-woman athletics team, finished ninth.

LAZY BOLT?
Bolt and Canadian Andre de Grasse set up a 200m showdown after crossing the line laughing together in their semi-final but 100m silver medalist Justin Gatlin missed out.
Bolt clocked 19.78 seconds with De Grasse claiming a Canadian record 19.80.
"He was supposed to slow down," said Bolt, who chastised himself for being lazy. "I said 'What are you doing, it's a semi-final?' But I think he wanted to push me."
Gatlin, who said he was hampered by an ankle injury, looked well placed before easing up and being overhauled by Dutchman Churandy Martina and Panama's Alonso Edward.
While Bolt remains on course for a triple-triple, Briton Mo Farah is ready to have a tilt at the distance double-double, though he had a scare when stumbling 200 meters from the end of his 5,000m semi-final.
Farah recovered from a fall to win the 10,000 earlier this week. His main rivals from East African countries also made it through to Saturday's final.
Kenya's iron grip on the men's 3,000m steeplechase continued as 21-year-old Conseslus Kipruto triumphed in an Olympic record eight minutes 3.28 seconds.
The East African nation has won every edition of the race since 1968 bar the two it missed due to political boycotts in 1976 and 1980.
Evan Jager took silver for the United while double Olympic champion Ezekiel Kemboi finished third but was disqualified for stepping out of his lane. The bronze went instead to France's Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad.
Hot favorite Caster Semenya qualified for the 800m semi-finals with ease and was immediately plunged into a new gender controversy over her reported hyperandrogeny.
Frenchwoman Justine Fedronic, who failed to advance from the heats, said that while she had sympathy for her rival's situation, her high testosterone levels meant it was not a fair fight.
"When you line up against someone like that, you know it's going to be a completely different ball game," Fedronic said.
"I do feel for her. She is just trying to train and compete just like the rest of us so that is really not fair to her. But it is not fair for others too. So I don't know what the solution is."
Olympic and world decathlon champion Ashton Eaton surged into the lead on the first day of the competition in Rio. The world record holder opened up a cushion with a 7.94m long jump and stretched it with a 46-second 400m.
Germany's Kai Kazmirek and Damian Warner of Canada, who posted an Olympic decathlon 100m best of 10.30, lead the chasing pack.


Club de Golf Chapultepec will host next year's World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship, the PGA Tour announced on Wednesday.
The March 2-5 tournament at the historic course in Mexico City will mark the first time the event has been held outside Miami, after it was held at Trump Doral for 10 years.
Australian Adam Scott won this year.
The Mexico Championship is one of four events in the WGC series, created in 1999.
"There will be plenty of tough holes that will keep the leaderboard interesting," said Rodrigo Lebois, chairman of Club de Golf Chapultepec, which opened in 1928.


RIO DE JANEIRO There will be no golden end to Tony Parker's international career, nor silver or bronze either after France bowed out of the Olympic men's basketball tournament with a whimper on Wednesday falling 92-67 to Spain.
It was hardly a suitable goodbye for the man considered the greatest French player ever and widely regarded as one of the top point guards of all-time - from any country.
"For Tony Parker he is the best French player forever," declared France coach Vincent Collet. "He was the leader we needed for a long time and I told him that I regret a lot that he has a last game like that.
"Despite this game Tony remains fantastic for the French national team and for all his achievements we must tell him thank you."
For 16 years Parker has been the face of French basketball, inspiring a generation of young Frenchmen along the way, some of them, like the "Stifle Tower" Rudy Gobert, his team mate in Rio.
In understated French style, Parker walked into the press room and with no fanfare, fireworks or hyperbole confirmed the Olympic quarter-final was his last in a French jersey.
"It was my last game, I'm not going to change my mind on that," Parker assured reporters. "I've been playing with the national team for 16 years, every summer and it takes a toll the wear and tear.
"I told the Spurs that it was going to be my last summer because I want to finish my Spurs career on a good note, I want to play another five years."
Parker's fame has grown from his work in the NBA; four championship rings with the San Antonio Spurs, an NBA Finals most valuable player award and six All-Star appearances.
But his passion has been the national team and putting French basketball "on the map" his greatest satisfaction.
The awards taken from 16 years of manning the French basketball ramparts are nearly as numerous but no less meaningful.
Parker signs off from national duty having failed to win an Olympics or world championship but there was progress. France won a bronze in the 2013 FIBA World Cup, a gold in 2013 from the Euro basketball championships and a bronze in 2005 that was the country's first medal in 50 years in that competition.
"It's mixed feelings because at the same time I am disappointed that we lost the game and I think we could have done a lot better," said Parker. "But I don't want to throw away everything we have done the last 16 years, I'm very proud of what we did on the national team.
"I told the whole team don't forget about what we accomplished in 2005 when we won the bronze medal it was 50 years since French basketball won a medal.
"We brought French basketball onto the map. As a French player I am very proud of what we did my generation."

GREENSBORO, North Carolina With the Rio Olympics in their rear view mirror, Patrick Reed and Rickie Fowler are turning their thoughts to the Ryder Cup, the main reason they are playing the Wyndham Championship starting here on Thursday.
Reed is on the borderline of qualifying for the United States team, with Fowler on the outside looking in, so now is not the time to take a week off, even after the rigors of Rio.
Reed is eighth in the U.S. standings, while Fowler is 12th.
The top eight after next week’s Barclays tournament qualify automatically for the team to take on Europe, while captain Davis Love will make four wild card selections on Sept. 25, just five days before the start of the Ryder Cup, to be held at Hazeltine outside Minneapolis.
“I’m thinking about it of course, it’s always in the back of my mind,” Reed, the 2013 Wyndham champion at Sedgefield Country Club, told reporters on Wednesday.
“Right now I’m trying to focus on playing well this week. If I take care of this week and play well next week, then I hopefully don’t have to rely on (a captain’s pick).”
Reed created a memorable impression at the 2014 Ryder Cup in Scotland, with his strong play and pugnacious attitude. He won three of his four matches on a losing team.
Last week Reed did not quite find his best form, finishing equal 11th in Rio, though he says he enjoyed the experience.
Fowler, who finished equal 37th in Rio, has also turned his focus to the Ryder Cup after immersing himself in the entire Olympic experience, including a memorable night at the swimming.
“The main reason being here is for Ryder Cup points,” said the world number eight. “It wasn’t something we planned on earlier in the year, but the Ryder Cup is something that means a lot to me.
“The game has been very close to being very good. Got a glimpse of it with the third round in Rio (shooting 64).”
Reed and Fowler are part of a strong Wyndham field that includes seven Olympians and 10 of the top 30 players on the world rankings.
Love is defending champion, while others in action include PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker, Japanese Hideki Matsuyama and “Mr 58” Jim Furyk, who shot the lowest round in PGA Tour history at the Travelers Championship two weeks ago.


GREENSBORO, North Carolina As much as Patrick Reed enjoyed the Olympic experience, he would like to see the format tweaked for Tokyo 2020.
The Rio men's golf competition last week was staged like a regular small-field tour event - 72 holes of stroke play with no team aspect.
Even though Reed was one of four Americans in Rio, they were competing against each other, not with each other and for those out of medal contention there was little on the line in the final round other than pride and a few world ranking points.
Reed would like to see 30 two-man teams in Tokyo, with the stronger nations perhaps having two teams.
“If you’re in the bottom half, you’re not really playing for anything,” world number 14 Reed said on Wednesday on the eve of the Wyndham Championship, which he won in 2013 in a playoff with Jordan Spieth.
“You’re playing for your country, but at the same time you have zero chance of getting on the podium.
“If you have two-man teams, where you have to add the score on every day, it doesn’t matter if you are six-under or six-over, you have to grind the whole time.”
Reed, who finished equal 11th in Rio, believes such a format would create more excitement, more of a team concept, more pressure on the players, and could help the Olympic competition develop a Ryder Cup-style atmosphere.
“That would be a pretty cool kind of thing, because you’re going to have someone cheering for someone.
“Last week, there’s four Americans there, we’re all cheering for each other, but really at the end of the day we’re all trying to beat each other."
Reid is one of seven Olympians who rushed back from Rio to compete in the PGA Tour event at Sedgefield Country Club, and the Olympic experience is still fresh in his mind.
While stories of chaotic transportation, crime and half-empty stadiums gave Rio something of a global public relations black eye, Reed has nothing but good memories.
“You didn’t know how things were going to be run throughout the whole week, but it was flawless,” he said.
“There was a bigger turnout than I expected with the galleries, and traveling to-and-from, the security and everything, it was awesome. You felt safe.”
As for the concerns of contracting the Zika virus, the reason several top golfers gave for skipping the Olympics, Reed said he did not see a mosquito on the course all week.


RIO DE JANEIRO France won its second team show jumping gold medal ever and its first in 40 years on Wednesday in a dramatic final round of competition featuring eliminations, last-minute horse swaps and rails toppling down.
The United States took silver after Olympic veteran Beezie Madden withdrew due to an injured horse, meaning the United States started with only three riders and was not able to drop its worst score when Lucy Davis knocked a rail down for four penalties.
Germany claimed bronze after an adrenaline-filled jump off to break a tie with Canada. Daniel Deusser, the third of four Germans to jump, sealed the deal with a swift and clean round, sparing the final team member from jumping.
France ended the two rounds of competition with three penalties for exceeding time allowed, but being the only team to leave all the rails up was enough to win.
Germany, Brazil, the Netherlands and the United States were tied with no penalties going into the final round, though of the top teams only Germany had four riders still in the competition after withdrawals from the United States and the Netherlands and an elimination for Brazil due to rough riding.
"Today we had four teams coming in clear so the idea was to step up the degree of difficulty," said Brazilian course designer Guilherme Jorge. "We also played with time allowed ... The riders have to decide if they can afford a time fault."
The competition was not all smooth sailing for France, which had a last-minute substitution, pulling in reserve Philippe Rozier after Simon Delestre, the sport's No. 2 ranked rider, withdrew his horse due to an injury four days before competition began.
"To be sure we had really bad luck in the beginning of the week with Simon's horse... that helped us fight more," said French rider Kevin Staut.
France has marked a triumphant return to the top of equestrian sports in Rio, claiming gold in eventing last week as well as individual eventing silver. It last won show jumping team gold in Montreal in 1976.
Home-team favorites Brazil finished in fifth behind Canada after all three riders still in the competition had a single rail down.
Germany's seven-time Olympic veteran Ludger Beerbaum said the drama and uncertainty of the day's competition showed a proposed rule change that would require teams of three rather than four riders was a bad idea. Three-person teams would simplify competition, with no possibility of a dropped score or of surviving a withdrawal or elimination.
"The Olympics in Rio have proven that the format of four per team could not be better," he said. "For the drama of the sport we want this roller coaster."
Wednesday also served as a third qualifier for the individual medal round on Friday. Canada's Eric Lamaze is the only rider with no penalties going into the final ride.

BERKELEY, Calif. In 70 years, most cities in the Northern Hemisphere will be unfit to host the summer Olympics due to rising temperatures associated with climate change, according to a medical journal's findings published this week.
“Our study using climate change projection shows that there will be very few cities at the end of the century that will be able to hold the summer Olympics as we know them today,” said John Balmes, a professor of public safety at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-authored the paper.
The findings, which originally appeared in the The Lancet, indicate that by 2085, only eight Northern Hemisphere cities outside of Western Europe are likely to be cool enough to host the summer Games. San Francisco would be one of just three North American cities that could serve as hosts.
The researchers used projections for the wetbulb globe temperature (WBGT), a measurement that combines temperature, humidity, heat radiation and wind, to determine the viability of potential host cities.
They focused their search in the Northern Hemisphere, home to 90 percent of the world’s population, and only considered  cities with at least 600,000 residents, the size considered necessary for hosting the Games.
The findings assumed that any city with more than a 10 percent chance of having to cancel a marathon due to temperatures exceeding 26 degrees Celsius, or 78 degrees Fahrenheit, would not be a viable venue.
“If you’re going to be spending billions of dollars to host an event, you’re going to want have a level of certainty that you’re not going to have to cancel it at the last minute,” said UC Berkeley Professor Kirk Smith, a co-author on the study.
According to the projection models, by 2085, all of the cities that are or were in contention for either the 2020 or 2024 summer Olympics, Istanbul, Madrid, Rome, Paris and Budapest, would be unfit to host the games.
Tokyo, the host of the 2020 games, would also be too hot to ensure athlete safety.
In North America, the only suitable sites would be Calgary, Vancouver and San Francisco.
“If we project out to the 22nd century, then there are only 4 cities in the world that can host the summer Olympics and that would be Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin and Belfast,” said Balmes.

RIO DE JANEIRO Reigning Olympic champion Claressa Shields of the United States made sure of another medal after reaching the women's middleweight semi-finals on Wednesday.
The 21-year-old beat Russian Yaroslava Yakushina on a unanimous points decision in her first fight of the Games after receiving a bye through the opening round.
Kazakhstan's Dariga Shakimova, who beat Morocco's Khadija Mardi in her quarter-final, now stands between her and another final.
"I would give myself an A+ if I was to look at how I reacted to my body," Shields told reporters after a fight that she never looked in danger of losing. "My body wasn't responding the way I wanted it to.
"I hit her with a lot of good jabs, a lot of good right hands...I did a good job transitioning but as far as the overall performance, about a C."
Shields has not lost since she won gold in London four years ago to become the first U.S. woman to win an Olympic boxing title. She could now become the first U.S. boxer since 1904 to win two golds.
Since London she has won two world championships and the Pan American Games.
While she said it was good to end the waiting, and she had not fought since the world championships at the end of May, she brushed aside any sense of achievement in winning a medal at two successive Games.
"Just bronze or silver, that's not my thing," she said. "I want to be a two-time Olympic gold medalist and I think I'm getting pretty close."
Shields said she had not been too concerned by a controversy over the scoring either.
"The judges can't beat God," she said. "I just prayed that he be with the judges and let the judges be fair and give the fight to the person who earned it."
The other middleweight semi-final will be between China's Li Qian, who beat Brazilian Andreia Bandeira, and Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands, who out pointed Britain's Savannah Marshall 2-0 to secure her country's first boxing medal since 1992.
The women's lightweight final will be between China's Yin Junhua, who out pointed Finland's Mira Potkonen, and France's world champion Estelle Mossely who beat Russian Anastasia Belyakova on a technical knockout.
Potkova and Belyakova both get bronze medals.

RIO DE JANEIRO Europe's top Olympic official, Ireland's Pat Hickey, on Wednesday temporarily stepped down from his position as executive board member on the International Olympic Committee, after his arrest in connection with a probe into ticket touting at the Rio Games.
"In light of this morning's developments and his ill health, Mr Hickey has taken the decision to step aside temporarily as President of the OCI (Olympic Council of Ireland) and all other Olympic functions (IOC member in Ireland, European Olympic Committee President, Association of National Olympic Committees Vice President) until this matter is fully resolved," the OCI said in a brief statement.


U.S. swimmer James Feigen told a Texas newspaper that he remained in Brazil on Wednesday after a judge there ordered him and teammate Ryan Lochte not to leave.
"I can't talk right now," Feigen told the San Antonio Express-News when contacted on Wednesday morning. "I'm still in Brazil and (an interview) is going to have to wait."
The Brazilian judge said the swimmers gave conflicting accounts of how they were robbed at gunpoint outside the Rio Olympic Games this past weekend and ordered their passports seized. Judicial sources said they believed the pair was no longer in Brazil, and Lochte's father told U.S. media his son arrived back in the United States before the order was issued.



RIO DE JANEIRO Caster Semenya qualified for the Olympic women's 800 meters semi-finals with supreme ease on Wednesday and was immediately plunged into a new gender controversy after a race rival questioned whether it was fair for her to compete.
South African Semenya will be hot favorite for Saturday's final but Frenchwoman Justine Fedronic, who failed to advance from the heats, said although she had sympathy for her rival's situation, her high testosterone levels meant it was not a fair fight.
"When you line up against someone like that, you know it's going to be a completely different ball game," Fedronic said.
"I do feel for her. She is just trying to train and compete just like the rest of us so that is really not fair to her. But it is not fair for others too. So I don't know what the solution is."
Semenya has dominated the 800m this season and there has even been speculation that she could take down Czech Jarmila Kratochvilova's 1983 record of 1 minute, 53.28 seconds - the longest standing athletics world record and widely considered to have been chemically enhanced.
Some observers consider Semenya to be also running with an unfair advantage, albeit one she can do little about.
After winning the 2009 world title as a 19-year-old, tests are reported to have revealed that she is hyperandrogenous, resulting in her body producing an abnormally high amount of testosterone, which makes her more powerful than her rivals.
An International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) rule limiting the amount of naturally occurring functional testosterone for female athletes appeared to have limited Semenya's prospects but the rule was quashed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport last year.

ROARED BACK
Semenya had struggled to rediscover the form of her breakthrough year - some blaming the dip on medication to reduce the testosterone - but this season she has roared back to her best and came to Rio unbeaten on the Diamond League circuit.
President Sebastian Coe said last week that the IAAF was considering an appeal against the CAS ruling, so this could turn out to be Semenya's last chance for Olympic glory following her silver medal four years ago.
"We'll see how the regulations will change," said Fedronic. "I think the Olympics will probably bring a lot more eyes to the issue than there have been before. It's an issue of protecting human rights, but I guess the decision is who has to be protected?"
Semenya won her heat in 1.59.31 and she said it was harder than she made it appear.
"It wasn't easy, It was pretty hot," she said. "I just tried to hang on and tried to feel my body first so I was comfortable.
"I'm not focused on any world records, I am focused on enjoying my championship and it's going to be a tough 800. Times don't matter but medals matter."
Belarusian Maryna Arzamasava and Canada's Melissa Bishop, first and second in last year's world championships, found themselves in the same heat as each other but took both automatic qualifying spots for Saturday's final with the two fastest times of the day, just under a second quicker than Semenya.
Russian duo Mariya Savinova and Ekaterina Poistogova, first and third in the London Olympics four years ago, were unable to take part in Rio due to the doping suspension on the country's athletes and have both been recommended for life bans by the World Anti-Doping Agency.









RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilian duo Barbara Seixas and Agatha Bednarczuk dished out a first ever Olympic loss to American great Kerri Walsh Jennings amid a fevered atmosphere on Copacabana beach to reach the final of the women's beach volleyball.
The Brazilians won the semi-final 22-20 21-18 after midnight on Wednesday with key saves from Seixas and big blocks by Bednarczuk too much for April Ross and 38-year-old Walsh Jennings, who was aiming for a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal in the event.
"It still hasn't sunk in what we've done, beating a player who has never lost at the Olympics," said Bednarczuk, who won the world championships last year with Seixas.
"Since the start of these Games we've been able to grow in each match, improving our concentration, our accuracy, and I think that made the difference."
Californian Walsh Jennings, nicknamed 'Six Feet of Sunshine', is a three-times world champion who was attempting to emulate long jumper Carl Lewis and discus thrower Al Oerter as the only American athletes to have won four consecutive Olympic golds in the same individual event.
But it was not meant to be as she struggled to control passes and took responsibility for the defeat, her first in 27 Olympic matches.
"It was very poor execution on my part, at the most fundamental part of the game," she said. "I put us in a hole from the start. We never gave up, but we never got our space."
The packed stands on Copacabana beach roared after every Brazilian point, the crowd backing the last local shot at gold after Germany eliminated Brazil's other team, Larissa Franca and Talita Antunes, in the other semi.
European champions Laura Ludwig and Kira Walkenhorst eased home 21-18 21-12 against the Brazilians 21-18 21-12 to become Germany's first women's team to medal in the event.
With the fans slow to fill the stadium for Tuesday's first match, the Germans seized on an unusually tranquil atmosphere to steal the opening set and walk away with the second before the Brazilian duo could hit their rhythm.
"It was really important winning the first set and we knew we had to have patience," said Ludwig. "I think I was the most nervous for this match because we were in the semi and in front of this crowd."
The final will take place later on Wednesday after the Americans play Franca and Antunes for bronze.

RIO DE JANEIRO Defeats in sports dominated by China at previous Olympics have left the country in an unfamiliar third place on the medals table, with some predicting that Rio 2016 could witness the lowest haul in two decades.
Chinese athletes have so far failed to defend gold medals in some of their strongest events, such as badminton to diving, leading the country to sit behind the United States (28 golds) and Britain (19 golds) after 11 days of competition.
"You're kidding me? The country which has never finished above China is about to," state news agency Xinhua said on its official English-language Twitter account on Monday, alongside a photo of the medals tally. The tweet has since been deleted.
The ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily expressed particular disappointment at the performance of Chinese gymnasts, winners of just two bronze medals.
"People cannot but ponder - what on earth is up with them?" it wrote.
By the end of Tuesday's events, the team had accumulated 51 medals -- 17 golds, 15 silvers and 19 bronze -- and appear highly unlikely to get anywhere near the 38 gold medals China harvested in London four years ago.
"Since China's gold opportunities are concentrated in the first half, it will be hard for China to win more than 25 golds at this year's Olympics, the lowest of the last five Olympics," the China News Service said on Sunday.
China, which sent its largest overseas delegation of 416 athletes to Rio this year, won 16 golds in 1996 and 28 in 2000. It has ended the Games in second place since 2004 and boasted of a 51-gold bonanza in 2008, its highest ever tally, when it hosted the Beijing Olympics.
The disappointments began swiftly in Rio.
On the first day, former Olympic champion shooters Du Li and Yi Siling could only claim a silver and bronze, while swimmer Sun Yang came in second in the 400 meters freestyle event and then failed to qualify for the 1,500 meter freestyle final.
He was the London Olympic champion in both events.

GOING EASY
In the men's synchronized three-meter springboard diving, Britain ended the eight-year reign of China, who took bronze. In badminton, China's formidable mixed doubles pairs and second-ranked women's doubles pair were eliminated.
The country's top sports officials had warned before the Olympics that the team faced a myriad of challenging factors, including unfamiliarity with South America, rule changes in some sports and the "diminishing dividend" of the 2008 Olympics.
"After Beijing was selected as the host city in 2001, China started a long-term talent training plan for the Games," China's General Administrator of Sport Gao Zhidan told Xinhua in July.
"The plan continues but is not as vigorous as then. That will be another challenge."
State media and internet users had already started to go easy on the athletes, who are cultivated through a sophisticated government-sponsored sports school system, after the medal haul trickled in the first few days of the Olympics.
Many commentators said that enjoying sport, rather than obsessing about gold medals, was increasingly important to China.
Reflecting this shift in expectations, a swimming bronze medalist has emerged as the biggest star of the Olympics in her homeland.
Fu Yuanhui has become a social media celebrity thanks to her candid and humorous pool-side interviews on topics ranging from menstruation to boys.
Ten million fans watched a recent interview she conducted live on a mobile app and she has been invited to appear on Chinese variety shows once back in China
"The Chinese people have made progress, we don't need gold medals to boost our confidence and are no longer as harsh on our athletes," said one user on China's Twitter-like Weibo.
"What we chase now is the gold standard Fu Yuanhui reflects in her humor and innocence."

Big-hitting John Isner and fellow American Steve Johnson did not allow long periods of rain, drizzle and mist to derail their advance at the weather-hit Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati on Tuesday.
Isner powered his way past Italian Fabio Fognini 6-3 6-2, while the bearded Johnson, fresh off his Rio Olympics bronze in the doubles, defeated Argentine left-hander Federico Delbonis
6-4 7-5 to reach the second round of the Masters 1000 event.
U.S. teenager Jared Donaldson is threatening to join them after winning the first set 6-2 against world number four Stan Wawrinka.
The 18-year-old wildcard twice broke the second seed in winning the opening set, helped by a rash of unforced errors from Wawrinka, before the Swiss settled down and swept the first three games of the second set.
Play was then called for the day with the return of more rain.
Rain through the day and into the night plagued the hardcourt run-up to the U.S. Open, leaving four men's matches and three women's contests still to finish to complete the first round.
Double Olympic gold medalist Andy Murray is waiting to face the winner of a match between Juan Monaco of Argentina and Ivo Karlovic of Croatia. Monaco leads 6-4 5-3.
American Johnson told Tennis Channel it had been a stop-start day.
"I can't keep track of how many times we stopped and started and warmed up," he added. "But I'm super happy to come out and get the win."
Johnson was hoping to build on his run in Rio where he paired with Jack Sock to medal in doubles, and took eventual gold medalist Murray of Britain to a third-set tiebreaker in the singles quarter-finals.
Another U.S. teenager tasted defeat as Russian Mikhail Youzhny dismissed 18-year-old Taylor Fritz 6-1 6-3.
The Russian qualifier advanced to a second-round match against Japan's Kei Nishikori.
Gael Monfils of France, seeded ninth, beat Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3 6-4, while his 13th-seeded compatriot Richard Gasquet battled past another Frenchman, Adrian Mannarino 7-6(2) 3-6 6-1.
Isner said he felt he might be poised to improve on a "mediocre" season.
"I had a very good serving rhythm. I'm happy with how I served," the world number 22 said. "I feel like I have begun to turn the corner a little bit."
Next up for Isner is fourth-seeded Canadian Milos Raonic, the world number six, who has lost to the American in all three of their previous meetings.


RIO DE JANEIRO China's women volleyball team upset favorites Brazil in a five-set battle on Tuesday that dashed the host nation's hopes of winning a third consecutive Olympic gold medal.
The younger Chinese team outplayed their more experienced opponents 15-25 25-23 25-22 22-25 15-13 and went through to the semi-finals where they will face the Netherlands.
Brazil, with eight players who competed in the 2012 London Games and four of them veterans from Beijing in 2008, had not dropped a single set until their quarter-final shocker against China.
China won their second gold medal in 2004 in Athens and are now on a path to a third under head coach Jenny Lang Ping, a former Chinese volleyball player who coached the United States to a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Unnerved by the loud cheering and booing of Brazilian supporters in Rio's packed Maracanazinho stadium, China took the lead in the third set with a succession of unstoppable spikes by its top scorer Zhu Ting.
Brazil fought back in the fourth but China prevailed in the fifth.
The United States crushed Japan in straight sets 25-16 25-23 25-22 to stay undefeated and boost their hopes of a first Olympic gold medal.
The Americans will meet a surprisingly strong Serbian team in the last four on Thursday. Serbia ousted Russia 25-9 25-22 25-21 to become the first Serbian volleyball team to reach an Olympic semi-final.
"We played extremely strong in attack and service, causing the Russian receivers a lot of problems," said Serbian coach Zoran Terzic.
Serbia will have to prepare for a very different game against the United States, who play much faster and more as a team than a Russian side that relies on two main attackers, Terzic told reporters.
Earlier, Netherlands beat South Korea 3-1 and will go on to play China on Thursday before Saturday's final and bronze medal matches.

RIO DE JANEIRO As Britain's track cyclists left Rio's velodrome on Tuesday with their saddle bags laden with gold, their rivals were left scratching their heads wondering just how they managed to keep peaking at the Olympics.
"Of course we are wondering," Germany's Kristina Vogel, who did stem Britain's charge by winning the women's sprint, told reporters on the final day of a memorable track program.
"It seems they do nothing for three years, then they start at the Olympics and kill us."
Yet there had been question marks over Britain's dominance of the boards this year.
A slow start to the season was followed by head coach Shane Sutton stepping down in controversial circumstances shortly after the team had begun to click at the world championships in London with titles in five of the 19 events.
Other envious nations must have hoped the British Cycling "machine" might finally have snagged its chain.
How misguided they were.
On Tuesday, Laura Trott cruised to victory in the omnium shortly before her fiance Jason Kenny rounded off a momentous six days by powering to keirin gold, his third of the Games.
In the process Trott took her Olympic medal haul to four golds from two Olympics -- more than any other British woman -- and Kenny matched British track great Chris Hoy's six golds.
And it could have been even better.
Becky James was narrowly beaten in Sunday women's sprint final by Germany's double world champion Kristina Vogel, as she was in the keirin by Dutchwoman Elis Ligtlee.
Chinese sprint duo Gong Jinjie and Zhong Tianshi won the women's team sprint in which Britain did not compete while Mark Cavendish was edged out by Elia Viviani in the men's omnium.
In all, Britain won six of the 10 titles -- just down on the seven they scooped at both Beijing and London, although their total of 11 track medals (every member of the team going home with at least one) was two more than at home four years ago.

GOT WHEELS TURNING
Kenny, who along with Callum Skinner and Philip Hindes, got the wheels turning on Thursday with a surprise win over New Zealand in the team sprint, has become the team's talisman.
"At my first Olympics in Beijing, I knew we had something special to build on," said the Englishman, who is aged just 28 and could well surpass Hoy's six-gold tally at future Games.
"We did so well in Beijing, we matched in it London. We never thought we'd get anywhere near it here, but we've turned up and done the business again."
Britain also shattered two world records in Rio. Firstly when Bradley Wiggins, now his country's most decorated Olympian with eight medals, led the team pursuit win over Australia.
Then when Trott inspired the women's quartet to gold in a world-record time in the final against a U.S. side boasting a high-tech bike specially designed to beat Britain.
Sprinter Matthew Glaetzer, part of an Australian team that went home with only a silver and a bronze, seemed baffled by Britain's ability to peak at the Olympics.
"It's hard to know. Unless there is something hidden in there or some crazy advance in technology," he said.
"But I think it's just they have done a great job in getting their athletes ready."
Vogel had suggested something untoward was behind Britain's apparent invincibility. She later back-tracked.
"I never said they take any drugs or have a bike with engines, but they always seem faster at the Games," Vogel said.
"Of course it's a question. It's crazy are we are wondering and we just want to know what they are doing. They are obviously doing something right."
The 32 million pounds budget British Cycling received for the Rio Olympics -- dwarfing the amounts available to teams such as the U.S. and Australia -- helps.
Britain, with a total Olympic medal haul of 71, have now surpassed France (66) as the all-time leading track cycling medal winners.
No stone is left unturned to find the "marginal gains" former team boss Dave Brailsford was once obsessed about.
Iain Dyer, the man appointed as head coach by Sutton, said it was down to the athletes and forward planning.
"First of all, we have outstanding athletes," said Dyer. "When you look at the times we have set on what is not a particularly fast track, it serves to highlight how good they were here.
"Then we target the Olympics. We set ourselves up to be successful every four years. If you aim to peak every four years, it needs to be a bloody good peak -- otherwise it's just a pimple."

RIO DE JANEIRO World champion Dafne Schippers laid down a marker to indicate that the Dutch woman remains favorite to add the Olympic 200 meters crown to her list of honors after setting the fastest time in the semi-finals on Tuesday.
The former heptathlete started well and ran a magnificent bend on her way to an impressive 21.96 seconds in the first semi-final, finishing comfortably ahead of Jamaica's 100m gold medal winner Elaine Thompson, who ran a season's best 22.13.
Schippers, who was a disappointing fifth in Saturday's 100m final after setting her sights on two individual medals in Rio, said she still had plenty left in the tank in her bid to back up last year's magnificent world championship triumph in Beijing.
"I didn't run at a full 100 percent. I saw my rivals were falling a bit behind, so I could relax at the end," the 24-year-old told reporters. "You can't really save too much energy in a semi-final anyway."
American Tori Bowie, who took silver in the 100m, matched Thompson's time to win the third heat in 22.13, edging Michelle-Lee Ahye of Trinidad and Tobago, who ran 22.25 to also advance to Wednesday's final.
Marie-Josee Ta Lou of the Ivory Coast won the second semi-final in a personal-best time of 22.28, ahead of Bulgaria's Ivet Lalova-Collio, who ran a season-best 22.42.
American Deajah Stevens (22.38) and Briton Dina Asher-Smith (22.49) will complete the eight-woman final line-up after the pair advanced as fastest losers behind Schippers in the first heat.

RIO DE JANEIRO Asia's stranglehold over world badminton loosened on Tuesday as two gritty Danish women toppled a Chinese dynasty and gave Europe hope of a first Olympic title in 20 years.
Veterans Christinna Pedersen and Kamilla Rytter Juhl stunned China's world number two pair Yu Yang and Tang Yuanting 21-16 14-21 21-19 to reach the women's doubles final and secure Denmark a first medal in the event.
Spanish world champion Carolina Marin then humbled South Korea's Sung Ji-hyun 21-12 21-16 to book a semi-final in the women's singles.
No European shuttler has topped the Olympic podium since Danish great Poul-Erik Hoyer Larsen floored China's Dong Jiong in the men's singles at Atlanta in 1996.
But Pedersen and Rytter Juhl are well-positioned to end the drought, despite a tough assignment against Japan's top seeds Misaki Matsutomo and Ayaka Takahashi in Thursday's decider.
"We have been dreaming about this for so long," beamed 32-year-old Rytter Juhl.
"It means a lot. Maybe this was our last chance at the Olympics -- we are not getting younger ... So of course we are so happy to get a medal."
By knocking out the last Chinese pair, the Danes ended the Asian superpower's 20-year tyranny over Olympic women's doubles.
In the final match of the evening watched by a threadbare crowd, Zhang Nan and Zhao Yunlei thrashed Xu Chen and Ma Jin in an all-China clash for the mixed doubles bronze, but it was scant consolation.
The badminton superpower had hoped to defend its clean sweep of all five titles at London but their champions have been repeatedly foiled and the rest of the world has caught up.
"It seems like Europe is starting to go up and it's really important that it isn't Chinese always in the final," world number one Marin laughed.
An hyper-aggressive, yelping force, the flamenco-trained dancer from Andalucia was too fleet-footed for seventh-ranked Sung and will hope to stamp all over China's reigning champion Li Xuerui in Thursday's mouthwatering semi-final.
World number three Li is the last woman standing for China, with London silver medalist Wang Yihan upset 22-20 21-19 by India's Sindhu Pusarla in a riveting contest.
The 21-year-old Hyderabadi will face Japan's Nozomi Okuhara for a place in the title-decider.
China are assured of at least silver in the men's doubles, however, after London champion Fu Haifeng and Zhang Nan ended the dream run of Britons' Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge in the semi-finals with a 21-14 21-18 win.
Fu and Zhang will vie for gold against the fired-up Malaysian pair of Goh V. Shem and Tan Wee Kiong who played out of their skins to defeat China's Chai Biao and Hong Wei 21-18 12-21 21-17.
The 12th-ranked Malaysians gave their nation another chance to win its first ever Olympic gold after compatriots Chan Peng Soon and Goh Liu Ying won their mixed doubles semi-final on Monday.
Chan and Goh will strive for the long-awaited title on Wednesday against Indonesia's Tontowi Ahmad and Liliyana Natsir.

RIO DE JANEIRO The United States steamrolled to their 47th straight Olympic win on Tuesday, routing Japan 110-64 to reach the semi-finals of the women's basketball tournament and taking a step closer to a sixth consecutive gold medal.
With an overall record of 64-3, Olympic losses are rare for the U.S. but Japan could lay claim to one of them.
History, however, was of little help to the 16th-ranked Japanese who were going up against a powerhouse that has outscored opponents by a staggering 44.6 points per game, on average, in Rio.
As it has been all tournament, U.S. scoring was done by committee with seven players hitting double figures, led by Diana Taurasi and Maya Moore with 19 points apiece.
"That (Japan) is a good team and they make you work," Taurasi told reporters. "The first half they were running us ragged a little bit.
"That was probably one of the toughest teams I have played against at an Olympics.
"They have got a system of playing that I am really familiar with and their style of game puts a lot of pressure on you as a team and we felt that pressure in the first half."
It took the Americans nearly a full half to get their bearings, but once they did the result was predictable as U.S. shooters found their range, pouring in over 100 points for the fifth time in six games.
With two minutes to go in the opening half, energetic Japan had worked their up-tempo style to perfection, cutting the Olympic champions' lead to 46-44, but the U.S. finished with a flurry, going on a 10-2 run to ease into the second half with a 10-point lead that would only grow.
As dominant as the U.S. have been, head coach Geno Auriemma issued an ominous warning that people have not seen the best of his team yet.
"They are improving every minute of every day," said Auriemma. "We keep improving, there is no chance we peak too soon.
"It will be a month when the tournament ends that we have been together. Everything is fresh and moving in the right direction."
The U.S. will now await the winner of Canada and France, who play later on Tuesday, while the other semi-final will feature Serbia and Spain.
Serbia had earlier upset second-ranked Australia 73-71 while Anna Cruz hit a last gasp buzzer-beater to lift Spain over Turkey 64-62.

RIO DE JANEIRO Britain's Jason Kenny won the men's track cycling keirin on Tuesday, taking his gold medal haul to six and equaling Chris Hoy's record for the country's most Olympic titles.
In a race that was controversially restarted twice without disqualifying any riders, Kenny ultimately had too much pace down the final stretch, recovering from a slow start to finish just clear.
It was his third triumph in Rio, having won in the team sprint and the men's sprint before the keirin.
After taking gold, Kenny embraced his fiance and fellow gold medal winner Laura Trott, who was in tears in the center of the track. Hoy, the sprint cyclist great whose record haul Kenny matched, cheered from the balcony.
"It just felt like a dream. I guess I'm tired. I was just floating through it," Kenny said.
Matthijs Buchli of the Netherlands won silver and Malaysia's Azizulhasni Awang took bronze.
The final was twice stopped after riders were judged to have overtaken too soon the back wheel of the electric bike that sets the pace in early laps.
Usually the riders responsible are disqualified, but on Tuesday, after minutes of tense deliberation, the race was restarted with all six cyclists. The second time, again no riders were disqualified.
That was fortunate for Kenny, who along with Awang was at the front when the gun was fired to stop the first race.
"I think it was the right decision to put everyone back in, obviously I was happy to be put back in," Kenny said.
British head coach Iain Dyer said the infraction had been too close to call, even supplying officials with Team GB footage showing no clear error had been made.
Dyer said officials did not have a camera with a side-on view and the British footage was also used in the decision not to disqualify German rider Joachim Eilers after the second race was halted for the same infraction.
By the time the race got underway for a third time, a tense quiet hung over the Rio velodrome.
Kenny appeared to hang back as the electric bike slipped aside, perhaps wary of triggering another restart.
As the riders spun into the final lap Kenny, the world's fastest sprinter, found another level and burst clear of the rest of the pack just before the line.
Still sweating after the race, Kenny declined to be drawn on his plans for the future but hinted he was not quite ready to get off the bike.
"It's possible to win more," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO No one would have guessed that Simone Biles' "legs felt like rocks" as the standout gymnast of the 2016 Olympics soared higher and higher to win a record-equaling fourth gold on Tuesday.
A day after a slipped foot off the balance beam dashed the American's hopes of leaving Rio with a record haul of five golds for a female gymnast, she was back to her hip-shaking best to clinch the floor title with 15.966 points, ahead of team mate Aly Raisman.
Biles was not the only one making amends for near misses and past disappointments on the final day of competition.
Oleg Verniaiev buried the heartache of losing the all-around gold to Kohei Uchimura by just 0.099 of a point as he earned Ukraine their first gold in Rio by winning the parallel bars title with a score of 16.041.
After a bronze and silver at the last two Olympics,  flamboyant showman Fabian Hambuechen was finally leaping with joy as he became the first German gymnast in 20 years to strike gold with an electrifying routine on the horizontal bar.
It was not just those who were standing on the top of the podium who were celebrating at the Rio Games on Tuesday.
Danell Leyva left his coach and step-father Yin Alvarez theatrically sprinting down the dugout and exchanging high-fives with gray-suited officials as the 24-year-old picked up two silvers behind Verniaiev and Hambuechen.
For Leyva, the medals were especially gratifying because had team mate John Orozco not suffered a knee injury in the run-up to the Games, he would never have received the last minute call-up that made him the most successful American man in Rio.
"You have to believe within yourself that you can do more than what people expect," summed up Leyva.
When it comes to Biles, however, those expectations have no boundaries.

FIVE-GOLD DREAM DISAPPEARED
Hence when her five-gold dream disappeared on Monday after she had to grab the beam with both hands to avoid slipping off completely, there was a sense of anti-climax hanging in the air even though she had already won three golds.
If the 19-year-old could not have a gymnastics record outright, there was no way she was going to miss out on at least having a share of a landmark.
A sultry floor routine full of hip-swinging moves to samba music had the Brazilian spectators on their feet as Biles flew high into the air to execute her trademark element, a soaring double layout with half-twist at the end.
She was so high off the floor, that her rivals would have needed to grow wings if they wanted to catch her -- and even then it would not have been enough.
Cries of "oohs" and "aahs" accompanied each of her complex tumbling passes, she drew gasps of admiration as she balanced her entire body weight on her right toes while spinning around twice and had the audience roaring their approval as she bounced her bottom off the floor to strike her final pose.
The ear-to-ear grin, which had disappeared on Monday after she ended up with bronze on the beam, was back on show again as she became the first woman in 32 years, and fifth overall, to win four golds at a single Games.
"It's very crazy. To think what I've done, it's been an amazing experience and I don't think I could be more proud of myself," said the team, all-around, vault and floor champion.
So was she disappointed on missing out on the outright record?
"Your first Olympics you walk away with five medals, that's not tough at all," said Biles. "Especially four being gold, that's just unheard of. I'm very proud."
The Soviet Union's Larisa Latynina (Melbourne 1956), Hungary's Agnes Keleti (Melbourne 1956), Czech Vera Caslavska (Mexico City 1968) and Romania's Ecaterina Szabo (Los Angeles 1984) were the only other women to have four golds at a single Games.

RIO DE JANEIRO Four years after tasting Olympic victory, "Flying Dutchman" Epke Zonderland came crashing to earth on Tuesday when he lost his grip on the horizontal bar and tumbled flat on his face - yet somehow still managed to pick himself up.
Zonderland blamed faulty timing for the moment of cruel drama in the gymnastics arena that caused him to plunge to the mat, drawing gasps from the crowd. He lay there face downward for several seconds, his legs splayed out behind him.
Some spectators must have assumed that Zonderland, one of the favorites, would simply drop out of the competition. But after a few moments he stood up, relaunched his routine and performed it successfully, drawing one of the warmest ovations for any of the eight competitors.
"I timed it a little bit wrong. I almost got it and I thought I had it, that's why I tried to stick on the bar but I slipped away and I fell on my tummy," Zonderland said afterwards, still able to muster a smile for reporters.
Asked what had kept him going, he replied: "Maybe the thought that in theory it's possible to still get a medal if your routine will be perfect and the other guys fail. But in my head I actually knew it was done."
The 30-year-old, who finished seventh, said he had been oblivious to the reaction of the spectators.
"I had no idea. I was just thinking about my back because it hurt, of course. I had no time to think about anything else."
He drew a sympathetic reaction from his rivals, as Germany's Fabian Hambuechen took the gold medal, American Danell Leyva the silver and Britain's Nile Wilson bronze.
"I was hoping he was all right. It seemed to look quite painful when he landed on the mat. I was just hoping his back was OK," said Wilson, who performed immediately afterwards.
"He's a legend of the sport, reigning Olympic champion. I was watching four years ago what he was doing, back home. Today I was competing after him and wining a medal in the same final, so I'm in dreamland," he said.
Asked about the support from his peers, Zonderland was philosophical but matter-of-fact: "Yes they feel sorry for me, but that's gymnastics."

RIO DE JANEIRO Montenegro put an early end to the medal bid of water polo powerhouse Hungary on Tuesday, clinching a spot in the semi-finals in a thrilling penalty shootout.
Also advancing were world champions Serbia, Croatia and Italy.
Hungary's men's team, the most successful in the sport's 116-year Olympic history, had arrived in Rio de Janeiro seeking to put things right after failing to reach the podium at the 2012 London Games.
The Hungarians, who have won gold nine times in previous Games, managed to battle back from an 5-3 deficit at halftime, leveling the score at 9-9 late in the fourth quarter.
In the decisive penalty shootout, however, Montenegro got the upper hand. Their goalkeeper Milos Scepanovic, 33, had shown lightning-fast reflexes to make dazzling blocks throughout the game and saved two shots in the shootout, which ended 4-2 in Montenegro's favor.
Scepanovic, who logged an impressive 13 total saves, said he blamed himself for allowing Hungary to score the late equalizing goal in regular time and felt under pressure to prove himself during the shootout.
"I was really upset because that last goal was my fault," he said. "I just didn't want to ruin a beautiful game. I'm so proud of the saves."
Through the group-round play, Hungary had shown they could hang with the best, drawing against Serbia in the first game.
Montenegro, in their 10-year history playing as a national team, have repeatedly demonstrated that they are not to be trifled with. They took second place to Serbia in this year's European championship, where Hungary placed third.
Montenegro - which before the 2008 Games had played as part of the Serbia-Montenegro team - is anxious for its first men's water polo Olympic medal as an independent team after finishing fourth in both London and Beijing.
In the second quarter-final match, a Serbian team that have dominated world water polo in recent years, and badly wants their first Olympic gold, scored their first convincing win of the Games, extending a 7-3 lead at halftime to finish off Spain 10-7.
Serbia's typically stalwart defense had looked distracted early in their five group phase games, forcing the team to mount late come-backs to squeeze through to the quarter-finals.
"I think we had concentration, especially on defense, from the very first moment until the last second," said team captain Zivko Gocic of the win against Spain. "It was the key of today's victory."
Croatia, the gold medal winner in London, also advanced by overcoming host country Brazil 10-6; Italy clinched a spot in the semi-finals with a 9-5 win over Greece.
On Thursday, Montenegro will play Croatia for a chance to advance to Saturday's gold medal match, while Serbia faces Italy.

RIO DE JANEIRO An "empty brain" contributed to China leaving Rio without any gymnastics gold medals, its worst showing since returning to the Games in 1984, after three competitors missed out on podium places on Tuesday.
China, usually a major player in the sport, claimed only two medals in gymnastics in Rio: bronze for its men's and women's teams. It was a long fall from the 2008 Beijing Games when it dominated the sport as host and claimed both the men's and women's team titles.
Deng Shudi, who finished just out of the medals in fourth in the parallel bars final on Tuesday, said the pressure was high going into the competition.
"I didn't get to sleep until 2 or 3 a.m... I just couldn't fall asleep," he said. "I just don't know what happened. My brain is empty."
Things got worse. Immediately after Deng finished his routine, You Hao ended China's competition in the men's events by completing his parallel bars dismount with a fall and finishing last.
China's sports system had been enormously successful since the country returned to the Olympic fold in 1984, culminating with the host nation topping the medals table at the 2008 Games it hosted with only a slight dip into second place behind the United States in London four years later.
Japan ended their Asian rivals' eight-year reign as Olympic men's team champions last week even after China had come out of qualifying on top.
The Chinese team, comprising of Deng, You, Lin Chaopan, Zhang Chenglong and Liu Yang sat back dejectedly in their chairs after Russia took silver, with Zhang breaking down in tears afterwards backstage.
That bronze was the men's only gymnastics medal in Rio. China won seven out of eight men's golds in Beijing eight years ago.
Though she looked pleased with her performance, Wang Yan, 16, finished fifth in the women's floor final that followed the parallel bars on Tuesday.
The women's competition has been dominated by the United States, who claimed the team title, and American Simone Biles who won a record-equaling fourth gold on Tuesday.
China took four gymnastics gold medals in London in 2012, when its women won gold and silver on the balance beam.
The country did not participate in the Olympics between 1956 and 1984.

RIO DE JANEIRO Ukrainian Oleg Verniaiev made up for narrowly missing out on the all-around gymnastics title by winning the parallel bars gold at the Olympics on Tuesday.
Verniaiev, who came agonizingly close to ending the all around reign of Japan's Kohei Uchimura before missing out on gold by just 0.099 of a point, finally got his hands on the top prize by winning the bars with a score of 16.041.
He beat American silver medalist Danell Leyva by 0.141 of a point. Russia's David Belyavskiy had to settle for bronze.
World champion You Hao and Deng Shudi completed a forgettable Olympics for the Chinese men's gymnastics team as they will leave Rio without a top prize after both finished out of the medals.
But there was no doubting who was number one as Verniaiev waved a raised index finger to the crowd long before the judges confirmed his score, giving Ukraine its first gold medal at these Games.
"At last we've brought the first gold medal to Ukraine. It's been cool and I still can't relax, I'm so thrilled," said Verniaiev, who missed out on a chance to win a third medal when he landed on his hand and knees from his horizontal bar dismount.
"I knew the two Chinese were very strong, Leyva was strong, but basically you just go out and do your thing."
Traveling the bars end-to-end, Verniaiev swung into a series of handstands. Such was the difficulty packed into his routine that he managed to breach the 16-point barrier despite his legs wavering considerably on one of the handstands.
Once he nailed his dismount, he fell into the arms of his delighted coach.
However, it was Leyva's stepfather and coach, Yin Alvarez, who provided the real entertainment with his theatrical celebrations on the final day of competition.
Alvarez wildly sprinted up and down the dugout with a raised fist as soon as Leyva had completed his routine with a double front dismount. But with seven more competitors to go after Leyva, Alvarez faced an anxious wait to see if his stepson's score of 15.900 would be good enough for a medal.
Once he realized it was, he was off sprinting again along the dugout.
Alvarez's joy was in sharp contrast to the utter dejection felt by world champion You.
His routine had the highest difficulty rating of 7.400 among the eight finalists and when he swung into 10 rigidly straight handstands, it seemed as if he would finally end China's wait for a gymnastics gold in Rio.
But after launching into his double front somersault with half twist dismount, he crouched down on his landing before his feet simply gave away and he fell backwards.
All his hard work amounted to nothing and he finished last with 14.833. Deng missed out on bronze by 0.017 of a point.
Deng summed up China's misery.
"I don't know what happened. My brain is empty," he said.
The nation that captured seven out of eight men's golds in Beijing eight years ago will be leaving Rio with a solitary bronze medal they won in the team competition. Their female counterparts also won only one team bronze.
Since returning to the Olympics in 1984, it was the first time the Asian powerhouse failed to win a gymnastics gold.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russian synchronised swimming stars Natalia Ishchenko and Svetlana Romashina's near-flawless routines have long had fans joking they are secretly mermaids or have gills.
In Tuesday's free routine final at the Rio 2016 Olympics, the duet at least pretended to.
Wearing scale-inspired swimsuits and batting their lean legs out of the water, feet sticking out to look like tails, they collected gold - as expected - and came even closer to sealing their status as sirens.
"Sometimes everyone calls us mermaids and asks us if we have gills, so we are really comfortable in this performance," said Romashina after their routine, as she took bobby pins out of her heavily gelled-back hair.
The Russians earned a final score of 194.9910, while China's pair Huang Xuechen and Sun Wenyan pocketed silver with 192.3688. Japan's Yukiko Inui and Risako Mitsui took bronze with 188.0547.
Russians, bringing a tradition of ballet to the pool, have taken home the Olympic gold for duets since Sydney in 2000, earning a reputation for extreme precision and ever more creative choreographies.
The mermaid routine was so special for the Russian pair, which also won gold at London 2012, that they had the enticing music specially written for the Games.
But the Russian dynamo's future in the water is not clear: After Rio, Ishchenko and Romashina said they would take a "short break" to think about whether to continue.
Their retirement would likely inspire rivals who for years have felt silver and bronze were the only medals up for grabs.
"They're superhuman!" said France's Laura Auge, after completing an athletic routine to the beat of African drumming with partner Margaux Chretien.
"When we see them in training, we wonder how it's possible to do what they do," she added by the side of the pool.
Unfortunately for their competitors, the Russian stars won’t be sharing tips any time soon.
"It's our secret!" joked Romashina.

RIO DE JANEIRO Bahamian Shaunae Miller launched herself over the finishing line with a desperate dive to pip American Allyson Felix to Olympic 400 meters gold by the slimmest of margins in a thrilling final on Monday.
After literally flying across the line in a personal best time of 49.44 seconds, the 22-year-old lay on the track, shaken up and exhausted, as she waited for the scoreboard to confirm she had clinched her first major title.
"I didn't see anyone until the last 20 meters and the only thing I was thinking was that I must get that gold medal," said Miller.
"I think (the dive) was just a reaction, my mind went blank, the next thing I knew I was lying on the ground. I've got a few cuts and bruises but I'm okay.
"This is the moment I have been waiting for. I am just so happy, so grateful, such emotions I just can't say."
SLIDESHOW: Shaunae Miller dives for 400m gold
Felix, who finished in 49.51, was also on the floor after failing to claim her fifth Olympic gold medal, let alone the 200-400 double she had originally planned for the Rio Games.
"Disappointment," said the 30-year-old, struggling to hold back her tears. "It's been a tough one and I really hoped it would come together tonight.
"I just gave it all I had, I don't think I had anything left to give. I feel emotionally and physically drained at this moment. I really wanted it, it's painful."
Felix was denied the chance to defend her 200m title, and bid for an unprecedented double, after failing to finish in the top three at the U.S trials while suffering the effects of an ankle injury she suffered in a gym accident earlier this year.
The Californian's silver medal was, though, her seventh in four Games, the most of any American female track and field athlete at the Olympics.
Silver medalist in the 200m in Athens in 2004 and again in Beijing four years later, Felix won her only individual gold over the half-lap in London in 2012. She has also won three relay golds and could add to that tally in Brazil.
Second behind Felix in the 400 meters at the world championships in Beijing last year when her strong finish was not enough to rein in the American, Miller had clearly learned her lesson.
She exploded out of the blocks in lane seven and went for broke, her long stride giving her a good lead on the back straight as the shorter Felix powered away inside her.
Miller retained the lead coming off the final bend but started tightening up as Felix surged about 50 meters from the line and the pair were neck-and-neck until the Bahamian's gold medal-winning dive.
Jamaica's Shericka Jackson took bronze in 49.85 ahead of Americans Natasha Hastings (50.34) and Phyllis Francis (50.41) in fourth and fifth.
 
LONDON Lee Westwood believes he has gone some way towards satisfying Darren Clarke after Europe's Ryder Cup captain told his close friend at the start of the year to play consistently well in order to be selected.
Westwood was 50th in the world rankings at the end of 2015 but has inched his way up to 43rd going into this week's Czech Masters in Prague, the penultimate points-counting event for next month's Ryder Cup at Hazeltine, Minnesota.
The 43-year-old Englishman first played in the biennial team event in 1997 and is hoping to represent Europe for the 10th successive time.
"I've had lots of conversations with Darren and he said at the start of the year, 'show me some form'," Westwood told www.europeantour.com.
"I've played pretty well over the year, second in the U.S. Masters, a few other top-10s, played well in the majors, played pretty good at the U.S. Open so I just want to try and keep playing well and be in form should I get picked for the Ryder Cup."
Westwood is outside the top nine automatic qualifying places for the match against the United States that starts on Sept. 30 but he is sure to be in Clarke's thoughts as one of the three wildcard choices.
The Northern Irishman handed Westwood a pick for the EurAsia Cup this year and the veteran did not disappoint, picking up three points out of three as Europe beat Asia by 18 1/2 points to 5 1/2 in Kuala Lumpur.
Europe are almost certain to have five debutants, Danny Willett, Chris Wood, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Andy Sullivan and Matt Fitzpatrick, in their side at Hazeltine and Westwood said it would be important to have some experience too.
"If you look at the balance of the team, there are a lot of rookies," said the former world number one.
"It's difficult if you're playing on home soil with that many rookies but going and playing in the States is even harder. It's a tough atmosphere to play in and it's always nice if you've got a few people on the team with a bit of experience."

Cathy Lanier, who has served as Washington, D.C.'s first female police chief since 2007, announced on Tuesday she will step down next month to oversee security for the National Football League.
As the NFL's chief security officer, Lanier, 49, will supervise security efforts for all 32 teams as well as for major events like the Super Bowl, the league said in a statement.
"Cathy joins us with a well-deserved reputation of being a tremendous communicator, innovator and relationship builder," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.
Lanier has spent 26 years with the 3,700-member Metropolitan Police Department. Her last day will be Sept. 17.
At a news conference at police headquarters on Tuesday, Lanier referred to her background as a high school dropout who joined the police department as a patrol officer in 1990 after earning a high-school equivalency diploma.
"Now I have two master's degrees," she said. "I owe my life to this city, the residents and this department."
Mayor Muriel Bowser, who said she would name an interim replacement within a few days, praised Lanier for overseeing a 23 percent reduction in violent crime while improving the department's relations with the community.
"She will leave a tremendous legacy here," Bowser said.
Lanier built a visible public profile, making frequent television appearances and holding numerous meetings with community leaders, to whom she gave her cellphone number so they could reach her day and night.
More recently, the department implemented a body camera program, as police officers around the country have seen increasing scrutiny amid racial tensions.
Despite lower crime rates overall, Lanier drew some criticism after a spike in murders last year. A Washington Post poll in November found her approval rating had dropped to 61 percent from 71 percent a year earlier.
Lanier was one of 10 female police chiefs among the 68 largest city departments in the United States, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association.

RIO DE JANEIRO Joao Havelange, head of soccer's ruling body FIFA from 1974 to 1998 and a former member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), died in a Rio de Janeiro hospital on Tuesday at the age of 100.
"During his 24 years as president ... football became truly global, reaching new territories and bringing the game to all corners of the world," current FIFA head Gianni Infantino said in a statement.
"Something the whole football community should be grateful for. I extend my condolences to his family."
Havelange, who has died during the Olympic Games being staged in his home city of Rio de Janeiro, oversaw a transformation of FIFA and its flagship World Cup competition into a multi-million dollar enterprise.
However, his reign was marred by allegations of corruption and he resigned as honorary president three years ago after a FIFA Ethics Committee report said he had taken bribes from the now-defunct sports marketing company ISL over an eight-year period.
Havelange, a former Olympic swimmer and water polo player for Brazil, has been in and out of hospital in recent months with respiratory problems.
Sepp Blatter, who served as Havelange's secretary general for 17 years before taking over from the Brazilian as president, said "football owes him a huge debt of gratitude".
"His ambition was to make football a global game, calling it the universal language. He succeeded," said Blatter whose career also ended in disgrace last year when he was banned for six years for ethics violations.

PERSONAL HONOR
"I had the personal honour of following him on his quest, helping to develop FIFA into the organisation it is today.
"Thanks to Joao Havelange, football is the world's leading sport, not only from a social, cultural and economic perspective but also in terms of its political impact."
Born to Belgian immigrants, Havelange represented Brazil in the 400 and 1500 meters freestyle swimming events at the 1936 Games and played for his country's water polo team 16 years later.
He became the first non-European president of FIFA when he defeated Englishman Stanley Rous in an election in 1974.
Before that Havelange was president of the Brazilian Football Confederation for 15 years during which time his country won the World Cup three times.
He was a member of the IOC from 1963 until he quit in 2011 through ill-health.
Havelange's resignation came just days before an IOC ethics hearing over his links with ISL.
Rio Games spokesman Mario Andrada said on Tuesday: "Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and Brazilian flags will be kept at half-mast".
The Estadio Joao Havelange venue in Rio, where many Olympic events are being staged, was named in his honor.

DUBLIN Rory McIlroy's Irish Open win earlier this year raised almost one million euros ($1.13 million) for three children's charities thanks to a donation by the Northern Irishman's Foundation.
"While winning the Irish Open meant a lot to me, being able to give my prize money to three local children's charities made it all feel much more special," the world number five said in a news release on Tuesday.
"I can think of no charities as worthy or deserving of support than Barretstown, the Jack and Jill Foundation and LauraLynn Children's Hospice."
Four-times major winner McIlroy shot a closing 69 to finish three shots clear of Scotland's Russell Knox and Welshman Bradley Dredge at the K Club on the outskirts of Dublin in May.
"This 317,000 euros donation (for each charity) from the Rory Foundation is literally a gift of time to the families under our wing," said Jack and Jill Foundation chief executive Jonathan Irwin.


Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski will be honored with farewell matches after announcing their retirement from international duty, according to a statement by the German Football Association.
Schweinsteiger revealed his intention to end his international career after winning his 120th cap in Germany's Euro 2016 semi-final defeat by France in July, and will have a final opportunity to say goodbye to supporters against Finland in Moenchengladbach on Aug. 31.
Podolski announced that he no longer wanted to be considered for international selection in a post on his official Instagram account on Monday (poldi_official), although due to a ankle injury, the date of his farewell match has not yet been confirmed.
"I know it means a lot for them to play for Germany one more time," German manager Joachim Loew told the federation's official website. (www.dfb.de) "This proves how much the team meant and still means to them."
Both players were part of Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning squad. Podolski is Germany's third most-capped player with 129 appearances; Schweinsteiger has made 120.

Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has confirmed that more new faces will arrive at the Nou Camp this transfer window while some  squad members will be sold.The Spanish champions have recruited Andre Gomes, Samuel Umtiti, Lucas Digne and Denis Suarez since the end of last season while Marc Bartra, Thomas Vermaelen, Adriano Correia and Sandro Ramirez have departed.
"I believe that players will come and some players will leave," Luis Enrique said in Tuesday's news conference.
Sports daily Marca reported that Manchester City had reached an agreement with Barca to buy goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who made 32 league appearances for the Catalans last season and that Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves would replace Bravo at the Nou Camp.
Bravo, the Chile captain, faces stiff competition from Germany international Marc-Andre ter Stegen to be the club's first-choice keeper while Jordi Masip is also contending for more playing time.
"All the players want to be starters," Luis Enrique said. "But no one has come to me to tell me that because they don't have to."
When asked how he was managing the goalkeeping situation, Luis Enrique said: "I've just told them (Stegen and Bravo) not to knock themselves with the goal posts or the net, the rest is up to them...
"I just want three goalkeepers in my first team."
Barca, who won La Liga and the King's Cup last season, are still looking to reinforce their formidable front line led by Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar.
However, Luis Enrique said: "There are many rumors circulating and I'm not going to get into it. Our focus right now is on Wednesday's final."
Barca host Sevilla in the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday holding a 2-0 advantage from the opening leg.


RIO DE JANEIRO South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk ran the fastest single lap in history to win the Olympic 400 meters gold medal in 43.03 seconds and break Michael Johnson's 17-year-old world record on Sunday.
Running an extraordinary race in lane eight, the 24-year-old world champion got off to a flier and was streaking clear on the back straight before upping his pace even further to better American Johnson's 1999 mark of 43.18 seconds.
"I believed I could get the world record," Van Niekerk told reporters. "I've dreamed of this medal since forever. I am blessed."
The South African flew across the line a good five meters ahead of 2012 champion Kirani James and held his hands to his head in disbelief before being embraced by the Grenadian, who took silver in 43.76.
"I'm happy to be part of a race that made history," James said. "We have put this sport on a pedestal."
LaShawn Merritt of the United States, the 2008 Olympic champion, claimed bronze in 43.85, the first time the top three had run under 44 seconds in the one-lap Olympic final.
"It was a crazy race, a great moment in history," said Merritt, who was unable to defend his title in London after suffering a hamstring injury in the heats.
"The world record was broken, the best man won."
American Johnson, who won back-to-back Olympic titles in the event in 1996 and 2000 and is considered one of the greatest sprinters of all time, was dumbfounded by the quality of Van Niekerk's finish.
"Oh my God! From lane eight, a world record," Johnson said on  the BBC. "He took it out so quick. I have never seen anything from 200 to 400 like that."
Van Niekerk marked himself as the leading contender for Rio when he led home Merritt and James with an exceptional run to win gold at last year's world championships in Beijing, where the podium again all ran under 44 seconds.
This year, he became the first sprinter to run the 100 below 10 seconds, 200 under 20 seconds and 400 in less than 44 seconds before deciding to concentrate on the longest distance in Brazil.

RIO DE JANEIRO The epicenter for one of the biggest media operations at the Rio Olympics is a 75,000 sq feet (6,970 sq meters) maze of windowless rooms lit by thousands of monitors that serves as the backbone of NBC's exhaustive Olympics coverage.
    Just one product of it is Michael Phelps' death stare that dominated social media the first week of the Games. NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp, was able to beam online athletes preparing in "ready rooms" at some of the Games' biggest events with newly installed cameras.
Rio is the ninth consecutive Games for NBC, which has the U.S. Olympic rights for the next 16 years.
Viewers' habits keep changing, with more searching for Olympics news online or through social media, fragmenting the traditional prime time audience that advertisers still pay a premium for.
The company has honed its own game plan with thousands of workers returning every Olympics. Its challenge is to meet new needs without unraveling a trusted system that has worked for so long.
"The sheer quantity of clips on mobile and tablets and the live streams add a lot of complexity," said David Mazza, NBC Sports and Olympics chief technical officer, pointing to a rack of equipment making it possible for editors in NBC's broadcast center in Stamford, Connecticut, to cut clips to be shared online.
He called the Rio operation 25 percent more complex than the broadcast from London in 2012.
    A wall diagram near him shows 132 feeds being sent back to the States, including all of the streaming video, signals for Telemundo routing back to Miami and a Golf Channel feed headed for Orlando.
Most of the raw feed comes from the Olympic Broadcast Services, although NBC supplements the events most popular with U.S. audiences like swimming, gymnastics and athletics with its own cameras.
The U.S. television network ships its gear from one Games to the next. When the Games are over in Rio, it will pack 30 shipping containers full of TV monitors, furniture, catering supplies and the like and send it immediately to South Korea for the 2018 Winter Games.
    "It took 60 days of build, will have 25 days of usage and in 20 days, it'll be dead empty," Mazza said.

NEAR DISASTER
NBC said there were a lot of close calls this year. Two-thirds of the power went out in Olympic park two weeks before the games. Then, a week before the opening ceremony, one of its four circuits transmitting the TV signal back to the United States failed. The next day, two more went down, which Mazza said was "terrifying."
After the Games started, one of its generators died on Copacabana during the beach volleyball and NBC had to run with no backup power that night since it took several hours and a crane to get a new one.
"We generally have four plans. Sometimes you never do plan A or B, often times you'll start with plan C and hopefully not plan D," Mazza said.

VIEWERSHIP
Overall viewership on the main NBC broadcast network is down from the Games four years ago in London. Jim Bell, NBC's Olympics executive producer, said it's not accurate to compare the primetime broadcast numbers because viewers are watching the Games online or on different cable channels at the same time.
    "We all sit there and quibble, what are the metrics, what is the engagement? To pick this metric or that metric is an incomplete snapshot of what’s gone on here. We're streaming it. We're monetizing it. We're winning cable. We're winning broadcast. We're dominating social," Bell said.
    NBC expects its revenue-sharing deals with young media companies such as Snapchat for the Olympics to pay off and for the Olympics to boost its own long-term digital efforts.
The NBC Sports' app saw a 60 percent boost in NHL streaming after the Sochi Winter Games in 2014, according to Rick Cordella, NBC Sports Group's general manager of Digital Media.

HELSINKI Six volleyball players from the Cuban national team have been charged with aggravated rape in Finland, regional prosecutors said in a statement on Tuesday.
The suspected rape occurred in July in the city of Tampere, at the hotel where the team was staying. The Cuba team were in Finland playing in a World League tournament prior to the Rio Olympics.
Finnish police initially detained eight players, but released two of them who are no longer suspects. A court ordered six suspects to remain in custody while the investigation continued. All six men have denied the charge.
The Cuban team decided to compete in the Rio Olympics despite the detention of their players in Finland, but lost all their five games.

RIO DE JANEIRO Thiago da Silva won Brazil's first athletics gold of their home Games on an extraordinary, unforgettable Monday night in Rio, producing an Olympic record of 6.03 meters in the pole vault to beat hot favorite Renaud Lavillenie and send the fans into raptures.
A roar to match anything from Sunday's 100 meters final - produced by a crowd a quarter of the size - accompanied the 22-year-old as he sailed over the bar, leaving the French world record holder and defending champion one more chance to beat him.
Lavillenie failed and Brazil had a new, and totally unexpected, hero and their first male athletics gold medal winner since Joaquim Cruz won the 800 meters in 1984.
"The gold - incredible," said Da Silva, who came into the Games with a best of 5.93. "My first time over six meters. My home town wanted me to win.
"The crowd were cheering me too much. I had to fix my mind on my technique, forget the people."
There had already been drama aplenty on a night dogged by heavy rain that caused a brief suspension of action.
David Rudisha and Shaunae Miller showed that there are different ways to cross the line first, but their gold medals will be the same after thrilling 800 and 400 meters finals.
Kenya's Rudisha, who won the 800m in world record style four years ago, delivered a dominant last lap, striding home majestically to become the first man since New Zealander Peter Snell in 1964 to successfully defend the 800m title.
Bahamian Miller, conversely, was tying up desperately but hurled herself across the line, crashing to the track in the process, to just get the nod ahead of American Allyson Felix.
There were also golds for Poland's Anita Wlodarczyk, with a world record in the women's hammer and 19-year-old Ruth Jebet of Bahrain via Kenya in the women's 3,000m steeplechase.
After the drama of Usain Bolt on Sunday, it looked as if the combination of a poor crowd and heavy rain would produce a flat atmosphere just 24 hours later.

FOCUS OF ATTENTION
The pole vault, so often the forgotten event of athletics as it chugs on relentlessly in the background with all the attention on the track, gradually became the prime focus when the crowd realized that the man in green kept clearing.
One by one Da Silva's rivals dropped off but the odds were still stacked heavily in favor of Lavillenie, whose world record of 6.16m meant his final attempt at 6.08 was well within range, despite two failures at 6.03.
Brazilians may have been criticized for not being the most sophisticated athletics fans in the world but they knew what was going on enough to take the roof off the Olympic Stadium when the Frenchman failed - though he was unimpressed by their booing as he made his preparations.
"There was no fair play from the public," Lavillenie said. "It is for football, not track and field.
"For the Olympics it is not a good image. I did nothing to the Brazilians."
Da Silva's heroics somewhat overshadowed another imperious display by Rudisha, who two months ago was struggling badly with injuries.
He bided his time on Monday and then took control just as he did when at his peak to come home in 1.42.15.
Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi took silver while fast-finishing American Clayton Murphy grabbed bronze.
In the morning session, Wlodarczyk underscored her total dominance of the women's hammer with a world record of 82.29 meters to win gold by a massive 5.54 meters.
Wlodarczyk now has the eight longest throws in history and is the only woman to clear 80 meters.
"I thought, 'this is that day'," she said. "It was worth giving it a go because you never know if it's going to happen again - parents in the stands, fans cheering... I think I'm the happiest woman in the world right now."
Bolt begins the second leg of his triple-triple on Tuesday when he runs in the 200m heats in the morning.
The highlights of the evening session include the 110m hurdles final and the final of the women's 1,500m, which four years ago was so ravaged by doping that it has since replaced the 1988 100 meters final as the "Dirtiest Race In History".

RIO DE JANEIRO Kenya's David Rudisha obliterated his rivals in the 800 meters final on Monday to become the first man since 1964 to retain his Olympic title over the distance.
Rudisha, the world champion and world record holder, stormed to victory with a devastating final-lap sprint that cemented his place among the greats such as New Zealand's Peter Snell, the last man to successfully defend an 800m Olympic gold.
Nicknamed 'King David' in Kenya, Rudisha hit top gear in the final 300 meters to surge ahead of his rivals with his trademark finishing kick and win gold in a season's best time of one minute 42.15 seconds.
"I am so excited. It is the greatest moment of my career," Rudisha told reporters.
After winning his first Olympic gold and setting a world record at the 2012 London Games, Rudisha suffered a couple of injury-ravaged years that dented his confidence and caused him to miss the 2013 world championships.
He struggled for much of the current season and came third in national Olympic trials but the 6-foot-3-inch Maasai runner looked in total control of the Rio Games final as his long stride and fluid running style propelled him to victory.
"It's been very difficult," Rudisha said, referring to his injuries. "I have stayed focused and positive. My coach has been great and given me hope."
The 27-year-old crossed the line several meters ahead of Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi, the London Games gold medal winner over 1,500m.
Makhloufi said the silver medal boosted his confidence ahead of the 1,500m event later this week.
"I am so happy to make my country proud," he said. "I dedicate this to the poor people."
Fast-finishing American Clayton Murphy set a personal best time to take bronze ahead of France's Pierre-Ambroise Bosse.
"When I saw I could get bronze, I just kept pushing," said Murphy, who was delighted to have raced against Rudisha.
"He is somebody I've looked up to since he broke the world record. It was an honor to race him."

BEIJING China's anti-doping agency said on Tuesday that the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) has approved the resumption of testing operations at a Beijing laboratory amid allegations of drug use by some of the country's swimmers.
WADA had suspended the accreditation of Beijing's national anti-doping laboratory in April, weeks after launching a probe into drugs allegations in Chinese swimming.
"Effective immediately, the Beijing anti-dumping laboratory has resumed comprehensive anti-doping testing operations," the center said in a short statement on its website.
The center said it had received a notice from WADA confirming it had met the agency's technical requirements, but did not elaborate.
Following WADA's suspension of the agency, state news agency Xinhua had quoted the laboratory as saying that false negative results were caused by "technical errors" because it had yet to update testing methods.
China's anti-doping program has been under scrutiny following a British newspaper report that alleged Chinese swimming had covered up positive drugs tests ahead of Olympic trials for the Rio de Janeiro Games.
The country's anti-doping agency courted controversy in 2014 after keeping a three-month drugs ban handed to Chinese Olympic swimmer Sun Yang under wraps for six months.
Last week, the Chinese Swimming Association said another Olympic swimmer, Chen Xinyi, had failed a doping test at the Rio Games.

RIO DE JANEIRO The Russian runner who helped expose a system of state-backed doping in her country says she fears for her life and has been forced to move after hackers tried to find her location.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said on Saturday Yulia Stepanova's online doping management account had been illegally accessed. The doping scandal she lifted the lid on has rocked sport and cost over 100 Russians their place at the Rio Games.
Stepanova has been in hiding in the United States with her husband Vitaly, a former Russian anti-doping official, after giving evidence that the Russian government for years facilitated widespread cheating across nearly all Olympic sports.
Speaking to journalists on a video conference call just days before the 800 meters final in Rio, which she has been barred from running in following the suspension of Russian track-and-field from international competition, Stepanova said she had moved her family to another location after the hack.
"The only reason somebody would hack an ADAMS account is to find out your exact location," she said. "We decided it was safer to relocate.
"If something happens to us then you should know that it is not an accident."
All athletes have to enter their details into WADA's Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) and register a time and location each day where they can be reached by doping testers for an out-of-competition test.
Stepanova and her husband have repeatedly raised concerns about their safety in light of the doping scandal they helped ignite and criticized the International Olympic Committee for not doing more to support whistleblowers.
Vitaly Stepanov said he did not know who had hacked his wife's account but said the couple were being watched by Russian authorities.
After she initially fled Russia for Germany, Russian sports officials said they did not know about any threats against Stepanova or her husband that could have compelled them to seek refuge abroad.
Stepanova said attending the Games - she and her husband declined an invitation from Olympic bosses to visit as spectators - would have left her particularly vulnerable.
General worries about safety and violent crime have cast a pall over the Rio Olympics. Most recently, U.S. gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte was robbed at gunpoint by men posing as police officers.
"Watching the Olympic Games and reading the news about what is happening there, on some level I'm glad that I didn't go," she said. "If someone wanted to hurt us, it would be very easy to do it there."

RIO DE JANEIRO The United States secured a berth in the quarter-finals of the men's Olympic volleyball tournament by defeating Mexico on Monday, while an ecstatic home crowd roared Brazil on to the next round with a 3-1 win over France.
The United States, gold medalists in Beijing in 2008, clawed their way back from the brink of elimination in Rio after losing their first two games to Canada and Italy.
They began the turnaround with a 3-1 win over Brazil, beat France by the same score, then defeated Mexico (25-23 25-11 25-19) in their last preliminary game to set up a quarter-final against Poland.
"The big challenge was having such emotional matches the previous two and being able to summon those emotional reserves and come out and to bring that again," said U.S. coach John Speraw.
Brazil sent France home after recording a 25-22 22-25 25-20 25-23 win at Rio's packed Maracanazinho stadium, where Brazilian supporters booed every French serve and roared with delight when the home team scored.
"The champions are back," the crowd chanted of Brazil, Olympic gold medalists at the 2004 Athens Games.
French coach Laurent Tillie said his team made too many mistakes on their serve.
"We were up against a very good team. We fought and tried to find our way tactically, but Brazil made no mistakes at the end of the sets," he told Reuters.
Tillie said the crowd was noisy but fair and France had enjoyed the sporting atmosphere.
Brazil, beaten finalists at the last two Olympics, face sporting arch-rivals Argentina in the quarters. Defending champions Russia play Canada and Italy play Iran.
Canada defeated group leaders Italy 3-1 on Monday.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilians Alison Cerutti and Bruno Schmidt moved one step closer to a men's Olympic beach volleyball gold medal, beating Nicholas Lucena and Phil Dalhausser of the United States in a thrilling quarter-final on Monday.
The wind picked up just before the match, tearing banners from the scaffolding at the front of the arena, but the Brazilians handled the conditions better to win 21-14 12-21 15-9 in front of an ecstatic Copacabana crowd.
"The strategy was to use the wind... We started the third set hard, put on early pressure and it worked for us," Schmidt told reporters.
This was a match that many thought would be the final, but an upset in the pool stages meant Brazil qualified as a second seed and entered the same side of the competition as the unbeaten Americans.
In a powerful and aggressive performance, Cerutti and Schmidt dived about the sand, hustling for every point and thriving on a raucous home crowd that chanted throughout.
Cerutti lived up to his nickname "the mammoth", throwing his heavy-set two-meter frame into a sequence of point-winning spikes and blocks.
Repeatedly, he demanded more from the crowd, waving his arms to the sky.
"The fans are our third player... that's what's making the difference for us," Cerutti said. "That was a game deserving of an Olympic final."
For the Americans it was an unfortunate end to a strong campaign, going out without a medal in the quarter-finals.
"They handled the wind better than us, that's basically the difference," Dalhausser said. "It was really tough conditions and I'm impressed with how well they did with it."
Brazil will now play Alexander Brouwer and Robert Meeuwsen of the Netherlands in the semi-finals on Tuesday after they beat fellow Dutchmen Reinder Nummerdor and Christiaan Varenhorst 25-23 21-17.





RIO DE JANEIRO U.S. coach Billy Walsh questioned the judging after his lightweight Mikaela Mayer lost her quarter-final on points to Russian Anastasia Beliakova at the Rio Games on Monday.
"To be honest, I've just had a look at the judging. It was crazy," Walsh told reporters. "Are they looking at the same bloody fight or what?
"Her performance was excellent, she gave everything she had ... I thought she did enough to win it."
The judges' tallies showed that one had scored the fight as a 38-38 draw while the other two came down 39-37 on the side of the Russian, who won 2-0 and is now assured of a bronze medal for reaching the last four.
All three judges awarded at least one round to Mayer, however.
Mayer, one of two U.S. women in the Rio boxing tournament with the other being reigning middleweight champion Claressa Shields, felt she could have swung it with a few more combinations.
"It was a close fight so it makes it even more disappointing," she said.
"I thought I might have pulled it off at the end but ... I also know this is boxing. If you let a fight get that close, you don't know who they are going to give it to."

RIO DE JANEIRO Reigning Olympic pole vault champion Jenn Suhr has contracted a serious virus in Rio de Janeiro that could affect her jumping, her husband and coach Rick Suhr said on Twitter on Monday.
The American has no plans to withdraw from the competition which begins with the qualifying round on Tuesday.
"Jenn has fallen ill, quite ill in the last two days," Rick Suhr said. "This morning it has really kicked in, she has lost her voice almost completely."
Suhr said his wife, 34, had picked up a virus in Rio and it has caused respiratory complications.
"Seems so unfair. We came here in the greatest shape of our life. Four years of total dedication eaten up in one nasty virus that is only getting worse," he said.
"Hoping that the antibiotics and other meds given by our doctors help but this does not look good."

Current world number one Jason Day and former world number one Adam Scott will form a powerful two-man Australian team for the World Cup of Golf in November.
They will be playing at home in the 58th staging of the event, to be held at Kingston Heath in Melbourne from November 23-27.
Day and Scott will be defending champions, after winning the event at Royal Melbourne in 2013. The World Cup was not played in 2014 or 2015.
Other highly ranked players committed to taking part include American Bubba Watson, English pair Danny Willett and Lee Westwood, Japanese ace Hideki Matsuyama and Scottish talent Russell Knox.
The highest ranked player from each of the 28 participating countries has until August 26 to select his playing partner, with Watson among those yet to announce his team mate.
The announcement by the PGA Tour on Monday of some of the prominent participants comes one day after Briton Justin Rose clinched the Olympic men's golf gold medal.
Day and Scott were among a number of highly ranked players who skipped Rio.
Day cited fears of contracting the Zika virus, while Scott was the first player to announce he would not play, because he does not think golf belongs in the Olympics.


RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilian police searched on Monday for the driver of a taxi in which U.S. gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte and three team mates were robbed at gunpoint, as authorities stepped up security in Rio de Janeiro after a spate of incidents.
The swimmers were returning to the Athletes' Village in the early hours of Sunday after a party hosted by the French Games delegation when armed men carrying police badges pulled them over. The gunmen ordered them to drop to the ground and demanded their wallets and belongings, Lochte said.
When he refused, one of the men cocked a pistol and placed it against the swimmer's head. He then handed over his wallet.
"We apologize to those involved and once again we regret the fact that violence is an issue in these Games," said Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio 2016 organizing committee.
"We have requested that authorities make sure that people are safe everywhere in the city."
There was initially confusion over the incident.
International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams told a news conference that the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) had denied the robbery took place. However, the USOC swiftly did an about-turn and confirmed it took place.
Organizers suggested it had been difficult to confirm the information early on Sunday because the swimmers were still asleep after the ordeal.
Police said on Sunday they were investigating the incident, which has raised concern over the safety of competitors and fans in Rio. The city of more than six million people has a long history of violent crime linked to the impoverished slums that cling to the hills overlooking its golden beaches.
"The police spoke to some of the athletes yesterday and the police are looking for the cab driver who drove them back to get more information," Andrada said.
Thirty-two-year-old Lochte, among the most successful male swimmers in Olympic history, said he had initially refused to get to the ground when ordered by the men.
"I was like, we didn't do anything wrong, so I'm not getting down on the ground," Lochte said in the interview broadcast on Monday on the "Today" show. "And then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead."
At that point, Lochte said he complied.
"I put my hands up, and was like, 'Whatever.'"
The gunmen stole their cash and wallets, he said. They let the swimmers keep their cell phones and credentials.
Lochte has won a career 12 Olympic medals, six of them gold, behind team mate Michael Phelps's 28 medals, including 23 golds.
The robbery of one of the Games' most celebrated athletes - together with team mates Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen - has fed concern over safety at the first Olympic Games in South America.
In addition to the swimmers, Swedish tourists were briefly abducted when they visited a slum, Portugal's visiting education minister was robbed at knife point, bullets flew into the equestrian center and a Games bus was attacked with stones.
Police shot dead a man outside the Games opening ceremony in the Maracana stadium when he attempted to rob a bystander.
With 85,000 police and soldiers deployed to provide security, roughly twice the number for London 2012, authorities have said they can ensure the safety of everyone at the Games.
After months of concerns in the run-up to the Games over late delivery of infrastructure, the Games themselves have been plagued by logistical problems, including poor signage, delays to transport links and the discoloration of the diving pool.
On Monday, an overhead TV camera fell to the ground in the Olympic Park, slightly injuring two people.

RIO DE JANEIRO Doping cheats using designer drugs or gene doping at the Rio Olympics should know they will eventually be found out, the International Olympic Committee said on Monday.
The Rio Games are taking place under the cloud of doping with the Russian track and field team virtually excluded after a state-backed systematic doping program was revealed, and three more athletes having tested positive since the opening of the Games village on July 24.
But that may not be the end of the story and about 6,000 tests, both urine and blood, will be stored by the IOC for a decade to allow for re-testing, using new technology, and the detection of substances that were not yet known at the time.
"We will store the samples. We can be very confident that an athlete who is cheating should be very scared," IOC medical chief Richard Budgett told reporters.
He said athletes guilty of gene doping or using the so-called designer drugs -- more sophisticated forms of performance-enhancing drugs -- will be caught.
"If someone thinks they have designer drugs eventually they will be found," he said. "The message for all those cheats out there is 'beware you will be caught.'
"I am confident we have the deterrents that should lead to the protection of clean athletes."
Targeted re-tests from the Beijing 2008 and the London 2012 Games recently yielded an additional 98 positive samples for banned substances with none of those athletes able to compete in Rio.
A test for gene doping would also be used in a matter of months after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) approved it recently.
Budgett did not want to say whether the Rio Games would be drugs-free but he said he was confident over time the cheats would be discovered.
"I am a medical man fundamentally so we always doubt everything. That is our job. So I think it is right we always investigate. But it is unfortunate that we doubt every fantastic performance. That's why we test the top five athletes. You can never know."



Pep Guardiola is impressed with what he has seen from Yaya Toure and Joe Hart in training ahead of Manchester City's Champions League playoff against Steaua Bucharest, even though the pair face uncertain futures at the Etihad Stadium.
Toure, 33, has not traveled with the City squad to Romania for Tuesday's match, having also been omitted from the squad for Guardiola's Premier League debut win over Sunderland this weekend.
England number one Hart was replaced in the starting lineup by Willy Caballero on Saturday, and while he has made the trip, speculation about his future has intensified in the British media.
"(Toure) is training amazing but I was not sure he was going to play so I would prefer him to stay in Manchester," Guardiola told reporters on Monday, explaining his decision to overlook the Ivory Coast international.
The player's agent, Dimitri Seluk, said on Monday that his client was keen to stay at City.
Guardiola also praised Hart, but refused to deny reports in the British media that he is lining up a move for Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo as a replacement for the 29-year-old.
"Since I have been Manchester City manager and we have been together, Joe has been perfect, a great professional," Guardiola said.
"It's not the moment to talk about players who are not in Manchester City and in another club," he added. "I won't talk about transfers before such an important match in our season."

RIO DE JANEIRO Poland's Anita Wlodarczyk underlined her absolute dominance of the women's hammer by throwing a world record 82.29 metres to win the Rio Olympic gold by an incredible 554 centimetres on Monday.
The only woman to have thrown the hammer further than 80 metres, the 31-year-old world champion had already broken the Olympic record with a second throw of 80.40 when she entered the ring for the third time.
Whipping the hammer around her body eight times before launching it into the sunny morning sky, Wlodarczyk was screaming in delight before the ball even pitched on the grass of the infield, well beyond the 80 metre tape.
It was far enough to better the mark of 81.08 she set in Cetniewo in Poland this month, as was her fifth throw of 81.74.
"Competition of my life," she told Poland's TVP. "After the first round I knew that I would get the gold medal and after the second one I went for it all. Massacre.
"I think that no one made such a surprise during Olympics. I was close to beating the record for the second time. I didn't want to hold back.
"I thought, this is that day. It was worth giving it a go, because you never know if it's going to happen again - parents in the stands, fans cheering ... I think I'm the happiest woman in the world right now."
Unbeaten since June 2014, Wlodarczyk now owns the 11 best throws of all time. Her winning margin was by far the largest in the history of the women's event.
She was the second Pole to win the title after Kamila Skolimowska, who won the inaugural women's hammer at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 before dying at the age of 26 of a pulmonary embolism while training.
"Everyone thought I'd win the gold medal," said Wlodarczyk. "But the best thing for me is the world record, because I talked a lot about it.
"I didn't fail the fans, I didn't fail Poland so that's just great. It's time to celebrate."
Wlodarczyk finished runner-up to Tatyana Lysenko at the London Games four years ago but the Russian was unable to defend her title in Rio after being banned for doping for the second time in her career earlier this year.
China's Zhang Wenxiu threw 76.75 to add a silver medal to the bronze she won on home soil at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Former world junior champion Sophie Hitchon was third with a British record 74.54 from her final throw to claim a first medal for her country in the women's hammer.
"To get a bronze medal, I am over the moon. I didn't expect that I would hold third, I just wanted to throw further," the comparatively diminutive Hitchon said.
"I had to double take a little bit. It was just incredible to see the number three there and a national record, I couldn't be happier."
Betty Heidler of Germany, the 32-year-old former world champion and world record holder, finished fourth with a best throw of 73.71.

The sound of a whistle signals the start of the race, and Rob Hogan sprints toward the first of 18 legs in his contest: a golf tee. He takes a quick look at the fairway, then hits a drive, grabs his bag and runs toward his next shot, a process he repeats until he makes it the green.
A game of 18 holes would usually take golfers about four hours. Hogan's round of 82 strokes lasted just 36 minutes and 59 seconds, retaining his title in a somewhat unusual contest -- the British Open Speedgolf Championships.
A golf club is southern England hosted the competition at the weekend, drawing both men and women. The players began individually at intervals, carried a maximum seven clubs and could putt leaving the flagstick in the hole. Buggies and caddies were not allowed.
Otherwise, the rules differed little from golf's standard rules. The final score combined total shots and time to complete the 18-hole round -- Hogan got 118:59.
"Just hit the ball as fast as you can, run as fast as you can and get in and chill out," he said when asked for playing tips.
The world championships take place in the United States in October.
"One of the problems people find with golf is that it takes up too much time," participant Tom Pinnegar said. "This way you can tee off at 9 o'clock and you've got the rest of the day."

RIO DE JANEIRO Teenager Ruth Jebet won Bahrain's first ever Olympic gold medal on Monday, blowing away the competition in the women's 3,000 meters steeplechase but narrowly missing out on the world record.
The 19-year-old stormed into the lead after a few laps and set a blistering pace to win in eight minutes 59.75 seconds, shy of the 8:58.81 world record set by Russia's Gulnara Galkina at the 2008 Beijing Games.
"I admit it was too easy for me but nobody told me about the record. I wanted the gold medal," Jebet said.
Galkina and Kenyan-born Jebet, who was the world junior champion, are the only two women to have run a sub-nine minute time.
Kenya's Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi, who won the world title in Beijing last year, was almost 50 meters behind in second place.
"I am so happy," said Jepkemoi. "The last two laps were really hard. I just tried to stay strong and see if I could catch her."
American Emma Coburn won United States' first ever medal in the steeplechase as she grabbed bronze and a new national record.
"I feel very honored," Coburn said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Win or lose, Usain Bolt was always going to dominate the Olympic headlines on Sunday but Wayde van Niekerk offered his embattled sport some hope for the future beyond the Jamaican's retirement with a stunning world record on the Rio track.
Twenty minutes before Bolt won his third successive 100 meters title, the South African ran at an unrelenting pace to clinch the gold medal and break Michael Johnson's 17-year-old 400 meters record in a time of 43.03 seconds.
It was the oldest standing men's sprint record - Bolt owns the 100 and 200 meters marks, - and one many thought might never be broken.
"I believed it was possible," the 24-year-old said. "I am just glad things went my way tonight.
"I'm still a bit amazed, I still have to pinch myself with what just happened."
Van Niekerk's achievement was all the more remarkable for the fact that he ran in lane eight, the outside lane where it is impossible to see any of your rivals.
"I don't think any athlete wants to be in lane eight but I figured it (has) advantages as well as disadvantages," he said.
"You have the perfect opportunity to go out as if you are in training and go as hard as you can."
Van Niekerk has been training with Bolt's team this year and the Jamaican, who has said he will retire after the world championships in London next year, ran over to congratulate him after finishing the 100 meters.
"When he got the world record I was like, wow!" Bolt, who   gave up the 400 meters because he did not like the training, told reporters.
"I told him in Jamaica 'my coach said you're probably the only guy right now other than me who can break this 400m world record'.
"I'm really happy for him, I'm really proud of him."
Van Niekerk, who also won the world title last year, said he was just happy to be at his first Olympics alongside the likes of Bolt, who he described as the "king of the sprints".
"I'm just really grateful that I'm part of this generation of athletics, just keeping the sport alive," he said.
"I use these guys as inspiration and motivation but I've now got a chance to build my own legacy, my own journey and story, hopefully I can inspire other South Africans and athletes around the world to go out and do their thing."
Van Niekerk watched the last Olympics at home on television but had a straightforward message for anyone who suggested his remarkable progress in the last four years was down to doping.
"I know I'm not, so what else can I say on that?" he said.
Twice Olympic 400 meters champion Johnson was dumbfounded by the quality of Van Niekerk's run.
"Van Niekerk is so young, what else can he do? Can he go under 43 seconds? It is something I thought I could do, but never did," the American said. "Usain Bolt will be retiring soon, this could be the next star."
When asked how fast he could run, Van Niekerk's reply would have been music to the ears of the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), who have been unable to shift the cloud of a doping scandal that has overshadowed the sport for the last year.
"Achieving what I did just now, the sky's the limit," he said. "There's no way I'm going to limit myself."

RIO DE JANEIRO The U.S. men's basketball team closed out pool play with an unbeaten record but a nervy 100-97 win over France on Sunday confirmed that getting to the top step of the Olympic podium will not be an easy climb.
"Personally I felt we were going to dominate these games that they were going to come easy," American guard Paul George told reporters. "But you start playing better competition, you see these teams are pretty good."
After a pair of blowout wins over China and Venezuela to open the tournament, the United States have received a wake-up call in the way of narrow three-point wins over France and Serbia and a battling 10-point victory against Australia.
The alarm bells continued to ring on Sunday as the United States allowed France, playing without talismanic point guard Tony Parker, to rally from a 16-point deficit late in the third quarter to turn a predicted rout into another nail-biter.
Despite their troubles, the United States finished top of Group A with a perfect 5-0 record to run their Olympic winning streak to 22 games and remain the favorite to claim what would be a third straight gold on the final day of the Games.
"Today they did not play very well and still won so they are still the favorites," said 7-foot, 1-inch (2.16) French center Rudy Gobert, also known as the 'Stifle Tower'.
The United States will not know their quarter-final opponent until after the final Group B matches on Monday but are well aware that they need to raise their game considerably if they hope to make it to the final.
While the performance has been uneven, Team USA coach Mike Krzyzewski remained unconcerned, insisting there is only one statistic that matters and that is the win column, where his team is perfect.
"At the end of the day, no one will ask you anything else except if you have won," Krzyzewski said. "While you are approaching that winning you are asked a bunch of other things.
"I think we are getting better offensively and we have to get better defensively."

STRUGGLING BUT WINNING
Like most nations lining up against the United States, France came into the contest still searching for a first-ever Olympic win over their opponents.
The two had met five times previously with the closest France coming to a victory before Sunday being a 10-point loss in the gold medal game at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
France came closer to ending that run in their sixth encounter and fancied their chances, but to beat a U.S. team still not firing on all cylinders will take something special.
"You've seen the past three games, against Serbia, against Australia and we thought we had a chance too," said Frenchman Boris Diaw. "We played pretty well but we didn't play perfectly and you have to have a near perfect game to beat them.
"They haven't been dominating but they haven't lost either. They are struggling but they are winning."
In other Group A action, Australia (4-1) locked down second place after easing past Venezuela 81-56, while France (3-2) finished third.
Serbia (2-3), playing in the final pool game, thumped winless China 94-60 to finish fourth and grab a spot in the knockout round.
Group B wraps up on Monday with three games -- Spain v Argentina, Brazil v Nigeria and Lithuania v Croatia -- that will set the quarter-final match-ups.

RIO DE JANEIRO Britain's Andy Murray beat Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro 7-5 4-6 6-2 7-5 in a compelling Olympic tennis final on Sunday to become the first player to win two men's singles gold medals.
The world number two and his Argentine opponent shared a long hug at the net, with both man trying to hold back the tears, after a punishing, see-sawing, four-hour contest played out in front of a boisterous crowd at the Olympic Tennis Centre.
Murray's consistency proved decisive. He was able to wear down Del Potro's weaker backhand and frequently drew the fatigued Argentine into the net with deftly placed drop shots as the contest wore on.
Del Potro served for the fourth set at 5-4 but Murray broke the Argentine in consecutive games to claim the match, his 18th straight victory following his second Wimbledon title in July.
The 29-year-old Scot, winner of three grand slams, called the Rio encounter "one of the hardest matches I've had to play for a big title."
"There were so many ups and downs in the match... this has been much harder than London," he told reporters in reference to his gold medal win four years ago.
The Scot, Britain's flag-bearer at the opening ceremony in Rio, had been a hot favourite to retain his title but he was pushed all the way by an impressive Del Potro, who was roared on by hundreds of passionate Argentine fans.

TREMENDOUSLY TIRED
Del Potro had blown open the tournament by beating top seed Novak Djokovic in the first round and then edged Rafa Nadal in a three-hour semi-final contest but the exploits had left him exhausted. Against Murray, he said he was dizzy and felt close to passing out.
"I left the last of my toenails on the court," said Del Potro, whose ranking has slipped to 141 after a series of wrist injuries over the past six years.
"I was tremendously tired. It was the crowd that made me keep running."
The 2009 U.S. Open champion, whose route to the final included being stuck in an Olympic village elevator for 40 minutes before his first round win, claimed his second Olympic medal after a bronze at the 2012 London Games.
His blistering forehand produced several winners but said he had no complaints about the final result, crediting Murray for playing "smarter" tennis at crucial moments.
Murray said he might seek a third title at the Tokyo Games in 2020, but acknowledged that his best playing days might be behind him by then.
Japan's Kei Nishikori, who will still be in his prime at his home Olympics, secured a bronze medal in Rio by beating Nadal 6-2 6-7(1) 6-3 on Sunday.

NEW YORK A data breach at 20 U.S. hotels operated by HEI Hotels & Resorts for Starwood, Marriott, Hyatt and Intercontinental may have divulged payment card data from tens of thousands of food, drink and other transactions, HEI said on Sunday.
The breach follows similar attacks at Hyatt Hotels Corp (H.N) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT.N in recent months.
Norwalk, Connecticut-based HEI, which is privately held, said malware designed to collect card data was found on HEI's systems.
The malware was discovered in early to mid-June on payment systems used at restaurants, bars, spas, lobby shops and other facilities at the properties, Chris Daly, a spokesman for HEI, said in emails and phone calls.
The number of customers affected is difficult to calculate because they might have used their cards multiple times, Daly said. About 8,000 transactions occurred during the affected period at the Hyatt Centric Santa Barbara hotel in California, and about 12,800 at the IHG Intercontinental in Tampa, Florida, Daly said.
The malware affected 12 Starwood hotels, six Marriott International Inc (MAR.O) properties, one Hyatt hotel and one InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG.L) hotel. It was active from March 1, 2015 to June 21, 2016, with 14 of the hotels affected after Dec. 2, 2015, HEI said on its website on Friday.
Marriott and IHG declined to comment. Representatives from the other hotel groups did not respond to requests for comment.
HEI said outside experts investigated the breach and determined that hackers might have stolen customer names, account numbers, payment card expiration dates and verification codes. The hackers did not appear to have gained PIN codes, since those are not collected by its system, it added.
The company has informed federal authorities and has installed a new payment processing system that is separate from other parts of its computer network.
Among the properties affected were Starwood's Westin hotels in Minneapolis; Pasadena, California; Philadelphia; Snowmass, Colorado; Washington, D.C.; and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Also affected were Starwood properties in Arlington, Virginia; Manchester Village, Vermont; San Francisco; Miami; and Nashville, Tennessee.
The Marriott properties affected were in Boca Raton, Florida; Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; Chicago; San Diego, California; and Minneapolis.

RIO DE JANEIRO Triple jumper Caterine Ibarguen won Colombia's first Olympic gold medal in athletics on Sunday, building on several years of dominance by sweeping to victory with a season's best leap of 15.17 meters.
"It's the biggest dream to achieve this," said Ibarguen. "I'm very happy and proud."
The two-time world champion Ibarguen was hot-favorite going into the Rio Games after winning 36 of her last 37 competitions excluding qualifying events.
The 32-year-old soared past 15m twice and appeared in total control after producing her best jump in the fourth round, though she failed in her plan to break Ukraine's Inessa Kravets's world record of 15.50m set in 1995.
Ibarguen's young challenger Yulimar Rojas took silver with a 14.98m jump and became the first woman from the South American country to win a medal in athletics.
The 20-year-old also became the youngest female winner of a triple jump Olympic medal, capping her meteoric rise in an event she only started two years ago.
Kazakhstan's London Olympics champion Olga Rypakova pulled off the two best jumps of her season, but her 14.74m in the fifth round was only good enough for bronze.



RIO DE JANEIRO For Andy Murray, there have been highs. Then there was this.
On a small, green patch of scorched acrylic some 9,000 kilometers (5592 miles) from home, the Scot achieved a unique Olympic feat, converting heart and guts and sweat into Rio gold.
With victory over Juan-Martin del Potro, the 29-year-old claimed a status unmatched by any of those peers with whom he is often less than favorably compared - two Olympics singles crowns.
Forget the five Australian Open runners-up finishes and the French Open final defeat. Forget that his three grand slam titles is 14 shy of Roger Federer's record haul, or 11 short of Pete Sampras and Rafa Nadal.
No matter that among the 'Big Four' Federer, Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Murray, the Scot is the only one not to have completed the full collection of grand slam crowns.
Now he has eclipsed them, though the man himself would never be so immodest.
"I don't think I would say that," he smiled.
But still, no other tennis player, man or woman, has defended an Olympic singles crown. And now Murray has two Olympic golds.
He did it with a typically dynamic display of baseline tennis seasoned with smart forays to the net, pinpoint serving when it mattered, and ironman fitness.

FITTING GIANT
Del Potro, conqueror of both Djokovic and Nadal here, at 6ft 6ins (1.98m) was somehow a fitting giant to fell. The Argentine put up a valiant fight before going down 7-5 4-6 6-2 7-5.
It was not always pretty, played out in front of a noisy, chanting Latin crowd, in a sometimes soccer stadium atmosphere, but it was a compelling spectacle in which, from one perspective, Murray elevated himself above his illustrious peers and predecessors.
Little wonder he clutched his head in the center of the court and fought back tears when he finally clinched victory after a four-hour-two-minute battle.
Burying his head in his towel, Murray shook with emotion as the Olympic podium was hastily assembled, and dozens of photographers swarmed the net like camera-wielding hornets jostling for place.
The crowd roared 'ole ole ole' as Murray walked to the side of the court to greet fans, many of whom were clad in Argentine soccer shirts and had been screaming against him all evening.
Now though, they hailed him, leaping high to catch soaking sweatbands thrown by the player, and lifting iPads, phones and other tablets to capture the moment digitally. Something for Facebook, and Twitter and to prove to friends and family that they had been there.
"Tonight was one of the hardest matches I have played," Murray said in the bowels of the tennis stadium, a British flag draped round his shoulders.
"I know the fact it has not been done before means it is very hard to do, and I am very, very proud to be the first one to have done it.
"Four years is a long time, a lot can happen. I had back surgery between London and now... I've gone through some tough times on court."
Sunday night in Rio was undoubtedly one of his greatest times.

RIO DE JANEIRO South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk ran the fastest single lap in history to win the Olympic 400 meters gold medal in 43.03 seconds and break Michael Johnson's 17-year-old world record on Sunday.
Running an extraordinary race in lane eight, the 24-year-old world champion got off to a flier and was streaking clear on the back straight before upping his pace even further to better American Johnson's 1999 mark of 43.18 seconds.
"I believed I could get the world record," Van Niekerk told reporters. "I've dreamed of this medal since forever. I am blessed."
The South African flew across the line a good five meters ahead of 2012 champion Kirani James and held his hands to his head in disbelief before being embraced by the Grenadian, who took silver in 43.76.
"I'm happy to be part of a race that made history," James said. "We have put this sport on a pedestal."
LaShawn Merritt of the United States, the 2008 Olympic champion, claimed bronze in 43.85, the first time the top three had run under 44 seconds in the one-lap Olympic final.
"It was a crazy race, a great moment in history," said Merritt, who was unable to defend his title in London after suffering a hamstring injury in the heats.
"The world record was broken, the best man won."
American Johnson, who won back-to-back Olympic titles in the event in 1996 and 2000 and is considered one of the greatest sprinters of all time, was dumbfounded by the quality of Van Niekerk's finish.
"Oh my God! From lane eight, a world record," Johnson said on  the BBC. "He took it out so quick. I have never seen anything from 200 to 400 like that."
Van Niekerk marked himself as the leading contender for Rio when he led home Merritt and James with an exceptional run to win gold at last year's world championships in Beijing, where the podium again all ran under 44 seconds.
This year, he became the first sprinter to run the 100 below 10 seconds, 200 under 20 seconds and 400 in less than 44 seconds before deciding to concentrate on the longest distance in Brazil.

RIO DE JANEIRO France dominated Italy in the men's team epee final on Sunday to take their first fencing gold medal in Rio and cap a rebound from their disappointment on the pistes four years ago.
France's win over their longstanding rival, achieved without dropping a bout in the final, gave them a record ninth team gold in men's epee.
Reflecting on the journey to Rio from the 2012 Games in London, where French fencers left without a medals for the first time since 1960, France's coach Hugues Obry said it was "four years of doubts."
"We know that with our medal, no one can take that away from us, same as in (London), no one can take that away from us," he said.
Top-ranked Gauthier Grumier, who won individual bronze on Tuesday, was substituted for Jean-Michel Lucenay in the final after scoring an aggregate 12-16 in the first two rounds.
"My role was ... to be here for my team mates and to guide them because I wasn't fencing in the final. So I was here to tell them, 'Go ahead and take your chance,'" said Grumier.

RIO DE JANEIRO China ensured top place in the weightlifting medals table for the fifth successive Olympic Games when Meng Suping won her nation’s fifth gold on Sunday.
Sarah Robles, in third place in the +75kg, won the first weightlifting medal for the United States since 2000.
Meng had to make her last clean and jerk of 177kg to edge out Kim Kuk Hyang of North Korea, who lifted more than 300kg for the first time. Meng did it and justified her last-minute selection for the Rio team.
Meng occasionally looked shaky, missing her first snatch and her first clean and jerk, but did enough.
“I was at home in China training hard when I heard I had been selected,” she said. “It was a personal challenge for me and I know there was a lot of weight on me, but it was my duty to perform well for my country and I did it.
“I was a bit nervous on my first lift but I stabilized. I didn’t think about how much I had to lift, I just followed my coach’s directions and the end result was pretty good.”
Meng's gold takes China’s weightlifting tally to 28 in the five Games this century. They have never won fewer than five in a single Games since women’s contests were added to the schedule in 2000.
Their total in Rio is five golds and two silvers with one lifter yet to compete - Zhe Yang in the men’s 105kg on Monday. No other team can overtake them.
A knee injury to the 48kg favorite Hou Zhihui prompted the decision to call for Meng, 27. Hou thought she had recovered sufficiently in a pre-Games training camp in Sao Paulo but China’s head coach of the women’s team, Wang Guoxin, made the change.
His decision was influenced, he said, by the absence of Tatiana Kashirina of Russia, the world record holder who beat Meng in the past two IWF World Championships. She was excluded when the entire Russian team was banned from Rio for state-sponsored doping. The ban was not confirmed until the week before the Games started.
Kashirina’s world record total of 348kg is way beyond the winning total in Rio. “It’s a pity she was not here,” said Meng. “She is a very strong competitor.”
Both Robles, 28, and Kim have served two-year doping bans. Kim's total 306kg was 1kg behind Meng. She was in tears afterwards and said, "I am happy to win silver but also sad that it was not gold."
At 143kg Robles was 20kg or more heavier than her rivals and turned that to her advantage to become the first American on the weightlifting podium since Tara Nott won at Sydney 2000.
“This means a lot, to be on the podium and give exposure to our sport at a time when it’s already growing,” said Robles. “It’s good not just for me, but for women of size, for women who want to get up off the couch and do something different.”
Her two-year ban, she said, was the result of unknowingly taking an over-the-counter supplement that contained a banned substance. Life was hard for Robles. She lost her funding, took three or four menial jobs, kept training and strove to return.
“I know I’m a good and honest person and if I put hard work in I would be able to reach my goals.”

Australian golfer Robert Allenby was arrested and charged after a weekend incident in Illinois, a spokesman at the Rock Island county jail confirmed with Reuters on Sunday.
The spokesman said Allenby had been charged with "disorderly conduct and criminal trespass."
He was released after a short time in custody.
Multiple media outlets reported that the golfer was arrested outside a casino early on Saturday morning, a few hours after missing the cut at the John Deere Classic PGA Tour event that he was playing.
Allenby, 45, a four-time PGA Tour winner, was in the news last January after saying he had been kidnapped, beaten and robbed after leaving a wine bar in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Allenby sported facial bruises when he spoke to the media the following day, but police found no evidence he had been kidnapped or beaten.
They did, however, subsequently charge a man with using Allenby's credit card.
The man received a five-year prison sentence.

RIO DE JANEIRO Jason Kenny proved conclusively he is still top dog in the British team, and the world, when it comes to track sprinting, leaving compatriot Callum Skinner in his slipstream to power to a fifth Olympic gold medal on Sunday.
The training partners -- who put the wheels of the British cycling juggernaut in motion with team sprint gold on Thursday -- had set up a head-to-head in the individual final in the Rio velodrome but the 28-year-old Kenny dished out a harsh lesson.
Using all his experience, Kenny responded to the challenge from within the ranks with two dominant rides, winning both heats with something to spare.
Kenny has now won as many gold medals for Britain as fellow cyclist Bradley Wiggins and could take his tally to six when he contests his final event, the keirin, on Tuesday.
The two finalist have been sharing digs in the Olympic Village and know each other's race styles inside out after thousands of training session together.
But come the real thing there was only going to be one winner with world champion Kenny at his devastating best.
"It's really special, it's not really sunk in," Kenny told reporters. "It was weird because we finished the semis yesterday which were a real scrap and had 24 hours to sit on it.
"It's a bit strange and it feels like a bit of a lull now."
Asked whether the previous night had been awkward, Kenny said he and Skinner had chatted about the progress of other British athletes at the Games.
"(Andy) Murray, heptathlon and (Greg) Rutherford," he said.
Skinner's emergence has prompted comparisons with six-times Olympic gold medalist Chris Hoy, his fellow Scot who was commentating on the race at trackside.
Kenny said the past few days had reminded him of Beijing eight years ago when he was the new kid on the block and Hoy was at the peak of his powers.
On that occasion he won the team sprint alongside Hoy but had to play second fiddle to his superior in the individual event where Hoy won gold and he took the silver.
"It took me back to Beijing a little bit," he said. "I remember sitting having breakfast with Chris that morning and it was a bit the same this time.
"But I enjoyed it, it was a bit lonely in London with only one (rider) per nation and being on my own in the finals.
"I tried to convince myself that I would probably be feeling better as I have a few more years training than Callum, but in reality I was hurting this morning, I knew it would be a fight."
Britain have dominated the track cycling program in Rio, winning four of the six events completed and with Kenny's fiance Laura Trott targeting a second gold as she begins the defense of her omnium title on Monday.

RIO DE JANEIRO China's He Zi received the shock of her life when teammate and boyfriend Qin Kai rushed up with a diamond ring during the medal ceremony of the women's 3 meter springboard event, marking the second marriage proposal of the Olympics.
Qin, who won a bronze medal in his own synchronized diving event last week, climbed up to the stage after He received her silver medal, getting down on one knee while holding a red box with the ring and a glass-encased rose.
"I didn't know he would propose today and I didn't expect myself to marry myself out so early," said He, who tearfully accepted the proposal with a big hug.
"I saw him during the afternoon and he seemed to be memorizing something, so I asked him 'what are you doing?' and he said he was singing," she told reporters.
"I've forgotten most of what he's said (during the proposal), but it's largely what you can expect like promises, but what touched me the most is that he said he was willing to be bullied by me for life," she said.
The 25-year-old has been dating the 30-year-old Qin for the past six years, she added.
Shi Tingmao, speaking to reporters after her gold medal win in the same event, said she had knew about the proposal before the event, which Qin watched from the sidelines with the Chinese team.
"I'm really happy for them, because these years, be it career or relationships-wise, they have had to face a lot of pressure," she said.
The engagement is the second of the Games, after Brazilian women's rugby player Isadora Cerullo accepted a marriage proposal from her girlfriend at the medals ceremony for the first Olympic rugby sevens competition last week.

RIO DE JANEIRO France's Charline Picon claimed Olympic gold in the women's RS:X sailboard competition in a fiercely contested medal race that pushed Italy's Flavia Tartaglini, the leader before the medal round, out of the podium positions.
With only six points separating the top six of 10 sailors qualified for the medal round after 12 preliminary races, the gold, silver and bronze were mathematically attainable by most of the final-round sailboarders.
Sailed in nearly perfect firm and lightly shifting winds, the test allowed Picon to jump from fourth overall to the top of the podium in one of the closest and most dramatic Olympic medal round races ever.
China's Chen Peina won silver and Russia's Stefaniya Elfutina took bronze. Standing third and second before the medal race they had to fight from behind to survive.
Chen used impressive downwind power to grind back from a poor start and sixth position at the upwind gate. Her third-place finish left her two points shy of gold.
Elfutina, at 19 the youngest sailor at the Games and Russian's first sailing medalist in 20 years, made the first mark in last place after taking a penalty turn.
"I stopped thinking about my position there," she said. "The only thing I could do was pump."
The pumping, a board sailing action where the sailor repeatedly pulls and eases back the sail to drive the bard forward, worked.
She finished seventh, enough to edge out World Sailing's No. 2-ranked RS:X sailor Lilian de Geus of the Netherlands, by a single point.
By passing Tartaglini, helping push her into eighth, Elfutina essentially pushed the Italian out of the podium spots.
The men's RS:X medal race took place under sunny skies and in near perfect sailing conditions just off Rio's Flamingo beach before several thousand ardent fans. Two of the three medals, though, had already been wrapped up on points before the start.
Showing up was all Dutchman Dorian van Rijsselberghe had to do to clinch gold and Britain's Nick Dempsey to claim silver.
Only the bronze was at stake and France's Pierre le Coq, fourth overall going into the final, was able to sneak onto the podium with a seventh-place medal-race finish.
In the men's Finn heavy single-person dinghy, Giles Scott, four-time world champion in the class, guaranteed Britain's second sailing medal of the Games on points after 10 preliminary races, World Sailing said.
Even if Scott finishes last in the medal race on Tuesday, he is assured of the gold medal.

Miguel Angel Jimenez will have to sit on the U.S. Senior Open lead for an extra day after rain washed out the scheduled final round on Sunday.
Officials decided the Scioto Country Club course in Columbus, Ohio was unplayable and rescheduled the final round for Monday.
Spaniard Jimenez is the 54-hole leader at three-under 207, one stroke ahead of American Gene Sauers.
Three weeks ago, Jimenez had a four-shot lead going into the final round of the British Senior Open at Carnoustie, but faded to finish equal third after a double-bogey at the final hole.


RIO DE JANEIRO After 16 years and numerous disappointments, the Olympic medals have finally arrived for Italian diver Tania Cagnotto.
Cagnotto, who made her Olympic debut in Sydney in 2000, had always come close. She finished in fourth in both the individual and synchronized three meter springboard events in London four years ago and fifth in the individual event in Beijing.
On Sunday, the 31-year-old took the bronze medal in the women's three meter individual springboard event, adding to a silver she won in the synchronized event last week.
"Now I'm fine and I can retire," she told Reuters after the medal ceremony, during which she stood on the podium and blew kisses to supporters.
"I'm just happy and I'm enjoying this moment because I lost two medals in London by very little points."
In London, she was pipped for bronze in the individual event by Mexico's Laura Sanchez by 0.20 points. In the synchronized, she and Francesca Dallape were 2.7 points behind Canadian duo Jennifer Abel and Emilie Heymans.
Her quest for the bronze medal, however, looked uncertain at certain times on Sunday as she faced strong competition from Abel before she finally came up out on top in her final dive and finished with a 5.55 point advantage.
"I was looking at the scoreboard, I just had one goal and that was to do my best score."
Cagnotto, who is also a police officer, comes from diving stock. Her father, Giorgio, was an Olympic diver who won two silver and two bronze medals over three Games between 1972 and 1980.
Her mother, Carmen Casteiner, was also a national diver.
Now that she's achieved her medal dream, she said she was not tempted to train for another Olympics and that Rio would be her last.
"I'm getting married in September and I will start a new life and we'll see."

RIO DE JANEIRO Elaine Thompson inherited the mantle of Olympic 100 meters champion from fellow Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce on Saturday but Mo Farah simply refused to relinquish his 10,000m crown as the Briton recovered from a fall to retain his title.
Fraser-Pryce, who took bronze in a fantastic final, became the third athlete in two days to discover why no woman has ever managed to win three individual athletics titles in a row, after Ethiopian 10,000m runner Tirunesh Dibaba and New Zealand shot-putter Valerie Adams both came up short on Friday.
Jessica Ennis-Hill also failed in her bid to defend her heptathlon title, pipped to gold by 21-year-old Belgian student Nafissatou Thiam, who said she had only dreamt of a top-eight finish prior to the event.
Farah, however, just does not know how to lose when it comes to the big races.
The Briton has won the 10,000m in the last two world championships and the 5,000 in the last three.
He has now won back-to-back Olympic 10,000m golds and is seeking to retain the 5,000m too, hoping to emulate Finn Lasse Viren, the only man to defend both titles in 1976 and who also fell while winning the longer race in 1972.
Every one of Farah's victories have come in virtually the same way as he sits in behind a group of Ethiopians and Kenyans before blasting out an unstoppable final lap.
There was a twist on Saturday, however, as he tripped and fell early in the race when he tangled with his American training partner Galen Rupp with 16 laps remaining.
He bounced up quickly though and with the East Africans failing to test him by pushing the pace, there was an air of inevitability about the outcome as he swept past Kenya's Paul Tanui and roared home.
"It's hard mentally when you go down," a tearful Farah admitted.
"I got emotional because you put so much work in and in one moment it's gone," Farah added. "That one moment could be it."

SUPER SATURDAY
The 100m final initially appeared impossible to call after all eight women qualified in sub-11 second times but as it turned out, Thompson won comfortably in 10.71 after hitting the front at halfway.
America Tori Bowie took silver in 10.83 while Fraser-Pryce, running with an injury, edged out Ivory Coast's Marie-Josee Ta Lou by seven thousandths of a second.
"I'm very excited, I'm really happy, Jamaica has so many talented sprinters and to be only the second Olympic champion I'm really happy about that," Thompson said.
Four years ago in London, Britain celebrated a "Super Saturday" as Farah, Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford claimed gold but it was a medal of each hue this time as Rutherford had to settle for bronze in an edge-of-the seat long jump competition.
American Jeff Henderson continued America's proud tradition in the event when he flew 8.38 meters on his final jump, edging out South African Luvo Manyonga.
Usain Bolt began his bid for a "triple-triple" with a 10.07 100 meters heat -- with arch rival Justin Gatlin the fastest qualifier in 10.01.
There was last-round drama in the discus as Germany's Christophe Harting produced 68.37m with the penultimate throw to snatch the gold from Pole Piotr Malachowski and match his brother Robert's success from four years ago.
Away from the track there was yet another, and unexpected, development in the Russian doping saga when the country's sole track and field competitor, long jumper Darya Klishina, was suspended from the Games after the IAAF withdrew her special eligibility status.
Klishina had been allowed to come to Rio after satisfying the governing body that, based in the United States, she had operated in a bona-fide anti-doping environment.
However, the IAAF said it had received new information that led to her suspension. Klishina said the ban was politically motivated and is appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
The men's marathon is the only event on Sunday morning but the evening session is one not to miss as Bolt goes in the 100 meters final shortly after what should be a top-class men's 400m.

RIO DE JANEIRO For Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, just getting into the blocks in the 100 meters at the Rio Olympics was a major achievement to rank alongside her title winning exploits at her two previous Games.
The 29-year-old Jamaican came up short in her quest to become the first woman to win three straight Olympic gold medals in an individual athletics event on Saturday, taking bronze behind compatriot Elaine Thompson and American Tori Bowie.
Given the toe injury that has plagued her throughout the season, though, she said she considered it her "greatest medal ever".
"First of all I didn't think I would have been here at this championships, it was a tough journey," she said.
"I just wanted an opportunity to defend my title. And it was really, really hard. By far, I would definitely say this was my best championship ever.
"Because I knew how hard I worked, I knew the pain, I knew the sacrifice, I knew the tears, I knew everything. Despite everything I stuck to it, I toughed it out and I kept my head in the game, even when the odds were against me."
Three women - Fraser-Pryce, 10,000 meter runner Tirunesh Dibaba and shot putter Valerie Adams - have had the opportunity to win a third straight Olympic title in Rio and all three have failed.
"It was really difficult, I cried because it was unbearable but I knew I had one more race to go," Fraser-Pryce added.
"I prayed and said 'God if it's to be, then it will be'. I can't begin to tell you how happy I am to be able to stand on the podium after having a year like this."
Fraser-Pryce was delighted that it was her training partner Thompson who got to stand on the top step of the podium, not least because it extended Jamaica's dominance of an event once owned by the United States to three Olympics.
"I am really happy for her, I have seen her work hard and it was her time," she said.
"In 2008 it was my time, in 2016 it was her time and I'm happy Jamaica gets to keep the gold.
"I have accomplished so much, I am blessed and I think this is my greatest medal ever."

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's Robson Conceição and France's Sofiane Oumiha secured at least a silver medal on Sunday, advancing to a lightweight title fight between the two boxers on Tuesday.
Conceição's victory, following a fast-paced third round that lifted enthusiastic Brazilian spectators from their seats, gives the host country a shot at its first Olympic boxing gold.
Oumiha, a 21-year-old from Toulouse, now faces the challenge of defeating Conceição for the title on his home turf.
"He is in his home country but for me that won't make it more difficult," Oumiha said. "I won't let my guard down and I won't stop believing that I can win."
If he were to prevail, it would be France's first gold boxing medal at the Games since 2000.
Conceição, a 27-year-old from the northeastern city of Salvador, was eliminated in early stages of the last two Olympics. On Sunday, though, he won a unanimous decision against Cuban world champion Lázaro Álvarez.
The Brazilian said he is more focused and driven, especially on a Sunday that happens to be Father's Day in Brazil, after the birth of a daughter in 2014.
"I even disconnected from social media," he said, underscoring his single-minded focus on winning. "I promised my daughter that I would fight for a medal for her."
Tension between the two boxers' staffs following the fight prompted a shouting match in front of reporters after a Cuban coach complained the Brazilians were celebrating too loudly.
At the London Olympics in 2012, Brazil won a silver and two bronzes.

RIO DE JANEIRO The head of wrestling's global governing body was elated on Sunday after the sport's first day at the Rio Olympics showed that a flood of rule changes resulted in amped-up action that ignited a surprisingly large crowd.
"I'm elated, the hall was nearly full and the fans excited, and we did not even have a Brazilian wrestling in this first session," Nenad Lalovic, head of United World Wrestling (UWW), told Reuters. "There was much more scoring, more flurries of action and you could see it in how the fans responded."
Wrestling, which first appeared in the 708 B.C. edition of the Games, faced Olympic extinction in early 2013 when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to cut it from the Games after 2016.
The IOC cited the staid state of the sport, lack of diversity in its global leadership, and dull matches that were not easily understood by the casual fan.
That ignited a global backlash from wrestling enthusiasts and prompted the sport's governing body to remake itself. It introduced many rules changes that resulted in more aggressive and faster action on the mat, more scoring and greater simplicity in how points were awarded.
The global body also cut some men's categories to ensure gender equality. There are now six weight categories for both men and women competing at the Games.
The IOC reinstated wrestling in late 2013 after it evolved.
"The end result is what you saw this morning," said Lalovic, who is Serbian. "There was a lot more scoring for Greco-Roman and a lot more excitement. That's what we needed to do and we did it. I'm confident that wrestling will long remain a member of the Olympic family."
On Sunday, Japan's Shinobu Ota, 22, competing in the 59kg category, stole the show, coming out of nowhere to make it to the gold medal match. But his run ended there, when Cuba's Ismael Borrero Molina, the current world champion, beat him by 8-0 technical fall.
In the 75kg category, reigning champion and 2012 gold medalist Roman Vlasov of Russia defeated his Danish challenger Mark Overgaard Madsen 5-1.

RIO DE JANEIRO China's Shi Tingmao dominated the competition to win gold in the women's 3 meter springboard event on Sunday, with team mate He Zi taking silver and Italy's Tania Cagnotto bronze.
Shi tied with He in the first two dives, before the 24-year-old pushed ahead in her third to achieve 84 points, the highest score, and eventually reached a total of 406.05, 18.15 points ahead of He and 103.2 points more than the last-placed diver.
The gold is the second for the 24-year-old, who won her first on the second day of the Games with team mate Wu Minxia in the 3 meter synchronized springboard event.
Shi becomes the third woman after Wu and retired Chinese diver Guo Jingjing to win gold in the 3 meter synchronized and individual events.
Shi said the two medals made her feel like she had fulfilled her responsibility to those who helped her along the way, but the Chinese added that she had not performed at her best.
"I would give myself a score of 80 today because I was very nervous. While my first few dives were okay, my heart felt quite unsteady during the others," she told reporters.
"Because it's the Olympic final, wanting to win it affects your state of mind."

NO TEARS
Shi said that while she did not shed tears during her individual victory, she had cried after her win with Wu, the Olympics' most decorated female diver.
"Because although a win in that event was safer, accidents can always happen...That was the hard work of two people, and we've seen how hard it is for big sister Xia," she said.
The medal tables in diving are dominated by China. They have won every gold in the women's individual event since the 1988 Seoul Olympics and every silver since the 2000 Sydney Games.
He, who accepted a marriage proposal from boyfriend and team mate Qin Kai at the medal ceremony, had also claimed silver in the event at the London 2012 Games.
Participating in her fifth Olympics, this is the first individual medal for Italy's Cagnotto, who also won a silver in the synchronized 3 meter springboard event a week ago.
Cagnotto battled with Jennifer Abel of Canada for third place throughout the event, finally coming up out on top in her final dive and winning with a 5.55 point advantage.

RIO DE JANEIRO The once-great U.S. men's Olympic boxing team is clambering out of the basement and heading back to where it belongs, coach Billy Walsh said on Sunday as Nico Hernandez collected his light-flyweight bronze.
The first medals ceremony to feature a U.S. male fighter since the 2008 Beijing Games provided a useful moment for the former Irish welterweight and national coach to take stock of the work in progress.
Hired after Ireland won three men's boxing medals at London 2012, and the U.S. drew a blank, Walsh said the results were starting to show.
"We're starting to gain respect again and hopefully it will continue," he said.
In 'Cold War' days, the United States and Communist Cuba were twin powerhouses of amateur boxing with some of the greatest names to grace the ring starting out at amateur level.
Muhammad Ali won the 1960 light-heavyweight title, as Cassius Clay, while Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Henry Tillman and Ray Mercer followed as heavyweight champions.
Leon Spinks won the 1976 light-heavyweight title while brother Michael was middleweight gold medalist at the same Montreal Games and Sugar Ray Leonard won the light-welterweight division.
Times have changed. The last U.S. male boxer to win gold was light-heavyweight Andre Ward in Athens in 2004 and the current team -- the smallest in more than a century -- have no heavyweights of any sort in Rio.
While Claressa Shields won women's middleweight gold in 2012, the last man to medal before Hernandez was heavyweight Deontay Wilder with a bronze in Beijing.
"It's a weight off the back," said Walsh. "Of the five we have left (in the competition), I think there's going to be a few more (medals), and we want to change the color of those.
"We want to bring them on to another level because the USA deserves to be at the top of the sport."
The heavyweight problem is particularly acute and there have been various theories put forward for the decline.
"I suppose it's a testament to the way the sport is going in the United States," said Walsh. "Hopefully we're going to change that and come Tokyo (in 2020) we'll have a really good squad and the full team hopefully."
He said the main problem was the style the U.S. amateur heavyweights were fighting with, having been schooled with professionals.
"It's like a marathon runner and a sprinter," said Walsh. "It (Olympic boxing) is over three rounds and you've got to be more skilful and tactical at points scoring and not trying to kill fellas and knock 'em out.
"Once they learn the skills of that, they have the ability and the talent...at the end of the day, this game is very simple: You've got to hit the fella more than he hits you. That's it."

RIO DE JANEIRO France's Teddy Riner - all 6 foot 8 inches and roughly 300 pounds of him - was basking in the Olympic glow on Sunday after adding yet another golden moment to his impressive resume.
Riner crushed Hisayoshi Harasawa of Japan in the men's +100kg category final on Friday, extending his six-year unbeaten streak in a career that includes eight world championship and two previous Olympic medals, including another gold at the 2012 Games.
His success makes him among the most visible athletes in the sport of judo. It is a position that inevitably leads to added expectations.
"It’s not a bad pressure," Riner told Reuters. "It’s a good pressure for perfection."
It is perhaps this pressure that puts Riner on alert for new contenders on the horizon.
"This competition is very hard," Riner said. "This season on the circuit I had a lot of new fighters (to contend with) - for me, it is exciting."
Even so, Riner, who was his country's flag bearer at the Games, laughed off questions about his long-term future.
"For the moment, I want just a holiday, sea, sun," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Two riders were disqualified from the individual show jumping competition that kicked off in Rio on Sunday for rough riding.
A jury ruled Jur Vrieling of the Netherlands went too hard on the whip, while Belgium's Nicola Philippaerts was disqualified for excessive use of spurs under International Equestrian Federation guidelines.
While the riders are out of the individual competition, they can continue competing for their teams. Vrieling was part of the silver-medal-winning Dutch team in London 2012, when Britain claimed gold.
Jumping is the last of three equestrian competitions in the Olympics.
A leading Dutch dressage rider, Adelinde Cornelissen, earned praise on social media for pulling out of a test on Wednesday because she was worried about her sick horse, even though it had been cleared by a vet for competition.
Host Brazil and Germany were the only countries to emerge without team penalties in the first qualifying show jumping round on Sunday in which the worst of four scores is dropped.
"It is the same feeling as a soccer player when he scores in a final," Brazilian rider Alvaro de Miranda Neto, known as Doda, said of local fans' reception to his clear round.
Riders go on to a second qualifier on Tuesday. Team medals are awarded on Wednesday and individual medals on Friday.

RIO DE JANEIRO When he first began boxing eight years ago, Yurberjen Martínez hid it from his parents.
Now, with a silver medal hanging around his neck, the 24-year-old light-flyweight from a small Caribbean port town plans to buy a new home for them with about $60,000 in Olympic prize money awarded by the Colombian government.
"My life has changed a lot through boxing," said Martínez, a relative unknown who surprised boxing fans by reaching Sunday's final which he lost to Uzbekistan's Hasanboy Dusmatov, the first boxer from outside the Americas the Colombian has ever faced.
Already 16 before he donned a pair of gloves, Martínez at first did not tell his parents about his new hobby. He was particularly worried about informing his father, an evangelical pastor and construction worker whom he feared would see boxing as violent.
"How could that be -- that a pastor's son is out there swapping punches?" Martínez recalled thinking.
Gradually, though, he won his parents over, especially because Martínez, one of six children, by that point was also putting the family's food on the table. After his father was injured lifting a concrete block, the younger Martínez began doing construction work of his own and also fixing bicycles.
"I was in charge of the family," he said, explaining how he won them over.
Now, he has the support of the thousands of yellow-clad Colombia fans who packed the Rio arena for Sunday's bout and many more Colombians back home, who are cheering a silver that represents the Andean country's first boxing medal in 28 years.
"We are making a little history," Martínez said after the fight.
Smiling despite a unanimous decision that awarded the gold to Dusmatov, a southpaw and winner of last year's Asian championships, Martínez paraded around the ring with his arm around his victor, pointing at the winner in tribute.
Although his family was unable to travel to Rio de Janeiro to watch him fight, Martínez said he was looking forward to returning, claiming his prize money and investing in a new house for his parents.
Would he have preferred gold?
"Yes, I came for more," he said. "But silver is still enough for me to buy them a home."

RIO DE JANEIRO Not content with seventh place at her seventh Olympics, Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina declared on Sunday she would be back to compete in Tokyo in 2020 at the age of 45.
Minutes after taking part in the vault against gymnasts younger than her 17-year-old son Alisher, Chusovitina breezily announced she would keep going.
"Of course I'm not entirely happy with today's performance, but what are you going to do? So we are going to move forward," she said.
Over the course of an extraordinary career, the diminutive Chusovitina has competed for the Soviet Union, Germany - where she lived for a period while Alisher was receiving successful treatment for leukemia - and Uzbekistan.
Her first Olympic appearance was at Barcelona in 1992 where she won a team gold with the Unified Team of athletes from the former USSR.
She flirted with the idea of retiring after each of the last two Games, but there was no hesitation when she was asked if she would be back in Tokyo for Olympics number eight.
"Definitely," she replied. "I've already taken this decision... I just woke up in the morning and decided.
"I'd like carry out an experiment to see how long it will take before I've had enough."
Her gymnastics lifespan almost defies belief, as the next oldest competitor in Rio after her is 32-year-old Vasiliki Millousi from Greece.

BILES TRIBUTE
Vault winner Simone Biles of the United States paid tribute to her. "She's amazing. If there's one person that could do it, it is only her," said the American.
Warmly greeted by the Rio crowd, Chusovitina began each of her two attempts by raising her right hand, then standing erect with her right foot outstretched to prepare her sprint for the springboard.
On the first, she over-rotated her vault and crouched down on the landing before rolling over. On the second, she had to step slightly to the side to maintain her balance at the end.
After the competition, in a special tribute that she described as a pleasant surprise, spectators were shown a short video of highlights from her long career.
She bowed, waved and blew kisses to the crowd in what many must have assumed was her final Olympic appearance.
Not so, said Chusovitina.
And what does her son think of her decision to carry on?
"He doesn't know yet," she said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Organizers for the Rio Olympics have delivered on their promises, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Sunday, playing down persistent problems that have plagued the first South American Games since the start.
Games organizers have had to deal with a seemingly endless list of issues affecting venues and infrastructure alike as the country grapples with its worst recession since the 1930s.
From the day of the opening ceremony on Aug. 5, thousands of empty seats have been visible at many venues despite assurances from organizers they would be filled eventually.
Transportation in the traffic-clogged and crime-ridden city has also proved to be a permanent headache while signage around the stadiums and outside venues has been virtually non-existent.
"We still have an issue with look of the Games and signage," said the IOC's Olympic Games Executive Director, Christophe Dubi. "What they have faced is a very unfortunate situation."
According to organizers, contractors failed to deliver the banners on time with only a fraction of them displayed across the city, stadiums and other Olympic areas.
They were equally absent along the route of the women's marathon on Sunday.
"They (banners, signs) could not be delivered on time and they had to change providers. Many things should have been installed and could not," Dubi said.
He did praise organizers for adapting quickly to the situation and at least securing Olympic banners for all fields of play, saying they had also done so when problems arose with the color of the diving pool and other issues.
"Halfway through I think we can say Brazil and the Cariocas (Rio residents) delivered on what they promised," he said. "If we go back in time, they said we would have great venues and we have spectacular venues."
"They said we would have a whole new infrastructure benefiting citizens before the Games and this is what they have done. They said 'we will offer a Carioca experience' and this is what we have. We are were we should be midway through."
He said new sports -- golf and rugby sevens -- had been a success despite initial low attendances and countries such as Singapore, Puerto Rico, Vietnam and Fiji, among others, added their first ever gold medal at these Olympics.
Despite the thumbs-up from the IOC, however, problems will not go away. Organizers are still struggling to clean both pools and get rid of an uninviting green hue for which they blame the contractors.
While managing, after days of delays, to finally turn the synchronized swimming pool back to its blue color, they are not yet able to say the same for the other pool.
"For the diving tank, we could not change it as priority is the competition schedule," said Games spokesman Mario Andrada.
"The water is better than yesterday but we may need another cycle... but I don't think we will need to change the water."

RIO DE JANEIRO They should make a movie out of Martina Hingis's tennis career.
First the meteoric rise, five grand slam singles titles while still a teenager, the world number one ranking and her dazzling smile adorning magazine covers around the world.
Then there were the accidents, injuries, relationship bust-ups, retirements, two comebacks and a two-year suspension for testing positive for cocaine in 2007.
Older and wiser, the former Swiss Miss added another line to an already rich plot on Sunday when, 20 years after playing in her only previous Games in Atlanta, she added an Olympic medal to her collection in Rio.
It was not the color Hingis wanted as she and partner Timea Bacsinszky were beaten to gold in a 6-4 6-4 defeat by Russians Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina and there were plenty of tears shed at the end.
But a while later the 35-year-old, who came out of retirement for a second time in 2013 and has won three grand slam doubles titles to add to the nine she managed earlier in her career, reflected on her achievement.
"I think if you asked me 10 years ago if I would be here in Rio, I would say you're crazy because I didn't play for six years and being able to play for gold is unbelievable," she told reporters.
"Of course, you are a little disappointed (not to win gold), but looking back it's been an incredible journey," added Hingis, who had hoped to partner Roger Federer in a dream mixed doubles match-up until he was forced out by injury.
The Swiss, who recently announced that she had split with doubles partner Sania Mirza, said the tears were a mixture of joy and relief after a tension-packed week in which herself and Bacsinszky had saved two match points in the semi-final.
"We are there together to fight through thick and thin. We are one team, we made it on the court this far and I think we were very emotional in general," she said. "If it doesn't touch you at the Olympic Games, where does it touch you?"

RIO DE JANEIRO Britain's Justin Rose birdied the final hole to win the Rio Olympic golf tournament on Sunday, the first gold medalist in a sport returning to the Olympics after a 112-year absence.
Rose, who hit a hole in one on his first day, carded a final round four-under-par 67 to beat Sweden's Henrik Stenson by two shots in a competition that went all the way to the final putts.
"Honestly this is a dream come true," said Rose. "I've been thinking about Rio for a long, long time. To come out of it with a medal is incredible, and to come out of it with gold, unbelievable.
"I was in a great fight with Henrik, a good friend of mine, and it took world class golf to win today so I am very proud of the achievement and I've just got to let it all soak in now."
The overnight leader was neck-and-neck with Stenson throughout much of the final round but he hit a lovely approach shot to within feet of the pin at the last hole.
Stenson put his long putt past the hole and missed his next shot to card a bogey six. Rose, whose only major victory was the U.S. Open in 2013, birdied and then punched the air and grabbed the British logo on his shirt to the acclaim of the crowd.
The United States' Matt Kuchar, who was only included after world number three Jordan Spieth pulled out, finished one stroke behind Stenson to win bronze.
Spieth and the other three men in the world's top four - Jason Day of Australia, American Dustin Johnson and Ireland's Rory McIlroy - withdrew from the Olympics, some of them citing concerns over the Zika virus.

BACK PROBLEMS
Rose and Stenson know each other well from the European Tour and Ryder Cup, where they played one of the most scintillating rounds in the competition's history in 2014, together carding 12 birdies in 16 holes in a four-ball win over Kuchar and Bubba Watson, the U.S. golfers who came third and eighth on Sunday.
Stenson said he struggled with back problems over the last few holes and had to have treatment soon after the turn, but he did not make excuses for his silver medal performance that included an opening round of 66 followed by three 68s.
"I had a bit of an issue, my thoracic spine kind of locked up completely after 13 holes and I had to have some treatment," said the Swede. "It kind of put me out of my rhythm a little bit but I was still there till the end...     "It was going to be a battle today and I think I battled pretty well," he added. "It was kind of head-to-head with Justin all day and it was going to come down to whoever finished the strongest and he birdied the last to win it.
"I have no regrets really, I did as well as I could today and congratulations to my good friend who won it today."
Few people play golf in Brazil and the par 71 course was built for the Olympics on environmentally sensitive land.
It is due to be turned into a public course after the Games, one of just a handful in the South American nation.

RIO DE JANEIRO Saina Nehwal, India's top medal hope in the Olympic badminton, limped out of the singles tournament on Sunday after an injury-hampered loss to unseeded Ukrainian Maria Ulitina.
Nehwal, who took bronze in London to become her country's first medalist in the sport, slumped to a 21-18 21-19 defeat by world number 61 Ulitina, clearly favoring her problem right knee which was heavily strapped.
"I got the injury before the Olympics almost one-and-a-half, two weeks back, so I was not fully prepared," the three-time Olympian and fifth seed told reporters at the Riocentro.
"Obviously I feel bad but the pain is there so there is nothing I can do about it."
The win for Ulitina put her into the last 16 of her first Olympic tournament.
"It is an incredible result for me and I'm just so happy," she said.
"Everybody knows that Saina was more like a leader in the match and for her maybe it was a little bit difficult, but my attack was really the best today and I could survive the defense so everything just went perfect."

RIO DE JANEIRO Max Whitlock made it a day to remember for Britain when he swiveled to the top of the podium with a smooth and silky pommel horse performance which earned him a second gold at the Olympics on Sunday.
Less than two hours after he ended Britain's 120-year wait for an Olympic gymnastics gold medal by winning the floor exercise, Whitlock was again on top in his specialist event with a score of 15.966.
Louis Smith completed a one-two for Britain as he picked up a second successive Olympic silver in the discipline with 15.833.
His "man bun" stood proud on his head as he moved smoothly up and down the block of wood to earn 15.833.
But with three more rivals to go after him in the final, including world champion Whitlock, Smith spent much of the next 15 minutes kneeling on the floor, unable to look at the scoreboard as he waited to see if anyone would leapfrog him.
In the end, his gold medal hopes were dashed by his own teammate, just as they were at the 2015 world championships when the British duo also claimed the top two spots on the podium.
American Alex Naddour picked up the bronze.

RIO DE JANEIRO Max Whitlock ended Britain's 120-year wait for an Olympic gymnastics gold medal by upstaging two-time world champion Kenzo Shirai to win the men's floor exercise title on Sunday.
Whitlock produced a series of gravity-defying tumbles to win gold with a score of 15.633, while Brazilian Diego Hypolito burst into tears of joy as he claimed silver, delighting the partisan crowd and making up for his flops at the last two Games.
There was more happiness for the home fans as Arthur Mariano picked up the bronze.
Shirai had been the favorite to become the first Japanese gymnast to win the floor exercise since Sawao Kato in 1968, but his gold medal hopes looked shaky when he almost sat down following a triple twisting front somersault.
When he stumbled forward following his next tumbling pass, he was completely out of the running for a medal.
But given the difficulty of Shirai's routine, Whitlock was still unsure where the 19-year-old would end up in the pecking order and he sat with his head down, jiggling nervously with his feet as he waited for the scoreboard to flash up his rival's  result.
The crowd's main concern was that no one would leapfrog sentimental favorite Hypolito or Mariano.
Chants of "Diego, Diego, Diego" were ringing around the arena when the final contender, Sam Mikulak of the United States, began his routine. Wild cheers erupted as he stumbled following his first tumbling run.
That set off the celebrations for the Brazilian crowd and the tears freely flowed down Hypolito's face as he finally got on the Olympic podium following years of pain and disappointment.
All around champion Kohei Uchimura was fifth.

RIO DE JANEIRO Olympics organizers said on Sunday they will appeal a judge's decision blocking them from using public money amid a deep recession in Brazil but insisted they would have enough funds to successfully stage the Games and next month's Paralympics.
Judge Marcia Maria Nunes ruled late on Friday that the federal government and the city of Rio de Janeiro could not provide some 270 million reais ($85 million) promised to help pay for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games and next month's Paralympics.
"We can guarantee that we are going to react according to the legal instruments that we have very early tomorrow morning," Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada said.
The judge's decision blocked organizers from making any payments using public money, under the threat of a fine of 100,000 reais ($31,320) per day.
Andrada declined to say whether the promised money had already been received and spent, citing the court case. He said there were ongoing talks with the government on funding.
"We remain convinced of the will of the government to support us whenever needed and we have negotiations with sponsors that will allow us to finish the Games without any debt and be ready to organize Paralympic Games at the same level," Andrada said.
The organizing committee for Rio 2016 has admitted that a shortfall in funding forced it to cut back on expenditure for the first Olympics to be held in South America.
Organizers have also had to depend on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) making some of its contributions months ahead of the original payment dates.
Asked whether delays in disbursing funds to national Olympic committees could prevent some poorer countries from sending athletes, Andrada said Rio 2016 had been in touch with some countries and would do everything required.
IOC executive director Christophe Dubi said organizers had a contingency fund to help cover unforeseen difficulties, but he said that ticket sales running at around 100,000 per day would help the financial situation of the Games.
Organizers had always expected a belated rush for tickets in Brazil, where locals have a reputation for last-minute purchases.
Andrada said organizers have sold 5.7 million tickets so far, with 800,000 still to be sold.
($1 = 3.1929 Brazilian reais)

RIO DE JANEIRO Life has changed a lot for Jessica Ennis-Hill, the golden girl of British athletics, since she won gold at London in 2012. She has taken time off, suffered injuries, got married and had a son. With her Rio Olympics over, it is changing again.
On Saturday night, she lost her Olympic heptathlon crown to Belgium’s Nafi Thiam. But reflecting on Sunday, she said was proud and happy to have won the silver medal and now it was time for a break, for celebrations, and to think about the future.
“It was just really hard days of competition. I just did everything I could over those seven events over two days and it wasn’t quite enough for the gold medal. I’m just very happy with our performances. Obviously I would have loved to defend my title but I knew it was a tall ask.”
Ennis-Hill, 30, said she was still undecided on when to retire.
“Obviously it was quite emotional last night but I am in two minds about whether to call it a day and retire now or perhaps go a little bit longer, but that was my last Olympics. It was just an amazing feeling and also quite a sad feeling that I won’t have another Olympics.”
"I’m definitely moving to that stage of my life where things are changing. I have so many years doing this sport and so many years at the top. I would never have imagined I would have achieved what I have at this stage and won the medals that I have. So it’s a nice position to be in and I’m looking forward to the future."
Speaking at the Omega House villa overlooking an Ipanema beach packed with Sunday crowds, she said she hoped to see a little bit more of Rio, but was heading home soon to celebrate with family.
Ennis-Hill would have been the first British female track and field athlete to win consecutive Olympic titles had she won. She led after the first day but dropped back after Saturday’s long jump. She won the last discipline of the event, the 800m, but not by enough to overtake Thiam, who scored five personal bests.
“I can go back and analyze all the different events and think ‘Oh, if I had done a bit there, got two more points there.' You know it was won by the better athlete on the two days and Thiam performed out of her skin. She thoroughly deserved that gold medal.”
Ennis-Hill, who is still the reigning world champion, looked relaxed and glowing and it was easy to see why she has become such a popular figure with the British public. While she is a familiar face in advertisements, she said she did not see herself as a celebrity. “I think I’m a sportswoman at the end of the day.”
Asked about the difference for her between the London Games and Rio, she said her approach to London had been “tunnel vision".
“More training and competing and not thinking about anything else. It was a unique run-up to the Games... being the poster girl and having all that kind of pressure and expectation, but it was an incredible journey.”
“This time it’s been completely different. Life is different. I’ve had some time away from the sport, I’ve had injuries, got married, had my son, so life is very different, but really just a unique and amazing journey to this Olympics as well.
Motherhood had changed everything, she said. Her son Reggie was born in 2014. “I’m definitely a more rounded person.”
“All my training now fits totally around my son. I make sure that he’s taken care of. I train in the morning then I’m at home in the afternoon, then do sessions in the evening once I put him to bed. Everything is catered around his needs. So training has had to adapt, but you know it would have had to adapt anyway. I’m an older athlete and the body can’t take the volume anymore.”
She said she wanted to stay involved in sport and fitness after she retired. For now though, she said: "I’ve had an incredible time here and enjoyed every moment of competing."

Italy's Andrea Iannone won the Austrian Grand Prix from pole position on Sunday for his first MotoGP victory as Ducati celebrated a return to the top of the podium for the first time since 2010.
Ducati, whose last win was with Australian Casey Stoner in Australia six years ago, made it a one-two finish for the first time since 2007 with Andrea Dovizioso following his compatriot home in his 250th GP start.
Spain's reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo was third for Yamaha to cut the overall lead of Honda's Marc Marquez to 43 points.
Marquez, riding with a dislocated shoulder after a crash in practice at Spielberg's Red Bull Ring, finished fifth behind Yamaha's Italian veteran Valentino Rossi in fourth.
After 10 of 18 rounds, Marquez now has 181 points to Lorenzo's 138 with Rossi third on 124.
Iannone, who is joining Suzuki next year, was the first Italian to win for Ducati since Loris Capirossi in Japan in 2007.

RIO DE JANEIRO Kenyan Jemima Jelagat Sumgong evaded a protester who leapt onto the Rio marathon course on Sunday to become the first woman from her country to win Olympic marathon gold in two hours, 24 minutes and four seconds.
Bahrain's Eunice Jepkirui Kirwa claimed silver in 2:24:13 and Ethiopian Mare Dibaba snatched the bronze in 2:24:30.
Sumgong, 31, said the man on the course immediately brought to mind memories of the April London Marathon, when she experienced a similar incident.
"It brings back memories of London, that's where my thoughts went back to," Sumgong said. "I was like scared, maybe I'm in trouble."
It was not immediately clear if the man, who went head over heels over a metal barrier, had been arrested or what his motive had been.
At the Athens Olympics in 2004, defrocked Irish priest Neil Horan tackled Brazil's Vanderlei de Lima near the finish, knocking him out of the lead. The bronze medalist lit the Olympic cauldron at Rio's opening ceremony on Aug. 5.
Sumgong, 31, bided her time throughout the race, staying with the leading pack and not moving ahead until the end.
"I had prepared that I would move out at kilometer 35 and my body was responding very well, as well as my movement," Sumgong told reporters after crossing the line at Rio's Sambadrome, the parade ground where brightly costumed samba schools perform during the city's annual Carnival celebration. "At the 40 kilometer I knew the gold was mine."
"It was very hot but everybody had to get through the heat. I had to control my body and listen to my body very carefully," Sumgong said.
Belarusian Volha Mazuronak, 27, shook up the pack halfway through, taking the lead and briefly pulling ahead of the lead group.
The move pushed the pace, stringing out what had been a lead pack of more than two dozen runners, causing some to drop back.
It was the first in a series of attacks by the first-time Olympian, who was ultimately unable to sustain the pace and was dropped by the leaders in the closing stages before finishing fifth in 2:24:48.

RIO DE JANEIRO Bullies are ruining U.S. gymnast Gabby Douglas's Olympic adventure by attacking her appearance, accusing her of being unpatriotic, and by mocking her with a mean-spirited nickname, "Crabby Gabby", on social media, her mother told Reuters.
The 20-year-old athlete has been attacked for a perceived lack of patriotism for not placing her hand over her heart as the U.S. anthem was played during a medal ceremony and for not joining a standing ovation for two team mates.

Her mother, Natalie Hawkins, says Douglas is heart-broken.
"She's had to deal with people criticizing her hair, or people accusing her of bleaching her skin. They said she had breast enhancements, they said she wasn't smiling enough, she's unpatriotic. Then it went to not supporting your team mates. Now you're "Crabby Gabby"," Hawkins said in an interview.
"You name it and she got trampled. What did she ever do to anyone?"
For the second Games running, Douglas has found herself caught in a firestorm despite yet another gold winning performance in Rio.
In 2012 Twitter went into overdrive after Douglas became the first African-American gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title. But rather than lauding her excellence, critics rounded on her for the state of her hair during the final.
Four years on and Douglas has another Olympic gold, from the women's team competition, but the sheen from that victory has also been tarnished after TV cameras showed her standing to attention during the national anthem.
"I don't think respecting your country or your flag boils down to whether you put your hand over your heart or not," Hawkins said.
"It's in your actions towards your country, how well are you abiding by its laws, how well are you helping your fellow citizens?
"We grew up in the military community. My mum spent almost 30 years in the military, my dad's a two-time Vietnam vet. Because of that it was so insulting that they would accuse my daughter of being unpatriotic when we are so tied to the military family.
"When the Star Spangled Banner is played, most military members either salute or stand to attention."
But Tuesday's furor over what the correct protocol is when the American flag is raised was neither the beginning nor the end of Douglas' problems.
She was also criticized for not giving team mates Simone Biles and Aly Raisman a standing ovation when they claimed gold and silver in Thursday's all around final.
With accusations that Douglas was angry and jealous at being denied a place in the final, since rules state only the top two performers from each country can progress to the final, #CrabbyGabby started trending on social media.
"We've been brought to many tears because I don't know what she's done to warrant such an attack. To me it looks like she is being bullied," said Hawkins.
All this unwanted attention on her daughter has been painful for Hawkins to watch. Despite being in Rio to cheer on Douglas, she is unable to give her a comforting hug because of team rules limiting contact to phone calls and texts until they are done competing.
"What I saw in the stands was someone who was hurting and she was also angry," added Hawkins.
"What was going through her head was 'I'm being attacked for everything I do so I might as well not do anything. Because no matter what I do, I am being attacked'."
Did Hawkins think Douglas was targeted because of her race?
"Many people are telling me that all the time. And that's from white people and black people. I don't want to believe (it's a race attack) as I want to have more faith," she said.
"But when I go on Twitter, I can't help but see that all the blacks are saying: 'was it just the white people that are saying this against us?'
"Maybe people are very frustrated. Our country has a lot of unrest and turmoil recently and people are frustrated and maybe they just want to vent and they just see someone innocent ... and bully them."
For now though, Hawkins says she has advised her daughter to stay offline and instead focus on competing in Sunday's asymmetric bars final.
"They keep attacking her about not smiling but they don't know what she is dealing with. If they did, this would not be a conversation. They would (understand). But this is not the time or place to tell that story," said Hawkins, who raised four children as a single mother.
"I want ... people to show me if they have ever seen Gabrielle being disrespectful ... or say something inappropriate. There is nothing because for her being a role model is such a supreme honor.
"Gabrielle's had her heart broken, but she's determined she will go out (on Sunday) and she knows she still has a job to do for Team USA. It's a huge honor for me to be her mother as she's the bravest person I know."
 
RIO DE JANEIRO U.S. marathon runner Desiree Linden has been there, done that and can now wear the T-shirt with pride.
After dropping out of the Olympic marathon in London four years ago, Linden, 33, hung on on Sunday to finish in a seventh-place two hours, 26 minutes and eight seconds. The result allows her to let go of the bad 2012 memories, which had left her reluctant to describe herself as an Olympian, she said.
"I can be proud of it now. Before it was something I just, like, didn't want to talk about, so I never brought it up," she said, wearing an ice vest to cool her body after the performance in 26-degree Celsius (79°F) heat. "I'll wear the T-shirt now. If people ask, I can have a story, and not be like, 'Yeah, I was there but not really."
American marathon runners of both sexes have struggled to win over the past decade, routinely losing top races including New York and Boston to Ethiopian and Kenyan rivals. The pattern repeated on Sunday when Kenya's Jelagat Sumgong crossed the line in Rio's Sambadrome.
Fellow Americans three-time Olympian Shalane Flanagan, 35, finished just ahead of Linden in 2:25:26, while Amy Cragg, 32, took ninth in 2:28:25.
"Three people finishing is something we haven't done in a long time, right? So three in the top ten is spectacular and I look at it as a testament to group training," said Linden, of Chula Vista, California.
She burst on to the U.S. running scene in 2011 when she finished second in the Boston Marathon to Kenya's Caroline Kilel, posting a 2:22:38 that stands as a record for American women at the 120-year-old race.
But Linden declined to say if she had her sights on a third Olympic performance in Tokyo in 2020.
"I'm not thinking that far. I'm thinking about my dinner," Linden said. That particular decision has already been made, she said: "Burger and a beer."

RIO DE JANEIRO The Australian swimmer who set off a chain of anti-doping comments at the Olympics says he has no regrets and nothing to apologize for after receiving hundreds of thousands of hate messages on social media.
Mack Horton, 20, called Chinese rival Sun Yang a "drug cheat" before defeating Yang and winning a gold medal in the  men's 400 meters freestyle final on Aug 6, inciting the wrath of Chinese social media users.
Yang, who took silver behind Horton, served a three-month ban in 2014 after testing positive for a banned stimulant. He said the stimulant was medication to treat a heart issue and did not enhance his performance.
"I do not think I need to apologize... I just said what is true," Horton told Reuters in an interview on Sunday. "I think people need to be more comfortable talking about doping in sport."
Following Horton's example, American Lilly King wagged her finger at the twice-banned Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and accused her of cheating before heats on Aug. 8, comments that were later supported by swimming legend Michael Phelps.
"I guess it worked because Lilly King was obviously more comfortable talking about it and so were other athletes," Horton said.
Doping has become a defining issue of the Games, with athletes more outspoken than ever before. The comments have increased tensions between Western athletes and those competing for China and Russia.
"It all get pretty out of control. I had 450,000 hate comments on one of my Instagram photos," Horton said.
Chinese state media called Australia "uncivilized" and "Britain's offshore prison", while the Australian Olympic Committee deleted thousands of vitriolic comments left on Horton's Instagram account.
Efimova, who won the right to compete after winning an appeal against a ban, said there were circumstances when athletes were unknowingly drugged and everyone deserved a second chance.
Horton disagreed.
"The bottom line is what you put in your body is your responsibility, he said. "If you are taking stuff that you do not know what it is, then really it is your fault."
Horton, who hopes to compete in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, said he was looking forward to seeing more of Rio and watching other sporting events now that swimming is over.
Not in his plans, however, is a visit to his rival's country.
"Yeah I'm probably not in a hurry to go to China," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Reports that U.S. Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte was held up at gunpoint during a party in the early hours of Sunday in Brazil are false, says the International Olympic Committee.
"I can tell you the story is absolutely not true," spokesman Mark Adams said at the Olympic Park, after receiving a message on his mobile phone.
"It (the message) is from USOC (United States Olympic Committee). It's a false story."
Fox Sports News had reported the incident, and quoted the swimmer's mother as saying the incident had been "terrifying".
USOC said it was finding out "truth and details".

RIO DE JANEIRO Russian track and field suffered a final humiliation at the Rio Games on Saturday when the sport's governing body suspended long jumper Darya Klishina, removing from competition the nation's only athlete to have so far survived a blanket ban for doping.
The suspension, announced three days before she was due to compete, relates to new evidence uncovered by an anti-doping probe into allegations Russia ran a systematic, state-backed cheating program, said a source familiar with the matter.
Klishina defended herself, saying she was clean and was appealing against the decision to sport's highest tribunal. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said it expected to rule on it by Monday, the eve of women's long jump qualifying round.
The 25-year-old had been given an exemption to compete in Rio while the rest of Russia's track and field team were banned from the Games by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in response to the doping allegations.
Ahead of the Games, the IAAF had deemed that the U.S.-based athlete was not involved in the doping program and had been subject to sufficient drug tests outside Russia. But the source said new evidence emerged, prompting the IAAF to pull her exemption.
"We have withdrawn her exceptional eligibility status which enables her to compete in international competitions based on new information that has been received," an IAAF official told Reuters, saying the athlete had been notified last week.
Klishina reacted strongly in a Facebook posting, suggesting she was the victim of a political conspiracy - echoing comments by President Vladimir Putin who has said clean Russian athletes have been targeted by a shadowy plot emanating from the West.
"I am a clean athlete and have proved that already many times and beyond any doubt. Based in the U.S. for three years now, I have been almost exclusively tested outside of the anti-doping system in question," she wrote.
"I am falling victim to those who created a system of manipulating our beautiful sport and is guilty of using it for political purposes.
"I cannot help but feel betrayed by a system that is not focused on keeping the sport clean and supporting rank-and-file athletes, but rather seeking victories outside sport arenas."
Russian Olympic chief Alexander Zhukov backed her up: "The situation with Darya Klishina appears to be cynical mockery of the Russian sportswoman by the IAAF."
The IAAF did not explain its decision to suspend Klishina from the Games. But her mother, Nadezhda, was cited by Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda as saying investigators claimed to have found scratches on containers used to hold her daughter's samples from the World Championships in Moscow in 2013.
A World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) probe, conducted by lawyer Richard McLaren, showed last month that Russian security officials had found a way to remove tamper-proof lids from test containers at the 2014 Sochi winter Olympics. This allowed them to swap dirty samples from Russian athletes for clean ones, but left incriminating scratch-like marks, the investigation found.

'I AM CYNICAL'
The IAAF barred the entire Russian athletics squad from the Rio Games even before McLaren released his interim findings last month, igniting world sport's biggest scandal in decades and threatening to split the Olympic movement.
Klishina was among 136 Russian athletes to appeal the ban and was the only one given the green light to compete in Rio.
The doping inquiry has cast a pall over the Games, fomenting what some have called an "anti-Russian atmosphere" in Rio and prompting the International Paralympic Committee to exclude Russia from its own Games next month.
Dmitry Shlyakhtin, head of the Russian Athletics Federation, said Russia had expected such a twist and that he thought it was unlikely the long jumper's appeal would be upheld.
"In general, I am cynical," he told Russia's R-Sport news agency.

RIO DE JANEIRO Rising Jamaican sprint star Elaine Thompson proved her mettle on the world stage on Saturday when she crossed the line a stride ahead of her nearest rivals including reigning Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce to snag the gold in Rio on Saturday.
Thompson had lingered in the shadow of two-time gold medalist Fraser-Pryce but proved in the final of the 100 meters that she had the power needed to win at the top level.
"I know I'm not the quickest out of the blocks, so holding that drive phase longer gives me that power that I need to have an advantage," Thompson, 24, told reporters after clocking a 10.71 second sprint, a mere 0.01 seconds off her career personal best.
The result came a year after Thompson took second in the 200m at the world championships in Beijing, as well as winning gold in the 4x100m on a team led by Fraser-Pryce and veteran Veronica Campbell-Brown, who Thompson edged in the 200m at the country's national championships in June.
"Jamaica has so many talented sprinters," Thompson said. "As long as it remains with Jamaica, I'm happy."
Thompson emphasized that she was not yet ready to celebrate, as she's also due to race the 200m and 4x100m next week -- the same suite that countryman Usain Bolt will take on in his bid for a historic "triple-triple" of gold medals in all three events for three consecutive Olympics.
The last woman to win gold in all three events was Florence Griffith-Joyner at the Seoul Games in 1988.
"I will celebrate after the 200 and 4x100m, and I will celebrate that one time," Thompson said.
The 29-year-old Fraser-Pryce, who claimed bronze, said she welcomed her team mate's rise.
"I am really happy for her. I've seen her work hard and it was her time," Fraser-Pryce said. "In 2008 it was my time, 2016 it is her time. I am happy that Jamaica gets to keep the gold medal."

RIO DE JANEIRO Jeff Henderson of the United States won gold in the men's long jump on Saturday, leaping 8.38 meters to snatch the title in the last round.
His win, edging out South Africa's Luvo Manyonga in the last round of the competition, gives the United States its 22nd long jump gold medal.
"It feels good to be in that category, to win that many medals. It feels surreal right now," Henderson told reporters at a news conference alongside Manyonga and dethroned London 2012 champion Greg Rutherford of Britain who took bronze.
As the reigning Olympic, World, Commonwealth and European champion, Rutherford had been favorite ahead of the Games.
In 2012 he stormed to the top of the Olympic podium in what British media later dubbed 'Super Saturday' when three British athletes win gold in the space of an hour.
But in Rio he scraped into the final, qualifying in 10th place, and could only jump 8.29 meters in the bid to defend his title.
"I never thought in my career I'd be disappointed with a bronze medal but I'm gutted," the 29-year-old told reporters, tears streaming down his face.
"Ultimately I didn't jump long enough today and that's very difficult for me to take," he said. "I've won a lot and today I haven't won, it's something I'm not used to."
Henderson and Rutherford put themselves ahead of the pack early in the competition, both jumping more than eight meters on their first attempts.
But Manyonga, who fouled two of his first three jumps, shocked the Brazilian crowd and his competitors with a distance of 8.28 meters in the fourth round.
Invigorated, the 25-year-old then flew 8.37 meters on his next attempt, putting him on course for Olympic gold.
"I knew I had something big in me. I felt it in me, it was growing inside," Manyonga said.
"I wanted to get more. If there was an extra jump, a seventh jump, I promise you, it would have been a massive one."
Henderson's victory was secured with his last jump, overhauling the South African by just one centimeter.
His American team mate Jarrion Lawson looked set to stage a last-minute upset and take a place on the podium, but a trailing hand in the sand cost him a medal.
"It felt pretty far," Henderson said of his medal-winning mark. "I knew it was the winning jump."


RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil beat Colombia 2-0 to move into the last four and a date with Honduras, while Nigeria and Germany both won on Saturday to set up an intriguing semi-final line up in men's soccer at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Brazil, who have never won the Olympic soccer title, were nervous, especially in a first half that had 21 fouls and five yellows cards, four of them for Colombia.
The visitors rarely tried to play, preferring to hack at their opponents and it was from a 30-yard free kick that Brazil took the lead after 12 minutes with Neymar curling the ball through a wall that disintegrated.
Brazil were the better team throughout and Luan got the second goal they deserved seven minutes from time when he lifted a sublime chip over the goalkeeper from 25 yards out.
"It was very important that we scored early and that helped us not fall into their trap of winding us up," defender Marquinhos told TV cameras after the game in Sao Paulo.
"We are very disciplined to not lose a goal and when we score early that allows us to open up a bit," he added.
"We held it together at the back and we played well."
Rampant Germany hammered Portugal 4-0 to set up a semi-final clash with Nigeria.
Serge Gnabry put the Germans ahead with an angled strike just before halftime and Matthias Ginter added a second with a commanding header from a corner 12 minutes into the second half.
Davie Selke got the third in the 75th with a goal that was almost identical to the first before substitute Philipp Max put the icing on the cake when he ended a sweeping move with a neat finish into the top corner three minutes from time.
Germany will face Nigeria in Sao Paulo on Wednesday after the Africans scored in each half to beat Denmark.
John Obi Mikel put Nigeria ahead after 16 minutes when he slotted home from the edge of the six-yard box after Imoh Ezekiel had set him up.    Aminu Umar doubled their lead with a glancing header that may have come off his shoulder from a corner after 58 minutes.
Honduras, seeking their first soccer medal in the Olympics, were inferior to a South Korea side that had 16 shots, compared to six for the Central American side, who got the only goal of the game after 59 minutes.
The speedy Romell Quioto ran the length of the field before feeding Alberth Elis who coolly side-footed home from 15 meters.
The Koreans pushed frantically for an equalizer but could not score.
The men's tournament is restricted to players aged under 23, though each squad is allowed to name three 'overage' players.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russia dismantled Ukraine to win their fourth fencing gold at the Rio Olympics on Saturday as the Americans took bronze over traditional powerhouse Italy for the second straight day.
Russia lost just one of nine bouts in the women's team saber final, trouncing Ukraine 45-30 to rack up seven fencing medals at the Games - their best performance in two decades.
"We would like to dedicate this medal to the athletes who were not able to compete in these Games," said Russian anchor Sofya Velikaya, referring to dozens of compatriots banned from Rio due to revelations of widespread doping.
Russia's biggest scare of the competition was a narrow semi-final win over the United States, who briefly took the lead when Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first American Olympian to compete in a hijab, exploded for 10 points in her last bout of the match.
The Americans fell just short against Russia, but earned the bronze with a clinical win over the Italians, following the example of the U.S. men's foil team on Friday. The women painted a diverse picture on the podium with pink, blonde and purple hair, plus Muhammad's Muslim headscarf.
"This is sport. It doesn't matter what hair color you have, what religion you are. The point is to go out there and be the best athlete you can be," said Polish-born Dagmara Wozniak of Team USA. "We're the best explanation of what America is: a mix of so many different cultures and races and everything all together."
The four fencing medals for the United States are second only to Russia so far, a testament to the growing American presence in a sport long dominated by Europeans.
American anchor Mariel Zagunis took her fourth Olympic medal and has now medaled at three Games, a new U.S. fencing record.

RIO DE JANEIRO Gregorio Paltrinieri of Italy won the Olympic gold medal in the 1,500 meters freestyle on Saturday after dominating throughout the race with a relentless display of technique and endurance in the longest event in the pool.
Connor Jaeger of the United States took the silver, and Italy's Gabriele Detti won bronze after overhauling Jordan Wilimovsky of the U.S. in the closing stages. But the winner never seemed in doubt after world champion Paltrinieri took the lead at 150 meters and wore down the rest of the field.
"It's incredible. Really. I have been dreaming of this moment since I was a child and it's amazing," the 21-year-old said.
"There was a lot of pressure on my shoulders. Italian people really wanted this gold and it was more difficult than I expected."
Having been on track through most of the race to beat the world record, he eased off slightly to clock 14 minutes, 34.57 seconds, 3.55 seconds outside the mark of 14:31.02 set by Chinese swimmer Sun Yang in London in 2012.
The winning margin was 4.91 seconds.
"At a certain point he just took off and I thought maybe I could try to hang with him but I couldn't," silver medalist Jaeger said.
"And then you have to hope -'Like man, I hope he is going fast, because otherwise I am really going pretty slow.'"
Breathing to the right after each powerful stroke, the Italian had stretched his lead to more than two seconds by 350 meters and more than three by 550, as Australia's Mack Horton and Jaeger led the chasing group early on.
Wilimovsky had moved up to second by 650 meters and it looked as though he and Jaeger would claim the other two medals.
Detti, the bronze medalist in the 400 freestyle on the first day of competition, caught Wilimovsky shortly after 1,300 and held on to take the bronze.
Australian Horton, gold medalist at 400, finished fifth, and Canadian Ryan Cochrane, silver medalist in 2012 and third in 2008, came sixth.
"Usually I am the one who goes out fast, so that's kind of when I knew I was in a bit of trouble – when he was able to go out faster than I was," Horton said of Paltrinieri.
"I tried to stick to Connor but I just couldn't."
London champion Sun failed to make the final after finishing 16th in the heats.

RIO DE JANEIRO Ester Silva curses the Olympic Games as another bus rumbles over a new elevated highway that passes by her slum in Rio de Janeiro, sending a tremor through her brittle brick house.
"That road ripped our little community in two," said Silva, 61, who has run a snack shop for 16 years from her home, gesturing up at a stretch of highway where an official Games bus was hit with stones this week as it traveled between venues.
"My home is crumbling, all for an Olympics that is not being put on for us poor, yet we are the ones paying the highest price," she added, pointing out large patches of plaster that have fallen away from her ceiling and deep cracks in the walls.
The 26-km (16-mile), six-lane highway was completed just ahead of the Games and connects the main Olympic Park and a cluster of other Games venues. The government described it as a Games legacy for western Rio, promising to use it as a major bus route for the area's many poor communities.
But residents of the Vila Uniao favela hate it.
A total of 368 families were relocated to make way for the Transolimpica BRT highway, and residents say the demolition of those homes and the construction works, just meters from their front doors in many cases, caused serious structural problems.
At least three Olympic buses have been hit by projectiles while speeding along a dedicated lane in recent days, a senior security source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter.
One bus was carrying a dozen journalists on Tuesday night when two of its windows were shattered by what some on board swore was gunfire but authorities later concluded were stones, likely shot at the bus by powerful slingshots.
In interviews with more than 15 residents and community leaders of Vila Uniao, none said they heard any gunfire when the media bus was hit. But all said they would not be surprised if the buses were targeted by rocks slung by young men in the community, acts denounced by the residents.
"We're an activist community, we've been fighting against the forced destruction of our homes for years," said Maria do Socorro, a 45-year-old beautician in the favela.
"If we wanted to protest, you would know it. We would barricade that road with burning tires."
The residents of Vila Uniao, which is just 2 km (a mile) from the newly built Olympic Village, are demanding that the city help repair the slum's 900 remaining homes, mostly tall, narrow terraces made from weak, locally made bricks.
They also want the city to meet a promise to provide basic sanitation to the community. All its household waste flows into a putrid stream which regularly overflows during Rio's rainy season, sending raw sewage into homes and streets.
The Rio mayor's office strongly defends the BRT highway as desperately needed public transport for the poorest communities of western Rio. "It's an important legacy for those who use buses daily," the mayor's office said in an emailed statement.
Critics say Transolimpica BRT highway, and other new highways built ahead of the Games, are inefficient modes of transport and point out that all of them run to the wealthy Barra neighborhood, home to the Olympic Park.
Barra is also the home turf of Mayor Eduardo Paes, who began his political career there and counts on it for strong support.
The University of Zurich's Christopher Gaffney, who has studied the impact of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games on Brazil, said the new highways were "retrograde". He said it would have been better to expand Rio's metro system to densely populated areas in the west and other needy areas.The government instead built an extension of the metro network linking the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood to Barra.
Watchdog groups say about 20,000 families have been relocated since late 2009 for Olympic and World Cup works and legacy projects. The mayor's office says 15,000 of them were moved because they lived in high-risk areas in danger of mainly mudslides and floods and does not consider them Games-related relocations.
"Funny how none of the rich areas in Rio are high risk, nor were the wealthy forced to leave communities where they had spent their whole lives," said Socorro, the beautician.
"Why is it the poor always pay the price for what the government calls the advances that Rio needs?"

RIO DE JANEIRO The United States won the men's 4x100 meters medley relay on Saturday after Ryan Murphy had given them a world record start that propelled Michael Phelps to a 23rd gold medal in his final Olympic race.
Britain took the silver medal and Australia bronze.
Phelps, who swam the third butterfly leg, ends the most successful Olympic career of all time with 23 golds, three silver and two bronze.
Murphy broke the world record for the 100 backstroke in the leadoff, clocking 51.85 seconds to eclipse the 51.94 that compatriot Aaron Peirsol swam in 2009.
Britain's Olympic champion Adam Peaty then swam the breaststroke leg in a scorching 56.59 seconds to move his team up from sixth to first place, with Cody Miller touching second for the U.S. at half-way.
A huge roar went up when Phelps hit the water for the butterfly and then caught and overhauled Britain's James Guy to hand a 0.41 second cushion to Nathan Adrian.
After the race, Phelps raised his alarms aloft to acknowledge the cheers from the crowd, while fiancee Nicole wiped tears from her eyes as she cradled their baby, Boomer, in the crowd.
The Americans finished in three minutes, 27.95 seconds, an Olympic record, to win by 1.29 seconds.
The U.S. have won the event at every Olympics since 1960, except the 1980 Games in Moscow which they boycotted.

American Ryan Moore completed a six-under-par 65 as darkness fell in Silvis, Illinois, on Saturday to carry a one-shot lead into Sunday's final round of the weather-hit John Deere Classic.
On a long day at soggy TPC Deere Run, where the second round was completed early on Saturday, Moore and his playing partners hustled through their last holes in fading light to avoid an early wake-up call to finish the third round on Sunday.
It was the second 65 shot by Moore on Saturday as he never got on the course on Friday because of the rain delays.
In the third round, Moore held off spirited charges by compatriots Ben Martin and Morgan Hoffmann, who both recorded nine-under-par 62s to reach 17-under 196 for a share of second place, three shots better than Johnson Wagner.
"It is dark," said Hoffmann, who finished earlier than Moore. "It is really dark, and the last few greens are getting really soft and bumpy, too, so it was hard to read."
Aided by the glow of light coming off the giant electronic scoreboards alongside the 18th green, Moore had a chance to gain one more stroke but lipped out his birdie putt at the last.
Low scores were readily available on the softened course where players were allowed preferred lies after 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) of rain drenched the layout over a 24-hour period.
Martin took advantage by starting the third round with five straight birdies and then closed with birdies on four of his last five holes. He rolled in a 44-footer from short of the green for a final birdie at the last.
"It was one of those days where all the putts were going in," said Martin.
Hoffmann, seeking his first PGA Tour win, briefly tied Moore for the lead late in the round as he rocketed up the leaderboard with six birdies in a row from the 11th before Moore birdied the 16th to regain the sole lead.
"It was great. Really exciting to make six birdies in a row," said Hoffmann. "Definitely fun."

RIO DE JANEIRO, August 13 Iran won their second gold medal in two days on Sunday when Sohrab Moradi finished well clear of his rivals in the men's 94kg weightlifting.
They could achieve a record-breaking three weightlifting golds at a single Games if favorite Behdad Salimikordasiabi retains his super-heavyweight title on Tuesday.
When Kianoush Rostami broke a world record in winning the 85kg on Friday he predicted more glory to come for Iran.
It arrived in the next event when Moradi won by 8kg, and with two lifts to spare, from Vladzim Sraltsou of Belarus and Aurimas Didzbalis of Lithuania.
"Now my wish is that Behdad wins his second gold medal, and makes it three for Iran," he said.
Moradi's total of 403kg was 15kg more than his best before a two-year doping ban in 2013.
"During those two years I was on my own at home training very, very hard," he said.
"People laughed at me, they said you're retired, you're banned but I had a goal and I worked hard for it."
Moradi said he did not understand why he was banned and denied having taken any banned substances. He tested positive for methadone and said it must have been administered to him as a painkiller without his knowledge.
Didzbalis, who has also served a two-year ban, might have mounted a stronger challenge but for missing his first two snatch attempts.
He also failed with his final clean and jerk, which he followed with a flying somersault.
"I only do them when I win a medal," he said. "If I had finished fourth you wouldn't have seen it."
The original entry list was shorn of three lifters because of doping.
Two Polish brothers, Adrian and Tomasz Zielinski, were sent home after samples taken before the Games came up positive.
Georgian Rauli Tsirekidze was excluded after testing positive in the reanalysis of samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.
There were two Iranians in the eight-man field and plenty of their countrymen to support them in a crowd of more than 5,000.
Hasem Ali, 24, made only two good lifts for a total of 383kg and seventh place.
Moradi, 27, had two attempts at a world-record clean and jerk of 234kg after his victory was assured, but never came close with either of them because, he said, he felt a strain in his right thigh.
"I am a weightlifter, they are weightlifters, they lost their chance to compete," Moradi said when asked about the bans from these Games of the Zielinski brothers and the 2012 champion Ilya Ilyin, from Kazakhstan.
"I am sad they are not here. I sympathize with them."

RIO DE JANEIRO Puerto Rico won their first Olympic gold medal on Saturday as Monica Puig clinched the women's tennis title at the Rio Games.
Puig beat Germany's Angelique Kerber 6-4 4-6 6-1.

RIO DE JANEIRO You might think weightlifting is a red meat kind of sport. Not so for the United States' Kendrick Farris, who competed in his third Olympics on Saturday - the first time as a vegan.
Farris, 30, made the switch two years ago after the birth of his second son. Despite the high protein levels needed to compete in the sport he has improved his performance and said: “I feel lighter, more focused.
“My wife laughed when I told her I was switching to a vegan diet but I am a very determined person. I wanted to return to the purest form of life because of my Israelite ancestors and that started with the food."    “Sure, I loved burgers before, but I love them still, made from mushrooms or beans," said the lifter, who came third in the B group of lesser-ranked lifters in the 94kg class.
Farris’ coach Kyle Pierce, a professor of kinesiology and health science at Louisiana State, in Farris' home town of Shreveport, said: "His becoming a vegan didn’t concern me in terms of his performance.
"He knows about mixing beans and rice and so on."
However, Farris, who holds four U.S. national records and won the PanAmerican Games gold last year at 94 kg, made only two good lifts in totaling 357 kg.
At one point in the clean and jerk, there were 10 misses in 12 attempts by various lifters.
There was another rarity in the B group when Britain’s Sonny Webster competed in a cap. “How about that, I might not have made a great total but I must be the first Olympic weightlifter to wear a snapback,” said Webster, 22.
He had to wear it backwards because if the bar had touched the peak it would have been a no-lift.
Webster made 333 kg and said: "The last 11 years of my sporting life flashed by out there when I made my total. It was the most amazing day of my life."

RIO DE JANEIRO Belarussian Uladzislau Hancharou upstaged world champion Gao Lei and 2012 Olympic gold medalist Dong Dong to soar to victory in trampoline gymnastics at the Rio Games on Saturday.
Hancharou performed four high-flying triple somersaults to become the first gymnast from his country to win a trampoline medal with a score of 61.745. It was also Belarus' second gold of these Games.
Fist-pumping his way through his out-bounce, the 20-year-old looked confident of success.
"It was an explosion of feelings," he told journalists after the competition.
A gracious Dong who had just packed a massive 25 somersaults into 10 skills sportingly gave Hancharou's performance the thumbs up when he realized he had been overtaken at the top of the standings by a man who had never before won a global meet.
Although the defending champion’s bid to win back-to-back Olympic golds ended with a second-place finish (60.535), 27-year-old Dong did become the first man to win trampoline medals at three different Games.
Gao had high hopes of succeeding Dong as champion as he had drawn the top score in qualifying. However, Hancharou's score had piled on the pressure and the group leader broke his lines and appeared to lose control slightly as he struggled to land on the big red cross target while showcasing his 10 elements.
The new champion’s victory may signal a changing of the guard in trampoline’s top flight.  Just minutes after taking the title the Belarusian’s sights were already set on a win in Tokyo while Dong hesitated to commit to the grind of another Olympic cycle.
“Right now I feel very tired and I don't know yet,” he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO From swimming to gymnastics, some of the biggest victories for Team USA in Rio have come from its women athletes, and swimmer Maya DiRado says having strong role models has been a key to their success.
U.S. athletes like gymnast Simone Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky have basked in the spotlight at the Rio Olympics, and DiRado thinks they in turn will become examples for the next generation.
"We just have a lot of strong women role models. Start in the White House, you have Michelle Obama who's kick-ass in so many areas of her life," DiRado told reporters on Saturday, a day after she won gold in the women's 200 meters backstroke.
"I think women's sports have been growing at such a huge rate for the past 30 years that it's been such an accepted part of the culture.
"I'm probably too young to know when it was different but I've always been encouraged and never thought that I couldn't compete," she said.
Biles dazzled the gymnastics world when she took gold in the all around on Thursday, her second after she and her "Final Five" teammates dominated the team competition earlier in the week.
Ledecky on Friday smashed her own world record in the 800 meters freestyle to complete a rare Olympic swimming treble, while DiRado herself won two gold medals, one silver and one bronze in Rio.
The women's soccer team was less successful, suffering a surprise early exit, but triumphed in the World Cup last year and won gold at the previous three Olympics.
DiRado said that a lot still needed to be improved in women's athletics but that girls growing up watching Olympics like the Rio Games would have confidence that they could be just as good as men.
"Little girls are going to grow up watching Katie Ledecky just destroy by crazy margins, and they're going to watch Simone do things nobody's ever done before," DiRado said.
DiRado also gave a shout-out to her swimming team mate Lily King. King made the news not only for winning gold in Rio but for publicly criticizing her Russian rival Yulia Efimova, who has served two previous doping-related suspensions.
"Having an opinion, and saying it and backing it up, and just being so gutsy, I think that's great and I think that's why women's sports are doing so well in this country," she said.

RIO DE JANEIRO From the beginning of the men's skeet semi-final on Saturday, there was something about Abdullah Al-Rashidi that grabbed the Brazilian fans.
Maybe it was his age, the oldest of the competitors at 52. Maybe it was the fact that the Kuwaiti was competing under the Olympic flag, his country having been banned from competition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
For Brazilian spectator Daniel Grillo, it was simply his "bigode," Portuguese for mustache.
"He looks so exotic with that mustache," said Grillo, a 24-year-old student.
With scores of other Brazilians in the stands, he shouted "Bigode" in a chant that would not be out of place at the Maracana, the soccer cathedral down the road.
And with a crowd-winning smile, Rashidi went on to win the bronze in skeet, his first medal in six Olympic Games.
"I feel like I am from Brazil and not Kuwait," said a grateful Rashidi, who is also a falconer. "Thank you Brazil!"
He thought it was a funny nickname, especially since his mustache used to be much bigger and is now just a finger-wide graying strip above his mouth.
Without a national uniform, Rashidi wore an Arsenal jersey for the competition, prompting the question of whether he was a supporter of the English Premier League soccer club.
"I don't know, I just bought it," he said.
Like his compatriot Fehaid Aldeehani, who won gold in the men's double trap event this week, he was sad that Kuwait's flag did not go up the pole.
"Anybody who doesn't see his flag, he dies," said Rashidi. "I need my flag, this is better for me. But what can I do?"
"Maybe after a gold and bronze we can compete again with our flag, inshallah (god willing)," added Rashidi.
The IOC suspended Kuwait in October 2015, accusing the government of interference in its national Olympic Committee.
Grillo did not even know that Kuwait was banned from the Games, forcing Rashidi to compete under the Olympic flag.
"That's really cool that he won then, I am so happy for him," said Grillo.

RIO DE JANEIRO Abdullah Al-Rashidi had to settle for bronze in the Olympic men's skeet competition on Saturday - but for choice of outfit, he beat the field.
The 52-year-old won his first Olympic medal in six Games sporting an Arsenal shirt: the English soccer club nicknamed 'the Gunners'.
The Kuwaiti had no official uniform to wear as his country was last year suspended from competing for government interference in sport.
But Al-Rashidi would not reveal if the choice meant he was a supporter of the north London Premier League club.
"I don't know, I just bought it," he said when asked about his unusual choice of attire.

RIO DE JANEIRO Argentina may not win gold in Olympic men's basketball but gave their fans the next best thing, beating bitter rivals Brazil 111-107 in double overtime on Saturday, to all but end the host's hopes of reaching the knockout round.
With the victory, Argentina (3-1) moved to the top of the Group B standings on seven points while Brazil sat fifth in the six-team pool on five points and little chance of advancing.
At the final buzzer, Brazil supporters, who had spent the final minutes chanting "eu acredito" (I believe), were left exhausted and stunned while Argentine fans celebrated, delighting in the particular cruel manner of their victory.
The game featured everything expected from two fierce sporting rivals with legitimate basketball pedigrees.
The pulsating showdown ebbed and flowed through four quarters and two overtimes that was finally decided when Manu Ginobili, who had a chance to end it in the first overtime with a last ditch shot, dropped two free throws with three seconds on the clock to put the contest out of reach.
"What had to happen, happened," said Ginobili. "I hope all the fans are just outside drinking beer now."
Andres Nocioni led the Argentines with 37 points, including a big three-pointer in the final seconds of regulation that forced the first overtime, while Facundo Campazzo contributed 33 along with 11 assists. Nene was Brazil's top scorer with 24.
"This match was close. There were all the fans, families here," said Argentina's Carlos Delfino. "We knew the game was going to be close just because of the atmosphere."
As with most Brazil-Argentina clashes, Games officials were taking no chances.
Before the game riot police took up positions under a nearby bridge and around the arena, keeping a discreet distance, while chanting fans lined up under a broiling sun hours before tipoff.
Brazil and Argentina are fierce soccer rivals - a longstanding sporting feud that hit fever pitch when Brazil hosted the 2014 World Cup and has shown no signs of easing with fans from both nations slow to embrace the Olympic spirit of friendly competition.
After a Rio Games opening ceremony that saw Argentina's delegation lustily booed, and a fight between a Brazilian and Argentine fan at a tennis match just days later, sport authorities from both countries met to discuss how to ease tensions.
Even the athletes have pleaded with fans to catch the Olympic spirit and take their soccer rivalry down a notch for other sports.
Before the opening tipoff on Saturday the two captains, Brazil's Marcelinho Huertas and Argentina's Luis Scola addressed the crowd telling them: "We are Latin America brothers. We are counting on you to celebrate the Olympic spirit".
The atmosphere was good natured for most of an entertaining afternoon but turned decidedly profane at the end as both sides unleashed a barrage of insulting soccer chants and songs.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russian whistleblower Yulia Stepanova's electronic account at the World Anti-Doping Agency has been illegally accessed, WADA said on Saturday.
The anti-doping body said a "perpetrator" had illegally obtained the password for the middle-distance runner's account, and accessed details which would normally include her registered whereabouts.
"The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirms that Yulia Stepanova’s password for WADA’s Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) was illegally obtained, which allowed a perpetrator to access her account on ADAMS," WADA said in a statement.
Stepanova, in hiding in North America, helped reveal the biggest state-backed doping program in Russia and was forced to flee the country with her husband for fear of her life.
As a result Russia's track and field team has been banned from the Rio Olympics while all Russian competitors in other sports had to prove they were clean by meeting several criteria in order to be eligible to compete in Brazil.
"The Agency noted that someone, other than Ms. Stepanova, had accessed her account. WADA immediately locked Ms. Stepanova's account to prevent further access and notified her of the situation," WADA said.
"A subsequent investigation by WADA allowed the Agency to determine that no other athlete accounts on ADAMS have been accessed."
All athletes have to enter their details into ADAMS and register a time and location each day when and where they can be reached by doping testers in case of an out-of-competition test.
Stepanova, praised by the international athletics body (IAAF) for her courage in stepping forward and revealing details on widespread doping in Russia, is still an active athlete and had attempted to compete in Rio.
The International Olympic Committee, however, refused to admit her as a neutral athlete, as proposed by the IAAF.
WADA said the incident came just days after what it said was "an alleged hack" of their website with some users receiving e-mails that looked as if they came from WADA urging them to enter their credentials.
"WADA quickly investigated and immediately sent an e-mail to all ADAMS users, including a warning banner on the ADAMS home page, alerting them to these e-mails, which WADA would never send, and asking them to advise ADAMS support immediately if they were to receive such an e-mail."

RIO DE JANEIRO Usain Bolt took the first "sluggish" steps toward his hoped-for Olympic triple-triple on Saturday when he eased through his 100 meters heat as the fans turned out in force to see the sport's superstar bring the athletics program to life.
After Friday's feeble turnout on a gray, wet morning, there were enough in the 60,000-capacity stadium to attempt a somewhat ragged Mexican wave in the Saturday sunshine, although there was no shortage of excitement to keep them occupied.
Much of it came from the unlikely source of the men's discus, where German Christoph Harting snatched victory with his last throw, four years after his brother Robert took the title in London.
Bolt was the headline act, however, even if his progress was a foregone conclusion.
Big-screen glimpses of him on the warm-up track brought roars of appreciation from the crowd and when the Jamaican entered the arena and clapped the fans they responded with a throaty roar of appreciation.
Bolt looked a little tight warming up, with possibly a barely perceptible limp, and he was slow out of the blocks, as he often is.
Into his running, though, he eased through to win the seventh of eight heats in 10.07 seconds.
"It wasn't the best start, I feel kind of sluggish. I think it's the fact that it's the morning," he said, having arrived at the track in good time for the early afternoon start.
"I’m feeling good, my leg is ok and I've got the first one out of the way so I'm happy about that. Now it's all about execution and getting it right.
"A lot of guys are running fast, so it's going to be some stacked semi-finals."
One of them is American 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin, likely to be Bolt's main challenger in Sunday's final. He was given a warm welcome despite his doping history and was the fastest qualifier in 10.01.
The discus produced a near-carbon copy of Friday's women's shot put drama which saw American Michelle Carter snatch an unexpected win with her final throw, leaving Valerie Adams with silver after the New Zealander failed to beat it with her last.
On Saturday, it was Piotr Malachowski sitting pretty with two throws left in the men's competition but Harting found 68.37 meters with the first of them and the Pole could not respond.
In the women's heptathlon, Nafissatou Thiam's 6.58 meter long jump was enough to edge the 21-year-old Belgian five points ahead of Britain's defending champion Jessica Ennis-Hill with two events remaining.
Later on Saturday, the women's 100 meters final includes Jamaica's Shelly-Anne Fraser-Pryce, bidding for a third straight gold while the men's 10,000m sees Briton Mo Farah seeking the first leg of a double-double and the heptathlon concludes.

RIO DE JANEIRO The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is disappointed that United States goalkeeper Hope Solo branded opponents Sweden as cowards after they knocked her team out of the women's soccer tournament, but will not take any disciplinary action.
The IOC, which on Friday launched a disciplinary commission after an Egyptian judoka refused to shake the hand of an Israeli opponent, said on Saturday that Solo's insulting comments came "in the heat of the moment" following a quarter-final defeat
"It is in heat of the moment. Passions run very high, people say things they then regret," IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.
"If those were the comments, it is disappointing. We can only keep talking about how athletes treat each other. People are free to say those things. We would not stop them expressing their opinion within boundaries."
Twice Olympic champion Solo was furious after the defending champions were beaten on penalties following a 1-1 draw on Friday, calling the Swedes "a bunch of cowards".
"I think we showed a lot of heart," Solo said. "We came back from a goal down. I'm very proud of this team. But I also think we played a bunch of cowards. The best team did not win today."
Solo is no stranger to controversy having been at the heart of domestic violence cases involving both her husband on the eve of their wedding as well as her half sister and nephew.
She also triggered the ire of Brazilian fans when she posted a picture with her face covered with a mosquito net and a jumbo bottle of insect repellent on Twitter before the Games, in reference to the mosquito-borne Zika virus.
"Not sharing this!!! Get your own!" the 35-year-old had written on Twitter. Brazilian fans greeted her with chants of "Zika" every time she touched the ball in her side's opening win over New Zealand in Brazil on Aug.3.

RIO DE JANEIRO In just one performance, Singapore's Joseph Schooling beat swimming great Michael Phelps, took home his city state's first Olympic gold medal and became an instant millionaire.
Known at home for smashing national records and taking multiple titles in regional competitions, Schooling had held the hopes of Singapore, a Southeast Asian island nation of less than six million, which had only won two silvers and two bronzes since it joined the Olympic fold in 1948.
"Its been a hard road, I've done something that no one in our country has done before. I've received a lot of support and that's phenomenal," Schooling told reporters.
"It's been a tough road, I'm not going to lie, the first guy through the wall, it's always bloody," he said.
Watched by his mother and president Tony Tan in the stands, the 21-year-old beat Phelps, South Africa's Chad Le Clos and Hungary's Laszlo Cseh in the 100 meters butterfly final on Friday, to grab the gold while the others completed a remarkable three-way dead-heat for silver.
Singapore has spent millions trying to win more medals at the Olympics, including offering a Foreign Sports Talent program which grants promising foreign athletes citizenship, as well as a S$1 million ($743,494.42) prize for gold medals.
Schooling left the country at 14 to train in the United States and now studies at the University of Texas in Austin, whose program is led by two-time U.S. Olympic men's head coach Eddie Reese.
He was inspired to aim for the Olympics as a six-year-old after a dinner conversation about his grand-uncle, Lloyd Valberg, a former national high-jumper who was also Singapore's first Olympian, according to local media reports.
"This moment is not about me, it's all about my coaches my friends my family that believed that when I was a six year old kid that I could do it," he said.
Schooling won Singapore's first medal at last year's World Championships in the 100 butterfly. He also broke two Asian records.
On Friday he set a new Olympic record of 50.39 seconds.
Like many of his contemporaries in Rio, who grew up idolizing Phelps, he keeps an old photo of himself as a bespectacled teenager with the American that was taken at a meeting in Singapore after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
"I'm excited just to see how much faster he goes," Phelps told reporters about Schooling.
"It's up to him where he wants to take it. As big as he wants to dream, as hard as he wants to work, to do whatever is in his head."



RIO DE JANEIRO Allyson Felix showed no discomfort from her ankle as she eased through the first round of the 400 meters heats on Saturday, taking another step towards what would be a fifth Olympic gold for the American.
Hampered by the injury she sustained this year in a freak gym incident, the 30-year-old Californian missed out on defending her Olympic 200 meters title when she failed to get in to the top three at the cut-throat U.S. trials.
That has made her bid to add the Olympic title over one lap to the world crown she already owns even more important and she started her campaign with a comfortable win in heat two, stopping the clock at 51.24 seconds after easing up over the last 50 meters.
"It feels good, I was focusing on first half," she told reporters.
"I've made good progress (with the ankle) since trials. It's fairly close to what it should be. Recovery is the key now.
"It's good to get out there on the track and get started. This race is completely different to the 200m. I just have to run hard and focus on doing the 400m now. I'll do my best."
Felix's time was only the sixth fastest of the morning behind a host of pretenders to the Olympic crown Sanya Richards-Ross will be unable to defend after suffering a career-ending injury at the U.S. trials.
American Phyllis Francis topped the time sheets in 50.58 seconds followed Bahrainis Oluwakemi Adekoya (50.72) and 18-year-old Salwa Eid Naser (51.06), a national record and personal best respectively.
Bahamian Shaunae Miller, who owns the best time of the year (49.55), also won her heat in 51.16 with the best European, Italian Libania Grenot, sixth fastest on the clock in 51.17.
"The race went good, I'm just fed up with this walk afterwards," Miller said of the complicated route the athletes have to negotiate through the media zone.
"Up so many stairs and then down so many. It's like a whole different workout."
All three Americans won their heats, Natasha Hastings came home in 51.31 to win the fifth race, as did Jamaicans Stephenie Ann McPherson (51.36), Christine Day (51.54) and Shericka Jackson (51.73).
The semi-finals take place on Sunday with the final on Monday.

RIO DE JANEIRO In the last decade, Jamaica, with Usain Bolt as the figurehead, has emerged as the world's dominant sprinting power, usurping the United States from the throne it occupied since the start of the modern Olympic Games in 1896.
After winning five golds over 13 Olympics from 1948-2000, things suddenly changed for the Jamaicans.
They started with double-gold in Athens in 2004, at the 2008 Games they won five of the six sprint events and they took four of six in 2012, claiming 10 of the 18 medals on offer.
Bolt has six of those golds, two each in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay and is seeking to complete an improbable treble-treble in Rio, beginning with the men's 100 on Sunday.
One man fascinated by the country's rise was Richard Moore, an award-winning cycling journalist and author, who had become hooked on the murky underworld of athletics when he wrote his acclaimed book "The dirtiest race in history," about Ben Johnson and the 1988 Olympic 100 meters final.
Moore was well-steeped in the issue of doping and the media's struggle to expose it after years on the cycling circuit and decided the Jamaican sprint phenomenon was something that could bear closer scrutiny.
He spent months investigating the scene, talking to athletes, coaches, anti-doping officials, and just about everyone else connected with the sport - although Bolt declined to become involved. The result was the "The Bolt Supremacy - Inside Jamaica's Sprint Factory", which is released in paperback this month.
Perhaps the sprinter was aware of Moore's broad motivation of seeking to break a career-defining story, and the Scot makes no secret of the fact that he traveled to Jamaica hoping to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
However, after two months of exhaustive research he came away with armfuls of fascinating material but not a whisper of a suggestion that Bolt's incredible achievements are illegally fueled.
"I felt that Bolt was this global figure who wasn't subject to much scrutiny outside the Olympic Games, because athletics isn't really a global sport beyond that," Moore told Reuters.
"There had been such a up-beat atmosphere at the London Olympics that it seemed that nobody wanted to spoil the party by asking about doping.
"I felt it hadn't been that well explored so I did a lot of interviews with a lot of the people he trained with and his coaches and found them pretty open."
Moore's research coincided with a dark period for Jamaican sprinting, with a succession of elite, champion athletes testing positive.

LIGHTER OFFENCES
Former world record-holder Asafa Powell, double Olympic champion Veronica Campbell-Brown and Olympic silver medalist Sherone Simpson were in trouble, albeit for "lighter offences" involving stimulants, and several cases were eventually overturned.
Moore concluded that those tests, and others, were an indication not of any sustained, organized system of doping, but of "stupidity".
"I think it was a failure of resources," he said. "Some of the anti-doping mistakes are not of a corrupt system but a under-resourced one where people are trying to do their best against the odds.
"I think if Jamaica tried to organize a systematic doping program their athletes would be caught on day one.
"Powell and Yohan Blake (in 2009) were probably stupid mistakes but you don't know if there is anything darker beyond that."
Instead of drugs, Moore ascribes Jamaica's remarkable rise to a more probable combination of factors, some physical but more cultural.
He likens the situation to that of rugby in New Zealand, a country whose world presence is virtually defined by the dominant All Blacks and where every child aspires to wear that famous shirt.
The excitement and sheer quality of "The Champs" where huge crowds watch the annual schools championship, are an indication of how deep the sport runs in Jamaican society and success at the highest level naturally spurs the next generation.
"There's nowhere else in the world where athletics is the number one sport," he said. "The incredible culture of athletics and sprinting there has deep roots."
He also says that pride extends to the exclusion of some dopers, pointing out that Powell is now based in the United States after effectively being drummed out of his home country by the outrage at his positive.
Moore's conclusion was that the country's extraordinary pride and identity in its sprinters is probably the key driver in its excellence, but the drip-feed of positive tests over recent years has left the case still open.
"I spoke to a lot of people," he said. "But just because I didn't find anything it doesn't mean it's not there."











RIO DE JANEIRO Katie Ledecky of the United States finally succumbed to her emotions on the podium after destroying the field in the 800 meters freestyle on Friday and smashing her own world record to complete a rare Olympic swimming treble.
Ledecky led from the start and inexorably stretched out the gap over her opponents to finish in eight minutes, 4.79 seconds, beating her previous mark of 8:06.68 set in Austin, Texas in January.
Britain's Jazz Carlin won her second silver medal in 8:16.17, and Boglarka Kapas of Hungary took the bronze.
Ledecky, defending Olympic champion at the distance, added to her golds earlier in the week in the 200 and 400 freestyle and the 4x200 freestyle relay, plus a silver in the 4x100 relay.
The only previous woman to win the 200, 400 and 800 freestyle at the same Games was American Debbie Meyer in 1968.
"I have to wait another four years to have this moment and I just wanted to enjoy it all and put my very best swim out there," Ledecky said after her final race in Rio.
She said that Meyer had sent her a video message of support via her mother before the race.
"I try not to think about the history of it much, but just to be mentioned in the same sentence as her is incredible," she said.
Ledecky sliced 1.89 seconds off her own record in the longest event of the women's swimming program.
It was the seventh world swimming record of the Rio Games, and the second by Ledecky, who achieved a similar feat in winning the 400 freestyle.
Since winning the 800 in London four years ago, she has been invincible, and anything but a victory for the 19-year-old would have been one of the biggest shocks of the Games.
Carlin and Kapas fought a dogged struggle for second, with Spain's Mireia Belmonte Garcia challenging them for much of the way.
Ledecky, who cried during the post-race media conference, said she and coach Bruce Gemmell had also burst into tears after the race.
Ledecky is moving to Stanford University later this year.
"Bruce doesn't cry very often but it was a very happy moment and it's been a pleasure to share this journey with him," Ledecky told the media conference, saying she would be setting ambitious goals once at Stanford.
"It's been a great four years and I know I can have another great four years and I know that I will have a lot of people supporting me."

RIO DE JANEIRO With crimson lipstick, eye-liner, mascara and a beaming smile, Michelle Carter on Friday won a stunning Olympic shot put gold to sprinkle a little glitz on an event often cruelly ridiculed for the shape of its women athletes.
Holding her nerve, the self-proclaimed "Diva" etched her name in the history books with a last-gasp throw at Rio. Now the bubbly, fashion-conscious American wants to change the perception of her event and the strong women who compete in it.
"I'm in a sport where people don't look at us like women, they don't look at us like being girls, or feminine," Carter said. "But I've been girly all my life and so I couldn't separate... between the sport and being a woman.
"I love hair, I love make up, I love fashion and I love throwing the shot put."
Female shot putters have struggled to shake off a brutish image from the sport's dark days in the 1970s and 1980s when some East German competitors were pumped with steroids, leaving them with masculine characteristics.
As the sport has become more technical in recent decades, the women slimmed in size but still remain larger than other track and field athletes and the snide remarks and stereotypes persist.
On social media and in person, 30-year-old Carter has often spoken out against body shaming and called for larger women to embrace their appearance, or as she puts it, "just have fun".
"One of my sayings is: look good, feel good, do good," she said. "If you are feeling good, you look good, you are confident about yourself, you are going to go out there and you will rock it."
A certified professional makeup artist, Carter also owns a small online business, "Shot Diva", selling make up packages.
"It combines two things that are part of me, the shot put and being a Diva. I love all these things: make up, hair, fashion, and just embracing my femininity, and I put it together," said Carter.

"YO DADDY, I GOT YOU"
When Carter hurled her last heave, she toppled New Zealand's two-time Olympics champion Valerie Adams and became the first American woman to win a shot put medal at the Games in 56 years.
On top of beating Adams, Carter also trumped her coach and father, Michael, who won a shot put silver in the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Now, she teased, the plan was to regularly remind him she went one better.
"I'm gonna be walking around the house saying 'yo daddy, I got you'," she told reporters afterwards, as Michael looked on and laughed in the audience.
Coach Michael built a successful American football career after his shot put silver medal, winning three Super Bowls with San Francisco 49ers. He remains the only athlete to have won the Super Bowl ring and an Olympic medal in the same year.
Though many athletes hail from sporting families, children of Olympic medal winners seldom soar to similar heights. For Michael, watching Carter compete in the final rounds was both nerve-wracking and exhilarating.
"As parents, we jump for joy, are happy, but as her coach, I'm responsible for what happens when she fails. But she finally succeeded," Michael told Reuters.
The path to success has not been smooth for Michelle Carter, who finished 15th at the Beijing Games, and then fifth at the London Olympics. Yet for Michael, both as her father and as her coach, the Rio victory was worth the wait.
"The coach has retired for this year and the dad is now just walking around happy, with his chest stuck out," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo called Sweden "a bunch of cowards" after they knocked the United States out of the Olympic women's football tournament on penalties on Friday.
"I think we showed a lot of heart," Solo told Sports Illustrated after the Europeans moved into the semi-final 4-3 on penalties. "We came back from a goal down. I'm very proud of this team.
"But I also think we played a bunch of cowards," she said. "The best team did not win today," she told the sports magazine, later confirming in a Tweet that she had made the comments after the match in Brasilia.
"Sweden dropped off. They did not want open play. They didn't want to pass the ball. They didn't want to play great soccer," she said.
"losing sucks. I'm really bad at it," Solo said in her tweet confirming and resending the comments she made to Sports Illustrated.
The United States were the better team throughout but Alex Morgan and Christen Press missed penalties after the game ended 1-1 after extra time.
It was the first time that the United States have not reached the Olympic final.
"The best teams in the world have to deal with inferior opposition that bunkers in and defends," former U.S. men's captain Alexei Lalas said in a tweet. "But they don't call them cowards."
Solo has regularly courted controversy and Friday's incident was not even her first in these Olympics. The Washington-born keeper was booed mercilessly by Brazilian fans angry at her comments on the Zika virus.
Several athletes chose not to come to Brazil citing Zika scares and Solo posted pictures on social media wearing a mosquito mask over her face and carrying industrial quantities of repellent.
She also indulged in what appeared to be blatant gamesmanship on Friday by calling for a new set of gloves immediately before Sweden's decisive penalty.
Solo, who played her 200th international last week, played well in her opening two games, with wins over New Zealand and France, but had a nightmare in the 2-2 draw against Colombia and was at fault for both goals.
She had little to do against Sweden as the United States struggled to break down their opponents, who tried to hit them on the break.
Stina Blackstenius put Sweden ahead on Friday after 61 minutes but the United States equalised 16 minutes later through Alex Morgan.
Neither side could find a winner in extra time and the Swedes qualified to meet either Brazil or Australia in the semi-final.

RIO DE JANEIRO Anthony Ervin of the United States reclaimed the mantle of fastest man in the water on Friday by taking the Olympic 50 meters freestyle gold medal 16 years after he first won it, and  by the slimmest of margins.
"I kind of laughed. It's almost absurd I was able to do it again," said Ervin of his immediate reaction to seeing his name with the number one against it.
France's Florent Manaudou, the defending champion, finished second and just 0.01 seconds behind the 35-year-old veteran, who won in 21.40 seconds in a splash and dash down the pool.
Nathan Adrian of the United States took the bronze in the shortest and fastest race on the program. He also finished third in the 100 freestyle on Wednesday.
"It was a very disappointing race. I flagged at the end. I did exactly the opposite of what I did four years ago," said Manaudou.
"Tonight I was hungry and I really wanted to win. Unfortunately, I wasn't the best today. I was the best in the heats but tonight he was better.
"I felt after 15 meters that the race wasn't going well, that I was too deep in the water and I couldn't get any speed. It's hard to come back after that."
The entire field was separated by just 0.68 seconds, with Ben Proud of Britain finishing fourth.
Ervin, at 35 the oldest swimmer to win a men's individual gold, won his first title in a dead-heat in the same event with team mate Gary Hall Jr at the 2000 Sydney Games. Both touched out in 21.98 seconds.
He later sold that medal to raise money for relief efforts after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
Asked earlier in the week what he would do if he won another, Ervin had replied: "I don't know. I'm living in the moment, man."
Heavily tattooed, and as the oldest man on the U.S. swim team making 31-year-old Michael Phelps look comparatively young, the Californian gave up competitive swimming in 2003 but returned for the 2012 Games in London.
Friday's medal was his second gold from Rio, the first coming in Monday's 4x100 freestyle. He also has a 4x200 freestyle silver from 2000.
"If anything, I was a little bit slower than I thought I was going to be," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Moments after becoming the first male swimmer to win an Olympic gold in the same event 16 years apart, 35-year-old Anthony Ervin said he would look to make the United States swimming team for the 2020 Tokyo Games.
He may have been joking. Or maybe not.
Ervin won his first gold in the 50-metres freestyle at the 2000 Sydney Olympics in a dead heat with compatriot Gary Hall Jr, before leaving the sport to pursue a love of rock music.
He even sold his gold medal to raise money for the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami.
With his arms cloaked in tattoos, Ervin -- now the oldest man on the U.S. swimming team -- returned to claim a second title on Friday by the narrowest of margins, edging out defending champion France's Florent Manaudou, by 0.01 seconds.
While Manaudou -- 10 years his junior -- said he was looking forward to some time away from swimming, Ervin was considering another Olympic tilt in Tokyo.
"I'm gonna try to make the team, of course," he told reporters. "I like being in an environment where I can try to swim to the best of my potential and I don't think that my age should limit me with that."
While the most successful Olympian of all time, 31-year-old U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps, insisted repeatedly he would not return in 2020, Ervin had no such qualms.
He said he had never thought of retirement despite finishing fifth in the 50 meters freestyle at the 2012 Games in London.
"Keeping going was an easy decision. I was enjoying what I was doing, so why stop," he said.
"It's been an incredible journey to think that after 16 years, I'm back on the podium at the Olympic games. But I credit it to the love and support of my people, my family."
Manaudou said that as a small child he had watched Ervin win gold in Sydney, and dreamed of becoming a swimmer himself.
"Even if I lost tonight, I am happy that he came back to win 16 years later," he said, but ruled out emulating Ervin's achievement.
"I'm going to take a three month break and if I want to swim after that, then I'll swim. For the time being, I want to party."

NEW YORK One last play in the field, that was all Alex Rodriguez wanted and with a 6-3 lead in Friday's ninth inning of his last game in pinstripes, Yankees manager Joe Girardi was able to make it happen.
"We want A-Rod! We want A-Rod!" the sold-out Yankee Stadium crowd of over 46,000 pleaded at the end of the eighth and out from the dugout Rodriguez emerged, trotting toward third base and the ball park shook with their standing ovation.
Rodriguez, 41, had thrilled fans with his talents for 22 seasons, the last dozen in New York including a World Series title, and sickened others with his doping offences, the last one wiping out his entire 2014 campaign.
Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner told A-Rod last week that he would be released after this game against the Tampa Bay Rays, with the club swallowing his $20 million salary for next year as they worked earnestly to shift to younger players.
"I'm going to savor every moment, every at-bat," three-time American League MVP and 14-time All-Star Rodriguez told reporters before the game.
A-Rod certainly enjoyed his first trip to the plate.
Given a standing ovation and the familiar chant of "A-Rod", he lined a run-scoring double up the gap in right-center off starter Chris Archer to score Brett Gardner from first to tie the game at 1-1 in the opening frame.
That was his only hit, but home runs by Starlin Castro and Aaron Hicks padded New York's lead to 6-3 and Girardi was comfortable giving A-Rod a last moment to cherish.
Rodriguez had been made a full-time designated hitter last year and this year as he struggled to make contact at the plate, was getting less and less play time, batting a woeful .199.
"I'm very grateful that Joe gave me the opportunity to play third. I hadn't touched my glove for a long time," said A-Rod, who stands fourth on the all-time home run list behind Babe Ruth, Henry Aaron and Barry Bonds.
"I haven't played a lot of baseball lately."
Reliever Dellin Betances took the pressure off Rodriguez by striking out Mikie Mahtook leading off the ninth and the ball park exploded again when Ronald Torreyes was sent to replace A-Rod, who received one more thunderous curtain call and a round of hugs from team mates who left the dugout to greet him.
"If this is the last time he plays, I wanted it to be something that would never be forgotten for him," Girardi said, sobbing with emotion.
"After the game I went up to him, shook his hand and gave him a big hug," Rodriguez said about the manager. "I'm forever grateful. That was a big moment."
Betances struck out the next two Rays batters to end the game, and A-Rod came out and collected some dirt from the third base area and put it in a baggie for a keepsake.
"I just wanted a little bit of a memory," said A-Rod.
Before the game, with the field covered by a tarpaulin for a threatened thunderstorm, the Yankees staged a modest tribute to Rodriguez with a video salute to him on the huge centerfield screen with family and friends joining him near home plate.
As he was being presented a base signed by team mates and a framed No. 13 Yankees uniform by owner Steinbrenner, a thunderclap boomed and a lightning bolt lit the Bronx sky.
"The ceremony, it was certainly like biblical," said A-Rod. "To hear the thunder crackle... You can't make this up. I guess we went out with a bang."

RIO DE JANEIRO She has ratcheted up a million Instagram followers, exchanged tweets with reality star Kim Kardashian and been splashed on the cover of major American magazines.
Teenage gymnastics phenomenon Simone Biles has vaulted herself to stardom with her bubbly personality and savvy use of social media - all while winning gold medals with the U.S. team and in the all-around women competition.
No stranger to the limelight before the Games, the 19-year old appears to have harnessed the Olympic spotlight to become a global sporting sensation, one cute Instagram post at a time.
"'Boa noite,' or 'Good night' in Portuguese,'' she chirped recently from Rio, posting a mirror selfie with fellow all-around women's finalist Aly Raisman in USA t-shirts, Biles donning a purple head wrap and Raisman buried under a face mask.
Already touted as the greatest gymnast of all-time, firecracker Biles soars during her moves - with one, a double layout with half-twist at the end, named after her - and has smitten judges, crowds and even her rivals during jaw-dropping performances in Rio.
That awe has spilled over to social media, with the Texas-raised teenager tweeting on Wednesday that she had surpassed one million followers on photo-sharing app Instagram and thanking her fans with an ''I LOVE YALL''.
Biles has also been raking in online praise from celebrities including pop star Taylor Swift and former teen idol Zac Efron, whom the giggle-prone gymnast has said she has a crush on.
"North is watching @Simone_Biles in awe!," U.S. celebrity Kim Kardashian also tweeted recently, in reference to her three-year-old daughter with rapper Kanye West. "She's rolling around on the bed pretending to copy her lol."
Without skipping a beat, Biles tweeted back that North merely needed a Simone Biles leotard from company GK Elite to be "my mini me!"

BALANCING ACT AHEAD
Of course, once the lights go off at the Rio Games, there is no guarantee Biles will keep her spot in people's hearts.
Gymnasts burst into the public eye every four years but, as they rarely make a splash at two successive Olympics, their stardom sometimes fades quickly.
The experience of U.S. team mate Gabby Douglas, who won the all-around women's gymnastics event at the 2012 London Games, suggests it is tricky to balance the surge in attention with intensive training.
After London, Douglas took a two-year break, starred in a reality TV show and switched coaches several times. She was shaky at U.S. trials in July and there was concern she wouldn't pull through in Rio although she has so far performed strongly.
Biles' supreme talent and work ethic may make her road ahead smoother.
In any case her compelling life story has already turned her into a media darling.
At the age of three, Biles was adopted by her grandfather and his wife because her biological mother battled alcohol and drug addiction and was unable to look after her.
The stability that her adoptive parents Nellie and Ron offered included enrolling Simone into a tumbling program in Texas after a daycare field trip to a gym -- a decision that eventually turned her into a 10-time world champion.
Swamped by camera crews and microphones after her triumph on Thursday, Biles distanced herself from the shining lights.
"I'm not a celebrity, I'm still just Simone," the 1.45-metre Biles told reporters. "But it's amazing to be recognized for all the success me and Team USA has had over these Games."

RIO DE JANEIRO Britain's women's team pursuit squad christened the Rio de Janeiro Olympic velodrome with a world record on the first day of the track cycling program on Thursday.
Shortly before the British men won gold in the team sprint in an Olympic record, the quartet of Laura Trott, Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker and Joanna Rowsell-Shand, clocked four minutes, 13.260 in the qualifying round of the 4,000m event.
It surpassed the mark of Australia (4:13.683) set at last year's world championships and threw down the gauntlet to world champions the United States who were second quickest.
Australia were third-fastest qualifiers.
The U.S. team led by Sarah Hammer, and boasting a unique bike with the chain on the left-hand side rather than the usual right, had threatened to go even quicker before slowing.
Hammer, desperate to win her country's first gold in women's Olympic track cycling, was not too concerned.
"It's a race over three days. We're super-excited and we've got the out for everybody," she said.
"That's what was expected. It's going to be even faster. World record, the Olympic Games, right?"
Britain were also fastest in the men's team pursuit qualifying with Bradley Wiggins, bidding for a British record eighth Olympic medal, looking in fine fettle.
Wiggins, who won road time trial gold in 2012 weeks after winning the Tour de France, returned to the track this year and was part of the squad beaten by Australia in the world championships in London.
Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Owain Doull and Steven Burke threatened the British world record set at London 2012 as the new track proved faster than some had been suggested in the build-up.
New Zealand's team sprint silver medalist Eddie Dawkins said the fast times were not surprising.
"Any track is fast when you're putting the fastest dudes in the world on it," he said.
"The Olympics brings the best out of people and everybody steps up to a new level."

SAO PAULO Police arrested two people on Thursday suspected of supporting Islamic State in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Police had arrested 12 people before Thursday's operation, all suspected of collaboration with Islamic State militants. Brazil's federal police said three others have been interrogated and later released. The two arrested on Thursday were Brazilians, but police did not provide names or other details.
Although Brazil has no history of conflict with known militant groups, the government has said the Games made the country a more likely target, particularly because of participation by countries fighting Islamic State.
Its militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and a U.S.-led coalition has conducted air strikes against them. The group has supporters worldwide who have carried out shootings and bombings of civilians.

RIO DE JANEIRO The United States show jumping team arrived in Rio determined to get back on a gold medal winning streak that ended in London in 2012, when the team finished off the podium for the first time since 2000.
Expectations are high from a powerful U.S. squad that includes four-time Olympians in Beezie Madden and McLain Ward, "stronger horse and rider combinations" and two impressive Olympic debutants in Lucy Davis and Kent Farrington.
"London was definitely a disappointment. Not only are we out for redemption but I think it looks good for our chances," said Beezie Madden, 52, who was part of the 2004 and 2008 gold medal teams.
"On paper we have a stronger team with better, stronger horse and rider combinations," she said on Thursday.
The team's new chef d'equipe Robert Ridland, who took over from his predecessor George Morris in 2013, agreed that U.S. medal hopes in Rio were lofty.
"All sports go in cycles -- we are in a bit of an up-cycle here and we hope to be able to take advantage of it," he told Reuters.
Show jumping is the last of three Olympic equestrian competitions, following eventing and dressage. Qualifying jumping rounds start on Sunday.
Concerns over the security of the Deodoro equestrian centre have increased in recent days, especially when a second bullet was found near the stables on Wednesday, prompting more soldiers to be sent to the venue.
"The security was notably enhanced today when we showed up," Ridland said. "Overall, they are doing a great job with the security. The state department, of course, is behind us with our U.S. riders and they have been in touch with us."
Asked what the riders thought of the Olympic atmosphere and whether they had seen anything else of Rio, Ward said the team had enjoyed the athlete's village but was mostly "focused on the job".
He added: "This is not a team here to just participate, we are here for the gold."

Following is a factbox on reactions to American gymnast Simone Biles winning all-around gold at the Rio Olympics on Thursday.

ALY RAISMAN, U.S. GYMNAST AND SILVER MEDALLIST IN ALL-AROUND
"Simone did amazing tonight as expected. I knew she was going to handle the pressure so well, and ... this whole week being here, she has been really calm and relaxed with people."
"No one goes in thinking they can beat Simone. People don't go in thinking they can beat Usain Bolt either. It's kind of the same thing."

SIMONE BILES
"I'm not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps. I'm the first Simone Biles."
"I had a good feeling when I woke up. I walked into Aly's room and said 'I have a very good feeling about today'. And She said 'me too'."

MARTA KAROLYI, U.S. WOMEN'S TEAM COACH
"I think she is right on the top (with Nadia Comaneci). Together, both of them. For me, the first Olympic champion and the last Olympic champion, they are together. They are special."
"In the future, she will be a big star. I am sure she will be a millionaire. And she well deserves this. She is a happy person, a bubbly person. She told me she will take a year off and go to the college and we talked about the importance of education even beside the big stardom and all of that."

KYLE SHEWFELT, RETIRED CANADIAN GYMNAST
"She flies higher than anyone, has bigger difficulty value than we have ever seen. But what I think, what is even more impressive is that she delivers in the big meets. It is one thing to come in with a lot of pressure and it is another to completely deliver and she gets better when the lights come on. She is the most powerful, dynamic gymnast I have ever seen."
"She is making history, she is breaking records left, right and centre. At theses Games, now that she has two medals, she could win another three. She looks very calm, very relaxed and very poised. She looks extremely prepared, so I think she is going to have a good run here at the Games. Her bags are going to be a lot heavier on the way home."

JORDYN WIEBER, 2012 OLYMPIC TEAM GOLD MEDALLIST WITH U.S.
"I'm tearing up!!! SO happy for you both @Aly_Raisman and @Simone_Biles. Nothing but beauty, grace, power, and class."

ELSABETH BLACK, CANADIAN GYMNAST, FIFTH IN ALL-AROUND 2016
"She's incredible. She is just unbelievable, an extraordinary athlete and person. She's going to continue to do well at these Olympics. She's definitely the best female gymnast who has ever been."

RIO DE JANEIRO The list of multiple-gold medalists in judo may be short but American Kayla Harrison never had any doubt that she would successfully defend her Olympic title.
At the Rio Games on Thursday, Harrison defeated France's Audrey Tcheumeo to become the first judoka to win two gold medals in the women's -78kg category, creating a legacy as one of the sport's all-time greats.
"I think it's really hard to repeat as an Olympic champion, I think it's one of the hardest things you can do," Harrison told reporters, lauding the job her coaches Jimmy Pedro and his father "Big Jim" did in getting her battle-ready.
"They pushed me to the point where when I showed up today, I knew that I had worked harder than everyone and no one was going to take it away from me."
Fearless -- like the name of the foundation she founded to support sexual abuse survivors like herself -- Harrison came out aggressive from the get-go and surged her way towards the final, shrugging off boos from a partisan crowd that was hoping for a gold for her longtime rival Mayra Aguiar of Brazil.
A final between Aguiar and Harrison, who held a 9-8 edge in their head-to-head record, would have been a dream match-up, but the Brazilian lost in the semi-finals and they never did meet on Thursday.
Instead, the 26-year-old American faced Tcheumeo in the clash for gold. Ahead on only penalties with seconds to go, she got her French opponent to submit on a hold for a match-ending ippon.
There has been much speculation over whether Harrison will compete in mixed martial arts but she declined to discuss her post-judo future in the immediate wake of her triumph.
"I'm just going to live in the moment and be Olympic champion," said Harrison, whose gold in London was the first by an American judoka.
But she left little doubt about whether she would continue in judo.
"I'm happy, I'm retiring. Two-time Olympic champion, that's it."
Aguiar and Slovenia's Anamari Velensek went on to take bronze.
Tcheumeo's silver, along with Cyrille Maret's bronze in the men's -100kg on Thursday, marked the third judo medal for France in Rio, but they remain without gold going into the final day of competition.
In the other men's medals, Lukas Krpalek of Czech Republic claimed gold, Azerbaijan's Elmar Gasimov won silver and Japan's Ryunosuke Haga won the other bronze.

LeBron James has signed a new contract to remain with his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers for the next three seasons.
Thursday's announcement, less than two months after James led the Cavaliers to their first NBA championship, had been widely expected.
"I'm re-signing back with the Cleveland Cavaliers, my hometown team," James said in a video posted on sports news website Uninterrupted.
"I can't be more excited than this opportunity once again, man, to defend our crown, defend our title.
"We all know last year as a magical, inspiring, all the words you can come up with, it was an unbelievable season. I just can't wait to get the group back together."
Agent Rich Paul told ESPN the new $100 million contract is for three years, with James earning $31 million next season, which would make him the highest paid player in the league.
His salary would rise to $33 million in the 2017-18 season.
The 31-year-old James, a four-time NBA most valuable player, won two championships for the Miami Heat before returning to the Cavaliers in 2014, leading them to the NBA finals where they lost to the Golden State Warriors.
The Cavaliers reversed that result this season, bringing the first professional sports championship to the Ohio city since 1964.

RIO DE JANEIRO United States gold medal hopes Nicholas Lucena and Phil Dalhausser relished Thursday's marathon victory against Italy's Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo, a performance they said put them in good stead for the knockout rounds.
With the sun setting over a windy Copacabana beach, the U.S. won 21-13, 17-21, 24-22 after both teams successfully defended match points in a third set that usually only goes to 15.
"It was a good test. They are one of the top five teams in the world, they're the future of this sport," Lucena said.
Nicolai and Lupo are 28 and 25 respectively, while veterans Dalhausser and Lucena are both 36.
Lucena and Dalhausser now move into the last 16. Their opponents will be decided by matches later on Thursday.










RIO DE JANEIRO South African Chad Le Clos has vowed to do all he can to take the fight to Michael Phelps one last time before the U.S. swimming great heads into retirement.
"I've got a clear head, I will respond," he told reporters after qualifying for the Olympic 100 meters butterfly semifinals.
"I've always said don't judge me when I'm running like a lion, judge me when my back's against the wall."
Phelps and Le Clos clashed last Tuesday in the men's 200m butterfly final, an event that Phelps lost to the South African in a stinging defeat in London four years ago but won back in style in Rio.
The American now has 21 Olympic gold medals and 25 in total.
Phelps has won the 100m butterfly for the last three Games, beating Le Clos to silver in 2012, but the South African has extra motivation this time.
"I need one more gold medal to become the best African athlete in the Olympics," he said. "I've got a gold and two silvers. I need one more gold to pass everyone else."
Casting his mind back to the 200m butterfly final, where he finished fourth, Le Clos said he was baffled by what happened.
"In my mind I was winning. With 10 meters to go I was winning. It was just like my body wasn't going and it was, like, what's going on here? It was the first time in my life it's ever been like that," he said.
"To lose in a 54.0 (1.54.06) is disgraceful from my side. I'm not the kind of guy that accepts defeat like this."
Friday's final could be the last individual race for the most successful Olympic athlete of all time, and the last duel with Le Clos providing both qualify.
Le Clos said he hoped Phelps, 31, might have a rethink, just as he did after retiring four years ago.
"If he can hang on for another year I would appreciate it so much," he said. "I'd love to race him again somewhere along the line in the 200 fly.
"He is the greatest of all time...he has always been in many ways my idol," continued Le Clos.
"But look, he's still in good shape. I'm sure he can continue."
The swimming world championships will be held next year in Budapest but Phelps has indicated clearly that Rio really is going to be his swansong.
"This is it. I’m swimming how I want to and this is a great way to finish," he told NBC.

RIO DE JANEIRO By most measures, like economics, technology or military might, Jamaica does not rival the United States. Not so on the track, where they stand as the superpowers of sprint.
All eyes will be on the two nations when the athletics program starts on Friday, with Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt looking to tie an Olympic record with an historic "triple-triple" of gold medal performances in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4 x 100 meters relay.
The three-time Olympian, due to turn 30 on Aug. 21, the last day of the Rio Games, has vowed that this will be his last Olympics and arrived in characteristically combative form, vowing that his U.S. rivals will "feel my full wrath."
"They have not learned over the years that the more you talk, the more I will want to beat you," said Bolt, who won the three sprint events at the 2008 Beijing Games and 2012 in London.
The Jamaican will need to match that brash talk with his best performance of the season to top two-time Olympian Justin Gatlin, 34, and 21-year-old Trayvon Bromell on his Olympic debut. Gatlin has clocked a 9.8 seconds for the 100 meters this year, while Bromell has notched 9.84 seconds, both better than Bolt's 9.88 seconds, well off the world record of 9.58 seconds he set at the world championships in Berlin in 2009.
That could interfere with the Jamaican's goal of tying the Olympic record of nine Olympic golds in athletics held by "Flying Finn" Paavo Nurmi, in the 1920s, and American Carl Lewis, a generation ago.
The rivalry isn't limited to the men.
Four-time U.S. Olympian Allyson Felix, 30, said it provides a powerful motivation for both sides.
"It's a highlight for us," said Felix, who has four career gold medals and aims to become the first woman to win five in athletics in Rio, where she has three chances in the 200 meters, 400 meters and the 4 x 400 meters. "We bring out the best in each other. It will be another great showdown."
Standing in the way of Felix's medal goals will be Jamaica's Veronica Campbell-Brown, with six career Olympic medals after a string of appearances dating back to Sydney in 2000. One more in Rio will see Campbell-Brown become only the second competitor to medal at five Olympic Games.
Jamaican athletics fans got a taste of what their post-Bolt team could look like at the country's Olympic trials in Kingston last month, which the Olympic champion skipped due to injury. That proved to be 26-year-old Yohan Blake's moment to shine, narrowly edging Nickel Ashmeade, also 26, to win the 100 meters.
Blake, who claimed silver in the 100 meters and 200 meters in London behind his more famous countryman, will be looking for his chance to step out from Bolt's shadow.

RIO DE JANEIRO American Kayla Harrison and Brazil's Mayra Aguiar stayed on course for a mouth-watering clash for gold between two of judo's biggest rivals as both advanced to the semi-finals of the Olympic women's -78kg category on Thursday.
Harrison, the reigning Olympic champion, has said it could be destiny to meet Aguiar in the final and urged Brazilian fans to bring on the passion -- and the partisan crowd certainly did not disappoint.
Boos rained down as Harrison took to the floor for her first match in which she dispatched China's Zhang Zhehui by pinning her down for an ippon in just 42 seconds, before she overpowered Hungary's Abigel Joo in the quarter-finals.
By contrast, Aguiar was greeted by thunderous cheers of "Mayra, Mayra," as she made similar quick work of her first opponent, Australia's Miranda Giambelli, in only 39 seconds. She then beat Germany's Luise Malzahn on a penalty to reach the semi-finals.
Harrison will face Slovenia's Anamari Velensek later on Thursday and Aguiar will meet fellow London bronze medalist Audrey Tcheumeo, who is targeting France's first judo gold in Rio.
The American has long been acquainted with Brazil's passionate judo fans and their support for Aguiar.
Harrison, who holds a slim 9-8 advantage over Aguiar in their head-to-head record, was famously booed by the crowd in Sao Paulo when she beat the Brazilian on penalties six years ago in the World Cup final.

RIO DE JANEIRO The man dubbed as the "Michael Phelps of gymnastics" proved that when it comes to showcasing skills across six apparatus there is no equal to Kohei Uchimura.
While other gymnasts have won more medals and more golds, most notably Belarus' Vitaly Scherbo -- who bagged a record six golds at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics -- no one has dominated the sport or maintained their levels of excellence for as long as the Japanese.
The 27-year-old has now scooped every Olympic and world all-around title since taking silver at the 2008 Beijing Games, a streak of eight successive global golds unmatched in gymnastics history.
"To keep it going for that long is just crazy," summed up Britain's Max Whitlock, who picked up bronze behind Uchimura and Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev.
"To stay at a level and at the top for that many years is a hard job. I feel very honored to stand on the podium with him."
In a grueling sport that seems to leave champions on the scrapheap faster than it takes Phelps use his giant wingspan to swim a 200m butterfly race, Uchimura's gymnastics lifespan defies logic.
The bad news for all his rivals is that he is still not done.
With Tokyo hosting the next Olympics, the all-conquering gymnast wants to keep going.
But what Wednesday did prove is that the chasing pack are now breathing down his neck as the margin of his victory over Verniaiev -- a tiny 0.099 of a point -- was too close for comfort and the narrowest of his eight all around victories.
It was no wonder Uchimura's mother Shuko could not handle all the tension and missed his moment of triumph as she fainted while watching from the stands of the Rio Olympic Arena.
"At one point, I felt I had lost," admitted the soft-spoken Uchimura, who has been immortalized in comic strips in his homeland and has an army of screaming teenybopper fans around the world.
Unfortunately for Verniaiev, all it took was one teeny-weeny little bobble on his dismount from the horizontal bar to lose to the man he called "the Michael Phelps or Usain Bolt of gymnastics".
"Competing with a guy who has not given up his title since 2009 is amazing. I’m quite happy I managed to make Kohei very, very nervous. He is a legend." said Verniaiev.
While touched by the high praise, Uchimura dismissed the comparison to his hero Bolt.
"I really hope gymnastics will be as famous as swimming by Phelps and running by Usain Bolt. But I am not in the same league as them," added Uchimura, who owns 26 world and Olympic medals, including 13 golds.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil beach volleyball great Larissa Franca had retired from the game when countrywoman Talita Rocha made her a offer in 2014 she could not refuse - playing in a home Olympics.
"I asked if she would play in this magical event ... an Olympics at home, an opportunity few athletes have," Rocha told Reuters after crushing Poland in straight sets in front of a cheering crowd at Copacabana beach on Thursday.
"I told her there would be an arena like this ... that people would be shouting our names," Rocha said. "I think it persuaded her."
Franca, 34, announced her retirement shortly after London 2012.
As a new pairing, she and Rocha have not lost a set in the pool stage and already look the fiercest challengers to stop the United States' Kerri Walsh Jennings from adding one more gold to her sweep of three from three previous Olympics.
Despite both enjoying glittering careers, Olympic gold has eluded the Brazilians. "We formed the team with the grand objective of winning gold," Rocha said.
The two complement each other, with Rocha taller at 1.81 meters compared to Franca's 1.74 meters. But more than the height difference is a differing attitude.
"The team combines her tranquility and patience with my aggression," Franca said.
Franca and Rocha are through to the final 16 as winners of Pool A.


RIO DE JANEIRO First time Olympic winners, including Australian teen Kyle Chalmers in the 100 meters freestyle, plundered three of the four golds in the Rio pool on Wednesday but there was no getting past Katie Ledecky.
On a night of novelty, with Mireia Belmonte becoming Spain's first women's Olympic swimming gold medalist and Dmitry Balandin winning Kazakhstan's first medal and title in the sport at a Games, freestyle phenomenon Ledecky provided consistency.
Swimming the anchor leg of the 4x200m freestyle relay, the American reeled in the Australian women and brought home her third gold of the Rio Games.
It also gave Missy Franklin, the now-struggling 2012 sensation, a first gold of the Games after she swam in the heats but not the final.
"I think I was prepared for any circumstance, whether we were ahead or behind. I just knew that these three girls were going to put me in a good position to finish it out and I knew I could do it," Ledecky said.
"It's so easy to get up and swim fast when you're swimming for three other people."
Olympic debutant Chalmers swam fast for himself, eclipsing better-fancied team mate Cameron McEvoy to take his first individual Olympic gold medal after claiming bronze in Sunday's 4x100m freestyle.
Trailing seventh at the turn, Chalmers powered through the field in the last 50 meters to become the first Australian man to win the event since Mike Wenden at the Mexico City Games in 1968.
The victory also made him Australia's youngest swimming Olympic champion since Ian Thorpe won gold at the 2000 Sydney Games aged 17.
"I have definitely flown under the radar," said the Australian of a win that took him by surprise.
"I flew under the radio at the trials, I stayed away from the media and just did my own thing.
"Coming into this, I didn't think it was possible," he added of the victory.

UNDER THE RADAR
Belgium's Pieter Timmers won the silver medal and defending champion Nathan Adrian of the United States the bronze.
Balandin said he had also flown in 'under the radar.'
"I think the whole of Kazakhstan is celebrating right now," he said of his 200m breaststroke win.
Belmonte won the 200m butterfly after an individual medley bronze on Saturday. She won two silvers in 2012 in the 200m butterfly and 800m freestyle.
In the heats for Thursday's women's 100m freestyle final, Australia's Campbell sisters Bronte and Cate will swim against each other after winning gold together in the 4x100m relay.
Michael Phelps was also back in action in the heats for the 200m individual medley, after winning two golds on Tuesday to take his career haul to 21.
Phelps, 31, is bidding to become the first swimmer to win the same event at four consecutive Olympics.
He and old rival and U.S. team mate Ryan Lochte were the fastest qualifiers.
Lochte, who has 12 Olympic medals to Phelps' 25, is swimming the 200 IM as his sole individual event in Rio.

MOSCOW Yelena Isinbayeva is to run for president of the Russian athletics federation (ARAF), the double Olympic pole vault champion said.
Isinbayeva, who is unable to compete at the Rio Olympics due to a doping ban on Russia's athletics team, said on Thursday in an interview with the ARAF's official website that she wanted to help her country's athletes return to elite competition.
The 34-year-old, who won gold in Athens and Beijing, is hoping to replace Dmitri Shlyakhtin when he steps down in November.
"The ARAF has a difficult path ahead in trying to return to international athletics," she said. "The fact that I was not allowed to compete in the 2016 Olympics will help me to try and make sure that the ARAF is a member of the IAAF again.
"I want our athletes to take part in international competitions. The chance to help Russian athletes return to the elite is a huge motivation for me and will be some sort of compensation for not being able to compete in Rio," she added.

Indonesian Rio Haryanto will stay with Manor as a reserve driver after being dropped from the race seat, the Formula One team said on Thursday.
The decision came a day after the team announced that Frenchman Esteban Ocon was taking Haryanto's place from this month's Belgian Grand Prix due to contractual issues.
Manor said Haryanto, who is backed by Indonesian state oil company Pertamina but needed to raise substantial sums to retain his seat, had accepted an offer to stay as a reserve for the rest of the season.
"Rio will be available to deputize should either race driver be unable to take part in an event," the team said in a statement.
"He will also be immersed in engineering meetings and PR activities as the team continues its support for his racing ambitions."
Haryanto became Indonesia's first Formula One driver in March. He started 12 races without scoring a point.
Ocon is backed by both Mercedes and Renault, where he was a reserve F1 driver, and will partner German rookie Pascal Wehrlein at Mercedes-powered Manor.
Manor, the smallest Formula One team but 10th of 11 in the current championship standings, signed Indianapolis 500 winner Alexander Rossi of the United States as their official reserve in March.
However, he said this month that he turned down an offer to race the rest of the season with them due to his IndyCar commitments.
"My management and I are in constant communications with Manor and we knew there might be an opportunity to race for the last half of the 2016 season," he told Autosport.
"We gave it careful thought but declined the race seat due to my IndyCar contract."

The leading women's doubles team of Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza have opted to end their partnership after suffering a slump in form following a trophy-laden 16 months together, the players confirmed on Thursday.
"After three grand slam victories and 11 WTA doubles titles together, we have mutually agreed that we would each be open to playing with other players for the remainder of the season," the pair said in a statement.
A former singles number one, Swiss Hingis partnered Indian Mirza for the first time at the Indian Wells Open last year and the self-styled "Santina" team went on to claim 14 titles, including wins at Wimbledon, and the U.S. and Australian Opens.
Since their 41-match winning streak was snapped at the Qatar Open in February, the pair claimed the Rome title but failed to advance beyond the quarter-finals in their last four events.
"Perhaps, because of out great past results, we have had very high expectations from our partnership and unfortunately did not get the results we desired recently," they added.
The pair will, however, reunite to defend their WTA Finals title in Singapore at the end of October.

RIO DE JANEIRO A year ago, Mireia Belmonte was injured and unsure whether she would even be able to compete at the Rio Olympics.
Now, after a come-from-behind victory in the 200 meters butterfly, the 25-year-old is the first female swimmer to win a gold medal for Spain and a contender for a fifth career medal if she qualifies on Thursday for Friday's 800 freestyle final.
"I didn't think I was going to recover and that it would be difficult to make the Olympics," Belmonte told reporters in describing her efforts to overcome two shoulder injuries last year. "But I made it and in the best possible way."
Admitting she was still nervous, the 25-year-old from Catalonia, a silver medalist four years ago, said she could not quite grasp her accomplishment upon exiting the pool after an enthusiastic crowd cheered her powerful finish.
"I couldn't believe it," she said. "I can't believe it now."
Australia's Madeline Groves, who began the race with a sizeable lead but whom Belmonte passed in the final lap of the race, took silver just 0.03 seconds behind.
"I knew that the second 100 meters were my forte," Belmonte said before recalling how difficult it was. "I suffered a lot in the last few meters."
Returning repeatedly to the pain and work that allowed her to heal and succeed at the Games, she said she sometimes still struggles to stay motivated. At times in her career, she has also been plagued by a sensitivity to chlorine.
"Some days it doesn't seem like it's worth it," she said.
But now, with one gold and the prospect of another medal, she is eagerly looking forward.
"It's what I dreamed about my whole life," she said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Freestyle queen Katie Ledecky won her third gold medal of the Rio Olympics by anchoring the U.S. women to victory in the 4x200 metres freestyle relay on Wednesday while struggling Missy Franklin opened her account without being in the water for the final.
Australia, who led until Ledecky dived in and turned the race around, took silver and Canada the bronze.
The U.S. were the defending champions but only veteran Allison Schmitt, who swam the leadoff leg in Rio, was in the race lineup from that London 2012 golden quartet that also beat Australia into second place.
Leah Smith and Maya DiRado swam second and third respectively before Ledecky, who won the 400 freestyle on Sunday and 200 free on Tuesday, brought home the gold with a typically powerful swim from behind.
Franklin, who won four golds in London four years ago but  suffered a dramatic loss of form at the U.S. trials, swam in the heats and collected a gold for doing so despite being dropped for the final.
So too did Melanie Margalis and Cierra Runge.
"It's such a great honour to be a part of a USA relay team," said Ledecky, still only 19 but the outstanding female swimmer on the U.S. team.
"I think I was prepared for any circumstance, whether we were ahead or behind. I just knew that these three girls were going to put me in a good position to finish it out and I knew I could do it," she added.
"It's so easy to get up and swim fast when you're swimming for three other people."
China led at the start before Australia, with Emma McKeon swimming the second leg, handed over in the lead to Bronte Barratt.
With DiRado closing in on Barratt but still behind, Ledecky had work to do and she went about it with a vengeance to take the lead with just over 100 metres to go and then powering home in seven minutes, 43.03 seconds.
Tamsin Cook touched out for Australia in 7:44.87 and Canada's anchor Penny Oleksiak finished close behind in 7:45.39 with China fourth.
DiRado's gold completed her set, having already earned a silver and bronze in the two women's individual medleys.
"I was so excited to get the call up today to be on this relay," said DiRado.
"It was a dream to be on a U.S. relay and to win gold. I'm just so happy I didn't mess it up and I gave Katie a chance.
"We've got the rainbow now," she added. "It feels really good."
The race may have been Schmitt's last swim but she was not ready to confirm anything.
"I am grateful for where I am right now, to be able to stand up there and hear our national anthem is something I am definitely soaking in," she said.
"I think my emotions are so high right now that I just want to soak that in and figure out the rest later."

RIO DE JANEIRO Japan's stunning run to the semi-finals of the inaugural Olympic sevens tournament has captivated the host nation of the next Summer Games and surprised even the players, leading try scorer Lomano Lemeki said on Wednesday.
Not content with upsetting sevens powerhouse New Zealand in the pool stage on Tuesday, the 10th-ranked Japanese knocked off world sevens series regulars Kenya and snatched victory over France with a last-gasp try on Wednesday.
Auckland-born Lemeki bounced over to reporters with a huge grin on his face after the quarter-final but was at a loss to explain what was going on.
"Honestly? I thought we’d come here, win a few games, give it a good go. I thought we’d be lucky to make the quarters let alone the semis. So I dunno what’s happened here," he said.
Pressed about what in the approach of the team was making the difference in Rio, the 27-year-old said he thought the lack of expectation was helping.
"We take it as it comes, we're feeling really good," he added.
"We're sort of playing with (the attitude) that if we lose, we lose, if we win, we win. A lot of boys are not playing sevens after this tournament, so just having fun with your mates, I guess."
Even the prospect of beating the mighty Fijians in the last four on Thursday for the chance to face off against Britain or South Africa for a gold medal was not beyond the Japanese, Lemeki thought.
"The way it's gone so far, I think we're still in with a big chance. Just need a few calls to come our way, maybe a few yellow cards and we could be in for a medal," he said.
"There's no pressure on us, the pressure’s on the big teams, they are the ones supposed to be winning the medals, not us."
Lemeki said the players had been instructed to turn off their phones because they were getting so many messages of support from Japan and their success had also raised their profile in the Athletes Village.
He was not sure he was making many friends back in New Zealand, however, after Japan's role in sending the All Blacks out before the medals rounds.
"Getting to the Olympics in itself is an achievement but to knock out New Zealand along the way is pretty special," he said.
"It feels pretty good, being a Kiwi, (but) probably one of the most hated ones at the moment."

RIO DE JANEIRO Olympic debutant Zach Garrett capitalized on the advice of U.S. team mate Brady Ellison to reach the last 16 of the Rio Games archery competition on Wednesday but does not expect to receive any more help from his more seasoned compatriot.
The pair face off for a place in the quarter-finals on Friday, another all-American match-up that will halve the nation's chances of winning a second medal at the tournament later in the day.
Garrett and Ellison combined with compatriot Jake Kaminski to grab silver in the team event on Saturday but their celebrations were tempered by a horror draw in the individual tournament, which saw them all placed in the same quarter after Friday's ranking rounds.
Three-time Olympian Ellison, the highest seed left in the draw, shared a regretful embrace with Kaminski on Tuesday after knocking out the man he won his first team silver with at the London Games.
After beating Canada's Crispin Duenas 7-3 in a thrilling duel in the rain at the Sambadrome, a sodden but fired-up Garrett said he was anxious about facing Ellison but felt the former world champion would also be feeling edgy.
"I'm nervous, I'm sure he's nervous," the 21-year-old told reporters under floodlights at the venue.
"I'm excited that one of us will definitely go into the next round, that's the best thing.
"We'll talk, we're team mates. Before this match he gave me advice and told me what he saw throughout the day of watching the matches.
"We'll wish each other good luck just like any other match, hope for the best and whoever wins, wins. It's archery, it's not life and death."
Garrett's team silver medal on Saturday thrilled the 800-odd residents of his home-town Wellington, Missouri, and the small-town boy has been a revelation in the sport over the past year, soaring to third in the world rankings.
While the formidable Ellison stands in his way, Garrett is unlikely to be overwhelmed, having shown an impressive poise at his first Games.
With Duenas pressing hard in the decisive set of their match, Garrison fired perfect scores of 10 with his last three arrows to close it out and enjoy an adrenalin-charged shot of confidence.
The final shot which sealed it, "felt great".
"I didn't know it was going to be in as I let it go but a half-second later I did," he said.
"I was very, very excited."



RIO DE JANEIRO Kohei Uchimura left it late - very, very late - before a heart-stopping final horizontal bar routine lifted him into the pantheon of greats as he became the first gymnast in 44 years to win back-to-back Olympic all around titles on Wednesday.
In the end, all it took was a razor-thin 0.099 of a point to separate triumph and disaster.
A day after the American women romped to the team title by more than eight points, Uchimura, Oleg Verniaiev and Britain's Max Whitlock provided the kind of edge-of-the-seat drama that tore everyone's nerves to shreds.
Going into the final round, it seemed as if the unthinkable would happen and the man who has been unbeaten in the event since picking up a silver in the 2008 Olympics would be knocked off his perch by Verniaiev.
In a high-quality contest devoid of falls and spills by the top contenders, Verniaiev led the standings from the third rotation and held a 0.901 of a point lead over the Japanese great ahead of their final apparatus, the horizontal bar.
When Uchimura, who fell from the bar during qualifying, earned 15.800 with his high-flying routine that drew a chorus of "oohs" and "ahhs" each time he performed one of his four release and catch maneuvers, it left Verniaiev needing to overhaul a target of 14.899.
Having amassed 15.133 in qualifying, the 22-year-old Ukrainian knew the gold was within touching distance.
Verniaiev raised his fist after completing his dismount with a wobble and clutched the Ukrainian badge on his vest as he urged the crowd to cheer him as he waited for his total to flash up on the giant screen in the Rio Olympic Arena.
When a score of 14.800 denied him the top prize by the narrowest of margins, he gave a rueful smile and raised both palms upward as if to say "What more could I do?"
There is not much you can do when you run into a man who is fast running out of fingers to count the number of all around titles he owns.
"Six world championships and two Olympic wins in eight years is a great victory. I've raised the bar," said the champion, who unfurled eight fingers one-by-one to confirm his haul.
Verniaiev simply could not have done more.
"I was so close to gold... but I’m quite happy I managed to make Kohei very, very nervous," quipped the Ukrainian.
"He is the Michael Phelps of gymnastics. Competing with a guy who has not given up his title since 2009 is amazing. I just want to be as close as possible to beat him. I'll beat him next time."
The only consolation for Verniaiev was that he had pushed King Kohei like no other challenger has during his remarkable reign - with Wednesday's victory marking the slimmest margin of all his eight global triumphs.
"He is the king of gymnastics. But I have come as close as possible to him as nobody has before," summed up Verniaiev.
Close... but not close enough.
Uchimura became only the fourth man, and the first since his compatriot Sawao Kato in 1972, to capture successive golds in the event that tests skills across six apparatus. The 27-year-old, who also won the team title two days ago, joins Kato as the only men to win three Olympic all around medals, with both owning two golds and a silver.
Uchimura won with a total of 92.365.
The battle for bronze was equally compelling as Whitlock trumped Russia's David Belyavskiy by a negligible 0.143 of a point to become the first British man in 108 years to win an all around medal with a total of 90.641.

Police are investigating an allegation that teenage British tennis player Gabriella Taylor was poisoned at Wimbledon last month, with her mother telling local media the 18-year-old had been "close to death".
Taylor spent four days in intensive care after becoming unwell during her girls' quarter-final match.
Her mother, Milena, told the Daily Telegraph that her daughter had been staying "in a completely healthy environment" and it was "impossible" for her to have become ill.
A police spokesman said the allegation was made on Aug. 5 "concerning a possible offense at an address in Wimbledon between July 1-10", according to British media.




RIO DE JANEIRO Golfers and gymnasiums do not always mix, but British Open champion Henrik Stenson has been pumping iron in the Olympic village in preparation for his opening round on Thursday.
Swede Stenson will be one of the favorites for gold on golf's return to the Olympic Games after a 112-year absence and while other top names have shunned the event, he is taking it seriously, regarding it as just below a major in importance.
"I was in the gym on Sunday evening and if you want to get motivated that is definitely the place to be," Stenson said after his practice on a rain-hit Wednesday.
"I didn't try and go for some dead lifts on 80 or 90kg when there is some guy holding 180kg straight up on both arms.
"I was sticking to my routines and exercises that I know I can do and looks good!"
Apart from the bi-annual Ryder Cup between Europe and the U.S., golfers play for themselves.
This week's action on the newly-built course on the Marapendi Nature Reserve will see them playing for their country, with no prize money at stake, just medals.
"It has a slightly different feel and it should have, it is the Olympics," Stenson told reporters.
"The beauty of this event is if you are third you are actually going to be leaving with something. If you are third at a major you get world ranking points and a nice check -- but I would definitely trade a third at a major with a bronze medal."
He is going for gold though and said in years to come no one would remember the players such as Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy who decided against making the trip.
"It is up there among the best things you can win for sure," Stenson said. "I think 10 years down the line you are going to look at who won the gold medal rather than who wasn't here."
The tournament will be run on traditional lines with four rounds deciding the medals.
Stenson is partnering Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee and Spain's Rafa Cabrera Bello on Thursday in the last grouping.

RIO DE JANEIRO The U.S. women's basketball team faced their sternest test of the Rio Games and tougher questions after beating Serbia 110-84 on Wednesday to remain on course for a sixth successive gold.
After winning their opening two games by an average of 52 points, the Americans had to settle for a more modest 26-point margin of victory against the 14th ranked Serbs.
But in the wake of a third consecutive blowout, and their 44th successive victory in the Olympics, American players were once again facing uneasy questions about the lack of depth, quality and competitiveness in the women's game and its place on the Olympic program.
"I don't even know how to answer anymore," said Diana Taurasi who scored a game high 25 points. "Would it (be) better if we lost by 50?
"We have 12 women who dedicate their lives to the game of basketball year around. To knock us for doing that?
"That's a bit disrespectful, I would say."
After two close losses to Spain and Canada, the Serbs (0-3) looked determined to at least make the U.S. work for the win.
In the end no amount of grit could save the 2015 EuroBasket champions from succumbing to the same fate as every other team that has gone up against the U.S. at the last six Olympics.
"They didn't win the European championship for no reason," said Angel McCoughtry.
"It might look like a big margin, but it doesn't feel like it. Those games are hard."
Having scored more than 100 points in all three games so far, the U.S. received offensive contributions up and down their lineup with all 12 players scoring, led by Taurasi who made six three-pointers.
In other Group B action, Spain eased past China 89-68.

WELLINGTON Former All Blacks lock Colin Meads, named as New Zealand's best player of the 20th Century, has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, New Zealand Rugby said on Thursday.
Meads, who turned 80 in June, has been ill for six months before the diagnosis was confirmed earlier this week.
"I've been crook for the past six months, and having all sorts of tests," Meads said in a statement.
"It's bloody hard for (wife) Verna, the kids and grandkids. The kids are all close to their mum and each other, and we'll come right together.
"Thank you to everyone for their concern."
Meads, known in New Zealand as 'Pinetree', played 133 games for the All Blacks in an international career stretching from 1957 until 1971. He played a then record 55 tests for the side and led them on 11 occasions.
At 1.92m tall, Meads was considered too short to play lock, but made 47 test appearances in the position, with his speed and ability to get wide in support of the backs making him the equivalent of a fourth loose forward for the side.
He garnered a reputation as an "enforcer" for the All Blacks in an era when the game was not subject to multiple television camera angles and numerous replays.
However, his athletic, no-nonsense playing style came to embody what many New Zealanders identify as being the ethos of the team.
"Colin remains a true legend of the game and it is with great sadness we hear of the seriousness of his condition," NZR chief executive Steve Tew said.
"We knew ...Colin had been ill for some time however the latest update on his condition is concerning to us all but we remain hopeful that ... Colin's strength and determination will help him through.
"Our thoughts, like so many others in New Zealand and around the rugby world are with him, his wife Verna and his family as he works through the next steps in his treatment."










RIO DE JANEIRO Damp beach volleyball players and a bundled up crowd found out the hard way on Wednesday that grim rain and wind can even beat down on Rio's picture-perfect Copacabana beach. 
Previous days' bikini-clad women and topless men were replaced by fans in anoraks and hoods, but still the mood was upbeat as pairs faced off in one of Rio 2016's most iconic venues.
Brazil is in the middle of the Southern Hemisphere winter, and bad weather also forced the Olympic rowing regatta to be called off.
Beach volleyball players, used to tricky weather conditions, largely shrugged off the light rain and temperatures in the low 20 degrees Celsius, but said the wind was an issue.  
"It made the game a little different, especially the wind," said Dutch player Marleen van Iersel, who wore long black workout trousers and a shirt to stay warm.
"If it's windy you have to adjust your game, keep it a bit smaller because the wind can blow away the ball," added van Iersel, who with partner Madelein Meppelink lost to Australia's Louise Bawden and Taliqua Clancy in a nail-biting match that ended 25-27 21-18 14-16.
Mother nature was no hindrance for Brazilian male favorites Alison Cerutti and Bruno Schmidt, who seamlessly beat their Italian opponents Adrian Carambula and Alex Ranghieri 21-19 21-16.
But under heavy rain after dark on Wednesday, their female compatriots Agatha Bednarczuk and Barbara Seixas were less fortunate, losing 17-21 20-22 to Spain's Elsa Baquerizo and Liliana Fernandez.
The public was stoic too, with about half of seats filled and crowds clapping along to Latin pop hits despite being soaked.
"Today the weather is not that great, but the play is great," said spectator Ola Ulmo of Norway, who bought a plastic raincoat outside the volleyball arena.

RIO DE JANEIRO As if she needed reminding, Kristin Armstrong kept finding little notes with the words "You are a champion" in odd places as she prepared for Wednesday's Olympic time trial.
And so it came to pass on the day before her 43rd birthday as she made light of foul weather on Rio's exotic coast to come out on top in the test of endurance and speed for the third consecutive Games.
But those notes drove her on, especially as they were written by U.S. team mate Mara Abbott, whose failure to win a medal in Sunday's road race when she was caught 200 meters from the line having led for the last 10km was sport at its most cruel.
"I thought about Sunday," Armstrong, who played a supporting roll for Abbott on Sunday and was the first to console her after she finished fourth, told reporters.
"I knew today I had to give it everything for my team and for Mara. The last 24 hours she has been leaving me notes. There was one on my coffee cup yesterday, I found another one on my hairbrush, last night there was one on my pillow.
"And this morning there was one in my podium bag. The support she has given me since her race is phenomenal.
"I feel this was the tightest team I've been on."
Armstrong returned from a second retirement in 2015 to give it one last go for Rio, having also quit the sport in 2009 to start a family. Son Lucas was seen hugging his tearful mom at the finish as the rain beat down.
"Mama, why are you crying?" Armstrong was asked by the 5-year-old who watched as she powered across the finish to win by five seconds from Russian Olga Zabelinskaya.
"That's a great question from a 5-year-old," she said.
"'Why am I crying? Because it's what we do when we're happy!' I'm going to have to explain that one to him a little later."
Armstrong said she still does not know if winning a third gold represented "closure" for her stop-start career.
"I think, of course, any athlete would like to come back and keep coming back, but there does come a point where you won't be able to perform at that level any longer.
"Tomorrow's my birthday and I think I've probably pushed it to the maximum level at the age I am."

RIO DE JANEIRO When you have become the world and Olympic champion in triple jump, arguably the most technically challenging of all athletics events, it seems a radical move to change your take-off leg, but for American Christian Taylor the switch is paying dividends.
Taylor won the world tile in South Korea in 2011, added the indoor world title in 2012 and completed a dream year when he triumphed at the London Olympics.
However, although he was still only 22, the relentless pounding had already taken its toll on his body, particularly his left knee, and he decided to take the risk of switching.
Now he lines up as favorite to retain his title, jumping further than ever, after going back to the drawing board.
"I was having a lot of patella issues with left knee," he told reporters on Wednesday. "It got to where I was focusing on coming out of competitions healthy instead of trying to strive for a world record."
So Taylor decided to switch things round, and of course initially had to go backwards to go forwards.
"It was far from easy. The biggest thing was the timing, so it was repetition, repetition," he said.
"It's a lot co-ordination. Timing and muscle development goes into it and in the 2013 world championships I didn't make the podium."
Gradually, however, things started to come together and after a "fun 2014" when he returned to the track to run some relays - including a 45.17 400 meters, he had mastered the new approach.
By the 2015 season he was not only jumping as well off his right as during his left-legged peak, but further, and in his first event he cleared 18 meters (59 ft) for the first time.
At the world championships later that year he improved to 18.21, second only to the world record of 18.29 set by Briton Jonathan Edwards in 2005, to claim his second world title.
"That 2015 was a game-changing year for me," Taylor said.
"There was incredible competition from (Cuban) Pedro Pichardo, he jumped 18 meters and he pushed me to raise my game."
Now he is in Rio seeking to become the first man since Viktor Saneyev completed his hat-trick for the USSR in 1976 to successfully defend the title.
"Triple jump is very special and to do back-to-back is very difficult," he said.
"It beats your body up and the biggest challenge is staying healthy."
Taylor, now based in the Netherlands after a spell in Britain, is injury-free at the moment and is targeting not only a second gold, but Edwards' world record.
"It's stood for so long because it was so special," he said of that remarkable leap in Gothenburg, Sweden 21 years ago.
"But trying to beat it and the excitement of the big championships is what excites me and my fire and passion is unchanged."

RIO DE JANEIRO Russia's Olga Zabelinskaya protested her innocence after winning the silver medal in the women's time trial on Wednesday, a week after almost flying home because a previous doping ban looked like ruling her out of the Olympics.
The 36-year-old Russian mother-of-three was beaten to the top step of the podium by American veteran Kristin Armstrong, missing out on victory by 5 seconds after a strong ride around the 29.7 km course.
Her participation had caused ill-feeling in the peloton, with British rider Emma Pooley saying she would refuse to shake Zabelinskaya's hand if she won a medal.
However, the Russian, who served an 18-month suspension in 2014-15 for testing positive for a banned stimulant, said she had never doped and that the fact she was breastfeeding her youngest child at the time of the test proved it.
"No, I never in my life," she told reporters when asked if she had ever doped.
"I am clean for myself, for my kids, for everything, when I got this problem with doping, I had my third child and I breastfeeded in this time.
"Any mother knows if you breastfeed you can't take any medicine."
After independent reports for the World Anti-Doping Agency found evidence of widespread state-sponsored cheating in Russia, Olympics bosses said no athlete with a past conviction for doping should be allowed to compete in Rio - a position the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled unenforceable.
Several Russians, including Zabelinskaya, were reinstated at the last minute but she said it had been a nervy wait.
"On Aug. 5, I had my ticket to go to Russia at 2 o'clock, and at 11 o'clock, on the way to airport, they tell me I stay here. It was two weeks like this, in the morning we go, in the evening we don't," she said.

START LIST
Armstrong, who embraced Zabelinskaya afterwards, steered clear of criticizing her Russian rival.
"I'm one person who doesn't make judgment so when I show up to the start line, if this is the official start list, this is who I am racing against," the 42-year-old said.
"I congratulate both competitors up here today for their great performance."
Australian Katrin Garfoot, who finished ninth, also preferred not to pass judgment, adding "karma hopefully will sort everything out that should or should not be out there".
Zabelinskaya tested positive for the stimulant octopamine while riding in Costa Rica in 2014 but the Russian cycling federation cleared her - a decision challenged by world governing body UCI at CAS.
Earlier this year, she accepted the ban, which expired in September 2015, rather than trying to clear her name with CAS.
"Of course I don't accept the ban, but I didn't go to CAS because I didn't have time for this," the double bronze medalist from London, told reporters.
"They find one octopamine, it's produced (in the) body, when you have some disease, it's seafood ... from this.
"We prove this with the biological and everything, and I didn't have time to go ahead with the (CAS) because I had to race, and if I don't race I don't get to go to the Olympics."

RIO DE JANEIRO Less than a week into the Olympics and people are looking tired around Rio de Janeiro.
That is not just the athletes, mind you, but the spectators trekking between hundreds of competitions across the sprawling city, where long commutes, vibrant beaches and alluring nightlife add to the exhaustion of actually watching the sports.
Catch a bus or subway back into town from one of the Games' many outlying venues, or merely walk around Olympic sites between events, and you will see people as spent as if they had completed a decathlon.
"I'm dead," said Rodrigo Escobar, a 24-year-old Argentinian who lay next to his father on a patch of grass after a handball match. "We were planning to go out tonight, but there's no way – we wouldn't have energy for tomorrow."
Part of the fatigue has to do with the logistics involved in such a large program, featuring more than 300 medal events, 11,000 athletes and venues that can be as far as 40 km (25 miles) from one another, as is the case if you wanted to catch beach volleyball and, say, canoeing in the same day.
But it also has to do with the fact that many visitors want to pack it all in, like an overeager toddler at Disney World or the first-time tourist in Paris hoping to see the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame in one day.
"People should know they have to pace themselves," says Duane Penner, a sales executive with Roadtrips Inc., a Canadian tour operator, who is in Rio with Olympic clients and says he tells them as much even before they leave home.
"You need to build some time in to rest or even take the sights in."

"KEEP GOING"
At a spectacle about endurance, though, many spectators are as singleminded as the athletes.
Consider Lorna Montgomery, a 54-year-old visitor from England who came with her husband, Billy, to attend events each day for the duration of the Games. Some days, they get home at 2 a.m.
From a rented room in the central neighborhood of Laranjeiras on Tuesday, they awoke at dawn to make a rowing event at a lagoon 45 minutes away by car, lunched briefly at a nearby shopping center and then proceeded another 90 minutes by subway and bus to watch basketball in the evening.
"It can be hard," Montgomery says, sitting with her husband on two towels they brought, along with water bottles and rain ponchos. "But you just have to keep going."
With fatigue in mind, organizers point to the amenities they provided for spectators, roughly a million of whom are expected to attend the Games by the time they end Aug. 21.
At the Olympic Park, more than 1 sq km of concrete that houses nine arenas for sports such as swimming, gymnastics and fencing, as many as 150,000 people are passing through daily. However enthusiastic they may appear inside the venues, cheering and heckling at an Olympics already known for its noisy crowds, many of them by nightfall are exhausted.
Late on Tuesday, as the sun set behind a multicolored tennis arena where Rafa Nadal had just won, visitors sprawled across astroturf swatches, some of them sleeping, some of them watching events on giant screens set up before them.
Nearby, a golf cart driven by an Olympic volunteer pauses at a stop on a circuit set up for elderly and disabled visitors to hitch rides.
"Even healthy people want to get on," says Marcos Bertão, the 58-year-old driver, who says he has to change carts every three hours, after driving the circuit dozens of times, to get a fresh battery. Just then, a coupled of middle-aged Brazilians, tired but hardly infirm, ask if they can get on.
"They're not supposed to," Bertão says, but then turns, relents and drives them toward the exit.

RIO DE JANEIRO World record holder Cate Campbell of Australia made quick work of the women's 100 meter freestyle heats at the Rio Games on Wednesday, leading the way to the semi-finals with an Olympic record of 52.78 seconds.
Campbell's sister Bronte, the world champion in the event, also went through comfortably as the eighth fastest with a time of 53.71.
"You're always a little bit nervous for your first swim so I'm really glad that that's out of the way," said Cate, the older of the two, who set the world mark of 52.06 seconds last month in Brisbane.
"It was a good heat swim and set me up for a good place tonight. Just looking forward to doing the rounds and keeping as calm and as relaxed as possible," she told reporters.
She made light of the Olympic record: "People have been going under 53 for the past three years, so it's not that big of an achievement."
Simone Manuel of the United States was second fastest in 53.32 seconds and Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom third in 53.37.
Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands, the defending Olympic champion, looked relaxed after going through in fourth place with a time of 53.43.
"It was an easy swim, a solid swim," she said. "I think I can go faster."


LONDON Adidas will open a new factory near Atlanta in 2017  largely operated by robots, part of a drive to shift production closer to customers and counter rising wages in Asia and lengthy shipping times.
The sportswear company has already started work at a similar factory in the southern German town of Ansbach. The two factories are each expected to produce half a million shoes for running and other categories in the medium term.
Founded by German cobbler Adi Dassler in 1949, Adidas had closed all but one of its 10 shoe factories in Germany by 1993 as it shifted most production from Europe to lower-cost Asia, particularly China and Vietnam.
But advances in robotics and automation means that Adidas can now bring production back closer to customers to meet demands for faster delivery of new styles.
"This allows us to make product for the consumer, with the consumer, where the consumer lives, in real time," brand director Eric Liedtke said, adding the factory would allow Adidas to customize more products for individuals.
Rival Nike, which has faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its footwear, promised last year to create 10,000 jobs in the United States in the next decade by producing more in its home market. Nike has also worked to improve conditions overseas.
Adidas has said the new plants would supplement rather than replace production in Asia, noting that Adidas currently makes about 300 million pairs of shoes a year and already needs to add two factories a year to keep up with current rates of growth.
The new U.S. factory will create around 160 jobs and is being operated by Oechsler Motion GmbH. Adidas is also working with German engineering group Manz to develop new automated production technology.

NEW YORK Longtime ESPN television host John Saunders has died at the age of 61, the cable sports network said on Wednesday.
Saunders, who worked for ESPN for 30 years, covered college basketball, professional hockey, hosted the network's Sports Reporters and co-hosted its SportsCenter show during the football season. The cause of death was not immediately known.
"John was an extraordinary talent and his friendly, informative style has been a warm welcome to sports fans for decades," John Skipper, president of ESPN, said in a statement. "His wide range of accomplishments across numerous sports and championship events is among the most impressive this industry has ever seen."
Hannah Storm, co-host of SportsCenter, tearfully read the "shocking and sad news" of Saunders' death on-air on Wednesday.
Saunders, who was born in Ajax, Canada, just outside of Toronto, was a defenseman in Montreal's junior hockey leagues and played at Western Michigan University, before becoming a broadcaster.
Saunders was an advocate for juvenile diabetes research and was a founding board member of the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research, ESPN said.
He also mentored aspiring reporters and spoke at the National Association of Black Journalists in Washington, D.C. last month.
He is survived by his wife, Wanda, and two daughters, Aleah and Jenna.

RIO DE JANEIRO American Kristin Armstrong became the first cyclist to win the same road event at three different Olympic Games on Wednesday, taking gold in the women's 29.7km time trial.
Here are some more landmarks she has reached.

* First female Olympic cyclist to win gold medals at three Olympics Games -- matching the male record held by Britons Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins, German Jens Fiedler and Russian Vyacheslav Ekimov.

* On winning a day before her 43rd birthday she became the oldest female Olympic cycling champion, breaking the record she set when winning in London.

* Second oldest Olympic cycling champion after Juan Esteban Curuchet (Spain) in the 2008 Madison.

* Oldest American Olympic cycling champion

* Three Olympic gold medals in cycling puts her second on the women's all-time list alongside France's Felicia Ballenger. Only Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel (4) has more.

French teenager Esteban Ocon will replace Rio Haryanto at Manor Racing for the rest of the season after the Indonesian driver failed to secure the financial backing needed to retain his seat.
The British-based Formula One team said in a statement on Wednesday that Ocon, 19, will make his race debut in the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps on Aug. 28 alongside Germany's Pascal Wehrlein.
Haryanto, his country's first Formula One driver, was offered the role of reserve for the remaining nine races.
"(Manor) has taken the decision to terminate Rio Haryanto's race contract after he was unable to meet his contractual obligations," the statement said.
Haryanto, who has been backed by Indonesia's state-owned oil company Pertamina, made his race debut with Mercedes-powered Manor at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in March.
However, his contract depended on raising substantial further funding.
"Some time ago his management indicated that they were experiencing difficulties honouring the obligations of that contract beyond (last month's) Hungarian Grand Prix," said Manor's racing director Dave Ryan.
"Rio's team have worked tirelessly to try to resolve that situation with his Indonesian backers and we have supported those efforts as much as possible, including allowing Rio to race in Germany.
"Unfortunately we reached a point where, in the best interests of the team, we were forced to explore other options for the remainder of the season."
While Ryan hoped Haryanto would accept the reserve driver offer, there was no immediate word from the Indonesian's management.
Haryanto failed to score a point in the season's first 12 races for the smallest team on the starting grid who are 10th overall in the standings after Wehrlein finished 10th in Austria in July.
Ocon has a contract with Mercedes, like Wehrlein, and has been racing for them in the German Touring Car (DTM) series while also carrying out a Formula One reserve role for Renault.
The highly-rated youngster won the FIA F3 championship in 2014 and the GP3 series last year.
"He is clearly one of the rising stars of F1," Ryan said.
Ocon said he was thrilled to be given his chance to debut at Spa, which almost amounted to a home race for him, and thanked Mercedes and Renault for making it happen.
"I've visited (Manor) already for my seat fit and to meet with the wider team, so we'll be ready to hit the ground running after the summer break," he added.

RIO DE JANEIRO There were a few wobbles here and there, even for Simone Biles, but those imperfections could not stop the United States from blowing away the opposition to capture the Olympic women's team title with a record margin on Tuesday.
Dubbing themselves the 'Final Five', Biles, Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman, Laurie Hernandez and Madison Kocian proved that they are an untouchable force in gymnastics as they tumbled and soared to victory with a total of 184.897 points.
In a sport where tenths of a point can mean the difference between a gold and no medal at all, their winning margin of 8.209 points was a blowout.
In fact there was only 4.601 separating silver medalists Russia from last-placed finalist Brazil. China trailed the Russians by just 0.685 of a point to finish with bronze.
The Americans' victory, along with the new moniker, was the perfect departing gift for retiring U.S. head coach Marta Karolyi, who burst into tears as she watched her adopted country win back-to-back team golds for the first time.
"I know it means the world to her... she was just so excited at the end ... she started crying, it was so cute," three-times world all-around champion Biles told reporters as she flashed a megawatt smile.
"We just thought the name was perfect because it is Marta's last year and we are the 'final five' for her and it is amazing to end it off with her like this."
Surprisingly the 19-year-old Biles, who is tipped to win five golds in Rio, earned the lowest mark of 12 performances for the Americans, drawing 14.800 on the asymmetric bars after hesitating for a split second midway through her routine.
Biles also had to whirl her arms around to stay on the balance beam after a sequence of three backflips left her wobbling on the four-inch wide apparatus.

OUT OF SIGHT
But despite those glitches, the 'Final Five' soared so far out of sight of their rivals that the other teams must have felt they needed to board a supersonic jet to catch them. And even if they did, it would have been a lost cause.
"We were trying for silver. That's what we were aiming for," summed up China's Shang Chunsong.
The collective strength of the Americans -- with Kocian securing the team's highest mark of the day (15.933) with her high-flying bars routine -- left Biles needing to overhaul a paltry target of just 7.591 with her final floor performance to secure the first Olympic gold of her career.
It was little wonder that her team mates were already hugging and whooping for joy even before she had begun her hip-swinging routine to the beats of Samba music.
Biles' explosive tumbling passes -- which included her trademark soaring double layout with a half twist at the end -- had the Brazilian crowd roaring their approval. When she completed her final landing, it was not a case of if the U.S. were champions but by how much.
A score of 15.800 confirmed the rout.
"We set the standard and we're not going down. We just improve the quality and everybody needs to follow us. If you try to run, it's hard to catch up," U.S. coach Mihai Brestyan said.
For Douglas and Raisman, it was a second successive team gold as they were also members of the triumphant 'Fierce Five' at the 2012 London Games.
"It feels amazing, especially to be alongside Aly ... we did this again and history again. It is just phenomenal," 2012 all-around champion Douglas said.
Before Tuesday, the previous biggest winning margin under the open-ended scoring system, which was introduced to the sport in 2006, came at the 2014 world championships when the Americans beat China by 6.693 points.

RIO DE JANEIRO Michael Phelps won two gold medals on Tuesday, avenging his 200 meters butterfly defeat from the London Olympics and then anchoring the U.S. 4x200 freestyle team to victory on a night of high drama and emotion in the pool.
Katie Ledecky of the United States won her second gold medal of the meeting and Hungary's Katinka Hosszu her third, extending their dominance of women's swimming in feats that on any other day would have grabbed top billing.
Instead it was Phelps, the most successful Olympian of all time, who stole the limelight, extending his career medal tally to 25 by adding golds number 20 and 21.
In the 200 butterfly, he touched the wall in one minute, 53.36 seconds to beat Japan's Masato Sakai by 0.04 seconds, with Hungary's Tamas Kenderesi taking the bronze. Chad Le Clos of South Africa, Phelps' conqueror four years ago, finished fourth.
Phelps, who had announced his retirement after London but launched a comeback in 2014, then celebrated by climbing into the stands to embrace his fiancee Nicole and kiss his baby son Boomer.
Seventy-five minutes after racing, he was back in the water to swim the final leg of the 4x200 freestyle after Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas and Ryan Lochte had built a lead of 1.76 seconds.
The Americans touched in 7:00.66, with Britain second in 7:03.13 and Japan in third after James Guy overhauled Takeshi Matsuda on the final leg.
For Phelps, the butterfly victory was especially sweet after the sting of the London defeat, where he misjudged his final lunge for the wall to let Le Clos steal the gold medal.
"I'm just thankful, that's for sure, I wanted that one back," he said.
"That event was kind of like my bread and butter, and that was the last time I'll ever swim it... There wasn't a shot in hell I was losing it. And if I did, every ounce that I had was left in the pool.
"Just being able to see the number one next to my name again one more time in the 200 fly - I couldn't have scripted it any better."

LEDECKY PUSHED
In the women's races, Ledecky, 19, pipped Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom and Australia's Emma McKeon to win the 200 freestyle, on top of her victory in the 400 on Sunday.
She is overwhelming favorite to add the 800 title later this week, an event in which she is totally dominant, and achieve a treble at those three distances that no woman has managed since American Debbie Meyer in Mexico City in 1968.
In what might qualify as a 'too much information' moment, Ledecky underlined how grueling the contest had been.
"Pretty sure that's the closest I've come to throwing up in the middle of a race," the teenager said. "I'm just so glad I got my hand on the wall first."
Hungary's Hosszu, who despite five world titles had come away empty-handed from three previous Olympics, won her third  gold medal with victory in the women's 200 individual medley.
The 27-year-old, who set an Olympic record of 2:06.58, had already won the 400 individual medley on Saturday and 100 backstroke on Monday.
Britain's Siobhan-Marie O'Connor took silver, with Maya DiRado of the U.S. winning a bronze to add to her silver in the longer distance.
Hosszu, the 'Iron Lady' who withdrew from the 200 butterfly earlier on Tuesday to prepare for the individual medley final, is entered in one more individual event, the 200 backstroke.
If she wins that she would equal the women's record of four solo swimming golds at a single Games set by East Germany's Kristin Otto in Seoul in 1988.

RIO DE JANEIRO Michael Phelps could add two more medals to his collection of 23 on Tuesday after being named in the U.S. lineup for the 4x200 meters freestyle relay after he has raced the 200 butterfly final.
The 31-year-old won gold in Sunday's 4x100m freestyle relay, the 19th of his Olympic career, and is the most medaled athlete of all time.
Phelps will swim the last leg of the relay after Conor Dwyer leads off, with Townley Haas and Ryan Lochte completing the lineup.
Lochte, 32, is an 11 times medalist, with five golds. The United States are the defending champions but Britain was fastest in the qualifying heats.

RIO DE JANEIRO In the world of elite women's gymnastics, where careers often last as long as the Olympic flame, American Gabby Douglas serves as reminder that fame can indeed be fleeting.
Douglas was the toast of the London Games when she lead the United States to the team title.
On Tuesday, however, she spent much of her time as a cheerleader, competing in just one of four apparatus as Simone Biles led the U.S. charge to a second straight title.
Douglas's reign as all around champion is also set to come to an end having failed to even qualify for a chance to defend her crown, which is widely expected to be placed on Biles' head.
Still there was history to be made in Rio on Tuesday as Douglas and team mate Aly Raisman became the first Americans to win back-to-back Olympic team titles, and that, the 21-year-old said, was something to cheer about.
"It was fine, when I was watching I wanted to encourage the girls as much as I can and when I was competing just contribute to Team USA as best as I could," said Douglas.
"It's just so special to have this bond with these girls and we all put in so much hard work so when the outcome is great you feel you accomplished something.
"It feels amazing especially to be alongside Aly we did this again and history again. It is just phenomenal."
If she misses the spotlight, Douglas has not let it show, earnestly encouraging her team mates from the sidelines much of the day.
But when called upon, Douglas also delivered.
Focused and stern faced, Douglas took a deep breath, leapt onto the uneven bars and 35 seconds later nailed her landing, giving a big smile, her work done.
"We never want to go into it like we don't have to try," said Douglas.
"We always want to do our best and deliver the best routines we can and have fun and enjoy these moments because they are so special, it's just amazing to compete for the USA.
"We always want to do our best and just shine bright, I feel like each one of us just want to have fun and not worry about the results.
"We want to work hard and deliver those prefect routines."

RIO DE JANEIRO Three days after taking their second silver medal in the men's team event at the Olympics, Americans Brady Ellison and Jake Kaminski shared another embrace tinged with regret after facing off in the individual tournament on Tuesday.
As both friends and top medal contenders in Rio, the pair had the misfortune to be drawn in the same quarter following the lottery of the ranking round on Friday.
They met in the relative cool of the late afternoon at the Sambodromo, having disposed of their first round opponents without too much fuss.
Former world champion Ellison prevailed 6-2 in a high-quality duel, his victory set up by a brilliant run of six perfect scores of 10.
On the brink of defeat, Kaminski dug deep to put 28 on the board with his three arrows in the final set but Ellison duly pipped him by a point to close it out.
"You know, it sucks," three-time Olympian Ellison, who won the first of his two team silver medals with Kaminski at the 2012 London Games, told reporters. "(It's) not really fun to shoot against a team mate at the Games.
"We want everyone to go forward and get a chance at the medal on the final day, but Jake and I drew each other and at least it was guaranteed for one guy to go through.
"That's all that counts -- if we still have an American in."
Athletes in the one-on-one duels of the individual event are usually joined on the shooting platform by coaches offering tips and encouragement.
But the Team USA staff withdrew from the battle field and Ellison and Kaminski went head-to-head alone.
"The coaches felt that we would turn it into a national tournament," added 27-year-old Ellison.
"Be easier for both of us to shoot like we were back home. Just go out there and beat each other up."
On Saturday, Ellison and Kaminski had hoped to claim the team gold they felt eluded them at the London Games, when they were off their best against champions Italy in the title-decider.
Teamed up with Olympic debutant Zach Garrett in Rio, the three shot well in Saturday's final but could do nothing to stop an inspired South Korea team from claiming the title.
Ellison's next match may also end up bitter-sweet for Team USA, with world number three Garrett a likely third-round opponent.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russia climbed to the top of the judo medal table on Tuesday as Khasan Khalmurzaev earned his country’s second judo gold of the Rio Games in emphatic fashion, thrilling the crowd at the Carioca Arena.
Ending his campaign with a bang, the European champion won his final two matches by ippon, judo's equivalent of a knockout, over Sergiu Toma of the United Arab Emirates in the semi-final and then American Travis Stevens in the final of the men’s -81kg category.
Russia had also won bronze in judo on Sunday, extending its strong run in the sport after claiming five medals total at the Olympics four years ago, including a London-best three gold.
Khalmurzaev had praise for Stevens and how he pushed him to victory.
“I know this opponent and I know he is strong, so I did all I could do to win this gold medal,” he said.
Khalmurzaev’s triumph ended Stevens’ dream of becoming the first man from the United States to win gold in judo.
Despite settling for silver, it was third time lucky for Stevens after he had come home without a medal from the Beijing and London Olympics.
Takanori Nagase won Japan's sixth judo bronze medal so far in Rio, though his country remains stuck on one gold – a figure that the traditional judo power surely wants to boost.
Toma won the other bronze.
In the women's -63kg category, Slovenia's Tina Trstenjak defeated Clarisse Agbegnenou of France to become her country's second Olympic judo champion.
After breaking Brazilian fans' hearts by topping Mariana Silva in the semi-finals, top seed Trstenjak handily beat Agbegnenou by ippon less than two minutes into the final.
Israel's Yarden Gerbi and Anicka van Emden of the Netherlands won bronze.
Agbegnenou's silver snapped a medal drought for France, seen as a top contender in Rio but which had come up short in the first three days of judo action.
"This medal does not have the right color, but it is still beautiful,” Agbegnenou said.
"I wanted to open the (French judo) medal count with a nice gold medal but the silver medal is not bad either.”
France is one of just three countries fielding a full team of 14 judokas in Rio and was hoping for a repeat of its strong performance in London four years ago, when it claimed seven medals - tied for the most with Japan.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russian swimming chief Vladimir Salnikov said on Tuesday the hostile atmosphere surrounding his Olympic team reminded him of the Cold War as sport, drugs and politics formed a toxic mix that is souring the mood of the Rio Games.
Doping scandals overshadowed the build-up to Rio and, far  from dying down as competition has got under way, have flared anew as U.S. and Australian competitors have branded their Russian and Chinese rivals as drug cheats.
Australia's delegation head Kitty Chiller said the country would not apologize to Beijing after freestyle champion Mack Horton leveled the accusation at his Chinese rival Sun Yang - a comment that prompted hundreds of thousands of Chinese web users to bombard Horton on social media with demands for an apology.
A similar drama played out between U.S. swimmer Lilly King and Russia's Yulia Efimova, who has twice been suspended for doping. Efimova was in tears after King beat her on Monday in the 100 meters breaststroke and declined to congratulate her after the race.
Resounding boos rang out around the Olympic Aquatics Centre for Efimova, and other Russian swimmers were also targeted.  Some Chinese spectators also jeered Australian swimmers.
"I think the whole atmosphere is very strange," said Salnikov, who won four swimming gold medals in the 1980s during a period of U.S.-Soviet tensions that prompted the two superpowers to boycott each other's Olympics.
He said the situation now was similar to the past "when we had the situation with the Cold War and everything was like Russia (versus) America and a lot of people were putting oil on the flame to make it higher".
"This is another round, but I think we will survive it," he told Reuters in an interview, complaining that "many people have a prejudiced attitude to our athletes".

"THEY DON'T LOVE US HERE"
More than 100 Russian athletes were excluded from the Rio Games after independent reports for the World Anti-Doping Agency revealed evidence of widespread state-sponsored cheating.
Russian officials have said their country is being singled out to punish it for its standoffs with the West over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.
Some Russian spectators in Rio say they sense hostility towards them.
"They don't love us here. They think we do all these bad things, that we are cunning and wicked," said Tatyana Omelchenko from the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk.
"There is definitely an anti-Russian atmosphere. We don't think it, we feel it," she added. "They're scared of us because we are strong."
Russia's Efimova was allowed to compete in Rio after winning a legal challenge last week against being excluded, arguing she had served her previous suspensions and should not be punished again.
China's Sun was revealed two years ago to have secretly served a three-month suspension for using a banned stimulant. He said it was medication to treat a heart issue and did not enhance performance.

RIGHT VS WRONG
Doping problems in sport are nothing new, but the direct attacks on rivals by two young, first-time Olympic champions - King is 19 and Horton is 20 - have dominated headlines during the first four days of the Games.
King, in particular, has been explicit in taking the moral high ground. "Standing up for what I believe is right, I felt like I had to perform even better tonight than I have in the past," she said. "It just proves that you can compete clean and still come out on top."
Michael Phelps, the most successful Olympian ever with 19 golds among his 23 medals, was quick to voice support for King.
Fellow-American Michael Johnson, a former 200 meters and 400m track champion, said nobody wanted athletes to be booed at the Olympics.
"But the simple answer to that is not to tell people to stop booing the athletes; the answer to that is to figure out how to keep athletes who have been doping out of the Olympics and out of the sport and handing down appropriate punishment," he said.
"Then people won't be booing athletes who are here that they feel like shouldn't be here. Athletes won't be pointing their finger and getting into these spats with other athletes."
Australia's Chiller said she welcomed the support of some of the American swimmers for Horton but did not want the controversy affecting her swimmers' performances.
"I think where the situation is now it's becoming a moral question versus a legal question," she said. "From our point of view, I don't want this to end up being a distraction, especially in the pool."

RIO DE JANEIRO Puerto Rico's Monica Puig collapsed in tears of joy after her shock 6-1 6-1 win over Spain's French Open champion Garbine Muguruza on Tuesday.
Puig, ranked 34 in the world, said the victory against third seed Muguruza was the biggest win in her career.
"I still have goosebumps," said Puig, who will play Germany's Laura Siegemund in the quarter-finals.
"I already know where I want to get and I'm letting the world know that I’ve arrived."
Muguruza, who lost in the second round at Wimbledon, said she was surprised by the intensity and quality of play by 22-year-old Puig.
"I was very shocked about how she played today. I think she played unbelievable. Also I didn't find the way tactically to beat her," she told reporters.
World number two and Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber faced fewer surprises in her match against Australia's Samantha Stosur, with the German triumphing 6-0 7-5 on way to a quarter-final meeting with Britain's Johanna Konta.
The highest seeds remaining in the men's tournament, Andy Murray and Rafa Nadal, progressed into the third round with ease.
Murray, who won singles gold at his home Games in London, outclassed Argentina's Juan Monaco 6-3 6-1 and will next face Italy's Fabio Fognini.
"I played pretty well, hit the ball good from the back of the court, not many unforced errors. It was a good match," said Murray, who is favorite to defend his title after Serbian world number one Novak Djokovic was eliminated in the first round.
The 2008 Olympic gold medalist Nadal overpowered Italy's Seppi Andreas 6-3 6-3 despite admitting over the weekend that he was still not fully fit.
"It was important to be playing like this. I’m enjoying (myself), I’m happy on the court," the Spanish third seed said.

RIO DE JANEIRO The U.S. men's golf team are hoping for a sweep of the medals as they prepare to encounter a variety of wildlife as well as windy conditions that could make the sport's return to the Olympics after 112 years a high-scoring contest.
While Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Matt Kuchar all arrived in Rio on Monday after competing at the Travelers Championship in the United States, Rickie Fowler has been in the city for several days and has played the course twice.
"It's all about what the wind does," Fowler said on Tuesday at a news conference. "I was playing on Sunday and had to basically stop playing because the wind was blowing so hard from the wrong direction.
"If winds pick up, shooting even par on the course will be nice," he said.
Par on the Olympic golf course is 71.
The course designer, Gil Hanse, has said the lack of trees promote wind movement and if Rio has its typical windy August conditions the course will provide a really tough challenge.
Fowler has seen a lot of wildlife on the course, which faced a land dispute and environmental challenges before the Games.
He said the exotic capybara rodent was a "decent size animal" that he would try to avoid but he was more concerned about caimans, a kind of alligator.
"We're not used to seeing caimans. Hopefully we don't have any encounters," he added.

CONFIDENT AMERICANS
Several leading golfers have pulled out of the Olympics because of fears over the Zika virus, including the world's top four -- Australia's Jason Day, Americans Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth plus Irishman Rory McIlroy.
But despite the high-profile withdrawals, the Americans still fancy their chances especially as they have the most players in the tournament thanks to the qualifying rules that favored golfers ranked in the top 15 in the world.
"It's a strong field. But we're the only country with a chance for a podium sweep," said Fowler.
The Americans have four players competing in the tournament compared with their rivals who have a maximum of two.
Fowler said the opponents to watch out for were Britain's Justin Rose, Venezuela's Jhonattan Vegas, Sweden's Henrik Stenson, Germany's Martin Kaymer and the Spaniards, Sergio Garcia and Rafa Cabrera Bello.
The men's event runs from Aug. 11-14 with a field of 60 competing over 72 holes and the top three claiming the medals.

RIO DE JANEIRO If some swimmers consider second place to be first of the losers, spare a thought for Ethiopian Olympic debutant Robel Kiros Habte.
By the time the chubby 24-year-old had emerged for air from his opening dive off the blocks in the 100 meters freestyle heats, he was already almost a body length behind and it did not get any better.
The only one of the 59 entrants in the heats not to complete the distance in under a minute, Habte touched the wall with a time 17 seconds slower than Australian pacesetter Kyle Chalmers who clocked 47.90.
Habte's only rivals in the three-man opening heat, Thibaut Danho of the Ivory Coast and Johnny Perez Urena of the Dominican Republic had removed their caps and were leaning on the lane markers as he trailed in more than 12 seconds behind.
The crowd, recognizing a valiant effort, raised a cheer for a man whose land-locked compatriots are considerably better known for long-distance running feats than any exploits involving water.
Habte acknowledged he had swum faster, his personal best being 59.08 seconds, and suggested morning training had left him feeling strained.
But he told Reuters he was delighted anyway.
"I am so happy because it is my first competition in the Olympics," said the Ethiopia-based university student, whose entry for Rio was secured on a special invitation from world body FINA extended to athletes from under-represented countries.
"So thanks for God."
If the performance attracted attention, so too did the swimmer's physique with some social media commentators highlighting his midriff in comparison to more finely-honed denizens of the Olympic pool.
They also recalled, somewhat unfairly, the exploits of Equatorial Guinea's Eric 'the Eel' Moussambani who struggled to complete the 100 meters freestyle at the 2000 Sydney Games.
Compared to Moussambani, who clocked out in one minute 52.72 seconds and more than 50 seconds slower than anyone else, Habte was motoring.
It may be some time before Habte is described as 'sculpted' or 'chiselled', and he has no plans on competing again, but he will always be an Olympian. For him, Rio was never about the winning, only the taking part.
"I wanted to do something different for my country, that’s why I chose swimming," he said. "Everybody, every day you wake up in Ethiopia, you run. Not swimming. But I didn’t want to run, I wanted to be a swimmer.
"It didn’t matter where I finished."

A federal appeals court on Tuesday said New Jersey cannot legalize sports betting, in a big defeat for supporters of the years-long effort to allow such wagers in the state.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said the 2014 law allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks violated the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, a 1992 federal law prohibiting the practice in all states other than Nevada, Delaware, Montana and Oregon.
"Because PASPA, by its terms, prohibits states from authorizing by law sports gambling, and because the 2014 law does exactly that, the 2014 law violates federal law," Circuit Judge Marjorie Rendell wrote.
The 10-2 decision is a defeat for Republican Governor Chris Christie, who has seen courts void two state laws, including one in 2012, designed to raise revenue through sports betting.
It is also a victory for Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, the National Hockey League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which opposed New Jersey's laws.
"We were relying on having sports betting to give a big boost to our ailing Atlantic City casinos and our suffering racetracks," state Senator Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat from Elizabeth who sponsored the 2014 law and a 2011 voter referendum allowing sports betting, said in an interview. "It's just wrong for Congress to deny New Jersey what the state of Nevada has."
New Jersey argued that its law amounted to only a "partial repeal" of its prohibitions on sports betting, did not "license or authorize by law" such betting, and could help curb the "thriving" black market in the practice.
Reflecting the stakes, two former U.S. solicitors general were on opposite sides of the case, with Paul Clement arguing for the sports organizations and Theodore Olson representing New Jersey.
"We are reviewing the opinion and considering our options," said Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for state Attorney General Christopher Porrino.
Clement was not immediately available for comment.
Nevada bookmakers made $231.8 million on sports betting in 2015, the state has said.
New Jersey's law banned wagers on state college teams and limited bets to people age 21 and older at casinos and racetracks.
Rendell acknowledged the law's "salutary purpose" in trying to revive those troubled industries, but said PASPA does not unconstitutionally "commandeer" the state.
The sports organizations, backed by the U.S. government, called the law "yet another attempt" to allow sports betting "only under the conditions of the state's choosing."
One dissenting judge thought the 2014 law permissible despite PASPA. The other thought PASPA was unconstitutional because it violated state sovereignty.
The American Gaming Association, an industry trade group, wants PASPA repealed.
"We do have two judges dissenting," Lesniak said, "and we certainly will take a shot at the Supreme Court."
The case is National Collegiate Athletic Association et al v. Governor of the State of New Jersey et al, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 14-4546, 14-4568, 14-4569.

NEW YORK It wasn't just Michael Phelps' big win on Sunday that had people talking about the U.S. swimming star. It was also the dark purple circles on his shoulders.
Phelps, who won the 19th Olympic gold medal of his career on Sunday and helped the U.S. men's team to victory in the 4x100 meters freestyle relay, is one of a number of Olympic athletes practicing "cupping," an ancient Chinese healing practice.
During the therapy cups are placed on the section of the body in need of repair to create suction. The method is said to  draw out any toxins, mobilize blood flow, soothe sore muscles and even help cure insomnia.
"I have done it for awhile but I haven’t had bad ones (marks) like this awhile though," Phelps, who in 2015 posted an Instagram photo of himself receiving the therapy, told reporters  on Monday.
"That’s where I hurt the most," he said of the marks on his shoulder. "I have done it before pretty much every meet I go to. I just asked for a little cupping yesterday because I was sore." 
The 31-year-old, raising a roar from the crowd on his first competitive appearance at his fifth Games after sitting out the heats, now has an unprecedented 23 medals with two silvers and two bronzes filling out his tally.
On Monday, there were nearly 300 posts per minute mentioning Phelps on Twitter, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.
U.S. gymnast Alex Naddour, 25, and Belarusian swimmer Pavel Sankovich are also fans of the procedure. Naddour posted a selfie with a big cupping mark on his shoulder last week, while Sankovich, 26, posted a photo on Instagram in June saying,  "This kinda Saturday morning. Cupping is a great recovery tool."
Actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and pop star   Justin Bieber have also been photographed with the distinctive large circles on their backs and chest.
However, while the therapy dates back to ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern cultures, it has been less popular among more skeptical Western medical societies.
"There is no scientific rationale for expecting any health benefit from cupping," the American Cancer Society said in a statement on Monday.
However, Jessica MacLean, acting director of the International Cupping Therapy Association, said she has seen a 20 percent increase in purchases of cupping therapy equipment and a 50 percent increase of healthcare practitioners seeking out their cupping certificates over the last three days.
MacLean, who receives cupping therapy daily and has been performing the procedure on people for 24 years, said she saw a similar trend after the “The Karate Kid” movie was released in 2010, which featured the therapy briefly.
“Every time we see something like this happen in the media, it piques people’s attention,” said MacLean. "When people get the treatment and they recover really fast, they don’t care about the scientific evidence - they just care that it works."

RIO DE JANEIRO As a dozen scantily clad Brazilian Samba dancers gyrated on to the stage, rocking peacock-style headdresses and glittery thongs, Usain Bolt was not about to be intimidated or upstaged.
Instead, the world 100 meters record holder hoisted his arms in the air and began moving to the Samba beats, delighting hundreds of journalists and photographers seeking a little sparkle to light up the Rio Games.
The contrast to every other press conference at the Rio Olympics was stark, showing once again that very few people on the planet transcend sport or command the world's attention in the way Bolt does.
Yet the scale of media interest in the 29-year-old has soared to new heights at Rio. More than 530 media members registered to attend the Jamaica team press conference on Monday, according to sportswear company Puma, Jamaica's team sponsor.
"Guys like Usain happen once every several generations. You cannot expect to hit the jackpot every four years," Carlos Laje, the Latin America general manager for Puma, told Reuters.
Laje said Bolt had a knack of producing "once in a lifetime moments in history", and drew comparisons with Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona, who delighted fans across the globe with his virtuoso performances at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.
"You've got to clap louder than that," Bolt cheekily told journalists as he walked on to the stage. "That was weak."
In the end, Jamaica's team conference morphed into an event focused on Bolt. Other athletes wheeled out to meet the press were mostly peppered with questions about what it is like to live, train and be inspired by the greatest ever sprinter.
"I don't have a question, I just want to say 'I love you,'" blurted out one Norwegian.
The journalist proceeded to serenade Bolt, rapping an ode to him in a Jamaican accent. Bolt demanded an encore so he could film it on his phone.
Moments later a Japanese TV personality, Teruhide Takahashi, thanked Bolt for an impromptu gift he had received ahead of the press conference: a pair of signed Puma shoes that Bolt wore once.
"I will treasure these forever," Takahashi told Reuters, referring to a pair of trainers two sizes too big for him.
As journalists from across the world hung to Bolt's every word and nearly 70 cameras filmed his beaming smile, the sprinter talked about his plans to retire and deprive the Olympics of its biggest star at the 2020 Tokyo Games.
Many hoped the Bolt show would go on. Even when the Jamaican said he would miss entertaining people at the Olympics, but not the media, they still laughed. They had been won over a long time ago.

RIO DE JANEIRO Lilly King of the United States won the Olympic gold medal in the women's 100 meters breaststroke on Monday, denying Russia's Yulia Efimova who was greeted with resounding boos from the Rio de Janeiro crowd.
Katie Meili of the United States took the bronze, with London 2012 champion Ruta Meilutyte of Lithuania fading in the second length to finish seventh.
There were loud jeers before the start of the race for Efimova, who has twice been suspended for doping offences.
The 24-year-old world champion won a legal challenge last week to get herself reinstated to the Olympics, having previously been excluded because of her doping record.
King swam a strong first 50 meters and led at the turn, with Efimova well back in fourth place. The Russian surged forward in the second half of the race and appeared to be catching her rival, but King finished powerfully in an Olympic record time of one minute 4.93 seconds, with Efimova 0.57 seconds behind.
"It just proves that you can compete clean and still come out on top," King said. Before leaving the poolside, she patted the Russian on the back.
Efimova, who after months of uncertainty learned only last Friday that she could compete, broke down after the race in front of reporters, crying into the arms of a friend.
"I can't say that I'm happy, it's just good that I was able to compete," she said.
"I can't remember the last time I slept properly ... I've been completely without sleep for the last month. The last three weeks in particular were horrendous."
The Russian said had wanted to win gold to prove her critics wrong.
"That's why I'm so upset that I didn't manage it, I knew that lots of people were counting on me."
After the victory ceremony, the two Americans wrapped themselves together in the Stars and Stripes flag, while Efimova stood awkwardly to the side.

BIGGER MARGIN
The margin was more comfortable than in the heats and semi-finals, where King had beaten her rival by 0.01 and 0.02 seconds respectively. Efimova was also jeered at both those swims.
Revelations of state-sponsored Russian doping overshadowed the build-up to the Olympics and led to more than 100 competitors being excluded, including the country's entire athletics and weightlifting teams.
Russia was banned on Sunday from the Paralympics that will follow.
Efimova was one of several Russians who successfully argued in legal appeals last week that having served their original doping suspensions, they should not be punished again for the same offense by being barred from Rio.
She was banned between October 2013 and February 2015 after testing positive for traces of the anabolic steroid DHEA, and also briefly suspended after testing positive for meldonium this year.

RIO DE JANEIRO Michael Phelps backed compatriot Lilly King's attitude toward Russian Yulia Efimova at the Olympics on Monday and said more people should follow her lead.
King, who beat the twice-banned Russian in the 100 meters breaststroke final on Monday, showed her displeasure at Efimova competing in Sunday's heats, wagging her finger at the Russian before she called her a drug cheat.
Efimova was only allowed to compete at the Games after winning an appeal against a ban for her previous doping.
"I think people should be speaking out more. You know I think (Lily) is right. I think something needs to be done."
Efimova has been booed every time she entered the pool deck at the Rio Games while King added fuel to the fire on Sunday when the pair exchanged angry glances before she told reporters she was not happy with the Russian being able to compete.
"You're shaking your finger 'number one' and you've been caught for drug cheating," she said. "I'm not a fan.
"If that's what she feels she needs to be able to compete, whatever, that's her deal.
"I'm here to compete clean for the U.S. and that's what I'm going to do."
Phelps was full of admiration for his 19-year-old team mate.
"You know, we have some tough young kids in our team and I think that's something special," Phelps said.
"It's kind of sad that today in sports in general, not just in swimming, there are people who are testing positive and are allowed back in the sport, and multiple times.
"I think it just breaks what sport is meant to be and that pisses me off."
France's Camille Lacourt, a three-times backstroke world champion, joined the chorus after taking fifth place in the 100m backstroke final, urging the international federation, FINA, to act tough on dopers.
"I am very sad to see how my sport is evolving. It's like I'm seeing athletics, with two or three dopers in every final," he was quoted as saying by French media.
"I hope FINA will react quickly and stop this massacre because it's becoming sad. They have nothing to do in sport. I'm disgusted to see athletes who cheated on a podium."

RIO DE JANEIRO The women's 100 meters breaststroke final at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on Monday had already crackled with tension in a tight finish but it was nothing compared to what transpired afterwards.
American Lilly King held off fast-finishing Russian Yulia Efimova to clinch the title, with fellow American Katie Meili winning bronze. King broke the Olympic record to win.
If the race itself was nail-biting, the aftermath was excruciating given King had stoked the flames beforehand, speaking out against the inclusion of Efimova after she successfully appealed a ban imposed for past doping suspensions.
After the victory ceremony, the two Americans wrapped themselves together in the Stars and Stripes. Efimova, who had broken down in tears, stood awkwardly to one side.
The three were then obliged to attend a joint media conference that was dominated by the issue of doping, especially since King had criticized the Russian for raising her finger in victory after winning her semi-final.
"You're shaking your finger 'number one' and you've been caught for drug cheating," she had told reporters on Sunday. "I'm not a fan."
With Efimova booed every time she stepped onto the pool deck, the pressure had been on the American to beat the Russian world champion, though the 19-year-old said she felt that any Olympic final was full of tension.
"Even just going in to your first Olympic final, any Olympic final for that matter, the pressure is going to be on," she said. "But especially standing up for what I believe is right, I felt that I needed to perform and do better than I had in the past.
"I do think it is a victory for clean sport and just to show that you can do it while ... competing clean your whole life."
Efimova told reporters that she had not slept for the past month as she waited to learn whether she would be allowed to compete in Rio.
That question was resolved only last Friday when she won her legal challenge against her exclusion by arguing she had served her suspensions and should not be punished again.
At the news conference, she spoke in a trembling voice and struggled to keep her composure as she acknowledged in broken English she had "made mistakes" and complained at the media coverage she had received.
She later switched to her native Russian when she was asked about her opponents' failure to congratulate her after the race.
"I perfectly understand athletes who do this," she said.
"But on the other hand I don't understand, because it always used to be that all athletes were above politics.
"It's really hurtful because now lots of athletes don't understand that, they simply watch the television and believe everything."
King, who did not have headphones to hear the translation, rolled her eyes while Efimova was speaking and defended herself for not shaking hands with the Russian.
"If I had been in Yulia's position I would not have wanted to be congratulated by someone who was not speaking highly of me," King said.
"So if she was wishing to be congratulated, I apologize. She had a fantastic swim and I always look forward to racing her, but I was really just in the moment celebrating with Katie."

RIO DE JANEIRO U.S. tennis powerhouse Serena Williams dispatched France's Alize Cornet in two sets on Monday, ending a streak of weak family performances that saw older sister Venus eliminated from singles on Saturday and the pair knocked out in doubles on Sunday.
The younger Williams, a 34-year-old four-time Olympic gold medalist, had a slow and frustrating start against Cornet before turning the momentum to win 7-6 (5), 6-2, picking up the pace in the second set after the first ran over an hour long.
"I just needed to relax. I was missing shots by literally centimeters," Williams said, adding that she "tried to add a little more spin" in the second set, after a long series of unforced errors in the first.
Spain's Garbine Muguruza topped Japan's Nao Hibino 6-1 6-1.
Earlier, Czech Republic's Petra Kvitova knocked out former world number one Caroline Wozniacki in the second round of the Rio Olympics on Monday, in another poorly attended tennis match on center court.
Twice Wimbledon champion Kvitova overpowered Wozniacki 6-2 6-4 to progress to the third round, where she will face either Russia's Ekaterina Makarova or Slovakia's Anna Karolina Schmiedlova.
"It was a tough draw for me. Petra played well today, really played aggressively and got me on my heels a little bit," said Wozniacki, ranked 53 in the world after an injury-ravaged season.
Wozniacki's participation had been in doubt as injury prevented her from fulfilling the minimum number of Davis and Fed Cup appearances required in a four-year Olympic cycle to qualify for the Games.
But she made it to Rio, where she was Denmark's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.
Germany's Angelique Kerber, ranked second in the world, faced stubborn resistance from Canada's Eugenie Bouchard but won 6-4 6-2.
United States' Madison Keys, seeded seventh in the tournament, also progressed to the third round after a nail-biting 7-5 6-7(4) 7-6(5) win against France's Kristina Mladenovic on court one.
On the men's side, Gilles Muller of Luxembourg beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-4 6-3.
Monday's matches, like most of the other contests in the first three days of the tennis tournament, were played in stadiums that were more than half empty.
Olympics organizers say about 82 percent of all Olympic tickets have been sold out, but for tennis, which boasts some of the world's most recognizable sports stars, attendance has been far below that level.

RIO DE JANEIRO Katinka Hosszu of Hungary won the women's Olympic 100 meters backstroke on Monday to claim her second gold of the Rio Games, edging out Kathleen Baker of the United States.
Canada's Kylie Masse and China's Fu Yuanhui tied for bronze, with the top four separated by just 0.31 seconds.
Australian world champion Emily Seebohm, swimming in an outside lane, set the early pace but Hosszu powered her way through the field in the last half of the race to touch the wall in 58.45 seconds.
Baker, who qualified fastest for the final, clocked 58.75, to finish 0.01 seconds ahead of Masse and Fu.
It was a second gold in Rio for Hosszu, the self-styled 'Iron Lady' of swimming, after her world record-breaking victory in the 400 individual medley on Saturday.
"It's really cool, I can't believe I've won the 100 back," the 27-year-old told reporters. "I know I've done the 100 back in the 400IM a million times and the goal was to make it like second nature when I came to Rio, which is how it felt.
"This time I was fresh and in great shape. I just focused on the execution and was not worrying about where I came."
Hosszu, who is also swimming in the 200 backstroke, butterfly and medley, had come away empty-handed from three previous Olympics, despite winning five world championships titles.
Seebohm, silver medalist in London in 2012, had achieved the second-fastest time in the heats but qualified for the final in seventh.
She faded in the closing stages on Monday to finish seventh.
Missy Franklin of the United States, the 2012 Olympic champion at 100, was reduced to a spectator, having failed to qualify in the event for Rio at the U.S. trials.
Franklin was in tears earlier after failing to make the final of the 200 freestyle, but has another chance in the 200 backstroke, in which she also won gold in London.

RIO DE JANEIRO Ryan Murphy won the men's 100 meters backstroke gold at the Rio Olympics on Monday to extend United States swimmers' run of domination in the event to six successive Games dating back to Atlanta in 1996.
China's Xu Jiayu took the silver -- his country's first male Olympic medalist in backstroke -- and David Plummer, making his Games debut at the age of 30, secured the bronze for the United States.
The 2012 champion in the event, Matt Grevers, was unable to defend his title after failing to qualify at the U.S. trials but the team was as strong as ever with two medalists for the third successive Games.
Murphy's winning time of 51.97 seconds was the second fastest in history, just outside the world record of 51.94 set by compatriot Aaron Peirsol in 2009 when non-textile bodysuits were allowed, and an Olympic record.
"I don't even feel tired just because I'm so excited. This means everything to me. I've been swimming for 16 years and to have it come to this is just a dream come true," said the 21-year-old Murphy, a first-time Olympian.
Australia's world champion Mitch Larkin had led at the turn, 0.17 of a second inside world record pace, with Murphy only fourth.
But the Australian's challenge faded as Murphy powered through. At the touch, Plummer clocked out at 52.40 and denied Larkin a medal by just three hundredths of a second.
"I'm just overjoyed to be on the podium. To watch my teammate win, it's about as good as it gets," said Plummer, who failed to make the team in 2012 but kept going when others might have given up.
Fourth was a bitter blow for Larkin, whose world champion  girlfriend Emily Seebohm finished seventh in the women's 100 backstroke, which immediately preceded the men's final.
"It was a quick race and I knew it would come down to a close finish and Ryan swum really quick and he deserves it," said Larkin. "A little bit disappointing."


Rio Ferdinand is confident Paul Pogba will cope with the pressure of his world record transfer fee after completing his move to Manchester United on Tuesday.
United spent 89 million pounds ($115.6 million) to bring the France midfielder back to the club from Juventus, and his former team mate Ferdinand believes the France international can handle the pressure.
"Paul is a huge talent and someone with the personality to handle that price tag," Ferdinand told the BBC.
"Paul's character means he will deal with being such a big investment, so that won't be a problem.
"He will relish the responsibility on his shoulders of bringing medals and trophies to the club," he added. "That won't faze him at all."
United have paid for allowing Pogba to leave for Juve in 2012, but Ferdinand is confident the 23-year-old can make up for lost time.
"It was a mistake to let him leave but bringing him back is a statement of intent," added the former England central defender who joined United for a then British record fee of 29.1 million pounds in 2002.
"He is going to be a top player for years to come and he will make a big difference to United's title chances."

RIO DE JANEIRO Athletes with past doping convictions should not be on Team USA, Olympic breaststroke champion Lilly King said on Monday in response to a question about the inclusion of sprinter Justin Gatlin.
King beat Russian Yulia Efimova to win the women's 100 meters breaststroke gold medal, a day after publicly criticizing her rival, who has served two previous doping-related suspensions.
She was then asked at a news conference if Gatlin, who also has two past offences, should be taking part in the Rio Games.
"Do I think people who have been caught for doping offences should be on the team? No, they shouldn't," she told reporters at a tense news conference alongside Efimova.
Gatlin tested positive in 2001 for an amphetamine contained in a medication he had taken for attention deficit disorder  (ADD). The 2004 Olympic gold medalist and 2005 world champion then failed a test for the banned steroid testosterone in 2006.
Revelations of state-sponsored doping in Russia have dominated the build-up to the Rio Olympics and increased pressure on athletes and officials to take a stand on the divisive issue.

RIO DE JANEIRO The Rio Olympics may be a swansong for Michael Phelps but the American swimming great is showing no signs of going gentle into the night.
On Monday, the 31-year-old proved he is in fighting form for his 200 meters butterfly rematch with Chad le Clos, the South African who four years ago denied him a third consecutive gold medal in the event.
World and Olympic record holder Phelps led throughout most of Monday's semi-final before being pipped in the last 25 meters by Tamas Kenderesi of Hungary, who finished 0.16 ahead of the American.
Le Clos finished fourth, more than a second behind Phelps, though he had raced in the 200 freestyle final a short time before and won silver.
Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, retired after 2012 but got back into the game two years later.
There have been question marks over his character after he was photographed with a marijuana pipe in 2009 and pleaded guilty to a drunk driving charge in 2014, his second offense in 10 years.
He got off to a good start in Rio, winning his 19th gold on Sunday night in the 4x100 freestyle. Phelps said he was fighting aches and a tight turnaround between the late-night race and the butterfly qualifying heats on Monday.
To deal with the pain he turned again to cupping, a Chinese healing technique, that has left his upper body full of purple bruises, much commented on social media. He also said he thought he could do well on Monday after a quick nap.
It appeared to have worked out just as he planned.
"Getting a two-hour nap at home felt amazing," said Phelps. "Should be a fun race tomorrow."
Le Clos, who beat Phelps by 0.05 seconds in 2012, is relishing the rematch in Rio.
"I am excited. Been excited for a very long time, very, very excited," Le Clos said.

RIO DE JANEIRO So far, at the Olympics many feared would be the Zika Games, so good.
With as many as one million people expected to attend the spectacle, half of them foreigners, Rio de Janeiro has not turned out to be the Zika hothouse some athletes and visitors feared as the virus wreaked havoc in Brazil earlier this year.
Despite some hot days, swings back to cooler temperatures in Brazil's winter mean that the population of the mosquito responsible for spreading the virus has dwindled.
And Rio itself never endured an epidemic as grave as many scientists had feared early this year. Even with thousands of reported cases of Zika during hot months, Rio was not hit as hard by the virus as Brazil's northeast, for reasons that scientists and the government do not yet understand.
"I'm really not concerned," said Dutch beach volleyball player Alexander Brouwar after a match in the towering metal arena set up for the sport on Rio's famed Copacabana beach.
"I haven't seen one mosquito," he added.

STILL EARLY
The ongoing Zika outbreak was first detected last year in Brazil, where it has been linked to more than 1,700 cases of   microcephaly - a birth defect marked by small head size - in babies of infected mothers. There is no vaccine for Zika, which usually only causes mild flu-like symptoms in those infected.
The virus is still spreading globally and has affected at least 54 countries, according to the World Health Organization. That includes the United States, where authorities on Monday said they were investigating a new case of local transmission in Florida.
It is also still early in the Games. Any sustained increase in temperature, though not expected until the local summer approaches later this year, could cause a rebound in mosquito populations. And those who get the virus normally do so within days of being bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika.
But with very few cases of Zika reported in Rio in recent weeks, the mosquitoes themselves, if they appear, have few sources of even picking it up. Aedes aegypti, the mosquito primarily responsible for spreading Zika, transmits it by biting an infected person and then moving on to another.
Compared with January, when more than 7,700 cases of Zika were reported in Rio, only about 140 cases were reported during the month of July, according to municipal figures through July 28, the latest available.
Several competitors, including golfers Jason Day and Rory McIlroy, skipped the games because of Zika and some did attend, but expressed concern about the disease, including British heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill and U.S. women's soccer goalkeeper Hope Solo.
But the subject has died down among athletes.
"I've not even heard anybody talk about it," said Helen Glover, a British rower who was a 2012 gold medalist, noting the low-level of concern.

LEAVING LITTLE TO CHANCE
Yet local authorities and Olympic organizers are staying cautious.
"We cannot leave this to chance," Mario Andrada, a spokesman for local organizers, told reporters at a briefing on Monday, stressing that anti-mosquito measures they have been using for months will remain in place throughout the Games.
In addition to air conditioning in athletes' rooms, meant to keep them from opening their windows in high temperatures, Olympic officials have made insect repellent available for free to them in housing, training and competition facilities.
Municipal health agents have been scouring venues and popular tourists sites to eliminate stagnant water and other areas where Aedes lay eggs.
Meanwhile, the Olympics are still a stage for Zika-related marketing by companies which see opportunity in any lingering fears, from aggressive advertising by repellent manufacturers to a couple of condom makers who touted Zika-proof prophylactics – never mind that any condom would suffice in protecting against rare cases of Zika transmission through semen.
Given the lack of mosquitoes, most visitors are brushing off any concerns. "I didn't bring any repellent," said Sophie Bahgeri, a 25-year-old Australian strolling along the beach.
Even those with most reason for worry say they are much more relaxed about the virus than they had been.
"I can't remember the last person I heard of coming down with Zika," said Fabiana Macedo, a 30-year-old resident of Tabajares, a Rio slum whose dense population and poor sanitation is the sort of community most affected by the outbreak.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russia's exclusion from next month's Paralympic Games in Rio is a different situation from the IOC's decision to allow some Russian competitors to take part at the Olympics, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said on Monday.
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) only had to ban one federation -- the Paralympic Committee of Russia -- while the IOC had to take a decision involving competitors from 28 international federations, Bach told Reuters in an interview.
The IOC refused to impose a blanket ban on Russia following revelations of state-backed doping across all sports and instead set criteria for Russian competitors, including a clean doping past and sufficient international tests, to be eligible for Rio.
A report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency also found widespread violations at the 2014 winter Olympics in Russia's Sochi, with positive tests replaced by clean samples from Russian competitors.
"It is a different situation and therefore a different decision," Bach said. "The IPC has just only one member federation in Russia.
"This you can compare for instance with the situation in the International Weightlifting Federation where also the IOC accepted and helped and supported the decision to exclude the whole team because you had so many cases."
Russian weightlifters were banned from the Games by the international federation while the country's track and field  team has also been essentially excluded with only one Russian track and field athlete competing in Rio.

DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
"I think it is exactly this fact of the very different situations that Phil Craven, the chair of the IPC, supported in his capacity as a member of the IOC, the IOC decision," Bach said.
"But then had a different decision in a different situation (for his organization)."
The IOC was criticized for not excluding Russia, though more than 100 competitors from the country's original team will not be in Rio, with Russia represented by 278 sportspeople in total.
Several national anti-doping bodies (NADOs), including Germany's, had wanted a blanket ban on Russia.
The head of the German and Austrian anti-doping bodies on Monday called for a ban on Russia for the 2018 winter Olympics in Pyeongchang over the Sochi 2014 doping revelations.
"That's one of our demands," said Andrea Gotzmann. "Just like the fact that we wanted to ban the Russians from the summer Olympics, but here (the winter Games) it is even worse and more detailed because we saw this manipulation in the laboratory in Sochi.
"It is adventurous what went on there. Here there was a criminal energy being used to undermine the system and I think that it cannot be any worse."

MOSCOW/RIO DE JANEIRO Russia blamed politics for a decision to bar its Paralympians from next month's Rio Games because of a state-sponsored doping programme, saying on Monday it would take legal measures to try to overturn the ban.
The decision to exclude Russia's entire Paralympics team, announced on Sunday by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), means at least 250 Russian competitors are set to miss the Sept. 7-18 Paralympics.
The same scandal has led to 109 out of 387 athletes originally included in the Russian team for the Rio Olympics being banned, including its entire track and field squad.
The imbroglio centres on a report for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) that found the Russian government and the FSB security service had over years covered up hundreds of doping cases across the majority of Olympic sports, as well as Paralympic events.
The findings have rocked Russian sport and tarnished the legacy of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which were President Vladimir Putin's showcase.
On Monday, Vladimir Lukin, president of the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC), said that to bar his country's Paralympians from Rio would be a grave human rights violation.
"The overwhelming majority of sports people who were barred from taking part in the Games were absolutely clean sports people," he told a Moscow news conference.
"What comes first, the crime or the punishment?"

"OBLIGATIONS FULFILLED"
He told Russian news agencies the decision had a whiff of second-grade politics about it and questioned why the IPC, which he said had previously lavished praise on Russia's Paralympians, had changed its mind so suddenly.
"A week ago, everything was fine," he told the same news conference. "Then, a week later, something happened and everything is bad. Of course, it gives rise to certain thoughts."
Lukin said the RPC was ready to prove it had met all its anti-doping obligations.
He said only 20 of the 35 Russian Paralympians whose positive drug tests had been covered up between 2012 and 2015, according to WADA, had anything to do with the RPC.
His words were echoed by sports officials in Rio who said a blanket ban was inappropriate and risked punishing clean athletes.
"We are deeply concerned by the IPC's decision," said ANOC President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah. "The IPC has decided to suspend Russia ... favouring collective responsibility over individual justice."
But WADA and other anti-doping authorities said the ban was justified in response to a state-backed doping scheme.
"The IPC has rightly put principles before politics in making this most difficult decision," said Doug MacQuarrie, chair of the Institute of National Anti-Doping Organisations.
"The Russian sport system and government have betrayed clean athletes in Russia and around the world."
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko was cited on Sunday as saying Moscow would appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland, sport's highest court, and Lukin confirmed that Russia would press ahead with the legal challenge.
Putin himself has also attributed the doping scandal to a political plot, a view widely shared in Russia.
The popular daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, in an editorial, said Russia's enemies were behind the latest ban.
Although not widely followed or celebrated in Russia, where rights campaigners say many disabled people are marginalized by regressive social attitudes and inadequate state support, Russian para-athletes are some of the best in the world.
Russia's Paralympians topped the medal table in Sochi after taking second place behind China at London 2012, and their exclusion from the Rio Games will sting a country that has long drawn pride and prestige from its sporting success.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's Rafaela Silva overcame top seed Sumiya Dorjsuren of  Mongolia to win gold in the women's -57kg judo on Monday, sending the crowd into joyous celebration of their first Olympic gold as host country.
Silva raised her arms to the crowd in triumph as she beat Dorjsuren on a waza-ari, following a pulsating semi-finals victory that went into extra time against Romania's Corina Caprioriu.
Gold for Silva marks a fairytale rise to the Olympic podium from a childhood in Rio's notorious "City of God" favela, and provides redemption for a disappointing London 2012 when she was disqualified in the early rounds for a rule violation.
Portugal's Telma Monteiro and Japan's Kaori Matsumoto won bronze.

Veteran basketball standout Amar'e Stoudemire on Monday said he turned down offers to continue playing in the NBA and decided to follow his "Hebraic roots" and play in Israel for Hapoel Jerusalem.
A former first-round draft pick of the Phoenix Suns and six-time All Star, Stoudemire, 33, last week called time on his NBA career and signed a two-year contact with Jerusalem, saying he wanted to lead rather than come off the bench.
"I felt like I didn't want to just wait around and be the last guy on the roster, I don't want to end my career that way," Stoudemire told Reuters.
"I want to end my career on a good, healthy note so that's when I decided to retire (from the National Basketball Association)," he said after a news conference with Israeli media in Jerusalem.
The 6-foot-11 (2.11 meter) Stoudemire said three NBA teams, whom he did not name, discussed contracts but he "didn't want to play for a team that didn't have a chance for a title."
Playoff contenders overlooked him after a season with Miami where he started most of the Heat's final 40 games, he added.
Stoudemire, who averaged 18.9 points and 7.8 rebounds a game in his NBA career with the Suns, New York Knicks, Dallas Mavericks and Heat and was hampered by injuries in recent years, called Jerusalem his favorite city in the world because of its ancient history.
"Now, to be able to continue to play the game of basketball in Jerusalem is an opportunity that can only happen once in someone's lifetime," said Stoudemire, who a few years ago discovered he had maternal Jewish roots.
Last season, Hapoel Jerusalem failed to retain the league title it had won for the first time a season earlier and was knocked out early in European club competition. Stoudemire, who had owned a stake in the team, said his goal was to win both.
"I don't play for fun," he said. "I play because I want to win."
In the past week, Jerusalem's season ticket sales have jumped. His entry is sure to inject more energy to the league, which in the past has been dominated by Maccabi Tel Aviv.
Stoudemire admitted it will be an adjustment playing in Israel and Europe just as it was coming out of high school to play in Phoenix. "But I want to make sure that I am going to play here while I still have good health," he said.
 

RIO DE JANEIRO A big round purple bruise on his right shoulder, U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps emerged from the pool in his qualifying heat for the 200-meter butterfly on Monday feeling the aches and the toll of late-night races in his fifth Olympics.
After winning his 19th gold on Sunday night in the 4x100 freestyle, the most decorated Olympian of all time could only muster a fifth place in the qualifying heats for the butterfly semi-finals later on Monday. Phelps, 31, holds both the World and Olympic records in 200-meter butterfly.
The bruises on his right shoulder and upper back were evidence of his fondness for cupping, an ancient Chinese healing practice.
He said he's been cupping for some time, before almost every meet, but the trainer went full bore on him and left some of the worst bruises in some time.  The right shoulder, he said with a bit of a wince, "is where I hurt the most."
Coming out of retirement in 2014 after a stint in rehab following his second drunk driving arrest, Phelps said the quick turnarounds between the late-night races tailor-made for U.S. television and the early afternoon heats the next day are tough.
He got massages, ice baths, heat applications to flush the lactic acid out of his muscles along with eating a pound of spaghetti, a food he is not keen on and had to force down.
"I guess I got to sleep at 3 a.m. and I was on an 11 a.m. bus. Quick turnarounds," Phelps told reporters.
It's back to his Rio de Janeiro home then for a quick nap, before he returns on Monday night for his butterfly semi-final, where he will be looking to make it to the final on Tuesday and avenge his defeat in the event four years ago to defending Olympic champion Chad le Clos of South Africa.
Clos, now 24, eclipsed Phelps in London in 2012.

RIO DE JANEIRO After two routs to open the Olympic women's basketball tournament, the question is not so much will the all-conquering United States win a sixth straight gold medal but will they ever lose again.
The U.S. followed up their drubbing of Senegal in their opener with a less ruthless but no less clinical 103-63 dissection of third-ranked Spain on Monday, blowing out a team viewed by many as a legitimate medal contender.
It seems as if nothing can stop the U.S. juggernaut as the mighty Americans ran their Olympic winning streak to 42 games, a 24-year stretch of domination dating back to the 1992 Barcelona Summer Games.
"You go into the game thinking that maybe today is the day you can beat them because it is not impossible," offered a hopeful Spanish captain Laia Palau. "You just have to have a wonderful game on your side and they have to be, I don't know, sick."
Spain has never won an Olympic medal, but with an experienced lineup that includes two players earning a living in the WNBA they represented a huge step up in class following a 121-56 mugging of Senegal.
But like nearly every other nation that lines up against the United States, the Spaniards are still searching for their first-ever win.
The two countries have met nine times in Olympic and world championship competition, Team USA winning all nine including their three previous Summer Games encounters by a whopping average of 35 points.
"I haven't been on many underdog teams in my career but I do have an awareness of what it feels like when no matter what you do you have no chance, and it's not a good feeling," said U.S. captain Sue Bird. "But on the flip side there is also opportunity to upset, to make history and that I am sure is in the back of all their minds.
"Would I want to be in their shoes, probably not, but they are trying to make history by beating us."
Despite the difference in pedigree between Spain and Senegal, who are still chasing a first-ever Olympic win, the Group B contest unfolded in much the same fashion.
Playing in front of a small, sleepy crowd at the Youth Arena, the U.S. took a few moments to shake off the cobwebs but quickly turned on the style as they sped to a commanding 54-37 halftime lead.
Once again the depth of Team USA was highlighted with all 12 players getting on the scoreboard, including five in double digits with Diana Taurasi leading the way with 13 points.
"We're not easy to deal with obviously," said U.S. coach Geno Auriemma. "Spain is a pretty good but when you look at our depth it starts to take its toll on the other team.
"That's the pressure we can put on teams, everybody we bring in off the bench can score and make a play.
"It's a good place we are in right now."

RIO DE JANEIRO Michael Phelps picked up his 19th gold medal on a second night of world records in the Olympic pool, with Katie Ledecky cruising to women's 400 meters freestyle victory and Britain's Adam Peaty running away with the men's 100 breaststroke.
Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom extended Saturday's record spree in winning the 100 meters butterfly, and Peaty and Ledecky followed suit in the next two finals before the U.S. men's team, with Phelps swimming second, took the 4x100 freestyle relay.
Six swimming world records have now fallen in two days of competition, and the United States moved level with Australia on two gold medals each.
Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, now has 19 golds, two silvers and two bronzes. For his relay team mates Caeleb Dressel and Ryan Held, it was their first Olympic medal.
London Olympics 100 freestyle champion Nathan Adrian swam the final leg for the Americans, touching first ahead of France and Australia.
"On the block I thought my heart was going to explode, I was so hyped, so excited," said Phelps, competing in his fifth Olympics.
Ledecky, the rising U.S. swimming sensation, shaved 1.91 seconds off her own world record on the way to the 400m gold, the first stage of a rare treble she hopes to complete along with the 200m and 800m.
"It's pure happiness," the 19-year-old told reporters.
"I wanted the first 200 to hurt as little as possible and I really felt like I could build into it and really explode that last 50," she added after leading the race from start to finish.

"WHERE IS EVERYBODY?"
Britain's Peaty set his second world record in consecutive days, and seemed surprised by the margin of his victory - 1.56 seconds - over defending champion Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa.
"I touched the wall and looked around and thought 'where is everybody?' Peaty told reporters.
The last British man to win an Olympic swimming gold was Adrian Moorhouse in the same event in 1988, six years before Peaty was born. On a big night for the British team, Jazz Carlin won a silver medal behind Ledecky.
In the butterfly, Sjostrom became the first Swedish woman to win an Olympic gold medal, with Canada's 16-year-old Penny Oleksiak taking silver. American Dana Vollmer, the 2012 champion, clinched bronze.
"The feeling is totally crazy. I didn't realize it was a world record," Sjostrom said.
"I knew I was the big favorite. I was under pressure, so I tried to focus on no disasters. Before the start I said to myself: 'It's just a pool. It's nothing. I know what to do.'"
In a reminder of the doping controversies that dogged the build-up to the Olympics, there were loud boos for Russian breaststroker Yulia Efimova and the men's relay team.
Efimova, who has served two doping suspensions, succeeded in an appeal last week against being banned from Rio.
She was one of a number of Russians who argued successfully that excluding them from the Olympics would be punishing them again for the same offense.
She qualified second for Monday's 100 breaststroke final, 0.02 seconds behind Lilly King of the United States.

RIO DE JANEIRO Victor Conte is back in business - and this time he says it's legal.
    The man who was jailed a decade ago for helping athletes be faster, higher, stronger by supplying them with illegal steroids is now providing nutritional supplements to a new generation of elite athletes, mostly from boxing and mixed martial arts.
Conte says his supplement firm, SNAC, is on track for $5 million in sales this year. Based in San Carlos, California, it is just a few miles from his now-defunct BALCO lab, infamous for cooking up the biggest sport drugs scandal in the United States.
But unlike BALCO, he explains, all the products on the warehouse shelves of SNAC, or Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning, meet global anti-doping standards.
    Conte, who served four months in a federal prison in 2006 for supplying performance-enhancing steroids to dozens of athletes, says all that remains of BALCO is memorabilia: a rouges gallery of drug cheats that hangs on his office walls.
    There are framed and signed pictures of former clients such as Major League baseball's home-run king Barry Bonds and disgraced sprint queen Marion Jones. They hang alongside the autographed jersey of National Football League admitted doper Bill Romanowski and other grid iron greats.
"In my own mind it is a small form of restitution," Conte told Reuters. "I caused a lot of damage, I harmed a lot of people, I'm trying to help others not go through what happens when you go down that slippery slope.
    "I accepted full consequences and went to prison."
With his familiar pencil moustache and welcoming grin, Conte explains the story behind each framed photo.
Jones returned her Olympic gold medals and went to prison. Bonds escaped jail but because of his steroid-fueled feats voters have kept him out of the Baseball Hall of Fame and has an asterisk attached to his home-run record. Romanowski retired.
Dozens of others had reputations and careers destroyed, but Conte has emerged embracing a past he knows he can never escape.
    A former bass guitarist who switched careers, Conte has used a gregarious personality and self-taught knowledge of nutrition to gain access to some of the top names in sport.
    "I clearly understand I cannot run from my past. I am who I am, I do what I do," said Conte, stretching back on a couch.
    "I'm not going to try and hide certain pictures and act like I never did those things. A lot of this stuff was all on the walls in BALCO. People would come in, I would always say welcome to the Hall of Fame or Shame, depending on your viewpoint."
   
    'RED LIGHT DISTRICT OF SPORTS'
As the Rio Games unfold, the dark clouds of yet another doping controversy hang over the Olympic movement, with dozens of Russian athletes banned from competing after the discovery that Russia had been running a state-backed doping program.
    Having spent years helping athletes escape the anti-doping dragnet, Conte insists he has seen the light. No longer part of the problem, he now wants to be part of the solution, offering his insight and expertise to help snare drug cheats.
    He has been following doping developments closely from what he calls the "red light district of sports", saying fighters talk to him about the latest performance-enhancing drugs and that he is eager to pass on these tips to anti-doping agencies.
    One hot drug right now, according to Conte, is a peptide hormone known as IGF-1 LR3, which aids in the production of growth hormone and enables an athlete to boost muscle mass.
"I've learned of this from some track athletes. I've also learned it from some UFC fighters who claim they take it the day of competition, get tested and they are not able to find it."
    "I'm hearing from the dark side that this is what people are doing," he adds. "The testing may have improved somewhat, but Olympic athletes are still able to circumvent the testing system and use PEDs."
Conte says he wants to pass on information about what he is hearing from fighters and other athletes to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and other anti-doping bodies but believes they are dismissive of him.
WADA did not respond to a Reuters request for an interview.
However, former WADA president Dick Pound says Conte's credentials cannot be ignored.
    "I always thought he could be very helpful," Pound said.

"Win or learn" has long been the motto of mixed martial arts coach John Kavanagh and he says his fighter Conor McGregor has learned the lessons of his shock defeat by Nate Diaz as the two prepare for a much-anticipated rematch.
Currently the biggest star in the sport, featherweight champion McGregor stepped up two weight classes to meet Diaz but was choked out in the second round of their first meeting by the brash Californian.
The two are now set to face off again on Aug. 20 in Las Vegas as McGregor seeks his revenge.
The Straight Blast Gym (SBG) boss told Reuters that the next fight against Diaz would be a completely different ball game.
"The whole approach to this contest is different," he said via Skype from McGregor's training camp.
"(Previously) we were always concerned with trying to improve ourselves and nothing to do with who we are facing, but this time we are almost completely training in a specific way for a specific type of opponent," he said.
Kavanagh said that McGregor in no way underestimated Diaz, who stepped in as a late replacement after then-lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos pulled out of a title bout against the Irish fighter due to injury.
McGregor's decision to move up two weight classes to meet Diaz proved to be his downfall as, despite a strong start in which he rocked Diaz several times with punches, he tasted defeat for the first time in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).
"That's just Conor, he's never going to shy away from a challenge. He was on a good run, a good roll at the time, and it was either accept him or be off the card, and he didn't want to do that," Kavanagh explained.

CONOR CONNECTED
"Even though Conor connected quite a few times with strikes that have put away people in the past, Nate was able to keep walking forward.
"That has been a major part of the camp this time, being more efficient and picking shots a lot better," he said.
Since that defeat, the 39-year-old Kavanagh has published a memoir itself entitled "Win Or Learn" which covers his 20 years to date in the fight game, from the humble beginnings of SBG in a shed in Dublin to the bright lights of Las Vegas and a world title win for McGregor.
In the book, Kavanagh says that despite being Irish champion and a black belt in karate as a teenager, being on the receiving end of a terrible beating left him searching for a more effective way of defending himself.
Inspired to take up Brazilian jiu jitsu by a videotape of Royce Gracie's victory at the first no-holds-barred UFC event in 1993, Kavanagh and his friends started to stage their own self-defense classes, which evolved into the Straight Blast Gym.
Kavanagh went on to become Ireland's first black belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu and has helped McGregor to achieve his iconic status in the fight game but only a fraction of his hundreds of students go on to compete.
Those who do are making a real mark on MMA.
"Who would have thought that a few guys from a small gym in Dublin would be some of the big names in the sport?" he asks.
Kavanagh says his next wave of young fighters could make an even bigger impact, as they are benefiting from the high-level experience accrued by their coach and forerunners.
"The sport is bigger, the gym is bigger, I really feel I'm only getting the hang of this business, of promoting and teaching," Kavanagh said.
"My first wave of guys was my apprenticeship -- now I'm ready to put a stamp on the world of MMA."

RIO DE JANEIRO Russia was barred from taking part in next month's Rio Paralympics on Sunday, with organizers blasting a "medals over morals mentality" as they announced the blanket ban over state-backed doping that Olympics bosses avoided.
International Paralympic Committee (IPC) President Philip Craven said Russia's Paralympians were part of a broken system overseen by the Russian government and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee ahead of the Sept. 7-18 Games.
Russia immediately said it would appeal and condemned the move as violating the human rights of its athletes.
"Tragically this situation is not about athletes cheating a system, but about a state-run system that is cheating the athletes," Craven told reporters.
"I believe the Russian government has catastrophically failed its para-athletes. Their medals over morals mentality disgusts me."
The IPC decision follows revelations of widespread cheating in Russian sport which ignited a doping scandal that has threatened to split the Olympic movement and cost dozens of Russian sportspeople their place at the Rio Games.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) stopped short of banning all Russian sportspeople from Rio and said on Sunday 278 of the original 387-strong Russian team would be able to compete after being cleared by their individual sports federations.
IOC President Thomas Bach had described a blanket ban as a "nuclear option" in which innocent athletes would be "collateral damage".
But the IPC had no such qualms and its hardline move drew praise from anti-doping authorities.
"The IPC showed strong leadership today in holding Russia's state-organized doping program accountable. Their unanimous decision goes a long way towards inspiring us all," said Travis Tygart, head of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.

"PREJUDICE AND POLITICIZATION"
Russia said within minutes of the announcement that it would be appealing against the ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland, sport's highest court.
"It is prejudice and politicization ... There will be a legal appeal to CAS," Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
Mutko said the decision had been made unilaterally by Craven because he was nearing the end of his career.
"This decision is absurd. It is all the ravings of a piebald mare," R-Sport news agency quoted Vladimir Lukin, president of the Russian Paralympic Committee, as saying.
Despite calls by athletes and sports officials for harsh sanctions on Russian dopers, multiple international federations have warned against punishing clean sportsmen and women with no history of cheating.
The International Equestrian Federation and World Archery were quick to criticize the IPC's ruling.
"It impairs clean athletes ... for political reasons rather than sporting, and goes against the Paralympic movement's principle of inclusion," World Archery said in a statement.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the ruling violated the human rights of Russia's Paralympians.
"The decision to bar the entire Russian team from the Paralympics is astoundingly mean and inhuman," she wrote on Facebook. "It is a betrayal of the very highest human rights standards which are the foundation of the modern world."

TARNISHED LEGACY
Although not widely followed or celebrated in Russia, where rights campaigners say many disabled people are marginalized by regressive social attitudes and inadequate state support, Russian para-athletes are some of the best in the world.
Russia's Paralympians topped the medal table at Sochi 2014 after taking second place behind China at London 2012 and their exclusion from the Rio Games will hit hard in a country which has long drawn pride and prestige from its history of sporting success.
The move also further tarnishes the legacy of the Sochi Olympics, an event held up by President Vladimir Putin to promote his image of Russia as a resurgent world power.
Addressing Russia's Olympic team before they traveled to Rio last week, Putin said Russian sport had fallen foul of a politically motivated plot and the principal of collective responsibility flew in the face of common sense and legality.
Craven said he had "deep sympathy" for Russian competitors who will miss the Rio Games but that the decision was taken in the best interests of the Paralympic movement.
"We sincerely hope that the changes that need to happen, do happen," he said. "They are part of a broken system."

Ashley Cole scored in the 89th minute to give the Los Angeles Galaxy a 2-2 draw with the New York Red Bulls on Sunday.
Gonzalo Veron put the Red Bulls ahead in the 68th minute and Sean Davis looked to have sealed the win six minutes later when he put the visitors 2-0 up.
However, Steven Gerrard set up Mike Magee in the 80th minute to give the Galaxy hope before Cole snatched the late equalizer as Los Angles extended their unbeaten run to eight matches.
In other Major League Soccer games, Clint Dempsey scored all three goals for Seattle in a 3-1 win over Orlando City.
“It’s a huge win for us,” Dempsey said. “If we have any hopes of making a run we needed to start now. We need to build on it.”
Defending MLS Cup champions Portland defeated Sporting Kansas City 3-0.
Portland's Diego Chara was sent off in the 12th minute for elbowing midfielder Benny Feilhaber in the face and Sporting were also reduced to 10 men before half time after Soni Mustivar caught Diego Valeri in the knee.


RIO DE JANEIRO Michael Phelps made all the difference as he won the 19th Olympic gold medal of his astonishing career on Sunday and helped the U.S. men's team to victory in the 4x100 meters freestyle relay.
The 31-year-old, raising a roar from the crowd on his first competitive appearance at his fifth Games after sitting out the heats, now has an unprecedented 23 medals with two silvers and two bronzes filling out his tally.
London 2012 champions France took the silver medal, their third successive podium in the 4x100, and Australia the bronze.
With baby son Boomer in the audience for the first time at an Olympics, Phelps swam the second leg of a race that has brought him four of his medals over the years including gold in Beijing in 2008.
If anyone is used to the atmosphere and the pressure, it is Phelps but even he -- 16 years on from his Olympic debut -- felt the sense of occasion.
"On the block I thought my heart was going to explode, I was so hyped, so excited," he said. "It was so loud, I don't think I've ever heard something like that."
The most decorated Olympian of all time has now won gold at four separate Games, the first swimmer to do so.
The U.S. team set a world record of three minutes, 8.24 seconds in the Beijing final, a race in the bodysuit-era that still stands and is likely to endure for some time to come.
On Sunday the came closer than anyone has ever done wearing textile suits, when the quartet of Caeleb Dressel, Phelps, Ryan Held and 100 freestyle world champion Nathan Adrian clocked 3:09.92.
Dressel completed his opening leg just two hundredths behind the French in 48.10 and Phelps made the difference, taking the lead off a strong turn and clocking out at 47.12 with Held putting in a 47.73 and Adrian fastest of all in 46.97.

TEARFUL PODIUM
As he has done so many times in the past, Phelps kissed the medal on the podium and waved at the crowd with tears in his eyes and a supportive arm for an emotional Held and Dressel who were collecting the first Olympic medals of their careers.
"I told them, it's OK to cry. It's good to see some emotion as one of the old dudes," said Phelps.
The 35-year-old Anthony Ervin, who won 4x100 relay silver in 2000, swum in the heats to collect another medal 16 years after his first.
Jimmy Feigen and Blake Pieroni also swam in the heats.
The victory maintained a run of U.S. success in the event, with the Americans medaling in every 4x100 freestyle relay raced at the Games since it was first included in 1964.
It also meant the United States ended the second day of the meet with two golds, level with Australia who won two on Saturday.
"I think we did our best on the night and are really happy with the bronze medal," said Australian James Magnussen who swam his team's third leg and paid tribute to Phelps.
"Michael is definitely an inspiration to many of us," he told reporters. "To stay on top of the world for that many Olympics is something that most of us couldn't even dream of.
"It gives us guys who are sort of in the middle period of our careers a lot of inspiration to think we can keep going for another Olympics.
"It's always great to see a fairy tale like that unfold in a race you are part of."

RIO DE JANEIRO Many sportsmen say they 'can't believe it' in the moment of achieving their lifetime goal but in the case of Adam Peaty, who posted another world record and won Britain's Rio first gold on Sunday, it seemed like he really meant it.
"I touched the wall and looked around and thought 'where is everybody?'" Peaty told reporters.
It was hardly surprising as he had just won the Olympic 100 meters breaststroke final with a world record and a remarkable 1.56 seconds ahead of second-placed South African defending champion Cameron van der Burgh.
"It's surreal to win it, to go 57.13 and to win GB's first medal. Honestly, I think you'll have to ask me about it in two days," he added.
Still only 21, Peaty came into the Games as a world, European and Commonwealth champion and the world record holder.
His stunning performance on Sunday has lifted him to a whole new level in the British sporting consciousness - or will do when most of the country wakes up.
Peaty is the country's first male Olympic swimming gold medalist for 28 years and only the fourth in last 100 years, following on from David Wilkie (1976) Duncan Goodhew (1980) and Adrian Moorhouse (1998) - all four of them breaststrokers.
However, none of that illustrious trio demolished the opposition the way Peaty has over two days in Rio.
His own 2015 world record of 57.92 seconds was brushed aside with a 57.55 in Saturday's heats and he was over a second faster in qualifying than anyone else in the final.
He knew he just had to keep his head and the result should look after itself but he is not the sort of competitor to sit back, and duly reacted fastest to the gun and smashed out another world best of 57.13.
"I can't really describe what it was like but coming home with that crowd roaring is what I've always dreamed of," he said.
"I was a bit anxious after the worlds last year but I put so much effort in to fixing my dive and it paid off. My stroke felt absolutely amazing tonight and I just kept pumping it through. That's probably the best-executed race of my life.
"I thought the best possible time I could achieve here might be a 57.3 but 57.1 - I have to slap myself. It's absolutely incredible."
Peaty, famously, was scared of water as a child, fighting his mother when she tried to get him near a bath and refusing to countenance a shower.
"Yep," he said, when questioned on it for about the 14th time this week. "I think you can say I've overcome that fear."


RIO DE JANEIRO Chinese web-users unleashed their fury on the social media accounts of Australian Olympic gold medallist Mack Horton, demanding he apologise for calling swimming rival Sun Yang a "drug cheat".
The controversy clouded Horton's Saturday triumph in the 400 metres freestyle final over Sun, the London 2012 champion, with the latter suggesting Horton had made the remarks to affect him. Sun won the silver medal.
"You have offended against the sensitive (feelings) of the Chinese people," said one of more than 300,000 comments left on Horton's latest Instagram post of him celebrating his win on the  medal podium.
"Apologise to Sun Yang!", said another on Horton's Facebook page that was peppered with insults, derogatory pictures, many of which carried the hashtag "#apologisetosunyang".
Many of the comments recalled a 2013 incident when the Australian men's freestyle relay team were suspended for using a sedative banned by their national Olympic committee (AOC) in a bonding session before the London Games.
The Chinese swimming team has also demanded an apology from Horton, state news agency Xinhua reported.
"We have been noticing what has been said in the past two days by Horton, who launched a malicious personal attack (on Chinese swimmers)," it quoted Chinese swim team manager Xu Qi as saying.
"We think his inappropriate words greatly hurt the feelings between Chinese and Australian swimmers.
"It is proof of a lack of good manners and upbringing. We strongly demand an apology from this swimmer."
The 20-year-old Australian had acknowledged after their final that there were tensions between him and Sun after a splashing incident during a recent practice.
"I used the words 'drug cheat' because he tested positive," he said.
A spokesman for the AOC said Horton was entitled to express his point of view.
"He has spoken out in support of clean athletes. This is something he feels strongly about and good luck to him," the spokesman said in an email to Reuters.
In 2014, it emerged that Sun had secretly served a three-month suspension after he tested positive for a banned stimulant. He said at the time the stimulant was in medication to treat a heart issue and did not enhance his performance.
Sun, the first Chinese swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal, is very popular at home but has been the subject of multiple controversies. In 2013, he spent a week in jail for crashing a car when driving without a license.
He gained widespread sympathy at home on Saturday after breaking down in tears following his loss.
Chinese media carried pictures and videos of him crying and hugging a friend with the phrase "Sun Yang don't cry" trending across social media.

RIO DE JANEIRO Calming her nerves by reassuring herself that 'it's just a pool', hot favorite Sarah Sjostrom broke her own world record in the 100 meters butterfly on Sunday to become the first Swedish woman to win an Olympic swimming gold medal.
Canada's 16-year-old Penny Oleksiak won silver and Dana Vollmer of the United States, the defending Olympic champion who became a mother last year, took bronze.
Sjostrom, three times world champion in the event, set a time of 55.48 seconds to break her previous mark of 55.64, set in Russia a year ago. It was the first Olympic medal for the 22-year-old Swede, competing in her third Games.
She will also race in the 50, 100 and 200 meters freestyle, but told reporters she knew the butterfly was her best chance.
"The feeling is totally crazy. I didn't realize it was a world record," Sjostrom said.
"I knew I was the big favorite. I was under pressure, so I tried to focus on no disasters. Before the start I said to myself: 'It's just a pool. It's nothing. I know what to do.'"
The reigning world champion led at the turn and pulled away in the last 50 meters as the crowd cheered her on in anticipation of the record.
Oleksiak put in a strong swim in lane two to snatch the silver ahead of Vollmer, breaking her own world junior record in the process.
"It is super amazing," the Canadian said.
"I still have a few more years left as a junior. Taking that time down is going to be fun."


RIO DE JANEIRO Adam Peaty smashed his own world record for the second time in two days on Sunday to win 100 meters breaststroke gold and become the first British male swimmer in 28 years to win an Olympic title.
The 21-year-old world champion, who clocked 57.55 seconds in Saturday's heats, sliced another hefty chunk off his mark to finish in 57.13 and open his country's medal account at the Games.
Defending champion Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa, whose 2012 world record Peaty took in April 2015, had to settle for silver in 58.69 and Cody Miller of the United States won the bronze in 58.87.
"It's surreal to get Team GB's first gold but this is a product of seven years' hard work," said Peaty, who showed no nerves as he walked out and calmly stripped down for the biggest race of his life.
Fastest off the blocks, Peaty made the turn 0.08 of a second inside world record pace and powered down the final 50 like a man determined to exceed the expectations that have built since he won three golds at last year's world championships.
The winning margin of 1.56 seconds was as immense as his broad shoulders and the grin on his face.
"I gave it everything I've got and I did it for my country. I knew this arena would be absolutely perfect for me," said the Briton, whose parents were in the audience shedding tears of delight.
The last British male swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal was Adrian Moorhouse in the same breaststroke event at the 1988 Seoul Games.
The country's only other male champions over the last 100 years were David Wilkie in the 200m breaststroke in 1976 and Duncan Goodhew in the 100m breaststroke in 1980.
Van der Burgh said Peaty was in a league of his own.
"I am super stoked to add a silver to my gold," he said. "I knew from the warm-up I could not go 57 (seconds). So if Adam was going to plan and he did his job then...
"My body feels super strong but my stroke was not connected, my timing was off. I was a bit on, a bit off," he added.
Moorhouse, commenting for BBC television, was lost in admiration for a youngster who still lives with his parents in Uttoxeter and was taken to his first swimming lessons after screaming at the sight of bath water.
"He has the technical ability and talent to do this and can then cope with the pressure of the moment and put a bubble around himself and say, 'You know what? I should be here'," the former champion told viewers.
"He has got everything."

RIO DE JANEIRO Chinese weightlifter Long Qingquan broke the 56kg world record on the way to defeating defending Olympic champion Om Yun Chol of North Korea at the Rio Games on Sunday.
A noisy crowd of more than 4,000 at Riocentro roared as Om made his final attempt in the clean and jerk at 169kg to take the lead. They cheered even louder when Long, the 2008 Olympic champion, hoisted 170kg with the final lift of the night to take the gold medal.
He became the first weightlifter to win Olympic titles eight years apart.
Long joined Om as one of seven men who have lifted three times their own bodyweight. His total of 307kg surpassed Halil Mutlu’s world record of 305kg set at Sydney 2000 and handed Om his first defeat since the North Korean won in London in 2012.
Since winning in London Om had competed in seven major competitions, including three World Championships, and won them all. Long, at 25 a year older than Om, had finished behind him four times.
Long said their feats of strength made them the world’s strongest men.
“Among human beings yes, we are the strongest," he added. "But not in the animal kingdom – remember how strong an ant is!”
Om, smiling despite his defeat, said: “The strongest man is the one sitting next to me. I congratulate him.”
Vietnam’s Kim Tuan Thach had stood below Om on the podium five times and was expected to take the bronze medal, but he failed with all three clean and jerk attempts.
That let in 20-year-old Thai Kruaithong Sinphet, who took third place 18kg behind Long.

RIO DE JANEIRO American gymnast Simone Biles' performance at the Rio Olympics  on Sunday was so spectacular that even her rivals were bowing down to the 1.45 meter Texan.
The American team blew away the opposition by almost 10 points in qualifying, propelled by Biles' gravity-defying vaults, vibrant Samba-infused floor choreography, and perfect landings.
The performance earned her an enviable total score of 62.366 and the bubbly 19 year-old's ear-to-ear grin also won over the audience at the Rio Olympic Arena. Team mate Aly Raisman had the second-highest score of 60.607.
Many of her competitors merely heaped on the praise.
"Everything she does is incredible," Peruvian Ariana Orrego told Reuters after going against her in the fourth group. "It's an honor to compete with her.
"I learn so much just from watching them train."
After debuting at her first Olympic Games, Biles downplayed the admiration.
"We try not to let the pressure get to us," she said, flashing American flag-themed nail polish as she jumped from interview to interview.
The American performance pushed the Chinese, Russian and British teams down the ladder, but even so Biles' closest competitors seemed to accept she was in a league of her own.
"She just wows us," said Britain's Claudia Fragapane. "I really take my hat off to her."
In qualifying, four competitors from each country compete on each apparatus with only the top three scores counting toward the total. In the final, each nation will put forward three athletes and all three scores will count.
With the Biles-led American team so strong, some competitors are feeling a bit fatalistic.
"They are unbeatable at the moment," lamented Russian Aliya Mustafina.
(This version of the story has been refiled to add Peruvian gymnast surname in fifth paragraph)

RIO DE JANEIRO There is still 48 hours to go before the medals are handed out in Brazil but on Sunday's evidence, there is no one who can stop American gymnast Simone Biles from standing on top of the Olympic podium.
Many reigning world gymnastics champions have come to conquer the Olympics only to crumble under the weight of expectation and become victims of what is known as the "curse of the world champion".
But Biles doesn't seemed fazed by the hype.
She soared high on Sunday as she made her Olympic debut in women's qualifying with a dazzling performance at the Rio Olympic Arena.
The three-times world all around champion's footwork and bodywork were so majestic that gasps of "wow" became a buzzword at the venue.
"I do a very good job at hiding (my nerves)," said the American with a wide grin as she flashed her nails that had been polished to match her sparkling red and navy blue leotard.
She earned 15.733 on the floor, 16.000 and 16.100 from her two vaults, 15.000 on the asymmetric bars, and 15.633 on the balance beam.
The beam routine included her spinning around 900 degrees on the four-inch wide apparatus as she balanced her entire body weight on her right toes.
On the floor, her explosive tumbling passes -- which included her trademark soaring double layout with half twist at the end -- had the Brazilian crowd dancing down the aisles as her sassy moves were choreographed to hip-swinging Samba beats.
After blowing away her rivals to become the top qualifier for the team, all around, floor, vault and beam finals, she is on target to become the first woman since Ukraine's Lilia Podkopayeva in 1996 to hold the world and Olympic all around titles at the same time.
As if that was not enough, the owner of a record 10 world titles could become the first woman to win five golds at the same Games.

RIO DE JANEIRO Carrying a country's expectations and an Olympic legacy of astonishing over-achievement, South Korea's archers were hardly going to let the wind at the Sambadrome blow their chances of an eighth successive women's team title at the Rio Games.
Wind can be kryptonite to the best of archers, with the merest breath sending a cleanly shot arrow wide of the target.
It raises doubts and can sap confidence to terminal levels. At times on Sunday it was blowing hard. Other times, soft.
But it was ever-present, causing many of the world's most accomplished women to wince in dismay as their arrows refused to land as directed.
It knocked Russia's strongly built Ksenia Perova off course during the gold medal-decider, her first arrow fading into the outer ring for a score of six, a virtual embarrassment for an Olympic competitor.
But South Korea's Ki Bo-bae, Chang Hye-jin and Choi Mi-sun  seemed to possess a mystical power to move the wind in their direction.
Five of their first six arrows in the opening set struck the innermost gold circle for maximum scores of 10 points.
It was a devastating opening volley which Perova, Tuiana Dashidorzhieva and Inna Stepanova had little hope of responding to.
They lost the first of the best-of-four sets by a stinging 10 points and minutes later surrendered the second as Ki, the defending champion in the individual event, refused to miss the gold.
She finally did in the third set but her imperfect eight on the final arrow was enough to seal a dominant 5-1 victory and let 50 million Koreans sleep safely, knowing that their women's unbeaten streak in the Olympics remains alive.
South Korea won their eighth team title in succession, 28 years after winning the first at their home Games in Seoul.
Punishing training regimes and practicing at baseball stadiums to get used to the noise of an Olympic crowd are the way of South Korean archery, which has professional teams and enviable corporate sponsorship.
Yet, in a meandering, multilingual media conference, Ki and her team mates were peppered with questions about the "secret" of their success.
A reporter asked the truth of a report that they had handled snakes to build mental toughness and overcome fears.
"We tried to get accustomed to noise and also sometimes we have training competitions in very unusual settings, but we don't handle snakes," said Ki with a smile.
Hard graft and the unflinching support of a well-resourced program were the more plausible factors in their success, the Koreans all said in different ways.
"It is true that before coming to Rio there was so much expectation from so many people for the eighth consecutive gold medal. The pressure felt even bigger because of that," added Ki.
"So we thought that it could be difficult for us but we just continued working together and having very strong team work and it proved to be right.”

The remarkable Ichiro Suzuki, who blazed a trail for Japanese players in Major League Baseball with high-average hitting, dazzling speed and a rifle throwing arm, underlined his Hall of Fame credentials by joining the 3,000-hit club on Sunday.
The first MLB position player from Japan to play regular in the majors, the superb outfielder known simply as Ichiro on Sunday reserved his place in Cooperstown when he became the 30th major leaguer to reach the milestone.
He accomplished the feat with a triple to right field for the Miami Marlins in the seventh inning against the Colorado Rockies in Denver.
Already a member of Japanese baseball's Hall of Fame (The Golden Players Club) after nine seasons, Ichiro carved out a second Hall of Fame career on the major league stage over the next 16 campaigns.
Arriving from the Orix Blue Wave of the Pacific League in Nippon Professional Baseball as a 27-year-old major league rookie with the Seattle Mariners, Ichiro wasted no time showing that his talent and determination translated on MLB diamonds.
The slender Ichiro, with an unorthodox high leg kick to time his swing in the batter's box, turned routine ground balls into short infield singles with his speed down the line and made baserunners cautious with his strong arm in right field.
Ichiro announced himself with an electric 2001 season in which he hit .350 to win the batting title with a rookie record 242 hits while swiping a league-leading 56 bases in sweeping Rookie of the Year and American League MVP honors.
The batting title/stolen base double had last been achieved in 1949 by fabled trailblazer Jackie Robinson, the man who broke the color barrier as MLB's first African American player.
Ichiro, who had won seven batting titles in a row and three straight Pacific League MVP awards in Japan, was just getting warmed up in the majors.

MODEL OF CONSISTENCY
Following a strict daily practice routine and stretching regimen, Ichiro was a model of high level consistency.
He went on to post a record 10 consecutive seasons of at least 200 hits, reaching his zenith in 2004 when he stroked 262 hits to break an 84-year-old major league record set by George Sisler as he claimed another batting title with a .372 average.
Including his 1,278 hits for Orix in Japan, the claim has been made that with his major league hits total, Ichiro has surpassed Pete Rose, who is MLB's career hits leader with 4,256.
Rose, who has been an admirer of Ichiro's, bristled at that suggestion, saying the Japanese stats could not be counted equally with a major league total.
Regardless, there is no disputing the enormous achievements of Ichiro, who is still playing at age 42 and has said he believes he can play until age 50.
The Japanese phenomenon proved his abilities despite starting his MLB journey at the advanced age of 27.
Most members of the 3,000 hit club began their MLB careers around age 21, with the latest bloomer among them before Ichiro being Wade Boggs, who was 24 in his rookie season and went on to amass 3,010 hits.
Derek Jeter, a teammate of Ichiro's when the Japanese outfielder played with the New York Yankees from 2012 to 2014 and who stands sixth on the all-time major league hit list on 3,465, praised him on reaching the milestone.
"It's an incredible accomplishment. When you add in his 1,278 hits from Japan, where he played until he was 26, his career will be counted as one of the best of this or any other generation," Jeter said in a posting on The Players' Tribune.
"My hat's off to Ichiro. He's a guy who comes around once in a lifetime. No one's ever seen anybody like him. And to be quite honest, we probably won't see anybody like him again."

RIO DE JANEIRO Majlinda Kelmendi made history at the Rio Games on Sunday as she took gold in judo to become the first athlete from Kosovo to win an Olympic medal, a feeling she said she would not trade for any amount of money in the world.
Rio marks the first Olympics at which athletes are competing under the flag of Kosovo, which proclaimed independence from Serbia in 2008.
Many competitors from the small Balkan country, which was accepted as a member of the International Olympic Committee in 2014, had previously participated under another country's flag including Kelmendi herself.
The twice world champion, who was Kosovo's flag bearer at Friday's opening ceremony and was competing in the -52kg category, represented Albania at the London Games in 2012 but went home without a medal that time.
"I have lived four years for this day, for this moment, and I felt so happy there at the podium when I saw my flag and when I heard my anthem," she told reporters.
Kelmendi refused many offers to compete for other countries because she had always wanted to represent Kosovo.
"There is no money in the world, no millions in the world which can make me feel how I feel today," she said.
Sanije Balaj, 51, who watched from a bar in Kosovo's capital Pristina, began to cry when the national anthem played at the medal ceremony.
"I thought I would never see this day because I thought I would die in the 1999 war. Majlinda was not representing only herself but all the people of Kosovo," she told Reuters.
Kelmendi described her semi-final match with third-seeded Misato Nakamura, which she won on a single penalty, as her toughest of the day, calling her Japanese opponent a legend who she had always wanted to fight.
But to claim gold she also had to overcome 10th seed Odette Giuffrida from Italy in a tense duel, winning on a point from a yuko that was initially judged to be a more valuable waza-ari.
Nakamura and Russia's Natalia Kuziutina won bronze.
Tensions persist between Kosovo and Serbia, which has not recognized Kosovo's declaration of independence.
Serbia has reportedly advised its athletes in Rio to withdraw from any medal ceremonies if they have to share the podium with athletes from Kosovo, although there were no Serbian judokas participating on Sunday.
Kosovo won further sporting recognition in May when it was accepted as a member of soccer's world governing body FIFA.

RIO DE JANEIRO Hsu Shu-ching claimed a 53kg gold medal for Taiwan at the Rio Games on Sunday, consigned arch-rivals China to a humbling defeat and should soon become a double Olympic champion while winning a lot of prize money in the process.
Hsu finished second at London 2012 but the winner, Zulfiya Chinshanlo, tested positive in a recent reanalysis of samples and is suspended.
Although Chinshanlo is Chinese she switched nationality to Kazakhstan, the nation with the worst doping record in weightlifting in recent years.
Her title will be taken from her when the legal process is complete and Hsu will be promoted to first place.
“I hope that happens soon, and the silver turns to gold,” said Hsu. Taiwan rewards its Olympic medalists well and that promotion would earn Hsu about $140,000.
The prize for a gold in Rio will take her total Olympic earnings to about $700,000 including what she has already been paid.
Asked what she will spend it on, Hsu said: “If I get this money it will be my pension for life, and I will give some to my family".
Hsu, 25, had expected a strong challenge from China’s Li Yajun but it never materialized. Li missed all three clean & jerk attempts and became only the second Chinese female weightlifter ever to fail to register a total. The first, Zhou Jun in London four years ago, was also a 53kg lifter.
Hsu suffered a string of serious injuries and did not compete for two years after the London Games. She had a cervical herniated disc, a leg injury and tendinitis. Hsu knows plenty about injuries as she is about to graduate in sports medicine.
Helped by Li’s failure, Hidilyn Diaz of the Philippines moved up from fifth after the snatch to second overall, winning a first weightlifting medal for her country.
Yoon Jin Hee of South Korea took the bronze.

RIO DE JANEIRO South Korea's top swimmer Park Tae-hwan apologized to his compatriots after bombing out of another race at the Rio Olympics on Sunday.
"I was afraid of looking up at the scoreboard," he told the Yonhap news agency after finishing last in his 200 meters freestyle heat.
"I didn't want to come out of the pool."
Park's presence in Rio has been controversial, the country's first Olympic swimming medalist winning a late battle to compete after appealing against a doping ban.
The 2008 gold medalist in 400m freestyle failed to qualify for the finals in that event on Saturday after clocking the 10th-fastest time.
On Sunday he was 29th overall in the 200m, a time 2.31 seconds slower than Chinese pacesetter Sun Yang, ending his hopes of winning a medal in the distance for the third Games in a row after silvers in 2008 and 2012.
Park completed an 18-month ban imposed by world governing body FINA in March after testing positive for testosterone ahead of the 2014 Asian Games.
Under a controversial Korean Olympic Committee regulation, he was then hit with an additional three-year ban from the national team the day the FINA suspension expired.
That would have ruled him out of contention for Rio but the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared the 26-year-old to compete. He is also due to swim in the 100m and 1,500m freestyle races in Rio.
"I wanted to put yesterday's 400m race behind me," he said on Sunday. "But I think I was trying too hard to make up for it and my shoulders didn't move the way I wanted them to."

RIO DE JANEIRO The capricious nature of road racing revealed itself on Rio's perilous Olympic course again on Sunday as Anna van der Breggen took gold after a horror crash for a teammate and American Mara Abbott was cruelly denied a medal.
After commanding leader Annemiek van Vleuten somersaulted into a ditch after skidding at high speed on the slippery Vista Chinesa descent with less than 20km remaining, Abbott rode solo and was leading with 200 meters of the 137km route left before she was engulfed by three chasers.
Van der Breggen then waited for her moment and powered past Beijing runner-up Emma Johansson of Sweden and Italian Elisa Longo Borghini, who took silver and bronze with Abbott trailing in the dreaded fourth place.
The 26-year-old continues Dutch domination of the Olympic road race since it was introduced in 1984. The cycle-mad nation has won four of the nine editions, but emotions were mixed as Van Vleuten was taken to hospital with back injuries.
A statement from the Dutch Cycling Federation (KNWU) said she was conscious and not in danger.
"She has severe concussion and three small fracture particles in her lumbar spine. She will remain in I.C. for 24 hours," it said on Twitter. "She is conscious and talking."
Van der Breggen expressed concern for her teammate after the finish.
"I won the biggest race of my career so I'm really happy but I'm really hoping Annemiek is okay," she told Reuters.
"It shocked me to see her there. It took me a while to realize that, OK we have to get our heads back on the race and start the chase. I knew we couldn't help her."
Reigning champion Marianne Vos could only finish ninth but played a vital support role to her younger Dutch team mates, sacrificing her own hopes with a series of attacks that took the sting out of several favorites.
World champion Lizzie Armitstead of Britain, dogged by controversy in the build-up after escaping a ban for missed doping tests, was fifth in a compelling race that ignited on the Vista Chinesa climb that caused mayhem in Saturday's men's race.
Van Vleuten and Abbott attacked hard on the 8.9km climb and scaled the summit together before Van Vleuten streaked ahead on the twisty descent as Abbott adopted a cautious line as drizzle added to the treacherous nature of the road that caught out Italian Vincenzo Nibali 24 hours earlier.
Toward the bottom of hill she appeared to lock her wheel and careered headlong over her handlebars into a bank - lying motionless in a twisted heap as Abbott sped by.
While Van Vleuten's hopes ended suddenly, Abbott seeped away and she was tearful at the finish after losing a 28-second lead in the last three kilometers of the race, her pursuers working together to relentlessly reel her in.
"I didn't think about winning it until I got to 200m to go and the second I thought it they passed me," she said before being consoled by 42-year-old team mate Kristin Armstrong.
"It shows you shouldn't count your chickens."
On the crash, she said: "Sometimes in cycling the ones that look really bad aren't as bad so I just hope that she's all right... There's something weird about the surface there."
The first half of the race, along a windswept coast and two circuits of the partly-cobbled Grumari climbs, belonged to 20-year-old Belgian Lotte Kopecky who stayed out in front alone for 70km before being caught.
A series of attacks followed before the day's big climb with Germany's Trixi Worrack taking six riders with her, including Vos, as the final climb loomed.
Vos later faded, but this time she was not Plan A.
"She is a hero of mine and she worked so hard for me today. I'm so proud," Van der Breggen said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Dutch road race gold medalist Anna van der Breggen said she had to snap back into race mode after seeing stricken team mate Annemiek van Vleuten crumpled by the roadside on Sunday.
Van der Breggen was part of a chasing pack pursuing Van Vleuten and American Mara Abbott when her compatriot, who seemed on course for victory, suffered a horrible high-speed crash that left her in hospital with concussion and back injuries.
The 26-year-old went on to catch Abbott 200 meters from the end of 137km Olympic race around Rio's stunning coastline.
But for a while she was in shock before her racing instincts helped her strike out for a thrilling victory.
"It really shook me when I saw Annemiek crashed in the road," Van der Breggen, who along with Emma Johansson and Elisa Longo Borghini closed a 40-second gap to Abbott, told reporters.
"I was pretty shocked. I saw her and she was on the edge (of the road). We needed some time to realize we have to chase now and keep our heads on the race because we couldn't help her.
"I was struggling to think straight but then race modus was coming on again."
Van der Breggen, who won the Fleche Wallonne race this year and was runner-up in last year's world championships, gauged the final 20km to perfection and despite the adrenaline pumping she made sure she left something in her legs for a final sprint.
Although she admitted she thought Abbott was too far ahead.
"I thought we were not going to catch her," she said. "Then we saw her. Then I thought it's too close to the finish! But we just went as fast as possible and worked as a three.
"When I realized that we would catch her I said to myself 'don't work any more because you need to sprint also'.
"I was hoping they were still chasing. I stayed at the back and needed to gamble."
The race came to life on the final climb, the Vista Chinesa, when Abbott and Van Vleuten took off, leaving Van der Breggen in a group desperately trying to stay in contention.
"The race kind of exploded," she said.
She is the fourth Dutchwoman to win the Olympic road race since it came on to the program in 1984 and takes the women's cycling crown from Marianne Vos who fell short of a record-equalling 10th gold medal in the Olympics and world championships.
"That Marianne was the one before is really good for the Dutch cycling," she said. "How she was working for me today that was an amazing feeling and she's an amazing rider."

RIO DE JANEIRO New Zealand and Australia were both given a fright by the United States but remained on course to meet in the inaugural Olympic women's sevens final by reaching the semi-finals unbeaten in Rio on Sunday.
World series champions Australia needed a late converted try to draw 12-12 with the Americans in the pool stage in the afternoon but blanked Spain 24-0 in the evening to set up a meeting on Monday with Canada, who beat France 15-5.
New Zealand had romped into their quarter-final against the Americans but were forced to defend a 5-0 lead with only six players for three minutes of the second half before securing their passage to a semi-final against Britain, 26-7 winners over Fiji.
"Full credit to our girls, to defend our line with six like that was awesome," said New Zealand's Kelly Brazier.
"Defense wins games and we pride ourselves on that. A win's a win, 5-0, 2-0, we'll take it."
After racking up 109 points in their first three matches, New Zealand had been held to just one Portia Woodman try, her sixth of tournament, when American flyer Jessica Javelet was taken down chasing a kick through.
The referee decided against a penalty try but New Zealand's Tyla Nathan-Wong was sent to the sin bin, setting up the dramatic conclusion to the second day's action at the Deodoro Stadium.
Australia's progress was smoother, Charlotte Caslick scored a brace and Emma Tonegato once to both move to six tries for the tournament, but coach Tim Walsh admitted his side had been far from their best.
"Today we grinded out wins which is what good teams need to do," he said.
"In any tournament the quarter-final's always the big one, but now we're playing for a medal. And we're not happy with a bronze or a silver."
The third seeded Canadians, who were stunned 22-0 by Britain in their final pool match earlier on Sunday, recovered from a poor start against a fired-up French side to progress to the last four.
Jade Le Pesq scored the opener for France before the Canadian responded with tries to Kayla Moleschi, Bianca Farella and Ghislaine Landry.
Abbie Brown gave Britain the perfect start to their match against the physical Fijians when she snatched the kickoff out of the air and raced away to score the opening try after 13 seconds.
Litia Naiqato loped over the line with the ball in one hand to level the scores halfway through the first half but Britain responded with tries from Alice Richardson and Joanne Whatmore with Brown crossing again for the only score after the break.
"It is a team thing," Brown said. "I happened to be in the right place at the right time. We stuck to our principles and basics and came out with the win."
Hosts Brazil, Colombia, Kenya and Japan were the teams to miss out on the knockout rounds.

RIO DE JANEIRO Italy won their second fencing medal in as many days when Daniele Garozzo upset top-ranked Alexander Massialas in the final, stopping his shot at the first U.S. men's fencing gold in over 100 years in a raucous arena on Sunday.
Britain's Richard Kruse also came up short of an historic medal, falling to Russia's Timur Safin in the bronze medal bout and letting the first British fencing medal since 1964 slip from his grasp.
The anchor of the best U.S. men's foil team in memory, Massialas nearly made a quarter-final exit from Sunday's individual tournament, slipping to an 8-14 deficit against another Italian, Giorgio Avola.
Seven straight touches put the American through to a semi-final with Kruse, but the magic eluded him when Garozzo also built an 8-14 lead at the end of the night.
"Unfortunately, you can only pull so many rabbits out of your hat, as he did in the quarter-final," said three-time Olympic fencer Greg Massialas, father to Alexander and coach of the U.S. men's foil team.
The win by 11th-ranked Garozzo, who had lost to Massialas three times since last year, helped to bring Italy even with China at the top of the overall medal count, totaling seven.
At several moments in the final, the American fencer turned to his father and coach with a shrug as the din of a rowdy Brazilian crowd broke down communication during the bout.
He was one of many fencers overcome by the crowd's stomping, whistling and booing, which injected a measure of chaos into the traditionally genteel sport as they ignored organizers' pleas for quiet.
"Cheering is cool. Jeering is not," said an announcer over the loudspeaker in Portuguese, but the Brazilian fans carried on booing points against local fencers.
Their enthusiasm helped lift Brazilian Guilherme Toldo, ranked 66th in the world, to an astonishing upset of second-ranked Yuki Ota, 2008 silver medalist and 2015 world champion, in the Japanese fencer's first match.
Toldo also beat Hong Kong's Cheung Ka Long before falling to Garozzo, while his Brazilian team mate Ghislain Perrier came within a touch of toppling China's third-ranked Ma Jianfei in the thunderous arena.
"This crowd gets into it, they're playing along with the athletes," said Toldo. "Obviously that makes a difference."
It was the second quarter-final appearance by a Brazilian after Nathalie Moellhausen's historic place in the last eight  on Saturday, also boosted by the rowdy crowd.

Japanese outfielder Ichiro Suzuki became the 30th member of Major League Baseball's exclusive 3,000-hits club on Sunday.

* Considered the greatest hitter in Japanese baseball history, Ichiro dominated the game in his homeland for nearly nine years during which he was a seven-times Pacific League batting champion and racked up 1,278 hits.
* Became the first Japanese position player, or non-pitcher, to be signed by a U.S. team when he joined the Seattle Mariners in 2001 and became only the second player to win Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player awards in the same season.
* Eclipsed an 84-year-old record for hits in a season when he finished the 2004 campaign with 262 hits, five more than the previous mark set by George Sisler in 1920.
* Reached 200-plus hits for a record 10th consecutive year in the 2010 season. He fell 16 hits shy of extending his streak the following campaign.
* Stole 45 consecutive bases without getting caught over the course of the 2006 and 2007 season, an American League record and five short of the all-time mark set by Vince Coleman.
* Is a two-time batting champion, 10-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove winner during an MLB career that has included stints with Seattle, the New York Yankees and Miami.
* His combined Japanese and North American total of 4,278 hits tops Pete Rose's all-time record of 4,256 but does not carry the same weight since the latter's came entirely while playing in MLB.

RIO DE JANEIRO Chinese gymnast Shang Chunsong was relieved she was able to play a part in women's qualifying on Sunday after illness almost caused her to miss the competition.
Shang has been recovering from a nasty bout of fever and wasn't able to train for nearly five days ahead of China's debut, a wobbly performance for a team that has hoped to regain the podium in Rio after relinquishing the gold medal to the U.S. women's team at the 2012 London Games.
Though far from perfect, China are well placed to reach Tuesday's team final, where a U.S. team led by world all-around champion Simone Biles are the favorites.
During her illness, Shang had thought that she might have to relinquish her spot on China's team in Rio.
''I was worried because the coach said that I might get replaced on the team since I had a fever,'' Shang, who is also expected to make the cut for the all around final, said on Sunday.
She said the qualifying performance -- where her vault was shaky and drew a low score of 12.766 -- wasn't up to her standards and had been affected by nerves.
''I feel regret because I didn't perform well. If I performed more bravely, then I would have done better,'' Shang said.
Team China provisionally topped qualifying with a total of 175.279 points, but are likely to slide down the rankings once world champions United States perform later on Sunday.
None of the scores from Sunday carry over to Tuesday's team finals. In qualifying, four competitors from each country compete on each apparatus with only the top three scores counting toward the total. In the final, each nation will put forward three athletes and all three scores will count.
It wasn't the first time Shang has overcome difficulty on her path to the Olympics.
Growing up in poverty in rural China, Shang's parents couldn't afford to hire a coach for her, and her visually impaired brother made a deep sacrifice.
''My brother did a lot of things for me. I lived in the countryside. I needed a coach, but we didn't have any money,'' said the 20-year-old gymnast.
''My brother gave up studying for me to do gymnastics. My dream is to find a way to cure my brother's eyes. I want him to see how beautiful the world is.''

RIO DE JANEIRO Taking inspiration from the sequinned lion on her blue leotard, British gymnast Ellie Downie roared back from a rough tumble that hurt her neck in the floor exercise, completing the vault to help her team pocket strong marks in Sunday's qualifying round.
Britain were provisionally third, behind China and Russia, with a total of 174.064 points, though they were likely to be bumped down once the American team competed in the fourth group of competitors.
Downie, 17, said she turned too slowly during a tumble, causing her knees to buckle and crunching up her neck. She carried on, but started to feel dizzy right before her last tumble and walked off the floor, seeming dazed.
"I was like, 'Stop, make sure you're okay first'. So I went out, came back, and I was fine," she told reporters after the competition.
Becky Downie, Ellie's 24-year-old sister and fellow gymnast, called her younger sibling a "fighter" for coming back to land a 14.833 on vault after her scare.
"It was a bit of a shock to the system, and I'm just really glad she's okay," she said.
The overwhelmingly Brazilian crowd at the Rio Olympic Arena breathed a sigh of relief when Ellie returned, with memories still fresh of the broken leg sustained by French gymnast Samir Ait Said in a crash landing from the vault on Saturday.
The British women fared particularly well on bars and, despite a few sloppy landings and a fall for Becky Downie on beam, were upbeat about their prospects.
"I'm so proud of our team," said British gymnast Amy Tinkler, 16. "We all know we have a chance at medaling now."

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilian beach volleyball duo Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca swept aside their Russian opposition in two sets on Sunday, giving a strong push to their hopes of beating the United States to the gold medal at the Rio Olympics.
Russia's Ekaterina Birlova and Evgenia Ukolova fell to Brazil 21-14 21-16 in Pool A, in front of a crowd of yellow-and-green-clad spectators who waved Brazilian flags and raucously cheered for the home-country favorites.
The pair represent Brazil's best shot at thwarting U.S. players April Ross and Kerri Walsh Jennings at the Games, after logging their fourth win in five FIVB world tour matches against the Americans last month.
While a potential meeting with Walsh Jennings, seeking her fourth successive Olympic gold, and Ross, looms large for Brazilian spectators, Franca said she and Antunes were concentrating on one game at a time.
"This moment we are not thinking about (Walsh Jennings and Ross) because it's not the next game," Franca, who won a bronze at the London 2012 Olympics, said through a translator. "So we just look for tomorrow's game."
Antunes was delighted with the win. "I'm so happy; it's a special moment," she said. "We trained so hard for this moment.
"For me, (Franca is) the best player in the world at this moment. I have the best player behind me."
Walsh Jennings and Ross thrashed Australian pair Mariafe Artacho Del Solar and Nicole Laird in a Pool C match that ended just after 1:00 a.m. local time (12:00 a.m. EDT) on Sunday.

RIO DE JANEIRO A day after star model Gisele Bundchen sashayed down the middle of the opening Olympic ceremony to rapturous applause, the crowd was going crazy for another graceful, long-haired Brazilian model strutting her stuff on the fencing piste.
Nathalie Moellhausen, whose sixth-place finish on Saturday was the best ever for a Brazilian woman, has walked for Italian dressmaker Alberta Ferretti and won team gold at the 2009 world championship. She says the inspiration for both is the same.
"Everything I do in fashion is related to fencing," said Italian-born Moellhausen, wearing gold earrings of her own design in the shape of swords. "My idea is to develop fencing as not just a sport, but as an artistic form, like fashion."
She is one of several fencers at the Rio Games walking a straight line from the piste to the runway.
For some, the modeling cash has even helped to keep their fencing careers afloat.
"When I was between 20 and 23 I was also modeling, but I did it because I needed money for my fencing career and for the trips to compete," said Argentina's Maria Belen Perez Maurice.
For other fencers, the world of high fashion has also helped to extend their public profiles beyond their niche sport.
"I started it," said both Race Imboden and Miles Chamley-Watson of Team USA, independently and unprompted, when the subject came up of fencers launching careers on the runway.
It would appear that both are mistaken, as U.S. fencers Jason Rogers and Tim Morehouse started with Wilhelmina Models soon after taking team silver in Beijing.
But neither had the profile of Imboden, who has walked for Louis Vuitton, appeared in J. Crew catalogs and even appeared in a video for Rag & Bone with famed dancer and fencing fan Mikhail Baryshnikov, all since being scouted at London in 2012.
Chamley-Watson has also supplemented classic sponsorships such as Nike with modeling for Rochambeau and Ralph Lauren.
Fencing's noble history and elegant poses seem to have drawn labels' interest, along with the lissome frame of many fencers.
"We're pretty lean and pretty tall," said Imboden, weighing the appeal. "I just think we're a good looking sport."

RIO DE JANEIRO Damaging wind gusts, a fresh doping controversy and the robbery of a visiting government minister presented the Rio Games with a perfect storm of problems on Sunday, forcing organizers to scramble to keep the world's biggest sporting event rolling on.
Winds wreaked havoc on the second full day of competition, forcing the cancellation of rowing races and delays to tennis and kayaking, while spectators ran for cover from flying signs, cafe umbrellas and other debris torn from their moorings.
Games organizers, who were already looking to fix the long queues at security checkpoints that marred the first day, also faced new security scares. Portugal's education minister was robbed at knifepoint on Saturday at the Olympic lake. He escaped unharmed and the assailant was arrested, Brazilian authorities said.
More security was also put around the equestrian center after a stray bullet tore through the roof of the press room there on Saturday, an unexplained incident which caused no injuries. The center is near a military complex and a slum.
"This is a worrying situation and is not an incident we can take lightly as the safety of everyone at our venue – athletes, horses, media and spectators – is of prime importance," said International Equestrian Federation president Ingmar De Vos.
Brazilian authorities are still investigating.
As powerful gusts swept across the host city, blowing debris and forcing spectators to find cover, the Rio Games was hit by a new Russian doping storm, this time involving the Paralympics, due to run from Sept. 7 to 18.
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) announced in Rio it would ban Russia from the whole event due to widespread doping that it said had polluted sport in that country.
"Tragically this situation is not about athletes cheating a system, but about a state-run system that is cheating the athletes," IPC president Philip Craven told reporters.
"I believe the Russian government has catastrophically failed its para-athletes. Their medals-over-morals mentality disgusts me."
Russia immediately announced it would be appealing against the ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The IPC's decision contrasted with the International Olympic Committee which balked at a blanket ban on Russia's athletes in Rio. The global anti-doping agency had called for such a ban after an inquiry found Russia was running a state-backed doping program for both Olympic and Paralympic athletes.
"The IPC showed strong leadership today in holding Russia's state-organized doping program accountable. Their unanimous decision goes a long way towards inspiring us all," said Travis Tygart, chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.

STREET CRIME
Of all the problems faced by Rio organizers, street crime is the one they have least control over.
Brazil's Ministry of Justice said a senior government official, who works for an agency responsible for security at major events such as the Olympics, was the target of an assault as he left the opening ceremony on Friday.
Felipe Seixas, who was accompanied by two undercover police, was confronted by armed robbers outside Maracana stadium. One was shot and killed by one of the undercover officers.
On Wednesday, three Swedish tourists were briefly abducted by armed men after they stopped to take photos near a dangerous slum. They were released unharmed.
Some 500,000 foreign visitors are expected to descend on Rio for the Games. They are protected by 85,000 police and soldiers, more than double the security for the 2012 Games in London.

"It really shook me when I saw Annemiek crashed in the road. I was pretty shocked, I think she crashed hard. I realized I was at the front of the team, so I had to chase. I did it for Annemiek. To see her like that, it's a big shock."

1333 ALL ROWING CALLED OFF FOR THE DAY
The second day of the 2016 Olympic rowing regatta was called off due to problems caused by rough weather, organizers announced.
The decision followed a day of difficult conditions on the opening day on Saturday, with some rowers complaining that the races should have been postponed. One boat capsized and several others were nearly swamped.

Australian bad boy Nick Kyrgios may feel his decision to pull out of the Olympics was justified after he claimed his second ATP title by downing John Isner 7-6(3) 7-6(4) in the final of the Atlanta Open on Sunday.
Top seed Isner was seeking a fourth consecutive title in the Georgia event, but the tall American fell short in his historic quest in a battle of big servers.
Second seed Kyrgios overcame a love-40 deficit in his first service game, with both players holding serve throughout the match.
"Returning is very crucial against John," said Kyrgios. "That serve is world-class. It would have been a completely different story if he got me there."
Kyrgios, 21, for all his undoubted talent, has made as many headlines for his off-court antics as for his tennis during his turbulent career.
He was in the headlines again recently when he pulled out of the Rio Olympics after a public spat with the Australian chef de mission Kitty Chiller, who said that some of Kyrgios's social media posts suggested that "he doesn't really understand what it means to be an Australian Olympian."
Kyrgios responded to Chiller's comments by announcing he would skip Rio.


RIO DE JANEIRO First-time Olympian Catherine Skinner of Australia battled to the end of a tense all-Oceania final in women's trap shooting to win the gold medal on Sunday, edging out Natalie Rooney of New Zealand by one shot.
The 26-year-old Skinner hit 12 of her 15 orange targets with her shotgun to Rooney's 11, but she got off to a rough start by missing the first target.
"I have had plenty of finals when I missed the first shot and it went downhill from there," said Skinner, who won her first gold medal in a major international competition.
After qualifying at the bottom of the six finalists, Skinner  was a steady shot in the semi-finals blasting 14 of the 15 targets and went straight to the final, prevailing over a veteran field including defending Olympic champion Jessica Rossi.
Rooney, also a first-time Olympian, made it to the final in a shoot-off with American Corey Cogdell.
Cogdell, a three-time Olympian, took her second Olympic bronze medal by besting Spain's Fatima Galvez in a shoot-off, after each woman shot 13 of their 15 targets for the medal.
Skinner said having a fellow Oceania competitor next to her in the final was a big advantage.
"It is really relaxing seeing a familiar face there," Skinner said of Rooney. "I am glad she was there. I am so happy she got a result too."
Skinner's win gives Australia the lead among all countries in the ranking of gold medals, with three: one in shooting and two in swimming.
Taking up shooting at the age of 12 and competing since 2006, Skinner said her first Olympic memory was looking at the Atlanta Games medal tally and thinking "Shooting? Who does shooting?"
Now, the recently graduated chemical engineer said she views trap shooting as a "nerve-wracking" sport, making Sunday's breakthrough a big reward for the stress of the last six months.
Italy's Rossi crashed out in the semi-finals after missing five of the 15 targets, a big disappointment for the police officer after she easily claimed gold and set a world record in London 2012. She finished sixth.
World No. 1 Ray Bassil of Lebanon did not qualify for the final, finishing in 14th position.

RIO DE JANEIRO A day after narrowly missing gold in the men's Olympic 400 meters individual medley, American Chase Kalisz was already thinking about his next shot at the top of the Olympic podium, when the games move to Tokyo in 2020.
"My goal is obviously to be in Tokyo and I'm more driven than ever after last night," the 22-year-old native of Baltimore told reporters the day after being edged out by Japan's Kosuke Hagino. "I'm going to try to set myself the next four years to be in a position to contend for a gold medal again."
Kalisz took a year off from college to prepare for the Rio Olympics, moving to Arizona to train under Bob Bowman, who also coaches American swimming phenomenon Michael Phelps. He credited that year with Saturday's result.
"The biggest thing was kind of me being isolated, not having any other outside distractions from swimming. So it was eat, sleep, swim and that's all I did," Kalisz said. "I did everything right that I possibly could for a year."
Kalisz overcame a youthful bout of Guillain-Barre syndrome, which paralyzed him for six months, before becoming an elite athlete, a trend that runs in a family where his older sister competed at the college level and two younger siblings contested the U.S. Olympic trials.
He said he hoped his medal would inspire them to similar performances: "My two younger siblings, I would like to think that they can look back on this and hope it motivates them to kind of want to be their best."

RIO DE JANEIRO Another day of Olympic sports played out before empty seats led to an admission from organizers that only Friday's Opening Ceremony has so far sold out.
Demand for tickets is running at 82 percent, considerably below London four years ago even though they are roughly half the price.
Not even Brazil's Olympic soccer team in its first match at the Games has attracted a capacity crowd and on Sunday the women's sevens tournament was played in front of at best half-filled 15,000-seater Deodoro stadium while only a few thousand spectators watched the women's cycling road race.
''We have sold 82 percent of the tickets we have available, 5 million tickets. We still have 1.1 million tickets to sell,'' said Games spokesman Mario Andrada, although organizers say they had surpassed their financial target from sales by 5 percent.
''Yesterday we started the day with 388,000 tickets sold and we ended the day with 410,000 tickets sold, which means people are able to buy ticket at the venues,'' he said.
Brazil, having long run out of cash for the Olympics, is struggling with its worst recession since the 1930s amid a political crisis.
Suspended President Dilma Rousseff faces an impeachment trial later this month while interim President Michel Temer is also deeply unpopular and opinion polls show Brazilians want fresh elections.
Prices for the Rio tickets range between $10 and about $1,150 for the opening ceremony. More than half the tickets cost $17 or less, about half the price of London tickets.
London eventually sold 8.2 million out of the 8.5 million tickets issued for the Games.
''Certainly the issues we had with 'mag and bag' (security screening) we had yesterday morning impacted the ability of people to get in,'' Andrada said.
''Some people, especially those with children, have decided to go home, which we regret,'' Andrada said.
Long delays at security checkpoints frustrated spectators on the first day of full competition, some of whom missed the competitions they had wanted to see.
''None of the sessions yesterday were fully sold out,'' he said.
''As you know, we are obliged by law to keep a contingency for last-minute arrivals... so we need to keep around 6 percent of every session in every venue available until the last-possible minute so that prevents us from claiming sold-out events as often as we would like to.''

The crowd at Copacabana's Beach Volleyball Arena loudly booed and taunted American volleyball players Lauren Fendrick and Brooke Sweat during an Olympic pool match Sunday, shouting "Zika" each time one of the duo served.
Their treatment follows U.S. women's soccer goalie Hope Solo also being roundly booed in a pool match against France on Saturday night because of her comments about the virus.
Neither Sweat nor Fendrick is known for expressing alarm over playing under the threat of the virus - indeed in an interview with a U.S. channel last week, Fendrick called the water quality in Brazil and Zika "non-factors" for the duo.
But with some high profile U.S. competitors having withdrawn from the Games citing their concerns over Zika, other U.S. athletes also appear to have become targets for vocal criticism.
In February, the U.S. Olympic Committee told U.S. sports federations that athletes and staff concerned for their health over Zika should consider not going to the Games.
American golfer Dustin Johson is among several top-ranked men in the sport who dropped out over Zika fears.
In June, American cyclist Tejay Van Garderen withdrew his name from consideration for the U.S. team, also citing concern over the virus.
Global health officials are racing to better understand the virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.
In the match, Fendrick and Sweat started strong against Poland's Monika Brzostek and Kinga Kolosinska, winning the first set 21-14, before falling apart and losing the following two sets 13-21 and 7-15.

RIO DE JANEIRO First-time Olympian Zhang Mengxue secured China's first gold medal of the 2016 Olympics on Sunday by winning the women's 10-metre air pistol event and extending her nation's gold medal streak in the sport.
Coming off a tough qualifying round, the 25-year-old Zhang handily won the final with a score of 199.4 points in 20 shots, well ahead of 19-year-old Vitalina Batsarashkina from Russia, the silver medalist with a score of 197.1.
Anna Korakaki from Greece won the bronze, becoming the first Greek woman to win a medal in shooting.
Zhang kept China in top standing in the event after countrywoman and London 2012 and Beijing 2008 gold medalist Guo Wenjun failed to qualify for the finals, finishing in 30th place.
Zhang established her lead midway through the event and pulled away with a 10.9 perfect shot in the final rounds. Her score is an Olympic record under the new finals format.
Ranked fifth in the world, Zhang said she felt her only obligation was to qualify, but she barely made it, coming in seventh out of eight finalists.
"I was pretty calm for the final actually, because the qualification was a bit tough for me," said Zhang, who joined the national team two years ago.
By midday Sunday, China had six medals so far in the Rio Games, Zhang's gold, two silvers and three bronzes.
For Batsarashkina, who won her country's second medal of the Games, it was "not the best final, but it is the Olympic Games and somehow it happened."
She stressed that Russia's problem with dozens of athletes being banned from the Olympics for doping violations has nothing to do with her or other athletes.
"I don't think this is an athletes' problem, this is an issue of the countries and the anti-doping committees that dealt with this issue," she said.
Korakaki, 20, reveled in her milestone medal, the first of these Games for Greece, after two difficult years of training in a country struggling with a prolonged economic crisis.
"We were facing difficulties with equipment and our relationship with the federation, but I made it and qualified for the Olympics last year," she said.
"Since then, I worked really hard and I am really happy I achieved this."

RIO DE JANEIRO The seemingly unstoppable American women's eight rowing team launch their quest for another Olympic gold medal when the heats get underway on Monday with a possible dynasty in the making.
The U.S. have claimed gold in the past two Olympics and underlined their dominance of the event by winning a 10th consecutive world title at the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette, France, last September.
Matthew Pinsent, Britain's four-time Olympic gold medal rower, called the U.S. women's eight the "most dominant outfit in world rowing at the moment".
"It has a sort of gravitational pull within the rowing (community)," Pinsent said. "It attracts the best people."
Pinsent pointed to the boat's high turnover rate as evidence of the exacting standards and high level of performance required to make the squad.
"No seat is ever really safe," he said.
Just two of this year's crew are returning Olympians: Eleanor Logan, 28, who competed in both the 2008 Beijing Games and the 2012 London Games, and Meghan Musnicki, 33, a member of the eight crew in London.
The success story began after Tom Terhaar became the women's head coach at the U.S. rowing federation (USRowing) in 2001.
Terhaar, who declined an interview request, led the women's eight to a silver medal in Athens in 2004, the first medal the U.S. had won in the event in two decades.
USRowing high performance director Curtis Jordan told Reuters the boat operated on a "very systematic" basis.
"The athletes and the coaches go about their business knowing that everybody's beatable," Jordan said. "If you don't do your homework and you don't do what you’re supposed to, you're going to get beaten."
Jordan pointed to Canada, the Netherlands and Britain as the boat's possible top challengers, citing strong programs in all three countries.
David Tanner, British Rowing's performance director, told Reuters that their team were "confident and grounded" going into the Games.
"If you don’t believe you can challenge a boat like (the U.S.) then you’re not going to be on the podium yourself," Tanner said.

RIO DE JANEIRO The Rio Olympic Games got off to a shambolic and nervous start on Saturday, with organizers apologizing to angry fans kept waiting for hours at security checkpoints to enter venues while, outside, shootings and bomb scares kept visitors on edge.
Athletes competed in front of empty stands early on the first day of full competition as spectators complained of missing their events while queueing for security clearance.
The morning after a dazzling opening ceremony, organizers admitted to dropping the ball, with only a few hundred spectators making their way into venues such as the gymnastics arena and the beach volleyball on iconic Copacabana beach.
Outside, lines stretched for several blocks as fans stood in full sun and security staff struggled. Organizers blamed a lack of coordination between security personnel, including the police, Games staff and private security firms.
Gymnasts performed in front of swathes of empty seats in an arena that can seat 13,500 people. The boxing venue also had many empty seats as the first professionals in Olympics history entered the ring.
"I don't believe it. It's absurd, ridiculous," said Rio resident Natalia Carvalho, 28, who missed seeing Brazilian gymnast and medal hopeful Arthur Zanetti compete on the rings as she waited with thousands of others to enter the Olympic park.
"It's a lack of respect for the fan that bought tickets. It's a shame," she said.
What should have been a celebration of the start of South America's first Olympics turned into a damage-control operation, with Games spokesman Mario Andrada vowing an immediate improvement.
"We apologize for everybody standing in line outside the venues," he told reporters. "Within the next hours we will be in much better shape."
At the tennis center, where former world number one Ana Ivanovic played in front of virtually empty stands in the first round, fans had to wait more than 20 minutes to buy water.
Spectators encountered similar situations at the rowing and the rugby venues as temperatures hit 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit).

SECURITY JITTERS
Security has emerged as a top concern after a string of killings, kidnappings and robberies in recent days.
Spectators leaving the Olympics opening ceremony at the famed Maracana stadium on Friday night were confronted by the body of a 22-year-old man shot dead by police in the street.
Police said the man had robbed several people in the area, but did not give further details.
A 51-year-old Brazilian woman was also shot dead during a robbery on Friday in the renovated "Marvelous Port" area meant to be a main attraction for Olympic tourists.
That came a day after police confirmed that a man sitting in a car had killed a suspect who tried to carjack his luxury automobile in the main Olympic area of Barra. The Russian consul denied media reports that the man was a consulate employee.
On Saturday, a bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion of an unattended bag, believed to belong to a homeless man, near the finish line of the men's cycling road race on Copacabana's sweeping boulevard.
There have been several controlled blasts in recent days as     organizers have tightened security around venues, amid concerns the Games could be a target for militants.
Brazil detained 12 people for suspected links to Islamic State last month. It says the risk of an attack is minimal, with authorities having deployed 85,000 police and military to guard the Games, roughly twice the number at the 2012 London Olympics.
Lorie Schmetterling, who traveled from Moorestown, New Jersey with her husband Eric to cheer on their daughter Laura, a U.S. rower, was disturbed to learn about the bomb scare a few hundred meters from where she was staying.
"You hear all these terrible things about how it is going to be and then you get here and it seems fine," she said. "Then this happens and you feel it, you go on high alert again."
Journalists covering equestrian events in the Deodoro Olympic zone got a fright on Saturday when a stray bullet cut through the plastic roof of the equestrian media center. The bullet flew above the head of the New Zealand team's media attache, according to the team's chef de mission, Rob Waddell.
No one was injured in the incident. The equestrian venue is sited next to a military complex, though police are still trying to discover who fired the bullet and from where, a spokesman for the Rio 2016 organizing committee said.
Other robberies and thefts have targeted tourists and media in Rio. Some 500,000 foreigners are expected to pass through the city during the Games that run until Aug. 21.
Three Swedish tourists were briefly kidnapped on Wednesday by an armed man as they pulled off on a highway near a slum to take photos. They were quickly released unharmed after the gunman checked the photos they took.
Drug gangs in Rio do not allow anyone to take photos or video of the areas where they operate, for fear of having their faces seen by police.

RIO DE JANEIRO Kohei Uchimura's clumsy slip on the horizontal bar not only shocked fans at the Rio Olympic Arena on Saturday but came to represent a horror day for Japan's men's gymnastics team in their efforts to dethrone China as Olympic champions.
Uchimura, who has won six all around world titles and an Olympic gold, produced a deafening thud after he lost his grip and fell into an ungainly heap on the floor.
Although the 27-year-old got back on the bar to earn 14.300, the fall summed up a poor day of men's qualifying for Japan, who featured four survivors from their 2012 silver-medal winning squad but were upstaged by their Asian rivals, the United States and Russia on the opening day of competition.
As the reigning world champions, they would have been expected to breach the 15-point mark in many of their performances but instead all they did was produce a succession of botched routines.
Yusuke Tanaka was the first to stumble with 13.366 on the pommel horse, before Ryohei Kato earned 13.966 on rings and Koji Yamamuro sat down and almost rolled off the crash mat following his vault to score 13.200.
Yamamuro (12.733) and Tanaka (13.866) both failed to impress on the parallel bars, while Uchimura's mishap was particularly surprising considering he is the world champion on the apparatus.
It was not until they performed on their final apparatus, the floor exercise, that all four Japanese gymnasts scored over 15 points on the same discipline.
The 19-year-old Kenzo Shirai was the only one who did not let the team down but he only performed on the vault and floor.
"I don't think the mistake on the high bar was a bad thing because... what happened today can only make me stronger," said Uchimura, whose fall meant he was out of the running to win the horizontal bar title in Rio.
"We try and perform like world champions but this is the Olympic Games and it stresses us out."
Luckily for Japan none of the scores will be carried through to Monday's team final but what they do know is that if they want to end China's eight-year reign as Olympic champions, they cannot afford another similar performance.
Uchimura can, however, take heart from the fact he won the 2012 all around gold despite finishing ninth in qualifying and remains the favorite to become the first man since compatriot Sawao Kato in 1972 to win successive Olympic all around titles.
(This version of the story refiles earlier verison)

RIO DE JANEIRO,  Former Olympic champion Venus Williams was eliminated in the first round at the Rio Games on Saturday after Belgian underdog Kirsten Flipkens mounted a spirited fight back to cause the biggest upset of the opening day.
Another notable casualty on the first day of competition was former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic, who surged ahead in the first set against world No. 12 Carla Suarez Navarro but lost 2-6 6-1 6-2 after two error-strewn sets.
With U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and gymnastics gold medal favorite Simone Biles looking on, seven-times grand slam winner Williams won the first set but became frustrated as the match wore on, losing 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) to the world number 62.
Flipkens collapsed on to the court after winning the final set tie-breaker and the rowdy Brazilian crowd serenaded her with chants of "ole, ole, ole".
Flipkens later thanked the "amazing" Brazilian crowd for helping her pull off one of the biggest wins of her career.
"To beat Venus Williams on the center court, one of the biggest champions in our history, that (gave me) goosebumps all over the place," she told reporters.
The loss will not be the end of the competition for 2000 Sydney Games champion Williams, however, as the 36-year-old is bidding to win her fourth doubles gold medal with sister Serena.
Former French Open winner Ivanovic rued letting her chances slip away.
"I had a chance to come back in the third set but every time I came close to pegging her back, I missed the opportunity," said the world No. 26.
Ivanovic's match, like all the others on center court, was played in a stadium that was more than half empty, something likely to disappoint organizers.
But the size of crowds did not bother Japan's Kei Nishikori, who opened the men's singles tennis tournament on center court by knocking out Spain's Albert Ramos-Viñolas with ease, winning 6-2 6-4 in two sets.
Some players said conditions were tricky due to soaring temperatures and a strong breeze drifting across from the ocean.
"Here it’s very difficult to play because it’s fairly open, there is constantly some kind of wind," said Croatia's Marin Cilic, who beat Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov 6-1 6-4.
One player who thrived in the Rio sun was Australia's John Millman, who become the first Olympian to win a men's singles match without losing a game.
Millman's "double-bagel" 6-0, 6-0 victory came against Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis. The Australian, who has battled back to fitness after several shoulder surgeries that threatened his career, took part in Friday's late-night opening ceremony, which many Olympians competing early on Saturday skipped.
"That was a really stirring moment for me. It's hard to explain the emotions I got walking into that stadium, and obviously that carried over to today," said the 27-year-old.

Italian Sebastian Giovinco's second hat-trick of the season led Toronto FC to a 4-1 triumph over the New England Revolution and boosted his hopes of becoming Major League Soccer's (MLS) first ever back-to-back MVP on Saturday.
The comprehensive win left Toronto (10-7-6) on 36 points, just one shy of first-placed New York City FC.    The striker, who burst onto the MLS scene last year with an MVP season, is the league's leading scorer with 15 goals – two more than New York City’s David Villa.
"I'm at my best stage. At 27-28 years old until 34 or 35 should be the best years of football," the 29-year-old Giovinco told reporters through a translator.
"(Scoring goals) is a bit of an instinct. Sometimes, some of the moments if I think too much I’ll miss. Other moments I don’t think at all and it just happens."    The scores came in a variety of ways against New England as Giovinco put in a rebound in the 20th minute, curled in a shot from outside the box in the 29th and added a penalty kick in the 76th.
Giovinco is not shy about pursuing the Golden Boot for the league’s top scorer and could create a league record by again becoming the league’s best player.
"It’s nice to have some objectives. Last year it was one of my objectives (to lead in scoring)," Giovinco said. "If you can do it you might as well go for it and that way you can say you tried."
In other matches, Montreal defeated Houston 1-0 to move into third in the East, second-placed Colorado Rapids beat Vancouver 2-0 and Real Salt Lake topped Chicago Fire 3-1 while DC United and Philadelphia Union tied 2-2.

RIO DE JANEIRO A stray bullet cut through the plastic roof of the equestrian media center on Saturday, alarming journalists and underlining concerns about the host city's ability to guarantee security at the world's biggest sporting event.
No one was injured in the incident. The equestrian venue is sited next to a military complex, though police are still trying to discover who fired the bullet and from where, a spokesman for the Rio 2016 organizing committee said.
"It was a stray bullet and has nothing to do with the Games," Mario Andrada said at a news conference, adding that security around the venue had been increased as a precaution.
Defence Minister Raul Jungmann was in the area accompanying the investigation and would return there on Sunday, a spokesman said.
Dozens of police and troops patrolled the streets en route to the equestrian complex. The area was not evacuated.
Some of the world's most expensive animals are housed nearby, and the dressage phase of the eventing competition was being held just a few meters away.
The bullet struck around 1 p.m. local (1600 GMT), when the press room was crowded at the end of a lunch break.
A spokesman for New Zealand's Olympic team said the bullet had fallen close to where the team's press attache was seated.
"She was sitting down and it went between the door and ceiling above her...," said Rob Waddell, New Zealand chef de mission and an Olympic rowing gold medalist.
He said New Zealand police liaison had advised the team that they were not being targeted, though the incident was still being investigated. New Zealand team members have been advised to stay inside competition venues, he said.
"We continue to assess the situation and look at the security around the venues and also in the village," Waddell said, adding that renowned horseman Mark Todd, who holds five Olympic medals, competed roughly an hour after the incident.
Security is a major concern for organizers of South America's first Olympics. Brazil has deployed 85,000 police, military, and private security personnel for the Olympics, more than double that of London in 2012.
Also on Saturday a bomb squad detonated an unattended backpack near the end of the cycling course.
Killings in Rio and nearby Baixada Fluminense climbed 7.5 percent to 1,518 murders in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 2015.

RIO DE JANEIRO Strobe lights, blaring music, and dancing Brazilians may be fixtures at Rio's legendary night clubs, but they aren't usually spotted at Olympic venues.
On Saturday night, however, beach volleyball teams competing in the Rio 2016 Games squared off at a 'midnight party' on the famed Copacabana sand, with athletes playing into the early hours of Sunday for an electrified crowd.
"Brazil isn't playing tonight, so I'm mostly here for the party," grinned professional soldier Sergio Soares, 33, as he walked into the arena carrying a beer.
"And it's a very good party!" he said above speakers blasting hits by Brazilian star Michel Telo, Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, and American pop star Taylor Swift.
The night culminated with American favorites Kerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross thrashing Australian pair Mariafe Artacho Del Solar and Nicole Laird 21-14 21-13 in a game that finished just after 01:00 am on Sunday.
Under the strong Rio sun the previous day, Brazilian female and male teams made winning starts in their hunt for gold.
While it adds pizzazz to South America's first Olympics, the late slot is also part of a wider sports schedule aimed at maximizing television audiences on the U.S. West Coast.
Viewing figures are vital for the funding of nearly all Olympic sports, but athletes and fans have long expressed concern over the rising influence of television and advertisers.
There is also worry the odd hours could unsettle and tire athletes, who may not be able to go to bed until 3-4 am local time following late games.
Swiss Anouk Verge-Depre trained at night ahead of a Saturday game against China, but still said she had trouble talking to partner Isabelle Forrer over the noise and said the artificial light changed her perception of the ball.
In famously laid-back beach volleyball, though, some athletes brushed away concerns over burning the midnight oil.
"Six in the morning or 12 at night, I love to play beach volleyball so that's what I do," Dutch player Alexander Brouwer told Reuters after he and partner Robert Meeuwsen beat Russia on Saturday.
Attendance thinned to about half after midnight, but the atmosphere never dampened.
"It should be fun and enjoyable, that's what sports are all about," said fan Tom Stratwick, 29, who was visiting from London - and planned to explore Rio's other party scene once the volleyball wound down.

RIO DE JANEIRO Hungary's Katinka Hosszu ended her long wait for Olympic victory and Australia captured two gold medals in an exhilarating first day of swimming competition that saw three world records smashed in Rio on Saturday.
Hosszu, five times a world champion but without a medal from three previous Olympics, demolished the world record by 2.07 seconds in the final of the women's 400 meters individual medley.
Australia's women retained their Olympic title by winning the 4x100m freestyle relay in world record time, with sisters Bronte and Cate Campbell swimming the last two stages to overhaul the United States, despite the efforts of Katie Ledecky on the anchor leg.
Mack Horton's victory in the men's 400 freestyle also meant Australia had already doubled their gold medal tally from a disappointing showing four years ago.
The day's record spree began with Britain's Adam Peaty, who broke his own world mark of 57.92 in the heats of the 100 breaststroke when he clocked 57.55.
Tipped to become the first British man to win an Olympic gold since 1988, he then swam 57.62 in the semi-finals.

FIRST HONORS TO JAPAN
In the first of four evening finals, Japan's Kosuke Hagino won the men's 400m individual medley, the grueling discipline that combines butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle.
Hagino, the bronze medalist in 2012, won with a time of four minutes, 6.05 seconds to end a U.S. stranglehold on the event dating back to 1996.
Chase Kalisz of the United States, who had been fastest in the heats, finished second and Japan's Daiya Seto took the bronze.
In the men's 400 freestyle, Australia's Horton edged out defending champion Sun Yang of China and Italy's Gabriele Detti, pulling ahead in the final quarter after shadowing Britain's James Guy and Conor Dwyer of the U.S. for much of the race.
Hosszu then grabbed the spotlight with a stunning victory in the 400 individual medley.
Having suffered a nightmare Olympics in London, where she started as a hot medal prospect but came away empty-handed, she led from start to finish and stormed down the final length with the crowd roaring her on to the record.
"It's just crazy that I've been able to swim two seconds faster than anyone ever, ever did. It's just crazy," said the Hungarian, who will also contest the 200 IM, 200 butterfly and 100 and 200 backstroke.
In the women's relay, the Australians led off with Emma McKeon while Brittany Elmslie swam the second leg before Bronte Campbell overhauled the Americans and handed over to sister Cate, who touched in three minutes, 30.65 seconds, beating the previous world record of 3:30.98 they set in Glasgow in 2014.
"Definitely my favorite race ever," said Cate Campbell. "In an Olympic final with my sister and two girls I have known since I was 12, 13 years old - and a gold and a world record."

Alex Rodriguez and the New York Yankees will hold a news conference on Sunday at Yankee Stadium, the team announced, an event that will likely address his future with the franchise.
The news conference will include Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and manager Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, 41, has played sparingly recently and there has been speculation the team could release him. The Yankees are paying him $21 million annually for this season and next, though the two sides could negotiate a buyout agreement.
Having been demoted from his full-time designated hitter role, Rodriguez is batting just .204 with nine home runs.
With 696 career homers, he is fourth on the all-time list behind Babe Ruth at 714.
Rodriguez arrived with the Yankees in 2004, and has claimed two MVPs and a World Series title during his New York tenure.
But his career has been partly defined by controversy and his attachment to steroid use. He was suspended for the entire 2014 season for his involvement in Major League Baseball’s Biogenesis scandal.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil won its first medal of the Rio Olympics on Saturday, but its hard cheering fans also suffered deep disappointment as a top gold-medal hope was eliminated from the judo competition, left in tears on the mat with a dislocated elbow.
After months of criticism over construction delays, corruption, safety and polluted water, Brazilians were out in force to support their teams. They were buoyed by an opening ceremony on Friday that spoke directly to their complex and rich history and culture and eased local anxiety that the Games costing nearly $13 billion might founder.
Enthusiasm turned quickly to shock for many home team fans though. Brazil's Sara Menezes, a judo gold medalist in London in 2012, was rushed to hospital after being eliminated in a bruising match against Mongolian Urantsetseg Munkhbat to finish seventh.
Judo is one of Brazil's most successful Olympic sports. But Menezes was in such pain after having her arm yanked in the match that she was unable to get up to acknowledge her opponent's traditional bow.
Another Brazilian judo contender Felipe Kitadai, also cheered on by name by fans, was also eliminated in the men's 60kg Judo class by Uzbekistan's Diyorbek Urozboev. Kitadai finished seventh.
Still, Brazil's Felipe Wu made a good start toward the host country's goal of breaking into the top-10 total medal count for the first time. He won silver in the men's 10m air pistol event after being edged out for the gold by Xuan Vinh Hoang of Vietnam.
On a glorious, sun-drenched Rio de Janeiro day, Brazilians  filled stadiums and streets and lined rowing and biking courses, shouting themselves hoarse alongside thousands of visitors from around the world.
"It's not like we don't know there are problems, if anybody knows that we Brazilians do," said Kele Fermino, a Rio real estate agent shortly after cheering on the bicycle road racers at the bottom of a steep descent in the Jardim Botanico neighborhood.
"The opening ceremony was wonderful, hit all the right notes and today is beautiful," she added. "We Brazilians, the people, we embrace our athletes totally despite all the problems, and we are convinced that we are going to have a good time at the games."
That spirit was evident at the men's gymnastics team qualifying event, where Brazil's team qualified for the men's finals.
During subdivision matchups with Japan, Korea and the Netherlands, chanting, singing local crowds, and a couple of emotional athletes' mothers, gave it their all in trying to spark Brazil to victory.
While Brazil has recently developed several top-flight gymnasts including Arthur Zanetti, 2012 gold medalist in rings and multiple world champion Diogo Hypolito, it has never before qualified to compete for a team medal at the Olympics.
Hypolito broke down in tears after helping Brazil come in second to historic powerhouse Japan before later rounds moved them to sixth behind China, the United States, Russia, Japan and Britain. Only the top eight teams qualify.
Similar scenes played out at the beach volleyball, fencing,  and judo, and swimming venues, though the results in competition were mixed.
Brazil's women's double of Agatha and Barbara beat the Czech Republic's Hermannova and Slukova 19-21 21-17 15-11 at a packed beach volleyball stadium on Copacabana Beach. Crowds were riotous despite long lines and delays at security gates. Hundreds without tickets cheered from the street and on the sand nearby.
Willy Pereira, 28, a computer technician, wearing a Brazil shirt as he stood in line for the matches Saturday morning explained the love cariocas, as Rio residents are known, have for the sport.
"In Brazil, first it's football and second it's volleyball. I'm carioca, I love the beach. I play volleyball ... on this beach or in Ipanema. It's a marvelous sensation to have this so close to home."
Brazil's first appearance in the quarter-finals of women's fencing ended there. Nathalie Moellhausen brought Brazil its first ever quarterfinal fencing appearance in Women's Épée only to be eliminated by France's Lauren Rembi 15-12 to finish sixth after Brazilian fans livened up a traditionally restrained sport.
Brazil put three swimmers into semi-final races. Daynara de Paula, won her heat in the women's 100m butterfly and qualified in 14th place, while Daiene Marcal also squeezed through tying for 15th. Felipe Franca qualified in third for the men's 100m breaststroke.
The Brazilians even whooped it up at the Table Tennis event, though the cheering may have contributed to the elimination of Brazil's Caroline Kumahara. She fell short of the second round after a loss to Luxembourg's Ni Xialian 4-3.
During the match, the audience stomped, chanted Caroline's name and also booed Ni once when she was serving, a situation largely unheard of at ping-pong tournaments, Kumahara said.
"It was a little bit bad," Kumahara said, referring to the times when she said she could her fellow Brazilians screaming.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's male and female beach volleyball pairs made winning starts in their hunt for gold on Saturday, drawing on the loud home support to beat their Canadian and Czech Republic opponents on Copacabana's golden sand.
Brazil's female gold medal hopes Agatha Bednarczuk and Barbara Seixas recovered from one set down to win 19-21 21-17 15-11 against talented Czech pair who came close to upsetting the home script on the opening day.
Barbora Hermannova and Marketa Slukova appeared to have the momentum midway through the second set but at 10-10 the Brazilians took the lead to drag themselves back into the match.
A thrilling block from Bednarczuk at won them the second set sending the crowd into rapturous applause. In the deciding third set the Brazilians regained control.
"We knew it wouldn't be easy," Bednarczuk told Reuters, explaining that the excitement of playing in front of a home crowd on Rio's famous beach had maybe caused them to lose a little focus.
After the first set "we were able to calm down a bit and put more tactics into play," she said.
Earlier on Saturday, Alison Cerutti and Bruno Schmidt beat Canada's Josh Binstock and Samuel Schachter 21-19 22-20 to seal their credentials as gold medal favorites in the men's tournament.
"It was incredible," Cerutti told Reuters, still beaming after the performance.
With beach volleyball one of Brazil's favorite sports, particularly in Rio where nets dot the coastline, the local athletes were fired up by an enthusiastic crowd waving green-and-yellow flags, many wearing swimsuits.
"To start an Olympics at home, to see this crowd shouting Brazil, it's a dream come true," added Cerutti.
Brazil's men's pair were not given an easy ride and fell behind in the second set, but scrambled back to make it 20-20.
The next point proved to be vital with the Canadians left to rue a crucial challenge that did not go their way after Binstock fouled at the net. The visiting pair said the hostile crowd, which booed at times, had made things difficult.
One point later the match was over and the crowd erupted as the Brazilian winners signed the ball and launched it into the crowd.
The Brazilian men will now prepare to play Austria while the women face Argentina on Monday.
"The focus is to play and win... Gold comes as a result of that," said Cerutti.

RIO DE JANEIRO There was plenty of chest thumping and free flowing tears on Saturday as Olympic champion Arthur Zanetti and his band of Brazilian brothers produced the performance of their lives to reach the men's team gymnastics final on their Games debut.
A nation that had never fielded a full team at the Olympics before Saturday showed what the fans had been missing as they fueled a carnival atmosphere in the arena with their pumped up celebrations each time they nailed a routine.
As Brazil's first and only Olympic gymnastics champion, rings specialist Zanetti spent the last four years being a poster boy for the Rio Games and he was the man everyone wanted to see on Saturday.
In his only performance of the day, he maintained straight bodylines as he lifted himself into a succession of strength moves -- such as the inverted cross, the Maltese maneuver and the handstand -- in a routine packed with high difficulty.
It was just a shame that his performance was in front of rows and rows of empty red seats as barely three thousand fans had been able to gain entry into the 13,200-capacity arena by the time he mounted the rings with the chants of "Zanettti, Zanetti, Zanetti" ringing in his ears.
Many fans were left fuming because by the time they had been allowed in, Zanetti was done for the day.
"I don’t believe it. It's absurd, ridiculous. What I most wanted to see was Zanetti on the rings," Natalia Carvalho told Reuters after discovering she was too late to see him despite sprinting into the venue once she had cleared security.
"It’s a lack of respect for the fans who bought tickets. It’s a shame.”
Liliane Oliveira, from Minas Gerais State, added: “It lacked organization, there were only two entrances to all arenas of the Olympic Park and the security check was taking too long. They should have prepared better for this.”
While Zanetti qualified for the rings final after earning Brazil's highest score of the day with 15.533, Diego Hypolito  showed there was still plenty of explosive tumbles left in his 30-year-old body as the 2005 and 2007 floor world champion produced a performance that earned him 15.500.
The man who failed to live up to expectation at the Beijing and London Games was left an emotional wreck as soon as he nailed his final tumble and burst into tears.
He will get a chance to battle it out for a medal on the floor exercise after making the eight-man cut for the final.
"I started crying because I had worked for 12 years for this moment," said Hypolito, who earned the loudest cheers of the day after making amends for falling flat on his face in London.
"After two Olympic failures, it is very difficult to show your face again at the Olympic Games. Today, my soul was cleansed."

RIO DE JANEIRO Dethroning champions China is the number one target for Japan at the Rio Olympics but after a day of falls and botched landings in men's qualifying on Saturday, Kohei Uchimura and his team mates were left with sore bodies and bruised egos.
Uchimura suffered the most spectacular of falls from the horizontal bar -- an apparatus on which he is the world champion -- as he lost his grip following a release-and-catch maneuver and landed on his back with a thud.
The glaring errors on every apparatus barring the floor exercise by the reigning Japanese world champions meant their total of 269.294 was surpassed by China (270.461), the United States (270.405) and Russia (269.612).
London Games bronze medalists Britain, jubilant hosts Brazil -- who were fielding a full team in the men's Olympic competition for the first time -- Ukraine and Germany also qualified for Monday's team final.
Japan's woes were put in context when Frenchman Samir Ait Said and German gymnast Andreas Toba provided a painful reminder of just how dangerous gymnastics can be.
Ait Said suffered a broken leg that was left dangling from below his knee following a crash landing from the vault and had to be taken out of the arena on a stretcher.
Toba may have suffered an injury to his anterior cruciate ligament following a fall from a tumbling run on the floor exercise. Incredibly he went on to perform on the pommel horse but as he limped off that apparatus, with his arms around his team mates, it was clear his Rio adventure was over.
"I cried like a little kid," Toba told reporters. "The injury on my knee is big, but the emotional injury is way bigger. A first diagnosis said it is the ACL."
While Japan lived to fight another day, Uchimura lost his chance to be in the running for the horizontal bar gold as his score of 14.300 left him well outside the top eight scores needed to reach the apparatus final.
That mishap did not stop him from reaching the all around final, where he will be bidding to become the first gymnast since compatriot Sawao Kato in 1972 to win successive Olympic titles in the event that tests skills across six apparatus.
Japan can now forget about Saturday's horror show since none of the scores will be carried through to Monday's team final but they cannot afford a repeat performance if they want to end China's eight-year reign as Olympic champions.
"What happened today can only make me stronger," Uchimura, who finished second in the all around standings behind Ukrainian Oleg Verniaiev and also made the cut for the floor final, told reporters.
"I need to repress my feelings so I can perform better at the next competition."
While in qualifying four competitors from each country compete on each apparatus with only the top three scores counting toward the total, in the final each nation will put forward three athletes and all three scores will count.
Since 1994, Chinese men have won 10 of 12 world championship team titles and three of the last four Olympic golds on offer.
The team that were toppled from their perch by Japan at last year's world championships will be eager to prove on Monday that they have recovered from their bronze medal finish in Glasgow.

RIO DE JANEIRO Italian cyclist Vincenzo Nibali broke both collarbones after crashing on a high-speed descent near the end of the Olympic men's road race on Saturday, a team official said.
Nibali attacked late in the race, leading a three-man breakaway on a climb. He tried to ride away from Colombia's Sergio Henao and Poland's Rafal Majka before he and Henao lost control on a descent so fast that the motorcycle carrying a television cameraman struggled to keep up.
Nibali was attended by medical staff after failing to finish the race, a fate that befell more than half the 144 riders on a crash-heavy day in which many suffered technical problems during an early cobblestoned section of the 237.5 km course.
The 31-year-old Nibali has won all three of professional cycling's grand tours - in France, Spain and his native Italy - but has failed to win a medal in three Olympic Games.
He was treated by a local hospital and released, said Fabrizio Marchetti, a spokesman for the Italian Olympic team, in an email. Nibali had not been scheduled to compete in Wednesday's cycling time trial. He plans to return to Italy, Marchetti said.
Gold medalist Greg Van Avermaet of Belgium said many riders had taken chances.
"Everybody was taking risks and some went over the limit," Van Avermaet told reporters. "A lot of guys wanted to go for it."
Ireland's Dan Martin said the race was one of the toughest he had taken part in.
"It was the most difficult day on the bike I've had in my career," he said after finishing 13th. "It was just a brutal, brutal day."
U.S. rider Brent Bookwalter went even further.
"It was anarchy out there," he said. "Everything happened. People crashing, flatting, getting gapped out in the wind. It was a very hard day."

RIO DE JANEIRO Beslan Mudranov won Russia's first gold medal at the Rio Games in judo on Saturday and fired a warning shot that his country had plenty more to prove.
Mudranov's victory comes two days after Russia's judo team was officially cleared to participate in the Olympics after his country escaped a blanket ban over its doping record.
"There has been a lot of psychological pressure that our country Russia has been subject to. Here, to win a gold medal on the very first day, of course it means a lot for my country," Mudranov told reporters through an interpreter.
"Of course, our country will prove to everyone that we can win the gold, I'm pretty confident that this is not the last gold medal we have won," he said.
Mudranov's gold in the men's -60kg follows his compatriot Arsen Galstyan's triumph in the same weight class in London four years ago.
In a tense duel with Kazahkstan's Yeldos Smetov that went into "golden score" extra time, Mudranov threw Smetov to score a match-ending waza-ari and earn his first Olympic medal. Japan's Naohisa Takato and Diyorbek Urozboev of Uzbekistan took bronze.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had called for a total ban on Russian athletes in Rio in response to the independent McLaren report that found evidence of state-sponsored doping by Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Mudranov said such a ban would not have been right.
"The president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), he should realize that it would be unjust for the athletes who have spent their entire life preparing for the competition - for some of them it would probably be the only Olympic Games in their life," he said.
Mudranov added that there had been some nerves amongst the judo team on the day of the IOC announcement but overall they had been confident they would be allowed to compete.
"We came here prepared and no one broke down under this psychological pressure," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO A breath of wind, a shaky floorboard or an untimely attack of nerves can all affect the fickle flights of arrows but nothing could stop Ku Bon-chan as he unleashed a perfect volley to drive South Korea to the men's team gold at the Rio Olympics.
In a mouth-watering final against a powerful United States team, with rowdy fans shrieking from the terraces at the Sambodromo, the 23-year-old entered a bubble of calm and shot all six of his arrows plum in the center of the target.
The six perfect 10's, called each time by a booming loudspeaker and greeted with roars from the crowd, were a death knell to the Americans' hopes of gold and redemption for their defeat in the London final four years ago to Italy.
Ku, however, was oblivious to it all.
"I actually did not know I had the perfect score six consecutive times," the archer, a member of a university team in North Gyeongsang province, told reporters through a translator.
"So they told me later after the game was done, but I was very happy."
Ku was the best performer in a team of world championship winners. But only just.
Kim Woo-jin, who dazzled his rivals with a 72-hole world record during the ranking rounds on Friday, took maximum points with five of his six arrows.
Lee Seung-yun hardly let the team down by nailing 10's on four shots.
Taking to the raised shooting platform at the Sambodromo, the three led off the final with six 10's in succession, a decisive statement of intent that the United States were unable to match.
The American trio of Brady Ellison, Jake Kaminski and Zach Garrett shot well in defeat but still finished on the wrong end of a stinging 6-0 scoreline.
"Incredible what they did," said Team USA's head coach Lee Ki-sik, the mentor of four Korean Olympic teams from 1984-1996.
"I never thought the Koreans could shoot that great. Korea never had so strong a men’s team.”
It was sweet validation for South Korea, who were dumped out of the semi-finals in London by a U.S. team that featured Ellison and Kaminski.
The bronze they won was considered something of a failure.
None of that team made it back to Rio, buried by the relentless treadmill of elite archers from a country that has won 20 Olympic titles since archery returned in its modern form in 1972.
The team kissed their medals and savored the moment, knowing full well that it may be their last trip to an Olympics.
The treadmill will crank up again ahead of the Tokyo Games in 2020.

RIO DE JANEIRO It was a hair-raising day for Louis Smith at the Rio Olympics on Saturday.
But rather than his fluid movements over the pommel horse providing the excitement during men's qualifying, it was the hair tied up on top of his head.
"People are calling it a man bun. I don't call it anything, I just tie it up," grinned the British showman whose toned back is covered with tattoos of two angels and a message for his late grandmother.
"I was growing it and I hadn't put any hair spray in it for training so it was flopping around everywhere. I went to one of the girls in training and asked for a hairband and I just tied it up.
"I caught myself in a mirror and thought, 'It looks all right,' so I've just been doing this every day as it's so convenient."
The man who waltzed to victory in Britain's version of Dancing with the Stars after claiming a silver medal at the 2012 London Games on his signature apparatus was happy with his new look as it saves time with his daily beauty regime.
"You get out of the shower, tie it up and it's done. Before I had to condition it, had to straighten it, had to hair spray it back," he added.
"I haven't seen anybody else with this hairstyle before and it's nice to be different."
For the record, he was heading for another pommel horse showdown with world champion Max Whitlock after the British duo topped the provisional standings in the apparatus.

RIO DE JANEIRO Professionals posted mixed results on Saturday, the first day that non-amateur boxers have been allowed to compete at the Olympics.
Cameroon's Hassan N'Dam N'jikam, a former WBO interim middleweight champion who is now fighting as a light heavyweight, lost to Brazilian amateur Michel Borges in a unanimous decision that delighted a raucous home crowd.
Earlier on Saturday, Italy's Carmine Tommasone made boxing history when he became the first fully professional fighter to compete, winning his opening bout against a Mexican amateur.
The two professionals and a Thai fighter who has yet to make his Olympic debut are competing after AIBA, the sport's governing body, made a constitutional change in June that ended 112 years of amateur exclusivity at the Games.
For 32-year-old N'jikam, the change to Olympic rules meant a struggle to adapt. Compared with professional boxing, which can feature 10 rounds or more, Olympic bouts are compressed to only three.
As a professional, "I take time in the first round to know what he's going to do," he said, admitting that the cautious approach led to his losing crucial early momentum.
Still, he does not regret competing.
"I am not happy but I (had) fun," he said.
Tommasone, meanwhile, reveled in reaching the Games and winning his first fight.
"The Olympics is the top dream of any athlete," he said, his face still red from a gritty bout in which he struggled to penetrate the guard of a taller opponent, Lindolfo Delgado.
In another shift, this Olympics marks the first time since 1980 that fighters are competing without headgear.
The boxing began in mid-morning on the first full day of competition at the Games after a colorful opening ceremony at Rio's Maracana stadium the previous night.
The 9000-seat boxing venue, during morning and afternoon fighting, began with few spectators, but was approaching a full house by the time light heavyweights entered the ring at the end of each session.
Enthusiastic fans, especially yellow-clad Brazilians who made the arena shake as they stomped on metal stands, cheered the bouts featuring fighters from countries including Britain, Spain, China, Uzbekistan and Poland.
The winners of the opening bouts will move forward into the round of 16.

American Daniel Berger moved within sight of his second victory in two months when he opened a three-shot lead after the third round of the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut on Saturday.
Berger, last season's rookie of the year on the PGA Tour, picked up nine birdies to surge clear with an eight-under-par 62 at the TPC River Highlands.
The 23-year-old posted a 15-under 195 total, three ahead of Scotland's Russell Knox (64), South African Tyrone Van Aswegen (65) and American Russell Henley (65).
Low scores were plentiful on a day when Ernie Els made his first ace on the PGA Tour since 2004, using a seven-iron from 171 yards at the 16th.
"I made a bunch of putts and that's what it takes to shoot a low number out here," world number 40 Berger told PGATour.com.
"It didn't really feel like I was that many under par until I looked at my scorecard walking down the 18th hole but sometimes it happens like that.
"I'm striking it really well, driving it well and that's going to be a big key tomorrow."
Berger, who won the St Jude Classic in June, was not the only player to go low.

SIMPLE ATTITUDE
Knox adopted a simple attitude and it paid off with birdies at the first three holes.
"Aim at the pin, you might hit it there," said the Scottish winner of the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai in November.
"I played beautifully. I had loads of chances, obviously made some, which was great, missed a couple."
Van Aswegen hit back well after dropping a stroke at the first.
"I started off real nervous," he said. "I wasn't feeling too good after that bogey but settled down, found a good rhythm and made some birdies coming in. Hopefully tomorrow I can find a rhythm a little earlier."
Fellow South African Els ended the day tied for 60th but the hole-in-one was a nice consolation for the four-times major winner.
"You hit a lot of good shots but rarely do they go in," he said. "It was a real thrill.
"All of us, from the 24-handicapper to the pro, it's a great feeling, a feeling of elation.
"I think everybody feels the same way. When the ball goes in we're all kind of surprised."

RIO DE JANEIRO On debut day for Olympic boxing, fighters said they were happy to be competing at the first Games since 1980 without protective headgear, welcoming better peripheral vision even if it means more cuts and scrapes.
After decades of debate, and some studies suggesting headgear did not make the sport safer, boxing governing body AIBA eliminated the equipment at events since 2013, including two world championships and one Commonwealth Games.
With a global audience at the Olympics, boxers said they were especially pleased to go without - even if no headgear means more scratches and, sometimes, cuts.
"You feel unimpeded," said Juan Nogueira, a Brazilian heavyweight from São Paulo, the biggest city of the host country, whose fans erupted in cheers as he defeated Australian Jason Eric Whateley on Saturday.
"He is a really good opponent, a technical fighter, and I was happy to be able to see more," he added, echoing comments by other fighters that headgear limits a boxer's ability to see to the side.
The prospect of cuts, and consequent stopping of matches because of safety concerns about blood, continues to be a sore subject. At the Commonwealth Games in 2014, Australian Daniel Lewis complained that he lost a medal because he was deemed unfit to compete because of a cut.
Still, on Saturday most boxers said they were willing to take the risk. "Yeah, you can feel the sting a little more, but it's worth it," said Misael Uziel Rodriguez, a Mexican middleweight who squares off against Iraq's Abdulridha Waheed on Tuesday.

RIO DE JANEIRO Britain's Adam Peaty smashed his own 100 meters breaststroke world record and Hungary's 'Iron Lady' Katinka Hosszu had another in her sights on an explosive opening day in the pool at the Rio Olympics.
American golden girl Katie Ledecky meanwhile set herself up for the first medal of a likely hefty haul after swimming the final leg of the 4x100 freestyle relay.
On a normal day Ledecky might have been the center of attention, but Peaty seized the limelight like a man on a mission.
The 21-year-old released plenty of pent-up energy to ensure a sensational start on his Olympic debut, completing the first 50 meters 0.35 seconds inside world record pace.
The crowd raised the roof as he touched out in 57.55.
The world champion had set the previous record of 57.92 in London in April 2015 and is favorite to become Britain's first male swimming gold medalist since Adrian Moorhouse in the same event in 1988.
Peaty, who was not even born then, has another swim in the evening semi-finals before Sunday's final.
"Hopefully tonight I'm going to feel a little bit better and swim a little bit faster... We're going to keep pushing the boundary," he told reporters.
Swimming earlier, Hosszu might have beaten Peaty to the honor of setting the first record in Rio but eased off in the women's 400 meter individual medley just as it was in her sights.
The 27-year-old, who was well inside the four minutes 28.43 seconds set by China's Ye Shiwen at the 2012 Games until the last 50 meters, still set the second fastest time ever with a European record 4:28.58.
Ye failed to qualify, ending up 27th.
Hosszu -- world champion in 400 IM, a two times female swimmer of the year and winner of five world championship golds -- is still seeking her first Olympic medal in her fourth Games but looks a solid bet this time.
In the men's 400m IM heats, Japan's world champion Daiya Seto and compatriot Kosuke Hagino had to settle for second and third with American Chase Kalisz setting the pace in what promises to be a close battle for gold.
South Korea's Park Tae-hwan, the 2008 champion who won a late battle to swim at the Games after appealing against a doping ban, failed to qualify for the men's 400 meters freestyle finals.
The 2012 silver medalist was 10th overall with only eight going through. China's world and Olympic champion Sun Yang was fourth fastest overall in a line-up led by Conor Dwyer of the United States.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilian Felipe Wu won the silver medal in the men's 10-metre air pistol event on Saturday to claim the host country's first medal of the Rio Olympic Games.
Xuan Vinh Hoang of Vietnam took the gold with a score of 202.5 in 20 shots, just 0.4 of a point ahead of Wu, a 24-year-old who is competing in his first Olympics. China's Pang Wei took the bronze.
Defending Olympic champion Jin Jong-oh of South Korea failed to recover from a poor start and finished fifth.

RIO DE JANEIRO The Rio Olympic Games got off to a shambolic start on Saturday as fans queued for hours at security checkpoints to enter venues, with some missing their events and many athletes competing in front of eerily empty stands.
Games organizers apologized for dropping the ball on the first day of full competition, the morning after a dazzling opening ceremony, as iconic venues such as beach volleyball on the famed Copacabana beach saw only a few hundred spectators.
Outside, lines stretched for several blocks as angry fans stood in full sun, waiting as security staff struggled.
"We apologize for everybody standing in line outside the venues," Games spokesman Mario Andrada told reporters.
"We need to upgrade that part of the Games. We moved people from Rio 2016 (organization) to speed up the mag and bag (security checks) and within the next hours we will be in much better shape."
He said he hoped no fan had missed competitions they had bought tickets for, but many Brazilians were left fuming.
"I don't believe it. It's absurd, ridiculous," said Rio resident Natalia Carvalho, 28, who had wanted to see Brazilian gymnast and medal hopeful Arthur Zanetti compete.
Instead she entered the stadium only after he had finished his rings presentation with thousands more waiting to enter the Olympic park, site of several venues.
"I always said that what I most wanted to see was Zanetti in the rings. It's a lack of respect for the fan that bought tickets. It's a shame," she said.

COORDINATION PROBLEMS
Games organizers blamed the snafu on a lack of coordination between various groups of security personnel, including the police, Games staff and private security firms.
Organizers have applied tight security around the venues, amid concerns that the Games could be a target for militants. On Saturday, a bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion of an unattended bag near the finish line of the men's cycling road race. There have been several controlled blasts in recent days.
There were also some problems with transportation as buses spent hours trying to get people to the opening ceremony on Friday and some venues running out of water on Saturday.
At the tennis center, where former world number one Ana Ivanovic played in front of virtually empty stands in the first round, fans had to wait more than 20 minutes to buy water.
Spectators encountered similar situations at the rowing and the rugby venues as temperatures hit 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit).
What should have been a celebration of the start of South America's first Olympics instead turned into a damage-control operation, with Andrada vowing an immediate improvement.
"It is the first morning of the Olympic crowd and some of the systems did not talk to each other. It was a problem of coordination. We need to explain to the public. We owe them an explanation and we owe them an excuse."
Only a few hundred spectators made it into the gymnastics arena, which can seat 13,500 people. The boxing venue also had many empty seats on Saturday morning as the first professionals in Olympics history entered the ring.
"We hope to clear the lines in the Olympic park," Andrada said, admitting some people had waited as long as 90 minutes.
"We feel sorry for the people who are there. Some time in line is acceptable but there needs to be a balance."

RIO DE JANEIRO Adam Peaty demolished his own world record in the heats of the  100 meters breaststroke on Saturday as he launched a bid to become the first British man to win an Olympic swimming gold medal for 28 years.
Peaty set a new mark of 57.55 seconds - cutting 0.37 from  his previous record, set in London last year - and said he hoped to shave off some more in Saturday's semi-finals.
"Going down that first 50, I knew it was fast, and I knew I turned fast. It wasn't until 25 meters to go, the crowd started to roar and it was like, there are no Brazilians in this race and they've got to be shouting for something," the 21-year-old told reporters.
"Hopefully tonight I'm going to feel a little bit better and swim a little bit faster... We're going to keep pushing the boundary."
World champion Peaty, swimming at his first Olympics, is seeking to become the first British male swimmer to win Olympic gold since Adrian Moorhouse in the same event in 1988, six years before Peaty was born.
Japan's Yasuhiro Koseki set the second-fastest time in the heats, 1.36 seconds behind Peaty. Brazilian Felipe Franca raised a big roar from the home crowd by qualifying third, a further tenth of a second behind.
Defending Olympic champion Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa was seventh, 1.8 seconds adrift of Peaty, and will have his work cut out in the semis and in Sunday's final.
However, he rejected any suggestion he might be demoralized by his rival's record-breaking form.
"For me there's no use expending any extra energy that I don't need to, so it's worked pretty well and that's my gameplan and I'll still be sticking to it," he told reporters.
"You know, we see guys smashing times in semi-finals and crumbling in finals... Obviously an Olympic final's a different animal, it's something really spectacular."

RIO DE JANEIRO Unflappable American teenager Virginia Thrasher won the first gold medal of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games on Saturday, holding her nerve against two Chinese Olympic champions to clinch the women's 10m air rifle event.
The 19-year-old U.S. college champion edged out China's Du Li, gold in Athens in 2004, with an Olympic-record score of 208 in the sport's new finals format. Defending Olympic champion Yi Siling, also of China, took the bronze medal.
Competing in her first Olympics, Thrasher, as the first champion of the 2016 Games, was awarded her medal by International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach and said the achievement was beyond her wildest dreams.
The youngest of the eight finalists by several years, Thrasher established an early lead after battling with the Russian shooter Daria Vdovina, who stumbled midway through the competition and finished fifth.
"About halfway through when I took the lead it kind of became clear to me that I was in contention for a medal, but I quickly pushed that thought away and focused on breathing and taking one shot at a time," Thrasher said.
Thrasher learned to love shooting while hunting deer with her grandfather when she was in eighth grade.
"I got my first deer and I liked the adrenaline of pulling the trigger," she said.
She then joined her high school air rifle team and was recruited by West Virginia University, where she became a national collegiate champion as a freshman this year.
With her non-nonsense style, Thrasher seemed unfazed by her seasoned field and consistently scored in the 10 points target area over the 20 rounds.
Afterwards, she noted that she had not attended the Olympics' opening ceremony Friday night and had instead gone to bed early for her Olympic debut.
Like all American shooters, Thrasher faced the inevitable question of what she thinks about gun control in the United States, a hot-button issue in this election year.
She responded matter of factly that the controversy over  guns in America "really is just distracting from our sport, which is very different."

RIO DE JANEIRO French gymnast Samir Ait Said discovered the perils of pursuing his Olympic dreams when he suffered a broken leg that was left dangling from below his knee following a crash landing from the vault during men's qualifying on Saturday.
Ait Said covered his eyes with his right hand as he clutched the back of his knee while lying prostrate on the crash mat before officials ran to tend to him.
But it soon became apparent that he would take no further part in the Rio Games when he was lifted onto a stretcher that had been brought into the arena.
After a delay of several minutes, he was eventually wheeled out and raised one arm to acknowledge the loud ovation he received from the crowd.

RIO DE JANEIRO A loud blast shook the media seats near the finishing line of the men's cycling road race on the first day of the Rio Olympics when Brazil's bomb squad detonated an unattended backpack on Saturday, amid tight security at South America's first Games.
A Reuters witness reported seeing bomb squad agents in protective clothing operating near the area where media were seated on the boulevard of Copacabana beach. That followed the detonation of another unattended bag near the same spot on Friday evening during the opening ceremony for the Games.
A spokeswoman for the public security department said that officials believe the bag may have belonged to a homeless man, but protocol requires any unattended objects to be destroyed.
The controlled blast occurred at 1:45 p.m. (12:45 p.m. EDT), the spokeswoman said.
Lorie Schmetterling, who traveled from Moorestown, New Jersey with her husband Eric to cheer on their daughter Laura, who is rowing for the U.S. Olympic team, had not heard the blast but was disturbed to learn it had occurred just a few hundred meters from where she was staying.
"You hear all these terrible things about how it is going to be and then you get here and it seems fine," she said. "Then this happens and you feel it, you go on high alert again."
Schmetterling said the incident would not alter her plans in Rio.
A security source said that officials were particularly concerned about this bag because it was close to the Russian hospitality site for the Games.
In recent days, bomb squad members have detonated several unattended bags in controlled explosions around Rio amid high security.
Brazil detained 12 people for suspected links to Islamic State last month but it has insisted that the risk of an attack at the Games is minimal.
Brazil has deployed some 85,000 police and military to guard the Games, roughly twice the number at the 2012 London Olympics.

RIO DE JANEIRO South Korea's Park Tae-hwan, the 2008 Olympic champion who won a late battle to swim at the Rio Games after appealing against a doping ban, failed to qualify for the men's 400 meters freestyle finals on Saturday.
The 2012 silver medalist finished fourth in his heat, won by China's world and Olympic champion Sun Yang, but his time of three minutes 45.63 seconds left him 10th overall with only the top eight going through.
Sun, China's big hope, was fourth fastest overall in a line-up led by Conor Dwyer of the United States with a time of 3:43.42.
Dwyer was followed by Australia's Mack Horton in 3:43.84 and Italian Gabriele Detti.
Park, the first Korean to claim an Olympic swimming medal when he won the 400 freestyle in Beijing in 2008, completed an 18-month ban imposed by world governing body FINA in March after testing positive for testosterone ahead of the 2014 Asian Games.
Under a controversial Korean Olympic Committee regulation, he was then hit with an additional three-year ban from the national team the day the FINA suspension expired.
That would have ruled him out of contention for Rio but the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared the 26-year-old to compete.
Park is also due to swim in the 100m, 200m and 1,500m freestyle races in what will be his fourth and final Olympics.
The 400m final is later on Saturday.

American Daniel Berger drove the green at the short par-four 15th hole for a two-putt birdie that put him into a four-way tie for the lead on Friday halfway through the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut.
Joining Berger, who won his first PGA tour title at June's FedEx St. Jude Classic, on seven-under 133 at TPC River Highlands were fellow American Russell Henley, South African Tyrone van Aswegan and Australian Marc Leishman.
One shot behind were Scotsman Russell Knox (67) and Americans Jerry Kelly (70), Robert Garrigus (67) and Patrick Rogers (66).
With lively winds to contend with, Berger punched a low drive that ran up the green into comfortable two-putt range at the 15th on the way to posting a three-under 67.
"Just tried to hit what I call my bullet shot," Berger told Golf Channel. "It's kind of my go-to shot. It's one of those shots that I hit under pressure and I know where it goes."
Leishman (68) and Henley (65) birdied their last holes, the ninth after starting their rounds at No. 10, while van Aswegan continued his flawless golf with a four-under 66 for his second successive bogey-free round.
"I feel like my swing coach this week has helped me a lot finding the slot, and I'm holing a lot of putts," said early starter van Aswegan, chasing his maiden tour win.
Leishman said there was quite a contrast from Thursday.
"Definitely a lot different than yesterday morning," said the big Australian, who lost in a playoff at last year's British Open. "The wind got up a little today so you had to be playing good golf to shoot a really good number.
"The driver was great, irons were for the most part good, and I felt like I putted well. But late in the day with the greens drying, they got a little bit bumpy. I'm looking forward to getting out early tomorrow."
With possible thunderstorms in the forecast, golfers are scheduled to start at 7 a.m. ET (1100 GMT) for Saturday's third round in threesomes going off two tees.
Twice Masters champion Bubba Watson, who won the Travelers Championship for a second time last year, stood at three-under 137 after a level-par 70.
Fellow American playing partners Matt Kuchar (67 for 136) and Patrick Reed (67 for 137) and Watson made for a high spirited threesome as they were all looking forward to playing in the upcoming Olympic golf tournament at the Rio Games.
Seventy-four players made the cut, which was set at one-under 139.

BUENOS AIRES New Argentina coach Edgardo Bauza believes a softy, softly approach is the way to try to bring talisman Lionel Messi back into the national team.
Bauza, officially unveiled as Gerardo Martino’s successor at Argentine FA headquarters on Friday, said he would seek to speak with retired captain Messi in Barcelona next week.
“My sole intention is to see if I can talk about football with Messi... and from that chat will come the possibility of him being called up to play Argentina’s next games,” Bauza told a news conference.
Less than a month after Bauza took charge, Argentina face 2018 World Cup qualifiers at home to Uruguay and away to Venezuela in the first week of September.
“I want to tell him my idea and for him to tell me how things are with him and then we’ll see what comes out of it,” Bauza said.
Messi quit the team after his fourth major final defeat with Argentina, and third as their captain, at the Copa America in the United States in June.
There is a widespread belief that the 29-year-old will revise a decision he took in the heat of the moment and look to try and take part in a fourth World Cup in Russia in 2018.
Bauza, a lanky former central defender who has won the Copa Libertadores twice as a coach, said he understood Messi’s reaction to a second successive Copa America final defeat on penalties against Chile.
“I have felt frustrated for losing a match or a final and understand that statement (of quitting) when you are overwhelmed with frustration, but I know it can be reversed.” said Bauza, who is known as 'Paton' (big foot).
Argentina are third in the 10-nation South American group with 11 points from six matches, two points behind leading pair Uruguay and Ecuador.
The top four after 18 matches qualify for the finals in Russia, while the fifth-placed team goes into an intercontinental playoff for one more berth.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russian breaststroker Yulia Efimova said on Friday she would take part in the Rio Olympics, a day after winning an appeal against a doping ban, but there was no immediate confirmation from swimming's governing body FINA.
Efimova posted a picture of herself on Instagram, looking surprised and tearful, with the caption: "I'm going to the Olympics. I couldn't be more proud and relieved."
The four-times world champion was handed a lifeline on Thursday when the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld her appeal against her ban from the Games, whose preparations have been overshadowed by revelations of widespread state-sponsored doping in Russia.
Last-minute appeals by banned Russians have turned the build-up into a legal obstacle course, creating uncertainty for the athletes and for their rivals.
Efimova's name is currently missing from the starting list for the 100 meters breaststroke, whose heats take place on Sunday, and Wednesday's 200m, the event in which she won an Olympic bronze medal in London in 2012.
Russian news agency R-Sport quoted Vladimir Salnikov, head of the country's swimming federation, as saying FINA had written to CAS to confirm it supported the readmission of Efimova and four other banned Russian swimmers - Natalia Lovtsova, Darya Ustinova, Mikhail Dovgalyuk and Anastasia Krapivina.
A FINA spokesman declined to comment, saying the federation would issue a statement "if we have something to say".
Efimova, 24, was banned by FINA between October 2013 and February 2015 after testing positive for traces of the anabolic steroid DHEA.
That triggered an automatic suspension from Rio according to criteria laid down by the International Olympic Committee last month in response to an independent report confirming state-backed Russian doping across a wide range of sports.
But the Court of Arbitration for Sport said the Olympic ban was "unenforceable" because an athlete could not be punished twice for the same doping offense.
A spokesman for the Russian Olympic Committee said Efimova was already in Rio.
The Russian was also briefly suspended after testing positive for meldonium this year, but cleared in July.
Meldonium was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances from Jan. 1, but some positive tests were later overturned after the agency said there was a lack of clear scientific evidence about how long it takes for the drug to be excreted from the body.

New York Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira is retiring at the end the season, he said on Friday.
Teixeira, a power-hitting switch hitter and outstanding fielder who has been plagued by injuries in recent seasons, is completing an eight-year contract with the Yankees in his 14th season after coming up with the Texas Rangers.
"Every kid playing whiffle ball in the backyard or playing Little League, you dream of being a Major League Baseball player," Teixeira, 36, told a news conference before Friday's game against the visiting Cleveland Indians.
"After 14 years it's time for me to do something else."
Teixeira won a 2009 World Series ring with the Yankees in his first season with the club.
"I got to live out my dream and had more success than I could ever imagined, but it felt like it was the right time to step away from the game," said an emotional Teixeira.
"This year my neck started bothering me, I hurt my knee and I just kind of realized my body can't do it anymore."
Before his recent spate of injuries, Teixeira was among the game's best offensive and defensive players in his position. He was named to three All-Star teams, won three Silver Slugger Awards and five Gold Glove Awards.
Teixeira, who also played for the Braves and Angels, has belted 404 career home runs and driven in 1,281 runs.


RIO DE JANEIRO BMX cyclists might have the fastest first two seconds of any event in the Olympic Games - coming out of a gate on an eight-meter high wall and going from zero to 56 km per hour in just two beats.
For American racer and two-time Olympian Connor Fields, those two seconds account for 75 percent of his training and often determine if he can win the race which usually lasts less than 40 seconds.
"We work our butts off and I think we have one of the most difficult sports in the Games because we require so many different skills," said Fields while training in California before he heads to Rio de Janeiro for his event on Aug. 17-19.
"You have to have reaction time, explosive strength and speed to get off the blocks and out of the starting gate. But you also need body awareness and ability like a gymnast," he added.
Past the initial steep hill, it's then on to 30 to 40 jumps, simultaneously with eight other riders. The opportunities for things to go awry are ubiquitous and Fields knows all too well how the dream of gold can slip away in a matter of seconds.
At the London Olympics in 2012, Fields was the No. 1 seed in the final at just 19 years of age, the youngest racer in the field. He crashed, finished seventh and as he describes it "at 19 it is hard not to seem like the end of the world."

RAISING PROFILE OF BMX
Now 23, Fields has more balance in his life and keeps things in perspective.
"If I can leave the track in Rio and say I did my absolute best and whether I get first, second, third, seventh, don't make the final, then there is nothing else that I can do," he said.
That kind of attitude helped him deal with a major injury in April, a broken hand that left him with big stitches on his wrist, a crucial area for a cyclist holding on to handlebars.
He said he was fortunate to have access to a top hand surgeon and the Olympic rehab team. And he lucked out when U.S. BMX coaches made him a discretionary selection for the U.S. team despite his injury.
He squeezed his recovery time down to two to three months and started riding again before the bone was completely healed.
"At this point, it is not 100 percent, but it doesn't impinge my ability to ride or do anything on the track," said Fields.
Fields is currently ranked 14th in the world and third on the U.S. team. But he also stands out as one of a handful of U.S. athletes chosen for the Ralph Lauren fashion house team in Rio.
The square jawed, 1.83-metre-tall blond from Las Vegas says he hopes his fashion status helps the sport he loves.
"I know I may be biased, but I think BMX is so cool and  one of the best sports in the world," Fields said. "If being a Ralph Lauren athlete can help get more BMX on TV then I am happy."


RIO DE JANEIRO Russian whistleblower Yulia Stepanova will not appeal against her ban from the Rio Olympics, saying on Friday she was "hugely sad and heartbroken" that the IOC had not supported her and used its discretion to allow her to run as an independent athlete.
Stepanova, who helped expose state-backed doping in Russian sport and has fled the country, had been ruled out when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned from Rio any Russian who had served a doping suspension. She served a two-year ban for blood passport abnormalities in 2013.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) outlawed that ruling on Thursday, potentially reopening a way in for her to compete. Several other Russians have appealed, but Stepanova, in a stinging attack on the IOC, said on Friday she would not.
"We are disappointed that the IOC turned a blind eye to the risks Yuliya had to take, and the damage to her athletic career, to expose the systematic cheating in Russia and live up to the ideals expressed in the World Anti-Doping Code," Stepanova and her husband Vitaly, a former Russian anti-doping official, said in a statement.
"For her to be called 'not ethical enough for the Games' in the media release of the IOC on July 24 is a tremendous blow."
The Stepanovas said they believed the IOC's focus on Yulia's past doping sanction shifted the spotlight away from the real issue, which is that the IOC took no action against Russia for punishing her for being a credible whistleblower by refusing to put her on Russia's Olympic team.
"At no point did the IOC, unlike the IAAF, demand publicly from the Russian sports authorities that they recognise our whistle-blowing as an important and valuable contribution for clean sport in Russia," they added.
"Our disappointment and sadness is huge. We asked the IOC humbly that Yuliya, as she would never be nominated by the Russian Olympic Committee, be permitted to compete as a neutral athlete at the Games in Rio.
"While Russia was permitted to send hundreds of competitors to the Games, Yuliya's request was denied. Although we are heartbroken, we wish to clarify that we have from the beginning chosen to not follow a judicial path."
The Stepanovas said they understood that the IOC had discretion to invite anyone it chose to the Games and, having been cleared by the International Association of Athletics Federations, had been hoping to be in Rio.
"We believe that in exercising this discretion to deny Yuliya a place in the competition, it sends a message that the World Anti-Doping Code and the values of Olympism are merely words on a page," they said.
"As a result, we will not file an appeal to CAS."


RIO DE JANEIRO The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on Friday defended USA Gymnastics against criticism it turned a blind eye to sexual abuse and said it had no plans to conduct an investigation itself.
In their opening news briefing of the Games, the USOC leadership faced questions about a report in the Indianapolis Star on Thursday that said top USA Gymnastics officials failed to alert authorities to allegations of sexual abuse by coaches.
Reuters has not independently verified the report.
While not addressing the specifics of the allegations, USA Gymnastics said it encouraged any victims of abuse to report their allegations to police - something echoed by the USOC.
The USOC said it would not conduct an investigation itself and defended USA Gymnastics as one of the leaders in developing policies to protect athletes.
"We do not intend to investigate ... we do however have what we think is a state-of-the-art policy regarding abuse and misconduct," said USOC chief executive officer Scott Blackmun said, just hours before the Games' opening ceremony.
"I will say since we became more focused on this issue in 2010, like many others, USA Gymnastics has been one of the most vocal proponents of creating very strong policies, procedures, and investigative resources to take a look at this.
"Our policy is not to investigate, it is to report any credible suggestions that there is abuse taking place."
USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny said the governing body had followed long standing policies.
"As the CEO of USA Gymnastics, it is heartbreaking and unacceptable for a young person to have the intolerable burden that results from being a victim of sexual misconduct," said Penny in a statement released after the USOC meeting. "We share the outrage that sexual assault victims and their families feel.
"This is why USA Gymnastics has implemented Safe Sport training and created educational materials that encourage members to contact law enforcement first when reporting incidents of abuse."
With a large Russian contingent now looking likely to take part in the Games, Blackmun was also asked by reporters if he was comfortable watching U.S. athletes line up against competitors from a country accused of developing and operating a sophisticated state-run doping program.
The USOC has been vocal in its push for a major shakeup at World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and a overhaul of the drug-testing system following investigations that uncovered evidence of widespread state sponsored doping in Russia.
The International Olympic Committee rejected imposing a blanket ban on Russia from the Games and instead set a number of criteria and turned over the decision to individual federations to determine which athletes were allowed to compete.
"There is no perfect solution," said Blackmun, acknowledging there would be clean Russians competing. "You're going to have sympathy for everyone in this because there is no outcome here that is going to be fair to every single person."
Russians or no Russians, the United States is still expected to top the medal table at the end of the Games and somewhere along the way claim a milestone 1,000th gold.
The United States currently sits on 976 gold medals, however, there is a dispute over a gold won at the 1904 Games.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilian soccer legend Pele will not light the Olympic cauldron at Friday's opening ceremony of the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics, a spokesman for the 75-year-old, three-time soccer World Cup winner said.
Pele, whose full name is Edson Arantes do Nacimento, is considered by some to be the greatest soccer player of all time, but has been suffering muscle pains and needs a cane to get around after hip surgery.


RIO DE JANEIRO A global sporting tribunal opened the door wider to Russian participation at the Rio Olympic Games on Thursday, ruling that an Olympic ban on two Russian rowers and a swimmer with histories of doping was unenforceable.
The decision, on the eve of the opening ceremony, could invite a dozen more appeals against the ban from Russian competitors, according to the tribunal's chief, and underlines Russian arguments that the ban lacks legal justification.
"We can do an appeal in 24 hours, so anything is possible," Matthieu Reeb, secretary-general of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), told Reuters when asked if there was enough time for other athletes to have their ban overturned.
"It's a first step," he said, referring to the Thursday's rulings. "There's now potentially a way to get through."
In response to evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia, the IOC last month directed sports federations to allow Russian athletes to compete only if they met certain criteria, including a clean doping past. Dozens of athletes were later excluded.
One of the athletes who could take advantage of the new ruling is whistleblower Yulia Stepanova who, together with her husband, ignited the Russian doping scandal by revealing the extent of the state-backed doping program.
Stepanova had been cleared to compete by the world athletics federation, which praised her courage in the affair, but the IOC refused to allow her to run in Rio due to her own doping past.
Russian officials in Rio could not be immediately reached for comment, but earlier the head of Russia's Olympic committee told reporters in the host city that the ban was discriminatory.
Alexander Zhukov said it was unfair Russian sports stars such as double Olympic champion pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva would now watch the Games from home while past doping offenders, including top U.S. runner Justin Gatlin, took to the field.
On Thursday, CAS ruled in favor of an appeal against the ban by four-times breaststroke world champion Yulia Efimova as well as rowers Anastasia Karabelshikova and Ivan Podshivalov.
Efimova had been disqualified from competing by swimming governing body FINA between October 2013 and February 2015 after testing positive for traces of the anabolic steroid DHEA.
CAS say the Olympic ban was unenforceable, saying an athlete cannot be sanctioned twice for a doping offense. FINA will now have to decide on her eligibility.
Karabelshikova and Podshivalov also argued that they should be allowed to compete given they had already served their doping suspensions. CAS sent their case back to the International Rowing Federation to decide on their eligibility "without delay".
Sport has been struggling for years to reconcile calls for a harder line on drug cheats against demands for natural justice.
The IOC had tried to ban cheats from the Games in 2011 with its own 'Osaka rule' - a suspension from the next Olympics for anyone with a six-month doping ban or longer - but that was also thrown out by CAS at the time.
A similar rule by the British Olympic Association to ban the nation's drugs cheats from Olympic participation for life was also rejected by CAS ahead of the 2012 London Games, allowing sprinter Dwain Chambers to race.
Several Olympic teams have competitors, who have been sanctioned for anti-doping rule violations in the past, in their ranks, including Gatlin and team mate LaShawn Merritt.

Jose Mourinho has dropped a heavy hint that Paul Pogba's protracted transfer from Juventus to Manchester United is close to completion.
Speaking ahead of Sunday's Community Shield with Leicester City, Manchester United's manager confirmed he expected one more player to arrive at Old Trafford before Aug. 14.
Although he said was reluctant to talk about players from other teams, he said he is one short of his intended first-team squad of 23 players plus three goalkeepers.
"We have 22 and we are going to have 23," Mourinho told a news conference. "We are going to get a very good midfielder," he added.
"Paul Pogba is a Juventus player until he isn't, officially, so we stay like this," Mourinho said of the midfielder, whose 100 million pounds ($130.30 million) move from the Italian side has been heavily trailed by British media.
"The market closes on Aug. 31 but my club try to do everything to close our market by Aug. 14."
Mourinho said he intended to use Sunday's game between his FA Cup holders and Premier League champions Leicester -- the traditional curtain-raiser to the English season -- to give a run out to as many members of his squad as possible.
"We can make six substitutions instead of three, so that gives me the chance to give minutes to people," he said.
"It also gives me the chance to play some players I know can't play 90 minutes, as they have no condition to play for 90 minutes. It will be a little bit of everything. Of course, we are going to try to win it."
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri also said he expected the game to be competitive.
"We will give the maximum and so will Manchester. It will be a true, true match," said Ranieri, for whom it will be his first time as a manger at Wembley.
Ranieri also said that he was hopeful that key midfielder Riyad Mahrez would stay at Leicester despite being linked with a move to Arsenal. "The chairman told me we want to keep everybody," said Ranieri.
Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha on Thursday posted a picture on social media of him with his arms round Mahrez, adding that the player was not for sale.

RIO DE JANEIRO The troubled preparations for the Rio Olympics proved that the model for the Games could withstand the toughest challenges but the IOC hoped it would not have to face such a stress test again, president Thomas Bach said on Thursday.
Speaking on the eve of the opening ceremony, Bach said organizers and the International Olympic Committee had braved and survived Brazil's economic meltdown and political turmoil.
"If this financial model of the Olympic Games withstands a stress test like in Brazil then you can see that this model is more than robust," Bach told reporters. "The crisis the country is in is maybe the worst crisis in the history of Brazil.
"These were not always easy times, not even now. Therefore I think we can say very clearly the financial model of the Games has really stood a stress test which I hope we will not have to withstand in the future again."
When Rio was awarded the Olympics in 2009 the country was enjoying a financial boom with near double-digit annual growth.
Yet only a few years later organizers had run out of cash and the state of Rio had suffered a financial catastrophe as the country slipped into its worst recession since the 1930s.
The IOC then had to pay out part of its financial contribution to the organizers in advance so they could complete preparations that were running dangerously late.
On a political level President Dilma Rousseff was suspended pending an impeachment trial for corruption with interim President Michel Temer taking over just months before the country hosted the biggest multi-sports event in the world.
Instead of basking in the glory of successfully organizing the first Olympics in South America, organizers were struggling to get the event ready in time.
"There were huge, huge challenges," Bach said. "Nevertheless you see this country... has managed to transform a city and put the Olympic Games on the stage."

RIO DE JANEIRO U.S. Olympic gold medalist Kayla Harrison is eager to compete in front of Brazil's passionate judo fans and hopes to meet long-time Brazilian rival Mayra Aguiar in the final at the Rio Games, calling it "destiny."
In what could be judo's biggest rivalry, Harrison and Aguiar are nearly even in head-to-head competition, with the former holding a 9-8 advantage.
Four years ago in London, Harrison upset Aguiar in the semi-finals of the women's -78kg class before going on to beat Britain's Gemma Gibbons and become the first ever U.S. judoka to win Olympic gold. Aguiar took bronze.
In their most recent meeting, Harrison beat Aguiar in May at a World Judo Masters tournament in Mexico.
"I wish her the best of luck along with all my competitors and hopefully see her in the final," Harrison told reporters.
"I fought a British girl in the final of London so I think it might be destiny to fight a Brazilian in the final of Rio."
Still, Harrison was careful not to look too far ahead with plenty of other tough competitors to contend with.
"Before I can even think about Mayra I have to think about everybody else in front of me," she said.
Harrison is well acquainted with the ardor of Brazil's judo fans and their support for Aguiar  -- she was famously booed by the crowd in Sao Paulo when she beat Aguiar on penalties six years ago at a world cup final.
But she said she thrives on the enthusiasm Brazilians hold for the sport, noting that since she has arrived in Rio she has been asked to pose for photos, which doesn't happen to her in the United States.
"I think the Brazilian crowd is going to be a very excitable and passionate crowd," she said.
"Let's go Brazilians - bring on the passion!"

RIO DE JANEIRO South Korea is not thrilled that its top archery brains are guiding other Olympic nations but the sport's superpower is especially uncomfortable about master coach Lee Ki-sik's American success.
The man who piloted South Korea at four Olympics from 1984-1996 has turned the United States into a formidable rival to the east Asian nation since joining the country's archery program in 2006.
Under Lee, the U.S. captured the men's team silver at the London Games to end a 12-year medal drought, having inflicted a seismic semi-final defeat on the Koreans to snap their run of three Olympic titles.
Little wonder a potential re-match between top seeds South Korea and the second-ranked U.S. will be imbued with tension at the Sambodrome in Rio on Saturday.
"I’m an American now, I’m a citizen," 59-year-old Lee told Reuters in an interview after training at the tournament venue on Thursday.
"(South Korea) don’t like this situation but you know, that’s how it is.
"There are a lot of great (South Korean) coaches outside of our country and I’m just one of them, but I don’t think my position makes them happy or comfortable, especially me working on the American team.
"Because, we’ve shown with our performance that the team is just getting better and better, year by year."
Former world champion Brady Ellison and Jake Kaminski, who won the team silver with Jacob Wukie, will bid for gold at Rio with debutant Zach Garrett, a 21-year-old who has soared to third in the world rankings after a stellar year.
A meticulous planner and a stringent advocate of biomechanics in technique, Lee brought the golden touch to Australia before joining the U.S. team.
He beams with pride when he remembers coaching Simon Fairweather to the men's individual gold at his home Sydney Games in 2000. A bronze for Tim Cuddihy, another of his Australian archers, followed four years later at Athens.
"The AOC (Australian Olympic Committee) said it was the most efficient sport compared with how much money they put in it," he said.

STRICT BLUEPRINT
Despite rejuvenating U.S. archery, Lee's tenure has not been without controversy.
His strict blueprint for technique has been adopted by U.S. archery in its training programs for coaches and athletes but has also been criticized as a one-size-fits-all approach that stifles individual invention.
A devout Christian, Lee was also censured for mixing spirituality with sport after a New York Times report during the 2008 Beijing Games said he held bible study sessions with his archers at their training base in Chula Vista, California.
Lee sponsored the baptisms of three Chula Vista archers in 2006 and weeks before the Beijing Games attended Ellison's baptism in a pool near their training range.
Although warned off proselytizing by the United States Olympic Committee, faith remains an important bond between Lee and his athletes.
"Sometimes we pray together," he said.
Lee's immediate mission is to convert the team's London silver into Rio gold, to beat South Korea, if necessary, and to keep archery's hard-won profile alive in his adopted nation.
"This is my third Olympics with the U.S. team," said Lee.
"I would like to win for sure so that people can have trust about what the American future can be."

RIO DE JANEIRO Michael Phelps is fired up and ready to go for what promises to be an explosive first weekend of the Rio Olympic swimming program.
The American could feature in Sunday's 4x100 freestyle relay final and should collect the 23rd Olympic medal of his record-breaking career if he does.
The U.S. men have not failed to finish in the top three since the event was introduced in 1964 but champions France and resurgent Australia will be tough opponents.
The women's 4x100 is Saturday's late night highlight, with U.S. golden girl Katie Ledecky tipped to swim in the preliminary heats to qualify for a medal in an event world champions Australia are favorites to win.
"The first two nights of the relays, with the women’s on the first night and the men’s on the second, there will probably be a lot of fireworks in the swimming pool," said Phelps.
"I’m looking forward to either watching or being in that race. Those races are ... super fast and there are always some crazy splits that take place."
Water and pyrotechnics usually result in a damp squib but Phelps is right to be excited. The sprint relays offer memorable nights of high drama.
Now 31 and in his fifth Games, the most medaled Olympian of all time (18 golds) has played his part in many such moments but may have to dig deeper this time.
"I think this sport has changed to where there’s not really one or two power houses," said Phelps. "You could probably pick three or four teams that are going to have a chance to win that (men's) relay."
"The Australians have made a significant charge over the last couple of years ... there are a lot of young guys who have really stepped up that I think brings more excitement to the sport."
Russia took the bronze in 2012 but two of that quartet -- Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev -- will be absent due to the doping scandal that has overshadowed the run-up to Rio.
The shadow of the past also hangs over Saturday's men's 400 freestyle, won in 2012 by China's Sun Yang ahead of South Korea's Park Tae-hwan.
Park, the first Korean to win an Olympic swimming medal when he claimed gold in Beijing in 2008, completed an 18-month ban imposed by world governing body FINA in March after testing positive for testosterone.
Sun served a three-month ban in 2014 after testing positive for a banned stimulant, spent a week in jail for crashing a car driven without a license, and was involved in an altercation at last year's world Championships.

RIO DE JANEIRO When Nadia Comaneci takes her seat at the Rio Olympic Arena on Sunday, she will be able to sit back and follow the women's gymnastics competition untroubled by the pent-up tension she usually feels.
That went flipping and somersaulting out of the window long before she headed for Rio to celebrate the 40th anniversary of her 'perfect 10' as, for the first time since 1968, her native Romania failed to make the cut for the team final.
"There will be a big hole in my stomach (on Sunday) when I won’t see my team," Comaneci told Reuters in an interview.
"It’s like someone important is missing from a party because you can’t imagine an Olympic gymnastics competition without Romania."
That is certainly true for a country used to showcasing perfection in the sport ever since Comaneci landed the first 10.0 score during the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
Romania has scooped a team medal at every Olympics since 1976, including gold in 1984, 2000 and 2004, but that remarkable four-decade streak in women's gymnastics ended in bitter tears  as they followed up a doomed outing at last year's world championships by also flopping at the Rio test event in April.
"When one member of the team got injured, it started a chain of bad luck as the others were left really shaken and then they just panicked," the 54-year-old Comaneci said.
"...One girl got injured, then one girl fell off bars and then you couldn't stop the mistakes."
Pre-competition injuries to Catalina Ponor and Anamaria Ocolisan had already provided major setbacks but when five-times European gold medalist Larisa Iordache botched her display on the beam at the Glasgow world championships last October, it completed a woeful exhibition of errors for the Romanians.
So poor was their display, no Romanian made it into the apparatus finals -- a competition that even featured an unlikely finalist from India on the vault.
"It was like they were all having a bad day and I started thinking 'can things get any worse?' And it did as they failed to qualify for the Olympics," lamented the five-times Olympic gold medalist.
After finishing 13th at the world championships -- where a top-eight finish was needed for automatic Olympic qualification -- the Rio test event in April offered Romania a second chance.
However, a rapidly shrinking talent pool meant that when they were hit by another round of injuries, a lack of top caliber substitutes meant they again failed to make the Olympic cut.
"In the qualifying event in Rio...they simply didn't have the girls as the only experienced member was Ponor but she can’t do three routines on every apparatus," said Comaneci.
"A lot of people think this is the death of Romanian gymnastics but I don’t think that's true. It’s just an unfortunate situation for now."
Romania's rich legacy is partly to blame for the current crisis as the country's gymnastics boom in the 1970s and 80s meant that countries with deep pockets lured away many of the nation's top-rated coaches.
Comaneci's own mentors, Bela and Martha Karoyli, have replicated that success with the current U.S. women's team, unbeaten in every global meet since 2011, winning three successive world titles and the 2012 Olympic gold.
Martha Karoyli, who will be retiring as USA Gymnastics national women’s team coordinator following the Rio Games, thinks the root cause of the decline in Romania is clear.
"I feel this happened because the system is broken," she said.
"We developed a system in Romania that was very successfully continued for a number of years but I don't know if it was because of some conflict in the organization or whether there was government interference ... but somehow they have forgotten the importance of raising gymnasts to be ready for every Olympics.
"So they had no strong upcoming gymnast to make the Olympic team."
Comaneci hopes her country's no-show when teams from the United States, Russia, Britain, China, Italy, Japan, Canada, Netherlands, Brazil, Germany, Belgium, France line up on Sunday can act as a wake-up call.
"After the (1989) revolution, we had a little bit of difficulty too but we came back from that setback.
"The recovery will be slow but I have not lost my faith in Romanian gymnastics."
In the absence of a fielding a full team, 2004 Olympic gold medalist Ponor will carry Romania's hopes as she looks to qualify for the individual finals.


RIO DE JANEIRO With their graceful lines and soaring tumbles, Kohei Uchimura and Gabby Douglas will be attempting to pull off a feat in the Rio Games that no gymnast has accomplished in over 40 years -- capturing back-to-back all-around Olympic golds.
After collecting every Olympic and world all-around title since taking silver at the 2008 Beijing Games, the man known as 'Super-mura' will be favorite to become the first man since Japanese compatriot Sawao Kato in 1972 to win successive Olympic titles in the event that tests skills across six apparatus.
For Douglas, though, things are not as clear cut.
Since Douglas' success in London, Simone Biles has turned into a one-woman demolition squad -- crushing anyone who comes before her with her explosive tumbles as she became the first woman to win a three-peat of all-around golds at the worlds.
She is such an unstoppable force that in just three years she has become the most successful female gymnast at the worlds with a haul of 10 golds.
That is the kind of opposition that Douglas needs to overcome to become only the third woman, after Russia's Larisa Latynina (1956-60) and Czech Vera Caslavska (1964-68), to win back-to-back all around titles.
''In terms of Gabby Douglas and Kohei Uchimura, both are capable of winning gold medals in Rio,'' Latynina, whose record of winning 18 Olympic medals was surpassed by swimmer Michael Phelps four years ago, told Reuters.
''I am amazed by the physical preparation that Douglas is showing and the level of skill that Uchimura shows.
''However, I don’t think they have much chance of winning 18 Olympic medals,'' she added, breaking down in laughter.
While Latynina's record of being the most successful gymnast is not under threat, Biles could become the first female gymnast to win five golds at a single Games as she collected four golds and a minor medal at each of the last two world championships.
Before any individual golds can be won, collective national pride will be on the line. Japan will be looking to end China's Olympic dominance in the men's team final on Monday while the U.S. women will be out to maintain their supremacy a day later as they are unbeaten in every global meet since 2011 - winning three successive world titles and the 2012 Olympic gold.
''The Americans are phenomenal. They’ve been dominating the sport now for over a decade. I don't really think they have any competition for the team gold as they've been winning every world championships by leaps and bounds for a long time,'' 1996 Olympic champion Kerri Strug told Reuters.
''It's exciting on one level that USA gymnastics has come so far but in terms of watching the competition, it's not exciting because we are so much better than everyone else.''
The collective strength of China means that since 1994, Chinese men have won 10 of 12 world championship team titles and three of the five Olympic golds on offer.
Japan, who captured five straight Olympic golds from 1960 to 1976, did climb to the top of the podium in Athens in 2004 but that was during the pre-Uchimura era.
Since Uchimura's arrival on the world stage, Japan have had to make do with silver medals behind champions China in 2008 and 2012.
But having finally toppled China from their lofty perch at last year's world championships in Glasgow, Uchimura hopes he can now lead his band of Japanese brothers to Rio glory.
''All I can think about is how much I want team gold. That's everything,'' Uchimura, who owns a record six successive world all around golds, told Reuters.

RIO DE JANEIRO Andy Murray, who won the Olympic tennis title at Wimbledon four years ago, will carry the British flag at Friday's Opening Ceremony in Rio, the British Olympic Association said on Wednesday.
Murray was selected from a short-list of athletes "who exemplify the Olympic values and uphold the Team GB values", with the final choice being made by a panel headed by Team GB Chef de Mission Mark England.
"To represent your country at the Games is an unbelievable experience, but to lead out Team GB will be an incredible honor, the biggest in sport," Murray said.
"This is my third Olympic Games and it is a very special competition for me. I obviously have great memories of London and I am 100 percent focused on winning here in Rio.
"The privilege of being the flag bearer is a moment I will remember for the rest of my life and will certainly be one of the highlights of my career."
England said: "The conviction with which Andy spoke to me about the honor of carrying the flag only underlined why he is such an exceptional individual, and absolutely the right choice.
"When I asked Andy to lead our team out it was received with a humility and grace that is befitting of the values of Team GB. It was an emotional moment for him personally, and for this team."
Murray, who secured his third grand slam title when winning Wimbledon this year, is second-favorite to retain his title behind Novak Djokovic, who he beat on grass in the semi-finals four years ago but who reigns supreme on the hard courts of the type to be used in Rio.
The Scot, who will also partner his brother Jamie in the men's doubles in Rio, was instrumental in leading Britain to the Davis Cup title in Belgium last year - the country's first triumph in the team event since 1936.

RIO DE JANEIRO A formidable lineup of the world's best shooters, including veteran Olympians from the United States and Australia, will be gunning for gold when their events at the Summer Games at Rio de Janeiro get underway on Saturday.
Among the veterans, American skeet shooter Kim Rhode, 37, will be looking to medal at her sixth consecutive Olympics, and could join a group that includes just five other people if she mounts the podium later this month.
"The pressure is definitely there," said Rhode, who relies on training to ease nerves. "I shot 450 targets the day before I left for here."
The United States has long dominated the sport, racking up 107 medals since its debut in 1920, almost twice as many as nearest rival Sweden. But a spot on the podium will be no sure thing for the Californian collector of first-edition children's books, who is currently ranked sixth in the world, behind rivals including teammate Morgan Craft.
Rhode is practically an Olympic novice compared with Georgian pistol shooter Nino Salukvadze, 47, a three-time medalist who will be competing in her eighth Games, an Olympic record. This time she will be alongside her 18-year-old son Tsotne Machavariani, who is making his Olympic debut. The two will be the first mother-son pair to compete on the same Olympic team.
"When I am at the shooting range I am the coach and mentor," said Salukvadze. "At the village I am the mother."
Australia's Warren Potent, 54, who snagged his country's first Olympic shooting medal in the 50-meter prone rifle event in Beijing in 2008, will be competing in his fifth games and aiming to top rivals two decades his junior.
In men's pistol events, South Korea's Jin Jong-oh, 36, will be a shooter to watch after his performance in London in 2012, where he became the first man to win multiple gold medals in shooting since 1924. He'll be contesting the same events, the 10 meters air pistol and 50 meters pistol, where he is ranked top in the world, in Rio.
China's team will also likely be a formidable threat, after it led the shooting medals table in the last three Olympics with a total of 32 so far this century.
The International Olympic Committee on Friday cleared all 18 of Russia's shooters to participate, after a quarter of its athletes including the entire athletics team were banned over a doping scandal.

RIO DE JANEIRO The U.S. trials proved a trial indeed for Missy Franklin but  swimming's golden girl of London 2012 believes she can be back to her best at the Rio Olympics.
Franklin set records on her way to four golds and a bronze medal at her first Games, but the 21-year-old qualified in just two individual events -- the 200 meters freestyle and 200 backstroke -- at the trials in Omaha.
That did not include the 100 meter backstroke, one of her  Olympic titles.
Despite that, she is still smiling.
"I've felt for the past several months that I am in the best shape I have ever been in," Franklin told a news conference on Wednesday.
"I think trials was just a very different experience for me and I think I wasn't really prepared for the emotional aspect of it...coming in this year I think I felt the pressure a lot more than I ever have before.
"I've normally been able to handle that really well and that was something that I really struggled with at trials," she added.
With that ordeal over, and many swimmers have commented over the years how the process is every bit as pressured as an Olympic final, Franklin said she had a fresh surge of confidence.
"I still have that power, I still have those guts that I really believe I've had my whole career," she said.
"With a lot of that pressure gone, and with a better mental mindset coming in here ... I won't only have all that endurance that I built up but also the heart and guts to go on top of that. I think that's a pretty killer combination."
Katie Ledecky won the 200 freestyle at the trials and looks set to be the talk of the women's team this time around with a possible individual golden triple as well as relays.
Franklin was gushing in her praise for the 19-year-old, who won 800m freestyle gold in London and has since made herself unbeatable over the distance.
"It's been such an honor to watch her," she said. "I think she's capable of unbelievable things, doing things that no-one in this world has ever seen before.
"To be able to tell my kids one day or tell stories that 'hey, I was there when Katie Ledecky did this'. That is so cool for me ... hopefully I can push her the way she's pushed me similar to how we talk about Australia pushing the U.S."

RIO DE JANEIRO Canoe slalom training runs were cancelled on Thursday at Rio's Whitewater Stadium after a power issue caused the pumps to stall on the eve of the Olympics opening ceremony.
Training was halted at 12:30pm local time and no more runs took place at the Deodoro X-Park in the north west of the city as organisers scrambled to fix the problem.
"Technical issues have been found in the power supply distribution to the pumping station," the local organising committee said in a statement.
"A decision to cancel training was taken for the technical issues to be solved more quickly," it added.
The power problem, three days before the Canoe slalom events start, raises further concerns about Rio's preparations.
Several delegations had complained of electricity and plumbing problems at the Olympic Village, with the Australian delegation chief saying accommodation was "not safe or ready."

RIO DE JANEIRO The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has confirmed the eligibility of Russian golfer Maria Verchenova to compete at the Rio Olympic Games, the International Golf Federation (IGF) said on Thursday.



RIO DE JANEIRO The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has confirmed the eligibility of 18 Russian shooters to compete at the Rio Olympic Games, the International Shooting Sport Federation said on Thursday.

RIO DE JANEIRO The International Judo Federation (IJF) said on Thursday that 11 Russian athletes had been cleared to compete at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
"The International Judo Federation is very pleased that all Russian judoka qualified for the Olympic Games, tested many times before the Games and clean, will attend the judo event in Rio," it said in a statement.
The International Olympic Committee is due to announce on Thursday the final number of Russian athletes across all sports who are eligible for Rio, after imposing strict criteria for admission following the doping scandal in the country.

RIO DE JANEIRO The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has confirmed the eligibility of eight Russian tennis players to compete at the Rio Olympic Games, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said on Thursday.

RIO DE JANEIRO Russia will be represented in most sports at the Rio Olympics, with 271 of its sportsmen and women cleared to participate ahead of the opening ceremony, Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) head Alexander Zhukov said on Thursday.
Russian boxers, judokas and shooters were among those given last-minute approval by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in the aftermath of a doping scandal which has tarnished Russia's reputation as a sporting superpower and threatened to split the Olympic movement.
Russia's depleted team will comprise about 70 percent of the 387-strong squad originally named for the Games.
The country's track-and-field athletes and weightlifters have already been barred over doping offences, and Russia narrowly avoided a complete ban over allegations its government and FSB security service systematically covered up widespread cheating.
The IOC chose not to impose a blanket ban on all Russian athletes at a meeting in July, but directed sports federations to allow them to compete if they met a set of criteria, including a clean doping past and sufficient testing at international events.
Zhukov said the stringent conditions meant Russia's 271-strong team would now be the cleanest at the Rio Games.
"Not one team underwent such strict requirements as Russian athletes," he told a news conference in Rio. "No athletes from any country ... had the rules changed to bar those previously guilty of doping."
Russia has long drawn pride and prestige from its history of Olympic success and President Vladimir Putin has used sporting victories to showcase his image of the country as a resurgent global power.
Speaking to the Russian team before they left for Rio last week, Putin said Russia's Olympic ambitions had fallen victim to a politically-motivated plot.
Zhukov said it was unfair that Russian sports stars such as double Olympic champion pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva would now watch the Games from home while past doping offenders including top U.S. runner Justin Gatlin took to the field.
"Athletes such as Yelena Isinbayeva ... are absolutely clean," he said. "This is a flagrant injustice."

RIO DE JANEIRO Five sports, including baseball, skateboarding and surfing, will feature at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after the IOC voted them in on Wednesday in an attempt to revamp the Games program to attract a younger audience.
The International Olympic Committee unanimously rubber-stamped the decision taken by its executive board in June, approving the inclusion of skateboarding, surfing, sports climbing, karate and a joint baseball/softball bid, which is expected to significantly boost local support for the Olympics.
The IOC session in the Brazilian city voted unanimously with a show of hands in favor of the sports which will make a one-off appearance in the Games.
"This will help make the Tokyo Games one of the most innovative Games in history," IOC Vice President John Coates said.
Baseball and softball, proposed to be staged in Yokohama, will each have a competition involving six teams. They last featured at the Olympics in Beijing in 2008 before being taken off the program and missing the 2012 and the 2016 Games.
It is unclear, however, if baseball will feature the world's best players from the MLB in the United States.
"Today’s historic decision by the IOC is a 'home run' for the Olympics, our sport and the Tokyo 2020 Games," World Baseball and Softball Confederation President Riccardo Fraccari said.
"Nations competing for the Olympic gold medal in baseball and softball, in Japan, will best showcase the nature and spirit of our global sport -- and it will be the most covered and most exciting international baseball/softball tournaments in history."
As part of sweeping reforms initiated in 2014, hosts can bring in sports popular in their countries to boost ratings and attract greater sponsorship as well as a younger generation of fans.
"I am so happy and so thrilled and I my have lost some of my composure," Tokyo Games chief Yoshiro Mori said. "This was an epoch-making decision today."
Surfing, with 20 men and 20 women athletes, will take place in the sea, instead of on artificial waves, likely in the Prefecture of Chiba. Skateboarding, with two street and two park events involving 40 competitors each (20 male, 20 female), will be in Tokyo.
"This is a game-changing moment for surfing," said international federation president Fernando Aguerre.
"We are already seeing increased popularity of the sport across the world and the Olympic Games will provide an incredible platform to further showcase surfing."
Karate could use the Nippon budokan -- home of Japanese martial arts -- and will have two events (one men's and one women's) for kata and three weight classes for kumite.
Sports climbing, also in urban Tokyo, will feature men's and women's competitions for bouldering, lead and speed combined with a total of 474 athletes to compete in the five sports.
Venues are to be finalised by the end of the year, Mori said.

Manny Pacquiao will take on American World Boxing Organization welterweight champion Jessie Vargas when he returns to the ring on Nov. 5, according to the Filipino boxer's manager Michael Koncz.
"Retirement doesn't suit Manny right now," Koncz told the Los Angeles Times of the former eight-division world champion.
"Boxing is in his blood. When he trains, it's like a pressure-release valve. You can see a dramatic difference in his mood... he's happy. It's amazing what training and fighting does for him."
Pacquiao (58-6-2) had announced his retirement after defeating Timothy Bradley in April and was elected to the Philippines' senate in May. His promoter Bob Arum announced last month that he would fight again in November.
Arum tweeted earlier this week that he would travel to the Philippines for a meeting on Aug. 10 to discuss the 37-year-old southpaw's return.
Koncz, who will also attend the meeting, said the trio were not discussing a potential opponent, but whether to stage the bout in Los Angeles or Dubai.
"That's the essence of the meeting," Koncz added. "Not choosing the opponent. That's already been done."
Pacquiao's unanimous decision win over Bradley was his first fight in nearly a year after his tame loss to Floyd Mayweather. He had said he was bringing the curtain down on his career to concentrate on politics and his family.
The 27-year-old Vargas (27-1) beat fellow American Sadam Ali in March to claim the WBO welterweight crown and has won 10 of his bouts via a knockout or stoppage, with his only defeat coming via a points loss to Bradley in June 2015.

RIO DE JANEIRO Usain Bolt is promising to let American sprinter Justin Gatlin  "feel his full wrath" as he zones in on an unprecedented treble-treble of gold medals at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Bolt was given a medical exemption by Jamaican officials to compete at the Rio Games after he pulled a hamstring during the Olympic trials and Gatlin wasted little opportunity in trying to get under the 29-year-old's skin.
Gatlin said the six-time Olympic gold medalist had been given 'a medical pass' to compete and Bolt said on Wednesday that had only served to fuel his desire to shut the American up by proving himself on the track.
"Yes definitely, I think they have not learned over the years that the more you talk, the more I will want to beat you," Bolt told Reuters on Wednesday.
"It's one of those things, but I'm looking forward to it, should be exciting and they will feel my full wrath as always."
Bolt, who returned to action in the 200 meters at last month's Diamond League meeting in London, said he felt he was in better shape ahead of the opening race of his program on Aug. 13 -- the 100 meters -- than he was for last year's world championships in Beijing.
"I'm feeling much more confident now," he added. "I'm much more comfortable with where I'm at.
"I never try to predict times, because you never know what will happen. But for me the shape I'm in, I'll say I'm in much better shape, so I think 9.6 seconds definitely."
Bolt's world record for the 100 is 9.58 seconds. He ran 9.79 in clinching his third world championships title last year in Beijing.
As for his preferred 200, Bolt said he and coach Glen Mills had been pleased with the work they had been doing on the bend after some "rust" in London, when he ran 19.89.
"We've been doing a lot of work since I've been here, everything has been going well, I've been feeling great and I have no problem so I'm happy with the progress I'm making," he said.
"It was just rust for me, having not run the 200 in over a year pretty much, but now I've familiarized myself back with the work, and it's just about going out there and executing."



RIO DE JANEIRO United States goalkeeper Hope Solo was the target of some teasing at the hands of Brazilian soccer fans on Wednesday as her team beat New Zealand 2-0 in their opening match of their quest for a fourth successive Olympic gold.
Solo, playing her 199th international match in the game in Belo Horizonte, was greeted by thousands of fans shouting "Zika!", in reference to a Twitter photo she published last month, every time she cleared the ball or took a goal kick.
"Not sharing this!!! Get your own!" the 35-year-old had written on Twitter, where she was photographed wearing a mosquito net and holding a jumbo-sized bottle of insect repellent.
Solo later downplayed the picture but the Rio Games, the first in South America, have been beset by concerns over an outbreak of the virus, which can cause birth defects in newborn children.
Several athletes, particularly male golfers, have withdrawn due to their concerns of contracting the mosquito-born virus.
The chant, based on similar chants used by fans all across Latin America, was one of the talking points in a game the U.S. controlled without dominating.
They took an early lead after just nine minutes thanks to captain Carli Lloyd, who got on the end of a cross to wrong foot New Zealand goalkeeper Erin Nayler and send a looping header into the corner of the net.
Alex Morgan got the second less than a minute into the second period when she ended a nice move by firing home between Nayler and the post from 12 yards out.
"They are very physical team and technically they were strong and they are strong throughout," said Nayler. "There were moments when we broke them down but we couldn't score."

RIO DE JANEIRO It's as predictable as the fixed, two-year calendar for the Olympics themselves.
Before every edition of the Games – winter or summer, rich or developing world – a litany of complaints, criticisms and doomsday predictions play out in the news media and among foreigners and host country locals alike.
Beijing was going to snap under the tension of east versus west sensibilities. London was going to grind to a standstill, paralyzed by security fears. In the days before Sochi started two years ago, social media crackled with criticism and images mocking Russian workmanship.
In Brazil, as Rio de Janeiro gears up for the opening ceremony on Friday, a slew of problems have indeed made many question the success of the Games – from a recession, to cost overruns, to forced evictions, to pernicious pollution, to the collapse of a new bike path that killed two people.
An outbreak of the Zika virus, a corruption investigation that jailed dozens of politicians and rich executives, and a political crisis prompting the president's impeachment have also battered Brazil's reputation and self-confidence.
But with as many as 500,000 foreign visitors descending upon Rio just days before show time, a familiar sense of anticipation and festivity are leading many to come to another habitual realization: Things might actually go okay.
"Despite all the talk and all the media, I think Brazil is going to pull off a great Olympics," said Farhad Panahi, a visitor from Toronto, enjoying the contrast from on high between verdant mountains and playful beaches during a tour of Rio's iconic Christ statue. "It's going to be fun and the city is going to have a good time."
True, plenty could still go wrong, even forgetting the financial hangover expected after Brazil spent about 40 billion reais ($12.3 billion) to host the Games just as it reels from its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
Traffic jams and other logistical problems could make for long waits and missed events. Quick fixes and last-minute construction could still cause problems at venues and Olympic housing. And the threat of terrorism, at a time of growing attacks by militants, continues to hang over the event.
Even concerns over Zika infections, which have waned dramatically during Brazil's winter because lower temperatures slow reproduction of the mosquito that spreads the virus, could intensify if a sustained heat wave caused the bugs to rebound.
But Brazil, aware of its possible shortcomings, is relying on massive manpower to help things go smoothly – a trick it has successfully used during previous big events, including the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and giant annual Carnival and New Year's celebrations.
More than 85,000 police, soldiers and other security personnel will be on hand – over twice the force deployed during the London Olympics in 2012. More than 50,000 volunteers will be in place across the city to help wayward visitors.

'A WAY TO REJOICE'
What's more, Brazil has a history of being able to put spectacle first, no matter its other travails.
"You think slaves had reason to party?" asks Haroldo Costa, a historian of Carnival and other popular festivals in Brazil. "Yet it was their song and dance that led to our popular festivals. Brazil, no matter the circumstances, finds a way to rejoice."
After traffic jams early this week, Mayor Eduardo Paes declared that Thursday, when the Olympic torch ends its three-month journey across Brazil, would be yet another official holiday – the fourth now decreed to reduce traffic during the busiest Olympic days. Public holidays helped grease the wheels during the World Cup, too.
Never mind the complaints of industry, small business owners and others who lose revenue, and still pay overheads, with every holiday.
For those here to enjoy themselves, it's all the more reason to have a good time. "This is like a dream," said Miguel Vizcainho, a 23-year-old law student from Argentina.
He and three friends, holders of Olympic volleyball and table-tennis tickets, filled an inflatable boat with ice, vodka bottles and juice on Copacabana beach. The sun beat down from a blue sky as tourists and locals took in its warmth and the pre-Olympic buzz now palpable around town.
It's not that visitors are unaware of the problems.
Vizcainho said reports of rising crime gave him and his friends pause before they decided to come anyway.
Others said they had to brush off fears about Zika despite the fact that infection rates now have fallen to a fraction of what they were at the height of Brazil's scare earlier this year.
And even those well aware of the nightmare scenario at such a big sports and tourism events – terrorism – say they are expecting things to go well.
"It's probably safer here than being in a European country," said Jon Lane, a 30-year-old physical education teacher from England, noting the recent tide of attacks in Germany, Belgium and France.

RIO DE JANEIRO Ryan Lochte was a top dog in the U.S. Olympic swimming team in London four years ago, but he felt more like an ageing underdog as he celebrated his 32nd birthday at the Rio Games on Wednesday.
As 31-year-old room mate Michael Phelps told a million followers on Instagram in a message accompanying a photograph of the pair of them, the friends and rivals are "the old dudes on the team now".
Lochte, who has 11 Olympic medals (five golds) from three Games compared to Phelps's record haul of 22 (18 golds) from four, repeated the picture with the additional hashtag #oldmanriver.
Sporting a striking new blue-grey hair look, with the jury out on the exact tint under the media center spotlights, Lochte said he felt the same thrill in Rio as he had at his first Games.
But he acknowledged he was in a different position with a younger generation coming through.
"The lead-up to this Games is a lot different than I guess 2012," he told reporters.
"I think I had more of a target on my back in 2012. Since the past couple of years haven't been up to par for myself and my standards, I think I'm the underdog now.
"Given what I've accomplished in the sport it doesn't seem that way, but for me personally I feel like I am the underdog. So that's really good for my mindset going into this Olympics that I'm the underdog and I have to earn my spot on the podium."
Lochte and Phelps have had some epic battles in the past, with the former losing out to Phelps in the 200 meters individual medley in 2012.
The pair have qualified for one more clash in that event in Rio, with Phelps again finishing first and Lochte -- the world champion and record holder in the event -- second in one of the highlights of the U.S. trials.
Olympic champion Lochte was also beaten into third place in the 400m IM at the trials by newcomer Chase Kalisz and Jay Litherland, saying afterwards he had pulled his groin in the earlier heats.
Lochte is no longer top of the world rankings in any discipline and will compete in just the one individual event in Rio, as well as relays. His fourth place finish in the 200m freestyle in Omaha secured a slot for the 4x200m.

RIO DE JANEIRO Explaining the difference between Olympic gold and silver can be a tough ask for a disappointed runner-up, but for American archer Jake Kaminski, heartbreak can be distilled down to three-eighths of an inch.
That tiny distance separated the United States from the men's team title in London, where Michele Frangilli sealed a one-point victory for Italy at the Lord's cricket ground with the last arrow of a nerve-shredding final.
American Kaminski, silver medalist along with Brady Ellison and Jacob Wukie, has had four years to stew over a result that still rankles as he prepares to go one better in Rio de Janeiro.
"The last arrow that we missed was out of the scoring range by less than a quarter of an inch," the 27-year-old told reporters at Rio's Olympic Park precinct.
"And their last arrow was in by less than an eighth of an inch. So a combined total, we can say less than three-eighths of an inch at a distance of over 70 meters, or 77 yards (was the difference).
"It was so gusty, so unpredictable, the wind. Unfortunately, there is a level of luck that comes into play in archery.
"But luck has a way of finding its way back to you. This year we have a chance to reclaim it, get that gold."
Kaminski has returned to the Olympics with former world champion Ellison and the pair form a powerful team with debutant Zach Garrett, a 21-year-old ranked third in the world.
South Korea's top-ranked trio of Kim Woo-jin, Ku Bonchan and Lee Seungyan are certain to provide stiff competition but the Americans have no fear of the sport's Asian superpower.
The U.S. stunned the South Korean men in the 2012 semi-finals, another nail-biting clash that Kaminski felt was the real gold-medal decider.
"Anybody that has followed archery will tell you that that was the match to watch and that was actually the Olympic gold medal right there and we made a statement there," he said.
"I feel like, despite taking silver, we knew that, in our hearts, we had won."
Should the teams face off again, the tension will be huge, but there is unlikely to be trash talk or death-stares thrown between the rival camps.
"The Korean team that’s on the field right now is probably one of the fun teams as far as hanging out on the field," said Ellison.
"When you have two heavy hitters on the field there is a lot of respect. I really hope it comes down to us facing Korea again, I really do."


RIO DE JANEIRO There will be no Russian weightlifters at the Rio Olympics after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Wednesday rejected the country's appeal against a ban imposed by the sport's governing body, the IWF.
The Russian team were banned last week after the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) said "the integrity of weightlifting has been seriously damaged on multiple times and levels by the Russians".
The Russian Weightlifting Federation appealed to CAS but sport's ultimate court found against them.
"The appeal has been dismissed," CAS Secretary General Matthieu Reeb told Reuters.
"The CAS panel in charge of this case has determined that the decision of the IWF was valid and proportionate to the circumstances."
On Tuesday, CAS dismissed an appeal by Russian rowers in similar circumstances.
Last month, the IWF said its Executive Board had decided to suspend for a year national federations that produced three or more doping violations in re-tests from the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.
It named Russia, along with Kazakhstan and Belarus, but said it would await confirmation of the positive tests from the IOC before implementing the suspension.
Last week it noted that Russian competitors had been named in the McLaren Report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) that exposed evidence of state-backed doping, evasion and cover-ups in Russia.
The IOC has directed sports federations to allow Russian athletes to compete in Rio only if they could effectively prove that they had operated in an environment with a bona-fide anti-doping regime. The IOC also said any athletes specifically named in the McLaren report should be excluded.
In its statement last week the IWF said: "We would like to highlight the extremely shocking and disappointing statistics regarding the Russian weightlifters."
Reeb dismissed any criticism about the role of CAS in ruling on athletes' involvement in the Games.
"There have been criticisms about the CAS decision with respect to athletics a few days ago, but our activity, our job, is really to render decisions according to the law, we are not a political body, we do not express political opinions and of course we cannot be seen as a political institution," he said.
“Maybe fans or the public in Russia may consider us as the bad guys but in reality it should not be so.”
Little known outside the world of sport, CAS has been front and centre already in Rio.
“We have broken the record for the number of cases registered, now we have 18 cases, in London we had 11 cases for the entire duration of the Games," Reeb said.

RIO DE JANEIRO A mischievous Michael Phelps hinted the Rio Games may not be his last when the most decorated Olympian of all-time said on Wednesday he was excited his infant son Boomer would be in the stands to watch "the potential" last races of his career.
The American, who retired after the 2012 London Olympics and was taken to task when he announced he would make a Rio comeback, appeared to be joking with reporters packed into his pre-Games new conference about continuing his career.
But the winner of a record 22 Olympic medals, including 18 golds, left the door open by the smallest of cracks that a sixth Games could be on his agenda.
"To have our first born be able to watch -- I'll say this just in case it comes back -- my potential last Olympics just so you guys don't beat me to death about coming back," said Phelps, drawing laughter from the packed hall.
"To have him (Boomer) watch the potential last races of my career is something I look forward to being able to share with him and also now being able to share the experience of carrying the American flag and leading Team USA out," he added.
The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) announced earlier on Wednesday that Phelps, who will be the first American male swimmer to compete at five Games, had been chosen in a vote of team members to lead the delegation into the Maracana stadium.
At the 2012 Olympics, which he had declared to be his last, Phelps won four gold and six medals but walked away filled with the regret that he simply went through the motions rather than embrace the moment.

DETACHED VETERAN
That has not been the case in Rio where the 31-year-old has been acting more like a wide-eyed teenager at his first Games rather that a detached veteran nearing the finish line.
Phelps's Rio room mate Ryan Lochte for one believes the swimming world has not seen the last of his long-time rival.
"I’m really excited to see what he can do at this Olympics," said Lochte, an 11-times Olympic medalist who has dueled with Phelps throughout their careers. "Honestly, I don’t think that this is going to be his last Olympics.
"I said this in 2012 and he’s back. So I’m saying he’s going to come back again."
For Phelps this Olympic journey has been more important than the destination, a trip he has shared with his fiance Nicole and infant son Boomer, who will both be in Rio.
An athlete who use to shut himself off at the Games and walk around with headphones on, a playful Phelps appears eager to savor every moment, even stopping top-ranked men's tennis player Novak Djokovic on Wednesday to have his picture snapped with the 12-times grand slam winner.
"I'm having fun again," said Phelps, who is widely expected to see his first action and shot at a 23rd Olympic medal on Sunday as part of the U.S. 4x100 meters freestyle relay team.
"I think I'm at the point where whatever is left here I will be able to turn the page and say I was able to finish my career how I wanted to and for me that's all that matters," he added.
"This has been the greatest two years of my life for a lot of reason and I wouldn't change it."

RIO DE JANEIRO Hans Gubler is the man who knows the answers but will never tell, the keeper of secrets as well as time at Rio's Olympic aquatics center.
Gubler is the Omega man, overseeing a 'nerve-centre' of timing systems as a privileged insider with access to the sort of sensitive data that many would like to see but that will never be divulged.
At the 2000 Games in Sydney, U.S. team mates Anthony Ervin and Gary Hall Jr shared the 50 meters freestyle gold with a time of 21.98 seconds -- meaning there was not even a fingertip between them officially.
There have been other ties in the history of swimming, which is timed to 1/100th of a second, but Swiss timers Omega will always know who was in front because they time to 1/10,000th.
There is even the computing potential to deliver timings to the millionth.
''Of course we can see the facts,'' Gubler told Reuters pool side on a tour of the timing facility. ''When it comes to a tie, obviously we have proof for it. And then it's up to the federation for the last judgment.''
The world body FINA will also be in the know, but the information is not released. Apart from anything, such fine timings have to take into account the construction of the pool and lane differences.
One thousandth of a second in the pool equates roughly to 1.7 millimeters.
Every Games has its novelties and for Rio, the swimming has two that should make life easier for competitors if not exactly cutting-edge.
One is underwater electric screens in each lane for the 800 and 1,500 meter events that will allow swimmers to keep track more easily of which lap they are on without having to look up for external signs.
Individual screens can be switched off if an athlete finds it a distraction, although Gubler said the feedback from its introduction at the 2014 Short-Course World Championships in Doha was that it was something swimmers had been waiting for.
The other is a 'backstroke ledge', a removable strip that is submerged in the water below the blocks to improve grip at the start off the wall.
High speed video technology has also seen big advances.
''I think there's still a lot of potential when it comes to show the television spectators the data that we gather, to give them an even closer feel of what is going on,'' said Gubler of future developments.
''If we can show the performance of the start like a curve, how much was he ready, that sort of thing, I think would be interesting to see.''
The first Olympics to be staged in South America also poses some specific local challenges, with the risk of sudden power cuts high among them, but Gubler is confident the timing system will be protected in Rio.
''Our crucial equipment is on battery backups, uninterrupted power supply,'' he said. ''Of course a big scoreboard cannot be secured, that would be run off a generator, and there may be a minute without power.
''But it's only a display. The actual timing is secured.''

RIO DE JANEIRO Widows of two of the 11 Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen at the 1972 Munich Olympics got the recognition that they had so long sought with a ceremony and minute's silence at the Olympic village in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday.
Ankie Spitzer's fencing coach husband, Andre, was killed along with weightlifter Joseph Romano, whose wife Ilana Romano was also at the ceremony led by International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach.
"This is closure for us. This is incredibly important. We waited 44 years to have this remembrance and recognition for our loved ones who were so brutally killed in Munich," Spitzer told reporters at the newly established Place of Mourning.
"That they would be really accepted as members of the Olympic family. It is what we wanted because they were members of the Olympic family."
On Sept. 5, 1972, members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage at the poorly secured athletes' village by Palestinian gunmen from the Black September group.
Within 24 hours, 11 Israelis, five Palestinians and a German policeman were dead after a standoff and subsequent rescue effort erupted into gunfire.
Relatives of those killed have long demanded a minute's silence at the Opening Ceremonies of Olympics Games, only to be turned down by the IOC.
Instead, Bach inaugurated the Place of Mourning, which will now be a feature at every Olympics, with two stones from ancient Olympia encased in glass in a leafy part of the athletes' village.
"Today, the inauguration of the Place of Mourning give us the opportunity to remember those that have passed away at the Olympic Games," Bach told a small crowd that included IOC officials, Israeli team officials, athletes and Spitzer and Romano.
"We chose the Olympic village as the location ... because it symbolizes the unity of the Olympic family."
He then read out the 11 names of the Israeli victims, the German policeman as well as the name of Nodar Kumaritashvili, who was killed on the eve of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics in an accident in the sliding center.
Romano said: "I never believed it is going to come. After 44 years I am happy for this moment of history."
Bach, in tears, embraced Romano and Spitzer, who praised the IOC's decision.
"I cannot explain to you how emotional I am and how much this means for us," Spitzer said. "We went through a lot. We always got a No (from the IOC) and this time we not only got a Yes but a big Yes."

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Serbia's Novak Djokovic said the doping scandal engulfing Russia was bad for the country and international sport, but he was glad some Russian athletes have been allowed to compete at the Rio Olympics.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accused Russia of running a state-sponsored doping program and called for the country to be banned from the Olympics.
Although Russia avoided an outright suspension, scores of its athletes have been banned by individual federations, including essentially the entire track-and-field team.
World number one Djokovic said Russia was a global power in international sport but the scandal had been damaging for all involved.
"I don’t want to make any kind of stance there because I don’t have adequate details about that case, but at least to some extent I’m glad there are some Russian athletes being part of the Games," Djokovic told reporters on Wednesday.
"To hear and to read about what was happening in the last couple of months was definitely from an athlete perspective not good; not (good) for Russia, not good for international sport, not good for Olympic games."
Djokovic's relief that Russian athletes will compete at Rio was in stark contrast with the view of WADA and many other athletes who have called for the entire Russian team to be banned from the Olympics as a punishment for persistent doping.
Djokovic is the top seed for the tennis tournament at Rio, ahead of defending champion Andy Murray. The 2008 Beijing gold medal winner Rafael Nadal has been seeded third.
The Serb said he was surprised that half of the world's top-10 seeds had pulled out of the tournament, either through injury or health concerns over the Zika virus.
Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer withdrew because of injuries while the Czech Republic's Tomas Berdych pulled out citing concerns over Zika. Other notable absentees include Canadian Milos Raonic and Austrian Dominic Thiem.
"I wasn’t expecting to see so many players at the top of the tennis world pull out but each one of them had their own reason and you gotta respect that," said Djokovic.
He added the withdrawals had not diminished the competition and winning a gold medal would still require defeating top players such as Murray or Nadal.
"It would mean the world to me (to win gold)," said Djokovic. "It would rank as one of the highest achievements in my career."

RIO DE JANEIRO Being the oldest gymnast to compete at an Olympics has earned Oksana Chusovitina admiration as "brave", but there seems to be one big reason why the 41-year-old keeps punishing her body - a love of Tom Cruise.
“I have a picture of Tom Cruise on my wall as I really like him. So I look at him every day and think I have to look young for him. Someday, if and when I meet him ... I shouldn’t look too old,” said the gymnast who won team gold with the Unified Team in 1992 on her Olympic debut.
Chusovitina may not want to look old for her Hollywood hero but in a sport over-populated with teenagers, she is almost pre-historic as her gymnastics lifespan of competing in seven successive Olympics defies logic.
While she is almost three times older than the youngest gymnast in Rio, 15-year-old Belgian Senna Deriks, the next oldest competitor after Chusovitina is 32-year-old Vasiliki Millousi from Greece.
"It’s hard to believe that someone Oksana's age will be competing at the Olympics," Romanian great Nadia Comaneci told Reuters.
"How can someone her age dare to do that to their body?"
"You’ve got be a little bit crazy to do such a brave thing. Hats off to her. It’s amazing."
Following the break up of the Soviet Union, Chusovitina was a member of the Unified Team in 1992, represented Uzbekistan at the next three Olympics, then won a silver on the vault in Beijing in 2008 after switching allegiance to Germany. She has now gone back to her roots and will compete for Uzbekistan in Rio.
While a lifetime of dedication and pain has earned her nine world championship medals, including three golds, over the past quarter of a century, 1996 Olympic champion Kerri Strug cannot believe Chusovitina, who has a 16-year-old son, is still going strong since they both made their Olympic debuts at the Barcelona Games.
"Unbelievable. I have the utmost respect for her," Strug told Reuters.
"I mean she’s had a child, and to keep getting into a leotard and stay in such phenomenal shape. To be able to bear all that pounding over the years, I don’t know how she does it.
"Kudos to her for being so disciplined with her diet, staying lean and mean at that age. It only gets harder to compete with these youngsters but she’s doing it.
"In gymnastics, it usually one or two Olympics but seven? It’s just crazy and it’s amazing. Whether she wins any medals or not, it’s inspiring to people of all lifestyles to see somebody is able to do that."
And what do the vault specialist's current rivals think?
"It's so insane," summed up 2012 all-around champion Gabby Douglas.

NEW YORK The federal judge overseeing the wide-ranging corruption case involving soccer's global governing body FIFA said on Wednesday that a trial for eight defendants could begin in September or October of 2017.
U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie in Brooklyn at a hearing said that federal prosecutors had sought an early 2017 trial date, but given the amount of evidence still being processed, that September or October of next year was more realistic.
The trial would involve seven former soccer officials and one ex-marketing executive who are among the 42 individuals and entities charged so far in a case that has rocked the soccer world. All eight defendants had previously pleaded not guilty.
The judge said he wanted the case to move forward, noting the first of the eight defendants before him appeared in court in May 2015.
"At some point, we're going to have to call it," Dearie said.
The potential trial date was announced as Assistant U.S. Attorney Evan Norris disclosed that prosecutors expect to bring additional charges in the case, though he said that it was "too early to say" if additional defendants would be charged.
"Our ongoing investigation does continue," Norris said. "It is quite active and quite broad."
U.S. prosecutors accuse the defendants of participating in schemes involving more than $200 million in bribes and kickbacks, both sought and received by soccer officials for marketing and broadcast rights to tournaments and matches.
The investigation has plunged Zurich-based FIFA and the sport's regional governing bodies into an unprecedented crisis. Gianni Infantino, FIFA's newly elected president, has vowed to restore the organization's tattered image.
To date, 16 people and two sports marketing companies have pleaded guilty in the U.S. case. Most recently, Brayan Jimenez, a former president of Guatemala's soccer federation, pleaded guilty on Friday. [L1N1AF1Z1]
The eight defendants facing the potential trial next year include former FIFA officials and executive committee members Jose Maria Marin of Brazil, Juan Angel Napout of Paraguay, Eduardo Li of Costa Rica, and Julio Rocha of Nicaragua.
Others include Miami-based sports marketing executive Aaron Davidson, Hector Trujillo, a judge from Guatemala and ex-official with its soccer federation, ex-Cayman Islands soccer official Costas Takkas, and ex-Venezuelan soccer official Rafael Esquivel.
Dearie said he would set an exact date for their trial in an order following the court hearing. The judge is also expected to hear a potential request for an even earlier trial date for at least one - Napout - of the defendants.

RIO DE JANEIRO Two days ahead of the opening ceremony at the Olympics, organizers say that 1.3 million tickets remained unsold, an indication that spectator demand for Rio has lagged behind previous summer Games.
As of Friday, 4.8 million tickets for the Games had been sold, out of around 6.1 million tickets on offer, the Rio Organising Committee told Reuters on Wednesday. Demand has been strong for sports such as basketball and swimming, the committee said.
Some 500,000 of the unsold tickets are for soccer matches. Many of those matches are scheduled to be played in stadiums in other Brazilian cities far from Rio.
Tickets for the Rio Games have been available since early 2015, but factors including a sluggish Brazilian economy and concerns about the presence of Zika virus in Brazil may have had an impact on both domestic and international demand.
A month before the London Games in 2012, 7 million tickets had already been sold, or more than 80 percent. Ultimately, more than 8 million were sold there.
Ahead of the Beijing Games in 2008, some 6.8 million tickets were put on sale and more than 95 percent were sold, according to an Olympic Committee report.
Rio organizers had initially planned to sell up to 7.5 million event tickets, but later pared back their estimate to closer to 6 million, citing factors including space limitations at event venues.
Ticket sales are an important generator of revenue for a city where around $12 billion has been spent preparing for the Games. Remaining tickets are still available to fans through the committee's website, Rio2016.com.

RIO DE JANEIRO Despite lingering issues with plumbing and laundry, athletes and training staff say the Olympic Village is much improved, nine days after blocked toilets and exposed wiring forced the Australian team to move.
Organizers hired around 600 people to work on repairing the 31-building complex housing more than 17,000 participants at the Rio de Janeiro Games and within days they had coaxed the Aussies back.
"At first we had some problems but they were fixed and we're happy with the place. The rooms are even bigger than in London (2012)," said Australian canoe coach Mike Druce on Tuesday.
Not everything is perfect though.
The Argentines are complaining about weak water pressure in the bathrooms while Brazilian handballer Jose Toledo said the laundry service was less than perfect.
Several Olympians also noted a film of dust in most rooms from the recently finished construction.
However, conditions are a far cry from those on July 24 that the Australians called "not safe or ready" for the Games which start on Friday.
Rio officials called the issues "teething troubles."
Most athletes had high praise for the Village kitchens with the exception of Portuguese gymnast Felipa Martins.
"I thought the food was so-so but maybe that's because we eat so well in Portugal," she said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil said on Tuesday it was deploying the military to patrol the emblematic tourist sites in Rio de Janeiro to guard against the "minimal" chance of an attack, though security at the Olympic stadium appeared slack three days before the Games.
Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes said deploying the military to the Christ the Redeemer statue and Sugarloaf Mountain would free up police to patrol other areas of the city during the Games, which run from Aug. 5 to Aug. 21.
Speaking at the inauguration of the center for international police cooperation, which allows countries competing in the Games to share information on security threats, Moraes said agents with handheld metal detectors would check visitors to the Christ the Redeemer statue, which sits atop the Corcovado mountain at the center of the city.
"The two (tourist) points where we'll deploy the armed forces are Corcovado and the Sugarloaf Mountain," Moraes told reporters.
The military will also patrol strategic points in Rio such as energy, water and telecommunications installations, airports and tram stations.
Concerns over possible attacks at the Games jumped last month after Brazil detained 12 people on suspicion of links to the Islamic State militant group. Police said they were monitoring some 100 suspected Islamist militants, particularly in the porous southern border region with Paraguay and Argentina.
However, the minister said that the chances of any attack were "minimal."
The security operation for the Games will include a total of 85,000 police and soldiers.
However, at the main Olympic stadium on Tuesday, an X-ray machine to scan visitors was not connected and there was no bar code scanner to check Olympic accreditation.
Organizers last week canceled the contract of the relatively unknown security firm, Artel, which was supposed to check credentials and bags at the entrance to stadiums, replacing them with military police reservists.
"As the people who were going to do this service are not here, the machine is turned off," said one reservist, who asked not to be identified, standing beside a metal detector. "We are going to see if by tomorrow they turn it on."
A Reuters reporter was able to walk around the Engenhao stadium, visiting the changing rooms and other areas, without any restrictions. The minister said that security would be tightened on Wednesday.
"We have already incorporated 2,000 of the 3,400 expected agents and we have until tomorrow to get them trained and operational. If there is any problem, it will be checked and fixed," the minister said.
Built for the 2007 Pan-American games, the Engenhao stadium has the capacity for up to 60,000 spectators, including temporary stands. It will host soccer between Wednesday and Sunday, and will be the venue for athletics from Aug. 12 onwards.

RIO DE JANEIRO A blanket ban on Russia at the Rio de Janeiro Games would have had devastating consequences, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said on Tuesday, defending his organisation's decision to allow some Russians to compete.
The IOC opted not to ban all Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics after revelations of a wide state-backed doping programme across many sports.
Instead it chose a set of criteria for athletes to meet, including a clean doping past and sufficient testing at international events, that so far has allowed more than 250 out of the original 387 Russian athletes to be cleared for Rio.
Bach, speaking at the IOC session, said preventing clean athletes from competing and treating them as "collateral damage" would have been wrong.
"This blanket ban of the Russian Olympic Committee has been called by some the 'nuclear option' and the innocent athletes would have to be considered as collateral damage," Bach said.
"Leaving aside that such a comparison is completely out of any proportion when it comes to the rules of sport, let us just for a moment consider the consequences of a 'nuclear option'. The result is death and devastation...
"The cynical 'collateral damage approach' is not what the Olympic Movement stands for."
Several anti-doping bodies, including the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), as well as those from the United States, Canada and Germany, among others, had called for a blanket ban.
They expressed disappointment following the IOC Executive Board's decision to allow some Russians to compete and accused the Games' ruling body of lacking the leadership and courage to punish Russia.

POLITICAL PRESSURE
Russia's Olympic Committee chief Alexander Zhukov said he considered the IOC decision to be "very fair" given what he said was the pressure from several countries to ban his nation.
"We are witnessing the enormous pressure put on the IOC by governments and political circles of certain countries," Zhukov said, without naming them. "We are witnessing direct interference of politics in sport."
He said it would be tragic if any of the 250-plus Russians awaiting a final green light from the IOC after being cleared to compete by the international federations, were now sent home.
"If Russian athletes already in Rio ... are forced to leave then that will be a real tragedy. It will be ruined fates and broken lives of athletes."
Bach received the backing of the IOC members at the session in Rio for the executive board's decision that was taken last month.
Eighty-four members supported the decision not to impose a blanket ban with only one -- Britain's Adam Pengilly -- voting against.
Not even Dick Pound of Canada, an outspoken critic of the decision not to implement a full ban, opposed Bach and the executive board on Tuesday.
"The arrow has left the bow," Pound said, adding that it made little sense to oppose a decision that had already been taken.
"It (discussion) was not bad. It was the first time we had a chance to do this. There is some disconnect and we will have to bridge that gap but it is doable," Pound said.
Bach also rejected allegations the IOC was not determined to fight doping, saying the anti-doping system needed complete restructuring.
"Engagement and not isolation is the key to build a more robust anti-doping system," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO Four years after finishing last at the London Olympics, the U.S. women's hockey team are hoping a revamped training program will help exorcise the ghost of that performance and perhaps earn a spot on the podium in Rio de Janeiro.
"A lot can happen within four years ... although we finished last, we're still writing our own script and come Aug. 6 we'll be writing a new chapter," said Katelyn Falgowski, a 27-year-old mid-fielder and three-time member of the U.S. Olympic squad.
The team have not reached an Olympic podium since 1984, but are currently ranked fifth in the world, an improvement some players attribute to a training schedule that required players to attend three weeks each month of practice in the years leading up to the Aug. 5-21 Rio Olympics.
"That's drastically different from what we've done," said Julia Reinprecht, a 25-year-old defender set to make her second appearance at an Olympic Games alongside her older sister, Katie, a mid-fielder.
Prior to the London Games, the team's practices were confined to more distinct blocks of time throughout the year, other than in the immediate buildup to the Games, she said.
The results have paid off with the team nabbing gold medals over the past three years in the Pan American Games, Champions Challenge and 2013 World League Round 2 played in Rio.
"What 2012 offers us is quite the experience," said Reinprecht. "I mean we finished last, there was a big learning element there."
The team's first match is on Saturday against frequent rival Argentina, which gives some advantage of familiarity, said Lauren Crandall, a 31-year-old defender who will be making her third Olympic appearance.
"It's going to be a high-energy game. Argentina is very talented, very fast," said Crandall. "This is international competition. We're at the Olympic Games and everyone's vying for a podium finish."

BERNE, Switzerland World number four Stan Wawrinka has pulled out of the tennis competition at this month's Rio Olympics because of injury.
"I am very sad because after Beijing and London I would have liked to experience my third Olympic Games in Brazil, unfortunately that will now not be possible," he said in a Swiss Tennis Federation statement on Tuesday.
Australia's Sam Groth is heading to Brazil after getting a late call as a replacement.
The fast-serving 28-year-old will be the fourth Australian in a men's singles draw missing the country's top two players after the controversial withdrawals of Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios.
The duo pulled out after being repeatedly criticized by Australia's Olympic team chef de mission for their conduct in the public arena.
World number 20 Tomic said he was too "busy" to compete at Rio while 18th-ranked Kyrgios bowed out claiming mistreatment by the Australian Olympic Committee.

NEW YORK A $150 million retractable roof that will keep the U.S. Open tennis championship's Arthur Ashe Stadium main court dry was displayed with great fanfare and a minor glitch at Flushing Meadows on Tuesday.
The technological wonder had a grand closing, as a crowd of reporters looked skyward on a sunny day as the translucent fabric, moving at the rate of 25 feet per minute, covered the world's largest tennis stadium in 5 minutes and 12 seconds.
Jeanne Ashe, wife of the late champion for whom the stadium is named, did the honors of hitting the button to close the roof and put the assembled audience in comfortable shade.
Tennis Hall of Famer Billie Jean King, for whom the National Tennis Center complex is named, was then summoned to hit the button to trigger the opening - but the roof did not budge.
On her third try, after a delay of over 10 minutes, the roof was again in motion and in five minutes was open over the stadium's 23,771 blue seats.
The delay was a bit embarrassing for officials who had been using the catch-phrase "redefine spectacular" about the high-tech achievement, but it was a minor hiccup as the new space age look of the stadium and prospects of relief from rain was a welcomed development.
U.S. Tennis Association Executive Director Gordon Smith put a positive spin on the delayed opening of the roof.
"It actually worked exactly like it was designed," Smith told reporters.
"There are 16 brake clamps that stop it. One sensor on one of those 16 said 'I'm slightly out of alignment' and it then sends a signal that says 'You need to reboot and check me out and make sure I'm OK.'
"That's what they did. It was fine. It behaved like it was designed to behave."
Tennis Center Chief Operating Officer Danny Zausner said the roof, an engineering challenge that took three years to complete, will continue to be tested daily ahead of the Aug. 29-Sept. 11 championship.
The new covering, which follows years of rain delays and postponements that often extended the year's final grand slam to an extra day, leaves the French Open as the only slam without a retractable roof, which they hope to put in place by 2020.
Besides keeping the court, players and spectators dry, the shape of the roof seems to have cut down the swirling wind that has often vexed players in the past.
Though refrigerated air is pumped into the stadium to manage humidity and help keep the temperature down when the roof is closed, Smith said: "We're not closing the roof for heat purposes, we're an outdoor tournament."

NEW YORK Former world number one Tiger Woods is taking on the role of U.S. tactician for next month's Ryder Cup against holders Europe, says captain Davis Love III.
Fourteen-times major winner Woods has been sidelined for almost a year as he recovers from multiple back operations and seems to have spent much of his time away from the circuit thinking about how the Americans can regain the trophy.
"He's been texting me some pairings and some groupings,"  Love told Sky Sports television of one of his vice-captains. "He's put a lot of thought into it and he's kind of our tactician.
"He's probably one of the most prepared guys when he shows up at a golf tournament. He's already picked his four wild cards... he knows who he wants to watch, who he wants to manage and who he'll get along well with."
U.S. Open winner Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, U.S. PGA champion Jimmy Walker, Brooks Koepka, Zach Johnson, JB Holmes and Brandt Snedeker currently occupy the automatic eight qualifying berths for the 12-man American team.
Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed, Matt Kuchar and Rickie Fowler are the next four players in the points list and look best-placed to receive a wild card pick.
Europe's top nine are Rory McIlroy, U.S. Masters champion Danny Willett, British Open winner Henrik Stenson, Chris Wood, Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Andy Sullivan and Matt Fitzpatrick.
The holders are currently loaded with rookies in the form of Willett, Wood, Cabrera-Bello, Sullivan and Fitzpatrick so captain Darren Clarke may prefer to go for experience with his three wild cards.
Ryder Cup stalwarts Lee Westwood (12th) and Martin Kaymer (13th) are high up the standings and will be hopeful of a pick.
Dane Soren Kjeldsen and Tyrrell Hatton of Britain are 10th and 11th respectively but the fact that they have never experienced a Ryder Cup match could count against them.
Europe's talisman Ian Poulter, who has won 14 points from a possible 18 in his career, will be missing this time because of arthritic problems in his right foot.
Clarke is due to name his wild card picks in the last week of August while Love will make his four selections next month.
The Ryder Cup, which will be played at Hazeltine, Minnesota, starts on Sept. 30.

NEW YORK The maker of the popular NBA 2K video game series on Tuesday won the dismissal of a potentially large damages claim in a lawsuit over its depiction of tattoos belonging to LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and other National Basketball Association stars.
U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan said Take-Two Interactive Software Inc cannot be held liable to the plaintiff Solid Oak Sketches LLC for statutory damages of as much as $150,000 per copyright infringement, a sum that in theory could reach billions of dollars.
Swain said Solid Oak can still pursue actual damages over New York-based Take-Two's alleged unauthorized incorporation into NBA 2K16 of eight tattoo designs that the plaintiff had licensed from various artists.
The works includes the words "Hold My Own" on James' left bicep, butterflies on Bryant's right bicep, and designs on the bodies of Eric Bledsoe, DeAndre Jordan and Kenyon Martin.
Take-Two has said it sold more than 4 million copies of NBA 2K16 in the first week after its release last Sept. 29.
Swain said U.S. copyright law imposed a "bright-line" rule precluding recovery of statutory damages when the first of a series of infringements occurred before the works in question are registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.
The judge said Solid Oak's 2015 registration came two years after Take Two's alleged first infringement when it released NBA 2K14, and that it did not matter that the game has been updated.
"When the same defendant infringes on the same protected work in the same manner as it did prior to the work's registration, the postregistration infringement constitutes the continuation of a series of ongoing infringements," she wrote.
Darren Heitner, a lawyer for Solid Oak, said in an interview: "The case will proceed, and we look forward to explaining why we are entitled to actual damages."
A Take-Two spokesman said the company does not in practice comment on legal matters.
Bryant and Martin have retired from NBA.
The case is Solid Oak Sketches LLC v. Visual Concepts LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-00724.

RIO DE JANEIRO A South Korean cyclist was slightly injured when he was hit by a car while training on the streets of Rio de Janeiro ahead of the Olympics Games which start on Friday, the federal traffic police said on Tuesday.
Kim Ok-cheol, 21, was struck by the rear view mirror of a car when he was training within the Tijuca national park in Rio and suffered scratches when he fell to the ground but did not need to be taken for treatment in hospital, police said.
"It was a minor incident with light scratches. He did not want to be taken to hospital," a spokesman for the traffic police, Jose Helio Macedo, told Reuters.
He said that police officers happened to be passing by the spot when the accident occurred. Traffic police will escort cyclists during the road race events.
The local organizing committee, Rio 2016, said the accident was a minor event and Tuesday was not an official training day for cycling events.
Kim was a bronze medalist at this year's Asian championships in the team pursuit.
The men's road race even starts on Saturday.

RIO DE JANEIRO They have played for Olympic gold in parks, next to car parks and on royal parade grounds, but at the Rio Games beach volleyball will actually be played -- on a beach.
Only once since the sport became part of the Olympic program in 1996 has beach volleyball, the most hedonistic of Olympic events, been staged on a genuine stretch of sand shared by sun worshippers and surfers.
With the exception of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, when the iconic Bondi Beach was the venue, beach volleyball has been contested on man-made surfaces to a backdrop of manufactured beach vibe.
Beach volleyball's Olympic debut came in an Atlanta suburb at Clayton County Park, while the Faliro Olympic Beach Volleyball Center used for the 2004 Athens Games popped up beside a car park.
The 2008 Beijing Olympic venue at Chaoyang Park was built on top of an old industrial complex while the 2012 Olympics site was constructed on Horse Guards Parade in the heart of London.
The United States, having invented the game, can claim to be the home of beach volleyball, but its soul lives in Brazil, and Copacabana Beach the altar where they come to worship.
The stretch of white sand watched over by the statue of Christ the Redeemer is probably the most famous beach in the world, making Copacabana the quintessential venue for the sport's showcase event.
Kerri Walsh Jennings has topped the podium at the last three Olympics but this will be the first time the American has gone for gold on an actual beach.
"Playing in Copa is amazing. The energy is electric and it absolutely does elevate play," said Walsh Jennings. "It is going to be amazing to play in front of such crazy, passionate fans. It is something we all relish."
While Walsh Jennings and new playing partner April Ross will be focusing on the serious business in Rio, Copacabana is braced for an Olympic beach party, with the action starting early in the day and running late into the evening, with several matches scheduled for a midnight start.

INCREDIBLE ATMOSPHERE
With the Samba and pounding surf providing a sunny soundtrack, beach volleyball is one of the hottest tickets in Rio.
"Brazil has so much passion for the game. Really it is going to be an incredible atmosphere down there, said Lauren Fendrick, who will partner Brooke Sweat in the other U.S. women's entry. "The energy, I think, is going to take level of play beyond what we have seen anywhere in the world up to this point."
The U.S. have dominated on Olympic sand, winning three of the five golds that have been contested in both the men's and women's competitions.
Ranked third in the world, 37-year-old Walsh Jennings,  nicknamed "Six Feet of Sunshine", and Ross will be among the favorites in Rio, along with the two Brazilian entries ahead of them.
Should Walsh Jennings get to the top of the podium again, she would emulate long-jumper Carl Lewis and discus thrower Al Oerter as the only athletes to have won four consecutive Olympic golds in the same individual event.
"Our goal is to play our best volleyball here in Rio, every single match come out and show up and be at our best," said Walsh Jennings, down-playing her chances of joining a very elite club. "We really don't think about the result. We just know how we want to play."

MELBOURNE If lacking in knowledge of advanced biomechanics, a degree in physics might help when chatting with American amateur Bryson DeChambeau, who believes his successful use of a single-length set of clubs might ultimately change the way players approach the game.
The 22-year-old casually drops complex equations into the usual golf jargon when discussing his swing, a finely calculated invention inspired by "The Golfing Machine", the Homer Kelley manual heavy on science in decoding one of the game's most elusive and confounding skills.
Years of slavish experimentation has produced a bag of identical length clubs with large grips that allow him to produce a consistent plane on his swing, whether driving off the tee or hitting off a fairway.
Heathen to traditionalists, the approach drew plenty of scepticism from instructors and colleagues.
That was until the Southern Methodist University senior won the U.S. Amateur title in August.
That followed his NCAA Championship in June, making him only the fifth player to win both the United States' amateur titles in the same year.
Arnold Palmer once remarked that golf is "deceptively simple and endlessly complicated".
Physics major DeChambeau describes his approach as simply "fun".
He and his long-time instructor Mike Schy started working on it when DeChambeau was 15.
"We looked through the book (The Golfing Machine) and worked out what would work where," he told Reuters in an interview at Melbourne's Huntingdale Golf Club on Saturday, where he was competing in the Australian Masters tournament.
"It was complete experimentation. We finally figured out what worked really well for me and lucky enough that there was a special component called the zero shifting motion where I was able to swing on the same plane. We built the swing around that and built the clubs around that.
"It's taken until now, I guess you could say. You're still trying to improve every day. It's kind of a fun thing, which I hope can help the game of golf.
"In regards to the swing, it's very personal, but the single-length set I think it could be very applicable to many people out there. I think it could change how starters, beginners play the game."
Apart from same-length clubs, DeChambeau is also fastidious about the balls he uses, rolling them in a salt solution to check on their centre of gravity.
"The heavy side will go to the bottom if it's off ... I do it with every ball," he said.
DeChambeau was grouped with Australia's Adam Scott in his opening round and the former world number one had no hesitation branding the Californian a potential "superstar" of the future.
DeChambeau plans to turn professional after playing next year's U.S. Masters and said he was enjoying his "internship" as an amateur, having delayed finishing his studies.
He was level with tournament favourite Scott on a two-under total of 211 after three rounds at Huntingdale Golf Club, five strokes behind the leader Matthew Millar, a local journeyman.
DeChambeau had to grind out a one-over 72 in windy conditions on Saturday and found at times that no amount of science could help in choosing the right clubs to play on the storied sandbelt course.
"I just didn't get much out of it today," he said.
"A couple of errors on a couple of holes, not getting the right clubs."
More detailed analysis was bound to happen later in the evening.
"I look at the imperfections of myself and what I can do better."

(The Sports Xchange) - For almost two weeks, Oklahoma City have been preaching relentlessly that they had to get better on defense. Yet, it has not materialized on the court in the form of consistent wins. On Friday, they saw what happens when a team puts defense first.
The New York Knicks came to town sporting that mindset and when they needed to get one stop to win a game, they did as they pulled out 93-90 victory at Chesapeake Energy Arena.
"We just wanted to get a stop," New York coach Derek Fisher said. "Doesn't really matter how you get into that position. It's a three-point game. In order to win, you have to get a stop."
Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony scored 25 points on nine of 20 shooting from the field and grabbed five rebounds. Arron Afflalo scored 14 points for New York and Lance Thomas came off to bench to score 12.
Thunder guard Russell Westbrook led all scorers with 34 points to go along with seven assists, seven rebounds and four steals. Dion Waiters added 16 points on 6-of-15 shooting from the floor.
The Knicks improved to 7-6 while the Thunder fell to 7-6.
Westbrook downplayed the team being frustrated at the way they have been playing since the injury to Kevin Durant sidelined the All Star for the past five games.
"We just have to find a way to put together some wins," Westbrook said. "That's about it."

'DIFFICULT OFFENSIVE NIGHT'
After trailing by 16 in the fourth quarter, the Thunder cut the lead to eight on Nick Collison's putback with 5:35 left. After Anthony knocked in a jumper, Enes Kanter answered with a rebound and putback on the other end.
But just as the Oklahoma City fans were starting to get loud, Afflalo hit a bucket from the corner and the Knicks were back up by 10 with 3:45 on the clock.
Oklahoma City were down 89-85 with 46 seconds left and Westbrook fouled Anthony, who missed both free throws. The Thunder got the ball with 32 seconds remaining and Westbrook got the ball to a wide-open Serge Ibaka, whose three-pointer from the corner rimmed out and Knicks rebounded.
Robin Lopez and Anthony followed with four free throws for the Knicks. However, Westbrook hit a jumper and three-pointer to cut the Thunder's deficit to three.
"You just never know what to expect when Russ has the ball," Anthony said. "He is coming down hill full speed. And you don't know if he is going to keep driving or put up a three.
"You have to keep all eyes on him. You just never know what to expect when it comes to Russ."
The Knicks turned the ball over and the Thunder had another chance to send the game into overtime, but shots from Westbrook and Waiters were both off the mark.
Oklahoma City dominated on the boards with a 49-36 advantage, but the Knicks held them to 38 percent shooting from the floor.
"I gave our guys a lot of credit as far as hanging in there," Thunder coach Billy Donovan said.
"The difference in the game was the three-point line. We really weren't able to make too many of ours. I was pleased with our guys continuing to fight and battle through a difficult offensive night."


LONDON The tennis world was already abuzz with the name John McEnroe well before Britain arrived to play the United States in the 1978 Davis Cup final in the Californian desert.
He had, after all, reached the Wimbledon semi-finals the year before as an 18-year-old qualifier, losing to Jimmy Connors, and repeated the feat at the 1978 U.S. Open.
But the wild-eyed left-hander had never been exposed to a Davis Cup singles rubber for the U.S. and eyebrows were raised when he ousted Arthur Ashe from the team to face Britain -- who had reached their first final since their heady days of 1936.
Not only that but McEnroe was drawn to play the opening rubber of the tie at Mission Hills against Britain's John Lloyd.
Lloyd's team mate Mark Cox, who was to lose the doubles with David Lloyd, remembers what followed vividly from the safety of his position on the court-side bench.
"I remember we were all quite excited to be facing McEnroe; he was the new young kid on the block," Cox, who will be watching in Belgium next week when Britain try to win the title for the first time since 1936, told Reuters.
"I thought he might be tight, maybe a bit nervous. But he served an ace on the first point. Kind of launched himself into the fray in quite spectacular fashion.
"He came out all guns blazing."
There was even a glimpse of the famous McEnroe temper which earned him the "Super-Brat" nickname after he was distracted by the voice of iconic British commentator Dan Maskell.
"Dan was talking from a balcony above the court and it wasn't enclosed and his lovely tones were drifting out to court," Cox said. "That caused something of a confrontation between Dan and McEnroe, Dan got the full Mac glare!
"Dan was the voice of Wimbledon and for this brash youngster to get into a confrontation with him was quite something."

'UP AGAINST GENIUS'
Unless Belgium have been hiding away a potential world beater, Britain will have less to fear when they arrive in Ghent next week for their first Davis Cup final since losing to the McEnroe-inspired Americans 37 years ago.
World number 16 David Goffin is a sweet ball-striker and their number two player Steve Darcis once beat Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon, but the task facing captain Leon Smith's side, boasting world number two Andy Murray, does not compare with the challenge facing Paul Hutchins' team in 1978.
McEnroe crushed Lloyd 6-1 6-2 6-2 and was equally ruthless when he demolished Buster Mottram 6-2 6-2 6-1 to give his team a winning 3-1 lead in the second singles.
"Reaching the Davis Cup final was the highlight of my career," Lloyd, who went on to captain the side, recalled in a BBC Radio interview this week.
"And to go up against McEnroe and get annihilated and be up against genius. I saw shots that I didn't think could be hit by another human being."
Hutchins, who captained the British 31 times and masterminded their run to the final, past a Czech team including a young Ivan Lendl and then arch-rivals Australia in the semis at Crystal Palace, said McEnroe already had an aura.
"I knew he would be really good but never imagined that good," he told Reuters. "Brash, confident and so talented were my thoughts sitting on the side of the court."
While the Americans had McEnroe, Britain's talented maverick was Mottram, who levelled the tie with a brilliant victory over Brian Gottfried from two sets down.
"I remember Buster beating Lendl in the quarter-final," Cox, who lost the doubles to Stan Smith and Bob Lutz, said.
"When Buster got his teeth into anyone in the Davis Cup he was like a barracuda, he was a very fine Davis Cup player."
Now Murray is the man his country relies on and seven-times grand slam champion McEnroe believes the Scot can do to Belgium what he did to Britain at Mission Hills.
"To me Britain should win," McEnroe said.
"It's set up for them. There will be pressure for Murray, but the way he handled it against Australia, he'll handle it again and win two singles."

Cleveland Cavaliers guard J.R. Smith has been accused of choking a 19-year-old student after the teenager jeered the basketball player's trade to Cleveland from the New York Knicks, the New York Daily News reported on Friday.
The alleged incident occurred in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan at about 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, the newspaper said.
Police said Smith has not been arrested, although they are investigating the reported incident. The National Basketball Association said it was "in the process of obtaining more information" about the situation. Smith's attorney said his client did nothing wrong.
The teen, Justin Brown, was with friends who admonished Smith for ignoring their request for a photo. "That's why New York kicked you out, yo!" Brown remarked, according to the News.
Smith, 30, was traded to the Cavaliers last season.
Brown told police that Smith pushed him against the exterior of the building and put his hands around Brown's neck, police sources told the newspaper.
"The accusation is completely false," Smith's lawyer, Alex Spiro, told Reuters.
Smith has played with four NBA clubs since coming into the league in 2004. He is averaging 8.6 points and 3.6 rebounds a game this season.

LPGA rookie Jang Ha-na took advantage of a late wobble by world number one Lydia Ko to grab a two-shot lead after the second round of the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida on Friday.
South Korean Jang, hunting her first title on the U.S. circuit after ending up second three times this year, birdied four of her first six holes before finishing birdie-birdie for a seven-under-par 65 at Tiburon Golf Club.
That left Jang at 10-under 134, two ahead of New Zealand teenager Ko who carded a 67 that was highlighted by eight birdies but damaged by a double-bogey at the par-four 15th and a bogey at the par-three 16th.
Twice major winner Cristie Kerr and fellow American Jennifer Song were a further stroke back at seven under after posting matching 69s.
For the fifth time in her rookie season, Jang holds the 36-hole lead but she does not want to look too far ahead.
"In the Marathon Classic, I played a playoff with Chella Choi ... I thought too much that I want to be champion," Jang, who is ranked 15th in the world and a six-times winner on the Korean LPGA Tour, told reporters.
"So I don't want to think about being leader."
Though Ko stumbled over the closing stretch, she maintained her grip in the race with Korean Park In-bee for 2015 LPGA Tour honours as she seeks her sixth victory of the season.

POLE POSITION
Ko is in pole position to clinch the LPGA Player of the Year award, the money list title and retain her number one ranking, while Park has a slight edge in the chase for the coveted Vare Trophy for best scoring average.
"It's right there," said Ko, who would clinch The Race To The CME Globe, which carries a $1 million bonus, with victory this week where the winner's check is for $500,000.
"My trainer and I always say, 'Hey, better every day.' It's what I try and work towards, too. If I keep getting better every day, it ends up being a few low scores."
Ko, who won last year's CME Group Tour Championship in a three-way playoff to land 2014 LPGA Rookie of the Year honours, shrugged off her double at the 15th where she hit a tree with her second shot.
"I played a little too cute," she said. "I should have taken my medicine."
Park, a winner of two major championships this year, returned a 69 to end the second round six strokes off the pace.
American Austin Ernst, who held a one-shot lead overnight after opening with a 66, triple-bogeyed the par-five first on the way to a roller-coaster 73 and a five-under total of 139.

LONDON Britain's Andy Murray can focus fully on next week's Davis Cup assignment in Belgium after Stanislas Wawrinka sent him packing from the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena on Friday.
The concluding round-robin match at the year-ender had become a straight knockout between the two players after Rafael Nadal had already sealed top spot in Ilie Nastase Group, and Wawrinka looked the sharper as he won 7-6(4) 6-4.
Earlier, Nadal spent two hours and 36 minutes beating fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 6-7(2) 6-3 6-4 to make sure he went into Saturday's semi-final against world number one Novak Djokovic with a 100 percent record so far this week.
Wawrinka will face Stan Smith Group winner Roger Federer, who like Nadal was unbeaten in group play.
Murray and Wawrinka were both guilty of numerous careless errors, Murray in a first-set tiebreak that he led 4-2.
His Swiss opponent then wobbled towards the end and nearly let slip a 5-2 lead, having to save two break points when he served for the match for a second time at 5-4.
World number two Murray, who smashed a frame in anger in the final game, said the proximity of next week's Davis Cup final on a claycourt in Ghent had not been a factor in his defeat.
"Way too many errors. Cheap ones, as well. Disappointing," the 28-year-old, who fell at the group stage for the second year running, told reporters.
"I didn't find it difficult not thinking about the Davis Cup final, to be honest. Obviously the only positive for me this week is I've come away from it injury-free.
"Now I have a couple more days to get ready for Belgium."
Murray was straight back on court afterwards, taking out his frustration in a knockup with coach Jonas Bjorkman on a deserted centre court as cleaners picked up litter in the stands.
With Nadal already in the semi-finals and Ferrer going home after two defeats, the clash of the Spaniards had no impact on the tournament but the packed arena was treated to the longest match of the tournament so far.
It looked as though Nadal might be in for an easy ride when he won 10 of the first 11 points, breaking Ferrer twice, but his 33-year-old opponent is renowned as one of the sport's best battlers and he hit back to win a tiebreak.
World number five Nadal, who had already beaten fourth-ranked Wawrinka and Murray, buckled down though and levelled the match before breaking the Ferrer serve in the final game of the contest.
"It should be like this," Nadal, who has been transformed since a modest summer, told reporters.
"Doesn't matter if I was qualified. For me the main goal is to try to arrive in good shape next year. Today was an opportunity to play against another of the top eight players of the world.
"I think I competed well. I won a very tough match. I think a very good match in terms of quality moments."
In the doubles, Ivan Dodig and world number one Marcelo Melo beat Marcin Matkowski and Nenad Zimonjic to set up a semi-final against Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea.
Second seeds Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau will face the Bryan twins after beating French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut.

American Kevin Chappell holed out from a greenside bunker to eagle the par-five 15th on the way to claiming a one-stroke lead after the second round of the RSM Classic in St. Simons Island, Georgia on Friday.
One off the pace overnight, Chappell coped well with strengthening winds as he fired a five-under-par 65 on the Seaside Course at Sea Island Golf Club in pursuit of his maiden PGA Tour title.
The 29-year-old Californian also recorded four birdies and a lone bogey to post an 11-under total of 131, to stand one ahead of Swede Freddie Jacobson and American Kevin Kisner.
Jacobson carded a five-under 67 on the Plantation Course while Kisner, the overnight leader who is also bidding for a first victory on the PGA Tour, returned a three-under 67 on the Seaside layout.
American Kyle Stanley was alone in fourth at nine under after shooting a four-birdie 67 on the Seaside Course.
Chappell, who has twice been a runner-up on the PGA Tour, was elated with his eagle at the 15th after not benefiting from what he had viewed as a well-struck approach from the right rough.
"I thought I hit a pretty good second shot there," Chappell told Golf Channel. "The wind obviously knocked it down and I just told myself, 'Hit the bunker shot harder than you want to.'
"Obviously I hit it hard enough," he said with a grin about his hole-out from 45 yards. "The wind blew a lot harder today and we are very fortunate the course is in great shape.
"It's soft so it makes some of the fairways play wider than they are, so you can get away with some missed shots as long as you are playing the wind properly."
British Open champion Zach Johnson, the American world number 10 who is the highest-ranked player in the field, posted a second successive 70 to end the day right on the cut line, a distant nine strokes off the pace.
Also advancing to the weekend after carding consecutive 70s was tournament host and next year’s United States Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III.

The globe-trotting LPGA Tour will feature 34 tournaments, two more than this year, in 15 countries on its schedule for 2016 with record total prize money of $63.1 million, Commissioner Michael Whan said on Friday.
The season tees off on Paradise Island in the Bahamas from Jan. 28-31 before moving on to Ocala, Florida, then Australia, Thailand and Singapore in a whirlwind start to a season that ends with the Nov. 17-20 CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida.
Fourteen new events have been added in the last five years, strengthening a tournament schedule that will also include stops in England, Brazil, France, China, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Canada and Mexico.
Television coverage has been significantly upped from this year and six events in 2016 will benefit from network TV broadcasting in the United States over the weekend.
"Our team's focus has exclusively shifted from securing new events to enhancing the ones we have on the schedule," Whan said in a statement.
"Increasing purses, number of weeks on network TV and creating more exposure for our events and players are the short-term goals we have set."
The first women's major of the season, the ANA Inspiration at Rancho Mirage, California, will be held from March 31-April 3.
The KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Sammamish, Washington takes place from June 9-12, with the U.S. Women's Open to be played at CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin, California from July 7-10.
Woburn Golf and Country Club in England will host the Women's British Open from July 28-31 before the fifth and final major of the year, the Evian Championship, is staged in Evian-les-Bains in France from Sept. 15-18.
The 2016 LPGA Tour's total purse of $63.1 million represents an increase of $4 million from this year.

LOS ANGELES NBA champions last season and unbeaten so far in their 2015-16 campaign, the Golden State Warriors are again relying on remarkable resilience, unwavering player trust and clutch three-point shooting down the stretch.
Twice trailing by 23 points and down by 10 with less than five minutes left against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night, the Warriors somehow found a way to prevail 124-117 at Staples Center and extend their perfect record to 13-0.
Golden State need just two more wins to match the best start ever to an NBA season, and no one in the league would bet against them given the extraordinary level of trust established by a roster that has barely changed since last season.
"Our confidence, our chemistry, the way we play ... it's definitely a carry-over from our championship run last year," Warriors reserve shooting guard Brandon Rush told Reuters after his team had beaten the Clippers for a second time this season.
"There's definitely a big comfort level there. We run more on instinct with what our coaching staff want from us.
"It's pretty much the same team we had last season, the same guys, so we know exactly where guys are going to be at, and what plays we are going to run."
Rush is a veteran of seven years in the league but being part of a team riding a perfect 13-0 run is certainly uncharted territory for him."It feels really good," the 30-year-old smiled. "We are focused every game when we step on the court, and we play real hard and we play without selfishness."

NEVER-SAY-DIE
The Clippers know all about Golden State's never-say-die attitude after squandering comfortable leads against them to lose both of their games against them this season, but Thursday's comeback by the Warriors left them stunned.
"You just have to tip your hat to them," said Clippers reserve guard Jamal Crawford, the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year in 2010 and 2014.
"They've been in that situation before and they always seem to weather the storm. We came out on fire, we were up by 23 two different times but they didn't get rattled. They just kept playing."
Leading the way once again for Golden State was reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry, who scored a game-high 40 points on 11-of-22 shooting, including three threes in the final quarter.
"He's a problem, he really is," Crawford said of the daunting challenge of trying to defend Curry, who is blessed with one of the purest shooting strokes in the league.
"At this point, he's starting to see every defense - whether it's trapping or whatever.
"The things people don't see is when we do trap, they have good pieces around him, whether it's Draymond (Green) or Klay (Thompson) to make a play. (Andre) Iguodala, whoever it might be that night, they do a good job getting them going."
Should Golden State win their next two games, at home to the Chicago Bulls on Friday and against the Nuggets in Denver on Sunday, they would match the 15-0 season starts made by the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and the 1993-94 Houston Rockets.
"They believe in themselves and they believe in what we are doing," Warriors interim head coach Luke Walton said of his team after they had outscored the Clippers 39-26 in the fourth quarter. "There was never any panic on our bench.
"We had early foul trouble with Steph (Curry) and Draymond (Green) that obviously hurt, but when they were on the bench, they were cheering for the guys that were in.
"It was a great all-round team win and once again showed what type of character these guys have," added Walton, who has taken over coaching duties from Steve Kerr while he recovers from back surgeries.
The Warriors capped a 67-win season in 2014-15 by clinching their first championship title in 40 years with a 4-2 series victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals.

DUBAI Less than a decade ago Andy Sullivan was stacking shelves in a provincial British supermarket but now the 28-year-old father is 36 holes from a fourth victory on golf’s European Tour and a further $1.33 million in prize money.
The ebullient Sullivan carded a second straight 66 on Friday to reach halfway at the DP World Tour Championship – the European circuit’s season finale – on 12-under 132 to lead by one and stands four ahead of tournament favorite Rory McIlroy.
Such exploits are far removed from his amateur days, when he would work the early shift at the Asda supermarket in his home town of Nuneaton before turning professional in 2011.
“This is my dream and I've always wanted to do it,” Sullivan told reporters when asked why he played so often with a smile.
“If I can't enjoy that, what can I enjoy? If I can't enjoy it, I'd best go do something else. Go back to stacking shelves.”
Sullivan has dropped just one shot over two rounds on Dubai’s earth course, which contrasts with a topsy-turvy 2015 that has included three tournament wins - two in South Africa and another in Portugal – plus 10 finishes outside the top 60.
That inconsistency means he is taking nothing for granted ahead of Saturday’s third round.
“There's a lot of good guys going to be chasing me, so for me it's just try and do what I did today, be patient and try to play my game and not worry about anyone else,” said Sullivan.
His cause has been helped by “Team Sully”, a group of about 30 friends and family from Nuneaton who have been providing vociferous support in Dubai.
“It's probably a key part of me playing well this week because they just keep going,” added Sullivan.
"Even when you start hitting a few wayward shots, things start going, the adrenaline gets going and absolutely fantastic.
“They have followed me about six or seven times this year and every time they have been there, I've done pretty well. So I think I am going to have to start paying for them to come out every week now.”

Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals became the youngest unanimous winner of Major League Baseball's Most Valuable Player Award, joining Josh Donaldson of the Toronto Blue Jays in claiming 2015 MVP honors on Thursday.
Harper, who was 22 at the end of the National League regular season when the vote was taken, received all 30 first-place votes from Baseball Writers' Association of America members after batting .330, slugging 42 home runs and driving in 99.
The left-handed hitting outfielder, MLB's Rookie of the Year in 2012, also became the first MVP to win representing a Washington franchise, including two incarnations of the American League Washington Senators.
Donaldson, traded to Toronto by the Oakland Athletics before the season, thrived with the Blue Jays, helping them end a 22-year absence in the postseason by claiming the American League East crown.
The third baseman clouted 41 home runs, drove in 123 runs for the high-powered Toronto attack, and batted .297.
"It's amazing," Donaldson, 29, told MLB TV. "I have to thank my teammates.
"Honestly, our team was so great, I was very blessed to be in the situation I was put in and I'm very thankful and I felt like I was able to take advantage of a lot of the opportunities that were put in front of me."
Harper, sidelined in previous seasons due to injuries suffered through his aggressive play in the outfield, enjoyed an injury-free season in 2015.
"To be on the field, that's the main goal," Harper said.
"I want to be able to do the things I can for my city, my town and that's DC. Do the things every single day that I can to give back to them."
Finishing second in the AL was Mike Trout, who was 23 when he won the 2014 MVP Award. The Angels' Trout has finished runner-up in his three other major league seasons.
Lorenzo Cain of the World Series champion Kansas City Royals was third.
Paul Goldschmidt of the Arizona Diamondbacks was second to Harper, with Cincinnati Reds' Joey Votto third.
Harper, whose fiery on-field persona has made him a target for opposing fans, said that fuels his performance.
"I enjoy getting booed when I go to places," Harper said. "And it makes me thrive, it makes me play well.
"I'm excited about what's in the future for DC. Very excited to get going again next year."


BOSTON Massachusetts would prohibit people under the age of 21 from playing paid fantasy sports games under a proposed set of regulations for the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar industry laid out on Thursday by state Attorney General Maura Healey.
The proposals would also ban fantasy competitions based on college sports, prohibit promotions of paid fantasy sports on high school and college campuses and bar professional athletes, agents and others connected to pro sports from taking part in paid fantasy contests related to their sports.
The fantasy sports business, led by DraftKings and FanDuel, has drawn increasing regulatory scrutiny over the past few weeks with state regulatory officials debating whether the paid daily games are gambling.
"These are games that you carry around with you in your pocket and lose money at the touch of a button," said Healey, who served as co-captain of Harvard's basketball team and went on to play two years of professional basketball in Europe. "This is an important step to protect consumers here in Massachusetts."
The proposals must be submitted to the secretary of state and will be subject to a public comment period before taking effect.

UNDER FIRE IN NEW YORK, NEVADA
Massachusetts' approach is more restrained than that taken by New York state, whose attorney general on Tuesday sought a court injunction to shut down DraftKings and FanDuel, calling the games "plainly illegal."
Healey said it is unclear whether the contests are illegal under state law and noted that other state authorities, including the legislature or gaming commission, could take other steps to rein in the games in Massachusetts. The state has the ninth-largest population of fantasy sports players, according to a survey by Eilers Research.
A spokesman for Boston-based DraftKings called the steps "thoughtful and comprehensive" and said the company would immediately begin taking steps to comply with the proposed rules.
"We appreciate that, in addition to Attorney General Healey, a number of state regulators and other authorities are taking a reasoned approach to the Fantasy Sports industry that considers the interests of sports fans," DraftKings said in a statement.
FanDuel did not immediately respond to a requests for comment.
Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online. Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey.
Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game, have developed over the past decade. Players draft teams in games played in just one evening or over a weekend.
Healey, a Democrat, and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican, have differed on whether the games are gambling or contests of skill. Baker last week said he played a free version of a DraftKings game on his cell phone and concluded it was a game of skill.
NEW YORK A newly filed class action claims that FanDuel and DraftKings could not have become billion-dollar businesses had it not been for the help of the credit card industry, which enabled players to enter online fantasy sports contests.
The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court on behalf of FanDuel and DraftKings players nationwide, accuses, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and other defendants of participating in a racketeering scheme to facilitate illegal gambling operations.
In addition to DraftKings, FanDuel and the credit card companies, the class action names banks that issued credit cards used by the lead plaintiff, as well as the companies that processed the transactions.
According to the complaint, the sports sites’ co-defendants “knew or should have known” that DraftKings and FanDuel were online gambling sites under New York law. Nevertheless, the suit alleges, the banks, credit card companies and payment processors profited from the sites’ operation by collecting transaction fees from players who used credit cards.
The class action demands restitution of all the money DraftKings and FanDuel players have lost as well as all fees paid to the credit card companies, banks and processors. Damages can be trebled under federal racketeering law.
DraftKings and FanDuel both require users to agree to arbitrate claims against the sites. It is not clear whether players will be able to evade those mandatory arbitration provisions in class actions against the site.
This suit is not the first time that the credit card industry has been dragged into the brouhaha over daily sports fantasy sites.
In a filing last week in New York State Supreme Court, DraftKings alleged that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman instructed the payment processors Vantiv and PayPal to stop accepting payments from the site’s New York customers. DraftKings claimed Schneiderman threatened to take legal action against Vantiv and PayPal if they did not comply.
Vantiv is named as a defendant in the new class action, as is the processor Paysafecard.com. PayPal is not named.
The suit is the first to bring claims against credit card companies and card issuers on behalf of FanDuel and DraftKings customers, according to plaintiffs’ lawyer Hunter Shkolnik of Napoli Shkolnik.
“FanDuel and DraftKings would have been just a nice idea for these scammers if they didn’t take credit cards,” Shkolnik said.
A representative of DraftKings declined to comment, as did American Express and JPMorgan Chase, one of the banks named as a defendant.
A MasterCard spokesman said the company is reviewing the class action but, in general, works to ensure its cards are used only for legal transactions and consults with merchants' banks if questions arise. Representatives from FanDuel, Visa, Vantiv, Paysafecard and Capital One did not respond to requests for comment.

LONDON Roger Federer's enduring brilliance and his sheer hatred of losing allowed him to withstand a stunning fightback by Kei Nishikori and remain undefeated at the ATP World Tour Finals on Thursday.
The 34-year-old Swiss maestro was on auto-pilot when he led 4-1 in the second set, having snatched an absorbing opener, but needed every shot in his formidable armoury to eventually claw out a 7-5 4-6 6-4 victory.
Japan's Nishikori had looked the more likely winner after reeling off five consecutive games to take the six-times former champion into a deciding set, but his stirring efforts proved in vain as Federer squeezed home.
Federer topped Stan Smith Group with a 100 percent record -- the ninth time in 14 consecutive appearances at the elite event he has won all three of his round-robin matches.
World number one Novak Djokovic, beaten emphatically by Federer on Tuesday, joined the Swiss in the semi-finals when he beat Tomas Berdych 6-3 7-5 in the evening match at the O2 Arena.
The Serb, bidding for a fourth straight title at the season-ender, could have qualified with a three-set defeat, but took no chances in a businesslike display to finish runner up in the group and set up a clash with a resurgent Rafael Nadal.
Federer will play either Andy Murray or Stanislas Wawrinka who complete the round-robin matches in the Ilie Nastase group on Friday.
Nishikori bowed out, having only managed to beat Berdych, but he got a ringing endorsement from the 34-year-old Federer.
"It's amazing what he's able to produce on the court. Today was another showcase of that, how he's able to return second serves, staying on top of the baseline...drilling forehands and backhands up the line. It was impressive," Federer said of the 2014 U.S. Open champion.
Seventeen-times grand slam champion Federer had already sealed a semi-final spot before walking on court on Thursday, but there was never a chance of him letting up.
He jumped into a 3-1 lead before 26-year-old Nishikori began striking the ball with real venom, breaking twice in a row.
Federer squared the set at 4-4 with some rock-solid baseline play wearing down Nishikori.
Nishikori had a point to set up a tiebreak at 5-6 but after a superb cat-and-mouse rally, Federer threaded a backhand down the line. Federer pounced on set point, forcing an error.
Federer was in full flow in the second set, leading 4-1, but Nishikori refused to slink away quietly and took the next five games with some delightful shot-making.
His crucial break at 4-4 came courtesy of an ugly forehand swipe from Federer who hit the ball several metres out with the court at his mercy.
Federer looked tired and tetchy early in the third, even offering an expletive, but crucially hung in from 0-40 down to hold serve, before breaking to move 4-1 ahead.
Again Nishikori stormed back to 4-4, but this time Federer steadied down, found four first serves in the nick of time, then broke for the match with a winning smash.
With a maximum of two matches left in a season which has already brought six titles, Federer said he is in the mood to go out on a high.
"I've got the perfect schedule. I'm off before the semis, which is huge. Now you're looking at potentially a maximum of two more matches and the season's over then," he said.
"It's going to be tough in the sense to win. But for the body, I'm in an ideal situation looking at the semi-final."
In doubles action defending champions and top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan saved five match points against Jamie Murray and John Peers -- 6-7(5) 7-6(5) 16-14 to scrape into the semi-finals.

LONDON Rafa Nadal will be pose a significant grand slam threat again next year after showing signs of returning to his best, according to two of the Spaniard's greatest rivals.
Spaniard Nadal slumped to 10th in the world rankings this year after a crisis of confidence and form, but since a third-round defeat at the U.S. Open by Italian Fabio Fognini he has rediscovered his old spark.
So far this week at the ATP World Tour Finals he has beaten world number four Stanislas Wawrinka and number two Andy Murray, without dropping a set to reach the semi-finals with a match to spare, where he will face world number one Novak Djokovic.
Serbia's Djokovic, who trails Nadal 23-22 but has won all three matches this year, says the 29-year-old is over his slide.
"It's a fact that he's been playing better and he's been raising his level ever since U.S. Open," Djokovic told reporters after his victory over Tomas Berdych on Thursday.
"You can feel that he's starting to get comfortable on the court, starting to play better.
"The couple of matches, first couple of matches he played here against Wawrinka and Murray showed that, showed that he feels more confident, shows that he's starting to miss less, serve efficiently, use his forehand much better."
Seventeen-times major champion Roger Federer has suffered at the hands of Nadal more than any other player, losing 23 of their 34 contests, and fully expects the Mallorcan to continue his form into 2016, providing he stays fit.
"Maybe for his standard it's not the best season. What is he going to finish, top five? It's still a good season," said the Swiss. "Everybody would take that except maybe a few players at this tournament. The rest would all love to be in his shoes.
"I think he's going to get stronger. With some time to practice and reassess his game, he's going to be tough to beat in Australia. I believe that."

Kevin Kisner took advantage of home comforts and a receptive layout to maintain his sizzling early season form and surge one shot clear in Thursday's opening round of the RSM Classic in St. Simons Island, Georgia.
The 31-year-old American, who came close to winning a maiden PGA Tour title at the elite WGC-HSBC Champions in China earlier this month before finishing second, fired a sparkling seven-under-par 65 on the Plantation Course at Sea Island Golf Club.
Kisner eagled the par-five eighth, his penultimate hole, to end the day one ahead of compatriots Jim Herman, Kyle Stanley, Kevin Chappell, Scott Stallings, Jeff Overton, Tom Hoge, Canadian David Hearn and South Korea's Kim Si-woo.
Herman, Stanley, Chappell, Stallings and Kim all carded six-under 66s on the Plantation Course while Overton and Hoge returned six-under 64s on the Seaside Course.
Kisner, a runner-up four times on the PGA Tour without yet claiming a breakthrough victory, was delighted to make a fast start at a venue where he owns a vacation home.
"I probably haven't put as much pressure on myself this week," Kisner told Golf Channel after a round that also included five birdies. "It's kind of a home game and we have a bunch of family and friends and we are just all hanging out.
"I haven't really worked on it (his game) that much but that's kind of when things go crazy and you play well so we'll see what happens."
Kisner, who was the 36-hole leader at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai before finishing two shots behind Scotland's Russell Knox, feasted on a generous set-up at the Plantation Course.
"There were a lot of birdie opportunities and I was happy to cap it off (with eagle)," he said. "I could reach a couple of them (the par-fives in two) which always helps me.
"They set it up pretty easy for us, I felt like, with the inclement forecast tomorrow. Hopefully tomorrow's set-up at Seaside is OK with the big winds that are forecast."
British Open champion Zach Johnson, the world number 10 who is the highest-ranked player in the field, opened with a two-under 70 on the Plantation layout.
Tournament host Davis Love III, who played with his 21-year-old son Dru on the Seaside Course, also carded 70, a score matched by his amateur son.

LONDON Serbia's Novak Djokovic clinched his place in the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals when he beat Tomas Berdych 6-3 7-5 in his last round-robin match on Thursday.
The world number one required one set to guarantee the runners-up spot in the Stan Smith Group behind unbeaten section winner Roger Federer who earlier beat Kei Nishikori.
Djokovic will face Rafael Nadal in the last four on Saturday with six-times champion Federer up against either Stanislas Wawrinka or home favourite Andy Murray.
Djokovic, bidding for a fourth consecutive title at the year-ender which has been hosted at London's O2 Arena since 2009, was well beaten by Federer on Tuesday to end a three-year unbeaten sequence on indoor courts.
But he bounced back to take the opening set with a couple of service breaks and, although far from his best, the Serb did enough to finish the contest in straight sets.
Czech Berdych's only chance of qualifying for the semis was to beat Djokovic in straight sets, although with two wins in 22 matches against him it was always a tall order.

PHILADELPHIA Lawyers representing some former NFL players urged a federal appeals court on Thursday to scrap the league's $1 billion concussion settlement because it does not cover potential victims of a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated blows to the head.
The deal should include future payments for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease found in a growing number of players after their deaths, the lawyers told the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.
The settlement unfairly favors currently injured retirees and ignores a potential 19,000 players who have yet to be diagnosed with neurological diseases, critics of the deal claim.
About 5,000 players are part of a class-action lawsuit that contends the National Football League was deceptive in hiding the dangers of concussive brain injuries.
The current deal, approved by April by Federal District Court Judge Anita Brody, provides payments of up to $5 million for former players diagnosed with certain neurological disorders. It also provides medical monitoring and concussion education.
About 99 percent of the class members accepted the deal, meaning they have not opted out. If approved in its current form, the settlement could cost the NFL $1 billion.
The small number of dissenters say it is a mistake to not include CTE and its symptoms, which include suicidal thoughts.
Autopsies found that some former NFL players who have committed suicide, including Junior Seau in 2012 and Adrian Robinson in 2015, had contracted CTE.
While CTE is currently definitively diagnosed after death, some scientists believe that within five to 10 years, better methods will be developed to identify it more readily.
Attorney Steven Molo, a lawyer for the objecting players, called CTE the "soundpiece" of the original complaint.
"A settlement like this, where there is this future claims issue, should account for the evolution of science,” said Molo. "We should at least be able to account for that, and here, this settlement doesn’t."
Samuel Issacharoff, a lawyer for the settling players, argued that the settlement was fair in light of what was known about how playing football affects players' long-term health.
"This happens in every car accident case," he said. "I’m injured today. It may turn out my back will deteriorate in five years, but I have to accept a settlement today or not.
"These settlements are not kept open on the grounds there may be better MRIs in five years that can detect some kind of latent condition that right now hasn’t manifested itself."
Paul Clement, a prominent Washington, D.C. lawyer representing the NFL, also argued in favor of the accord, which he called "fair, reasonable and more than adequate."
Clement said the settlement offered "good value," noting that out of the entire group of plaintiffs, “less than 1 percent is objecting, less than 1 percent is opting out.”

American Austin Ernst seized a one-shot lead after the opening round of the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida on Thursday while Lydia Ko strengthened her grip in the race for 2015 LPGA Tour honors.
Ernst, in pursuit of her second victory on the LPGA circuit, birdied her last two holes to break clear of a congested leaderboard as she fired a six-under-par 66 in the $2 million event at Tiburon Golf Club.
That left the diminutive 23-year-old Ernst a stroke in front of South Korea's Lee Mi-hyang, with twice major winner Cristie Kerr lurking among a group of six who opened with 68s.
Level with LPGA veteran Kerr were her fellow Americans Brittany Lincicome, Jennifer Song, Gerina Piller and Jaye Marie Green, and South Korean Kim Sei-young.
Lurking three strokes back was world number one Ko, after the New Zealander birdied three of her last seven holes to move into contention for her sixth LPGA victory of the season.
Ernst, who won her first LPGA title in a playoff for last year's Portland Classic, finished in style with a birdies at the par-five 17th and par-four last, where she nearly holed out with a five-wood approach from 192 yards.
"It almost went in," a smiling Ernst told reporters after hitting 17 of 18 greens in regulation. "The crowd got pretty wild like it rolled right over the edge. "So that was nice ... to have a little tap-in birdie."
Ko, back in action this week after taking a fortnight's break, is in pole position to clinch the LPGA Player of the Year award, the money list title and retain her number one ranking, and was in good position for all three after opening with a 69.
However, South Korea's Park In-bee, a winner of two major championships this season, is in close pursuit and she launched her bid for further LPGA honors by carding 71.
Park stands second in both the money list and the Player of the Year points standings, and leads the way in the hunt for the coveted Vare Trophy with a scoring average this season of 69.433, just ahead of Ko (69.449).
Either Ko or Park would clinch The Race To The CME Globe, which carries a $1 million bonus, with victory this week where the winner's cheque is for $500,000.
"Even if it doesn't exactly go the way I would love it to by the end of Sunday, I think I've just got to be pleased and proud with the way this year has gone," said Ko, 18, who won her first major crown at the Evian Championship in September.

BRUSSELS Next week's Davis Cup final between Belgium and Great Britain will go ahead with increased security in the wake of the Paris attacks, which involved Brussels-based jihadists, organizers said on Thursday.
The British team, featuring Andy and Jamie Murray, are bidding to win the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936 and will face Belgium, who have never won the competition, on clay in the city of Ghent.
Tennis Vlaanderen, which administers tennis in the region, said it had already talked to the interior minister, police and independent security experts.
"There will be measures taken, some of them visible, some not," a spokeswoman said, without giving details.
Belgium, whose team include David Goffin and Steve Darcis, are appearing in their first Davis Cup final for 111 years -- when they were beaten by the British Isles.

ZURICH Russia's World Cup chief said on Thursday that Swiss and U.S investigators looking into corruption in global soccer have not been in contact with him and he had no doubt the competition would go ahead in Russia in 2018.
FIFA's award of the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and to Qatar in 2022 is one of the strands under scrutiny by U.S. and Swiss authorities carrying out investigations into the activities of some of the officials of the world soccer body.
But Alexei Sorokin, chief executive for World Cup 2018, told  Reuters in an interview that neither the relevant Swiss nor U.S. authorities had even been in touch with his committee.
"We have not been contacted by a single official, be it from Switzerland or the U.S. or from any other country," he said at the International Football Arena conference at FIFA  headquarters, adding that he knew of the investigations only from the media.
Sorokin said that Russia had cooperated with FIFA's own investigation, which was led by U.S lawyer Michael Garcia.
"We went through an investigation at the request of FIFA, by the appropriate FIFA committee. The findings are public. To the best of our efforts we complied. We submitted everything that was required. We spoke to officials conducting these investigations. We couldn’t do more, so we think the matter is effectively over," he said.    Swiss investigators declined to comment on Sorokin's remarks. U.S investigators were not immediately available.
Buffeted by scandals over the last few years, FIFA was thrown into turmoil in May by the U.S. indictments of 14 soccer officials, including two FIFA vice-presidents, and sports marketing executives for alleged corruption.
With 11 of the 22 men who voted to back Russia and Qatar in the December 2010 vote having been banned or placed under investigation, some critics have raised the issue of a possible re-vote.
But Sorokin said he regarded the issue of whether the World Cup might be taken away from Russia as over.
"We are organizing the World Cup in Russia, whether someone has an attitude towards that or not. It will be in Russia in 2018," he said.
"It was the will of the then deciding body in FIFA ... we still think that we had a very good, sound bid. We had a great concept and story to tell and we are implementing it now," he said.
"We are so far on in the preparation now that we don't understand these discussions - about whether it went to Russia justly or not," he added.
Sorokin said Wednesday’s decision by the World Anti Doping Agency to suspend Russia’s anti-doping agency, after an independent commission report that uncovered evidence of state-sponsored doping and cover-ups, would have no negative influence on the World Cup preparations.
"We don't see it impacting the World Cup. Our officials and international officials have stated recently that all issues could be resolved by means of joint efforts, there is nothing tragic going on, nothing irreversible going on. FIFA has its own anti-doping policy, we certainly adhere to that," he said.
"The CEO also said that even before the attacks on Paris on Friday, World Cup organizers were working on a detailed security plan.
"As part of our efforts, our country is preparing a comprehensive security strategy, it has been serious from the very start, it has been taken very seriously by all appropriate government agencies. I don’t think that it could be any more serious. The threats have always been taken into account," he said.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado Russia's sporting reputation was in tatters and drug cheats around the world put on notice on Wednesday as an emboldened World Anti-Doping Agency vowed to step up the war on performance-enhancing drugs.
WADA capped a big fortnight for their cause, and a miserable one for Russia, by suspending the country's anti-doping agency on the back of an independent commission report that uncovered evidence of state-sponsored doping and cover-ups.
The suspension of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) completed a non-compliance hat-trick.
The Moscow laboratory implicated in the cover-up has been decertified, while the Russian athletics federation (ARAF) was banned last week by the world governing body (IAAF).
The commission, led by former-WADA chief Dick Pound, generated plenty of buzz at Wednesday's board meeting as the world-doping authority signaled a possible change in the way it does business going forward.
"I'm not sure they (WADA) realized they had the muscle until we got our teeth into some reliable evidence and followed up on it and came out with a report with recommendations," said Pound.
"Maybe that's the new WADA. Maybe we could have gotten there sooner if we had known how to deal with the kind of information that was coming from whistle blowers.
"Once we got some hard evidence, some audio, visual recordings, there you are now we've got something and we know where to go and how to pursue it. Maybe that's WADA II."
While Russia and their athletics program have been in the WADA crosshairs, Pound has repeatedly made it clear that it is not the only country, and athletics not the only sport, with doping issues.
The foundation board heard from several members urging the global agency to do more and expand its investigations.
Beckie Scott, a Canadian cross-country Olympic champion and chair of the WADA athlete committee, told the board that many athletes have asked her why the commission was focused solely on Russia and Russian athletics.
By the time the day-long meeting had concluded, the board had endorsed moves for WADA to look at ways to strengthen its ability to conduct international investigations.
President Sir Craig Reedie announced he would go to governments seeking additional money to fund probes and then ask the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which set up WADA, to match those donations.
"There is little doubt investigation is certainly one of the ways forward," Reedie told Reuters.
"We're always asked to do more with limited funds and now this is a big step forward.
"That's why I specifically said go to the government first they are keen on it, it would appear, now please put your hands in your pockets and let's have some additional resources.
"If you are going to do proper investigations you need to employ the correct people and it's expensive."
Pound put a price tag of at least $1 million on investigations similar to the one just completed and finding the money to aggressively pursue drug cheats will be hard.
WADA has an operating budget of $31 million and will eat up $500,000 of its reserve fund this year to stay alive.
"Lots and lots of people said today 'You need to do more investigations'," said Reedie. "Nobody has turned around and said 'By the way, this is how we are going to pay for it'."

DUBAI Rory McIlroy chipped in from the bunker on the final hole of his first round of the DP World Tour Championship on Thursday to be within two strokes of the lead and level with Danny Willett, his main rival to be Europe’s top player of 2015.
Four-time major winner McIlroy and Willett are two of eight players to card a four-under 68 on Dubai's earth course, two strokes behind the leading quartet of Germany’s Martin Kaymer, Australia’s Marcus Fraser and English duo Ian Poulter and Andy Sullivan.
McIlroy, 26, was fortunate to end the day on the fringes of the leaderboard after twice finding bunkers on the 18th before holing from the sand to pick up an unlikely birdie.
“It's one of those ones where all I needed to do was splash it out, land it on the top of the hill and have it trundle on down to the hole,” the world number three told reporters.
“I knew I could get quite close without having to really do much.”
Aside from vying for a share of the event’s $8 million prize money, the top 15 players in the so-called Race to Dubai -- the revamped Order of Merit -- will share a further $5 million.
Going into the Dubai tournament, McIlroy was narrowly ahead of Willett, while five other players also had a mathematical chance of being the season’s best.
The standings meant Willett, 28, and McIlroy were last to play, arriving at the first tee under a blistering midday sun and without any breeze to provide some respite.
Willett’s turquoise shirt was drenched in sweat as he and McIlroy amiably chatted before play began.
The Northern Irishman missed a difficult downhill birdie putt from 20 feet on the first green, rolling the ball wide.
He made immediate amends, picking up a shot with a nine-foot putt on the second to move to one-under despite struggling to find the fairway or green on the approach.
Willett birdied five and seven, in between McIlroy picking up another shot on six as both reached the turn two-under.
“Ball-striking tee-to-green for the most part has been very good all year and it's been the putter that held me back,” said McIlroy. “But I felt I putted well today so that bodes well for the next three days.”
On the back nine, McIlroy bogeyed 10, then birdied 11 and 12, while Willett picked up shots at 11, 14 and 18 and bogeyed 13.
“In between those birdies and the birdie at the last, there was a bit of ugly golf in there,” added McIlroy. “I got enough practice out of the bunkers on the back nine.”

DUBAI Germany’s Martin Kaymer and England’s Ian Poulter are among four players tied for the lead after Thursday's first day of the DP World Tour Championship, the $8 million finale of the European season.
The Ryder Cup team mates carded 66 and are joined on six-under by another Englishman, Andy Sullivan, and Australia’s Marcus Fraser.
World number three Rory McIlroy, who began the day top of Europe’s money list and is aiming to be the continent’s top earner for a third year in four, is two shots further back on 68 after chipping in from the bunker to birdie the final hole.
Poulter did not drop a shot as he claimed three birdies on the front nine and three more after the turn.
“I took care of the par-fours and the par-threes. I just didn't really take care of the par-fives,” Poulter, 39, told reporters, after squandering three birdie opportunities, missing 15-foot putts on holes two and 18 and a four-footer on seven.
“I'm playing well. I'm just not converting all of the chances that I would expect to convert. So when I do that, I'm going to find myself with a trophy in my hand,” said Poulter, who is seeking a first tour victory since 2012.
“I would like to end the year on a win. There's a lot at stake. It is probably more pride than anything else."
Kaymer, a two-time major winner, escaped with a bogey after finding water on the par-three sixth hole, while a run of five birdies on the final eight holes was marred only by another dropped shot on 16 as the early-starting players found it easier to score low before a desert wind whipped up in the afternoon.
“I gave myself a lot of chances and I putted really well, so overall it was a very, very good round,” said Kaymer.
World number 133 Fraser is an unlikely front-runner and will hope to improve on his record of two top-10 tour finishes this year despite a bogey on the 16th which pulled him back into the chasing pack.
“I missed my drive, and going in with a three-iron, it was always going to be a bit tough,” the 37-year-old said. "The greens are that good. If you pick the right line and you hit it on line, it's going to go in.”
Italy’s Francesco Molinari is five-under, while McIlroy is one of eight players a shot further back, in a pack that also includes England's Danny Willett, the Northern Irishman's main rival to win the Race to Dubai.
The top 15 players on the tour, also known as the European money list, will share an additional $5 million based on their overall season performance.

BERLIN FIFA should set limits on the term and age of its future presidents as world soccer's governing body seeks to reform after a corruption scandal, the chief executive of long-standing sponsor Adidas was quoted as saying on Thursday.
The comments by Herbert Hainer are the first concrete proposals for reform from the German sportswear company that has provided the World Cup match ball since 1970 and two years ago extended its partnership with FIFA until 2030.
Hainer also said the role of FIFA president should be more like that of a chief executive, overseen by a supervisory body, like in companies.
"It doesn't help at all for just one person to go. You have to fundamentally change the organization," Hainer said in an interview with the WirtschaftsWoche magazine released on Thursday ahead of publication.
The way that decisions are taken had to be changed as well as limiting the term and age of future presidents, he added. He did not specify a maximum age or recommend how long the term should be.
Adidas has faced criticism for declining to join other major sponsors like Visa and Coca-Cola in October when they demanded the immediate departure of FIFA President Sepp Blatter after Swiss authorities opened a criminal investigation into him. [L8N12714X]
Blatter, 79, who has been at the head of FIFA since 1998, lost his appeal on Wednesday against a provisional 90-day ban by the global soccer body's ethics committee.
Sponsors like Visa and Coca-Cola have demanded that FIFA reform is driven by an independent, third-party commission of impartial experts.
However, Hainer reiterated his support for the existing reform commission, with which he had discussed his ideas.
"I can't say what will come out in the end, but you will see that the structures will change significantly," he said.
Buffeted by scandals over the last few years, FIFA was thrown into turmoil in May by the U.S. indictments of 14 sports marketing executives and soccer officials for alleged corruption.
Hainer, who has said the FIFA scandal is not hurting the company's image, also told the magazine he expects soccer sales to grow by more than 10 percent next year, when France hosts the European championships.
Adidas said its sales of soccer products rose 19 percent in the third quarter, helped by the launch of new "ACE" and "X" soccer boots and kits for new partners Manchester United and Italian champions Juventus.

DUBAI Charl Schwartzel says he no longer looks at leaderboards after a double-bogey on the last hole of the first round of the DP World Tour Championship on Thursday left the former Masters champion off the pace at the European Tour's season finale.
The world number 55 has not been ranked in the top 20 since August last year and the South African’s 2011 Augusta triumph stands out as his only tour victory outside of Africa this decade.
“I haven’t competed in any tournament for a very long time so I’ve stopped looking at leaderboards,” Schwartzel told Reuters after shooting one-under on Dubai’s Earth course.
“I haven’t played well for the last couple of years, but I’ve been going at it for 13 years and I’m guessing somewhere along the line you will find some struggles so I’ve got to keep going and come out of it.”
The 31-year-old was steady on Dubai’s front nine, birdying the second hole and otherwise finding par. He then picked up a shot at the 10th, bogeyed 12 before successive birdies on 14-15 and a double-bogey on the last.
“I played nicely. I hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens. One or two putts went in. It was a disappointing finish but other than that was pretty good,” said Schwartzel.
He has no plans, however, to change his game, preparations or coaching despite the prolonged slump.
“I’ll just work harder. It’s never far away, you just lose confidence. I’m better sticking with it -- if you do too many changes you’re going to lose it,” said Schwartzel. “I’ll stay with the same stuff and wait for it to turn.”
He said his passion for golf remains undimmed.
“It’s always there -- it’s served me well for many years and this is part of it,” Schwartzel said. “It goes up and down. This is one of the downs and it’s a longer down than I’ve had before.”

LONDON Mexican teenager Alfonso Celis has joined Force India as a development driver and will take part in seven practice sessions next year, the Formula One team said on Thursday.
The 19-year-old, who has been racing in the junior GP3 series, will drive a Formula One car for the first time in Abu Dhabi testing after next week's season-ending grand prix.
Force India said the Mexico City-born driver, who has had one podium finish in GP3 so far, will also carry out simulator work.
"As our development driver we will work hard to prepare him for the demands of driving in Formula One and provide a good grounding in all aspects of the job," said team co-owner Vijay Mallya in a statement.
Force India already have experienced Mexican driver Sergio Perez racing for them along with Germany's Nico Hulkenberg and are also backed by several Mexican sponsors.
The country's presence in Formula One is growing, with Mexico returning to the grand prix calendar this season after a 23-year absence and Esteban Gutierrez joining the new Haas F1 team as a race driver.
"Ever since I started racing I’ve been dreaming of Formula One, so it’s a huge honor to begin working with Sahara Force India," said Celis.
"It’s an amazing opportunity for me to learn about Formula One and to work closely with the engineers and race drivers. Being on the track in Abu Dhabi will be an incredible feeling."

DUBAI Former world number one Luke Donald was left frustrated after some late bogeys marred a blistering start to his first round at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship on Thursday.
Donald sunk birdies on the opening three holes of Dubai’s earth course, bogeyed the fourth and then picked up shots at the next three greens to be five under after seven holes.
“It was a game of two halves. I got off to a great start, I was really hot out of the gate,” Donald told Reuters.
Bogeys on eight, 12 and 18 -- plus a birdied 11th -- dragged the 37-year-old down the provisional leaderboard.
“Five under through 11, I would have hoped to have finished lower, but there a lot of positives,” said the Englishman.
“The first 12-13 holes, there wasn’t much wind. The conditions were perfect, (but) the wind then started to pick up a bit. The course is in great shape, the greens are soft and pure, so if you’re in control of your ball you can make birdies.”
The world number 77 ended 2011 as the world’s top-ranked player but has endured a difficult few years, slipping to his lowest rank for more than a decade and without a European tour victory since 2012.
“It has been a tough season and I want to finish on a high. I feel like I’m going in the right direction,” said Donald, who tied for fifth at last month’s British Masters.
The Tour has changed its member requirements for next year so that players must compete in at least five tournaments per season -- excluding majors and World Golf Championship (WGC) events. Previously, the minimum was 13 including these elite tournaments.
“If that change hadn’t come into effect I would have struggled to get my number of events -- now my schedule will be very similar,” said Donald, who also plays on the U.S. PGA Tour.
His next tournament on the European circuit will be May’s BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.

LONDON Next season is likely to be a 'make or break' year for 14-times major winner Tiger Woods, according to former world number one Nick Faldo.
Woods turns 40 next month and is battling to recover from a follow-up procedure on his back that he underwent in October, a month after having had surgery for the second time in a year and a half.
The American has slumped from number one to 384th in the world in the last year and a half and Faldo doubts that he can climb the mountain again.
"He's got to physically get strong enough to practise hard enough to find his game again, try to compete again and then try to win again," the 58-year-old Englishman told Reuters in an interview.
"Who knows? It might be the end of the road for Tiger in a way. The hardest thing is, how determined can he be to come back?
"If he has another season like this one, mixed with poor play and injuries, what decisions will he make? If it was me, how can you pick it up?"
Faldo said Woods had simply been overtaken by the 'New Big Three' of American Jordan Spieth, Jason Day of Australia and Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy.
"When you are an athlete and you've had your time, you should be praised for that," added the winner of the 1987, 1990 and 1992 British Open and the 1989, 1990 and 1996 Masters.
"What Tiger's done for our game has been unbelievable but it's going to tail off one day because you physically can't run, jump and chuck it like you used to.

TALL ORDER
"We've got to acknowledge what he did for the sport but it's a new generation now," Faldo said as he launched a range of wines from six of Europe's classic regions to celebrate each of his major victories (www.miltonsandfordwines.com).
"It's a huge, tall order for Tiger to get into the mix now."
Faldo, who now works as a golf analyst on television in the United States, believes Woods needs to overcome more mental barriers than physical ones when he makes his comeback.
"I'd say the problem now is a nerve factor," he said. "I've watched him closely and I feel he's got a couple of demons sitting on his shoulders now.
"He hasn't got the confidence to hit the driver how he used to. Now it's going either way and that's huge.
"If he stands on the practice range and hits it straight and then walks to the first tee and hits it like this," said Faldo, motioning left and right with his hands, "then it's, 'Whoa, hang on a minute.'
"That's not physical, that's not technical, that's the shortest distance," added Faldo, pointing to his head.
While the Englishman was less than optimistic about Woods' prospects, he felt altogether differently about McIlroy.
The 26-year-old Northern Irishman has been eclipsed this season by Masters and U.S. Open champion Spieth and PGA Championship winner Day but 2016 could be a different story, according to Faldo.
"It will really motivate Rory," he said. "Rory loves the limelight and he wants to be world number one again.
"He doesn't like the fact that these two other guys went, 'whoosh' past him because of his injury so he'll be gearing up big time for next season."
McIlroy's campaign was hampered by an ankle ligament problem he sustained in mid-season while playing a friendly game of soccer and Faldo offered the four-times major winner a few words of advice.
"You've got to look after yourself," he said. "You're an athlete, you have a window of opportunity. It doesn't mean you've got to put yourself in cotton wool but some things you've just got to think twice about.
"Your priority is to do everything right to be a golfer for the time you are out there. Once it's over, hopefully you've got 50 more years of the rest of your life to enjoy what you did as an athlete for 20 years."

LONDON Andy Murray was known for his wild mop of hair earlier in his career but the world number two surprised fans at the O2 Arena on Wednesday when he took out a pair of scissors and gave himself a mid-match trim against Rafael Nadal.
It was early in his 6-4 6-1 defeat by the Spaniard at the ATP World Tour Finals that the Briton sat down on his courtside chair and began carefully cutting his fringe.
He was playing reasonably well at the time, but following his do-it-yourself haircut he slumped to defeat, leaving his chances of reaching the semi-finals in the balance.
"I had some hair in my eye, and I just wanted to get rid of it. That literally took two seconds," he told reporters, who were obviously curious about his antics."
The world number two's barbering skills were lost on his opponent, who laughed when told of the incident afterwards.
"He had a practice before to try to know that," Nadal said, when told Murray's hair had been causing him a problem.
"Was good. Is a good solution, yeah."

United States captain Davis Love III, looking for passion and experience, has appointed 14-times major winner Tiger Woods as one of five vice-captains for next year's Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National in Chaska, Minnesota.
Woods, 39, is a veteran of seven Ryder Cups as a player, most recently in 2012 under Love's captaincy, and is battling to recover from a nagging back injury that led him to undergo two surgeries over the past two months.
Love also announced on Wednesday that Steve Stricker and Jim Furyk would be vice-captains, joining Tom Lehman who was introduced in February as the first of five assistants under a new management system unveiled by the PGA of America to help revive U.S. fortunes.
The Americans will be bidding to end a dismal stretch of eight defeats by Europe in the last 10 editions of the biennial team competition when the 2016 Ryder Cup is held from Sept. 30-Oct. 2, and hope to benefit from several changes made following the recommendations of a task force that was assembled.
"These three guys, joining Tom Lehman, will send a message to our team that we are really serious about this Ryder Cup," Love said during a news conference on the eve of this week's RSM Classic, the PGA Tour event which he hosts at Sea Island Golf Club on St. Simons Island, Georgia.
"We are ahead of the game this time and it lets potential team members know that we are going to do whatever it takes to put them in the best position to win in 2016."
Furyk, 45, has played in nine consecutive Ryder Cups while Stricker, 48, who has represented his country three times in the team competition, will repeat the role he served as an assistant to then-captain Tom Watson at Gleneagles in Scotland last year.
"Two things that excite me about these vice-captains is ... to a man, they said, 'We will do anything you ask us to do to make this Ryder Cup successful'," said Love.
"And second, these four guys bring over 50 years of combined Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup experience to the table, so I have surrounded myself with passionate people who have a tremendous amount of matchplay experience.
"They'll also be my eyes and ears from event to event next year on Tour. That's invaluable and, as captain, I am grateful for their commitment, dedication and passion to win."
Woods said in a statement: "I'd like to thank Davis for his confidence in me and for my selection as a Ryder Cup vice-captain. This is something I want to do.
"I will continue to do whatever I can to help win the Cup back. Once I'm fully healthy, I'd like to try to make the team too, but either way, I'm very excited to work with Davis, the other vice-captains and the players to get a U.S. victory."
It will be the second time Love, 51, has led the team in the biennial event as he guided the U.S. to a 10-6 lead heading into the final day in 2012 but lost by 14-1/2 points to 13-1/2 in what is known to European fans as the "Miracle of Medinah".
The Americans were then beaten by 16-1/2 points to 11-1/2 in last year's Ryder Cup at Gleneagles where five-times major winner Phil Mickelson was scathing of the often aloof approach used by U.S. captain Watson.
Under the immensely popular Love at Medinah, the American team felt fully involved with every aspect of that year's Ryder Cup and, to a man, they agreed their captain had done everything in his power to create a winning strategy.

LONDON The Jordanian prince beaten in May's FIFA presidential election says he can win the race to become president next February because the old order which led world soccer's governing body into crisis is being swept away.
Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan is one of five men seeking to replace Sepp Blatter in February's special elective vote. He told reporters in London he was optimistic of doing better than in May, when he was beaten by 133-73 votes by Blatter at the FIFA Congress in Zurich.
"I am confident that I can win the election because I believe I have the best ideas for what the future of FIFA should be and I have full faith and confidence in our national associations.
"I feel much more confident with the national associations now because I can see they feel that a weight has been lifted off their shoulders.
"Under the terms of the election, unlike before, the electoral body has stipulated there can be no block voting by confederations, forcing them how to vote, as we used to see in the past and I believe I have support from all over the world."
Among the wielders of the block vote in the past was the now-disgraced Jack Warner of CONCACAF, the South American and Caribbean confederation, who used to publicly state that all his 35 member states were voting for Blatter.
"That cannot happen now," said Ali. "All candidates have been given strict instructions on how the election should be run and the confederations cannot control the individual votes of their members."
The landscape ahead of February's vote looks very different to May's, which took place two days after police swooped on FIFA delegates and other officials at their hotel in Zurich, sparking the biggest crisis in the organization's 111-year history.
Blatter, who stepped down four days after being re-elected,  is currently suspended from office, as is UEFA President Michel Platini and former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke.
Jeffrey Webb, another former president of CONCACAF, has been stripped of his position and is facing corruption charges in the United States.
Earlier on Wednesday, Blatter, who is not standing in February's election, and Platini, who is hoping to do so, had their appeals against their suspensions turned down by FIFA.
Prince Ali said he decided to re-enter the race for the presidency in September because other people he thought might take up his torch to reform FIFA did not want to do so.
"I felt a deep sense of responsibility. I talked to others who were potential candidates at the time to see if they would do what was needed to be done and I did not get the encouragement that I needed, that is why I decided I definitely needed to get back into this."
As well as Prince Ali, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne of France, Swiss Gianni Infantino, UEFA's general secretary, South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale and Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain are also standing.
The election is on Feb. 26 in Zurich.

ZURICH FIFA presidential candidate Tokyo Sexwale says he wants national teams to be able to wear sponsors' names on their shirts at an expanded World Cup tournament.
South African Sexwale, a prisoner under apartheid who became a politician and businessman, unveiled his election manifesto on Wednesday as he bids to replace Sepp Blatter at the helm of world football's governing body in the Feb. 26 vote.
Sexwale said the current crisis at FIFA, which faces investigations from the U.S. Department of Justice and Swiss authorities and was hit by the indictment of 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives in May, can be "utilized to turn things around and renew FIFA".
Repeating his call for a strong commitment to development programs to help the game outside its profitable center in Europe, Sexwale promised an "open door policy" to national associations and to "allow stakeholders easier access" to the FIFA president.
But his most eye-catching proposal is to allow the national associations to generate more sponsorship revenue by allowing company logos on shirts.
Sexwale said he would "seriously explore the possibility of the national jersey, as happens in other sporting codes, bearing the logo of the main sponsor - not only the jersey-maker as is currently the case.
"There is space there for much value worth millions of dollars which will be destined directly into FAs' (national football associations') coffers," he said.
Shirt sponsorship became widespread in the club game in the 1980s but FIFA have not allowed deals for national team jerseys, with FAs limited to sponsorship on training tops and off-the-field equipment.
Sexwale said that FIFA needed to "take a hard look, with sensitivity" at the imbalances in representation at World Cups among regional confederations. Europe, which has 53 FAs, has 13 World Cup slots while Africa, with 54 members, has just five.
The South African proposed no specific numbers but opened the door to an expansion of FIFA's biggest tournament.
"Concerning the number of national teams in the World Cup, it is proposed this be above the current 32 teams, subject to an inclusive discussion by the FIFA executive committee," he said.
Sexwale called for the creation of an 'international advisory board' made up of 11 "internationally respected eminent persons from various walks of life, including football".
He said this body, which would meet annually "to share its critical views with an about FIFA" would be "part of the effort to win back the trust and confidence of various stakeholders following the disruptive corruption allegations which have damaged the FIFA brand".
FIFA president Sepp Blatter and UEFA president Michel Platini are both currently serving 90-day suspensions from the game and lost appeals on Wednesday against them.
Their bans relate to a 2 million Swiss franc payment from FIFA to Platini in 2011, nine years after Platini had completed work for FIFA.

LONDON When the losses were coming thick and fast earlier this year, Rafael Nadal resembled a man tormented -- what had always come so naturally, he now had to think about.
The powerful topspin forehand, the signature shot which propelled him to 14 grand slam titles and made him virtually unplayable on clay, was deserting him at crucial moments.
With his movement tentative and his confidence at a low ebb, Nadal was humiliated by Novak Djokovic in the French Open quarter-finals -- a tournament he had ruled for a decade.
Lesser players also hunted him down, with many predicting the Mallorcan was stuck in an irreversible downward spiral.
This week at the ATP World Tour Finals, however, Nadal has crushed Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka, the world number two and four respectively. The instincts that allowed him to dominate the game seem to be alive and kicking.
"The sport in general is simple," Nadal told reporters at the O2 Arena, after his brutal 6-4 6-1 victory over Murray left him on the verge of reaching the semi-finals.
"When I hit the ball and I know the ball will go in, when I don't think about how to hit the ball, when I think just about where to hit it, that's good news.
"This year, I've been worried about how to hit the ball, not to miss, rather than hit the ball where I can damage the opponent. I have been more worried about myself than the opponents for a lot of matches. Like that it's impossible to compete at the highest level.
"Today I feel free. That means I'm happy."
Ranked back at five in the world, after slumping to 10th during a miserable summer which included defeats by dreadlocked German Dustin Brown in the second round of Wimbledon and Fabio Fognini at the U.S. Open, Nadal appears to be heading into 2016 ready to challenge for the big prizes again.
"I'm happy how the things are going the last couple of weeks," said the 29-year-old Nadal, who since his third-round exit at the U.S. Open has reached finals in Beijing and Basel and the semis at Shanghai -- a run that guaranteed his place amongst the elite at the London finale.
"It's good to finish the year with this positive energy. That helps to try to start next year in better shape."

The Houston Rockets fired head coach Kevin McHale on Wednesday after the team made a stumbling 4-7 start to the season, replacing him on an interim basis with his assistant J.B. Bickerstaff.
Though McHale led the Rockets to the Western Conference Finals last season and compiled a 193-130 record in four-plus seasons with the franchise, his position had become increasingly tenuous following blowout losses in their last four games.
Rockets general manager Daryl Morey announced that Bickerstaff would take over as interim coach when Houston host the Portland Trail Blazers later on Wednesday.
"The team was not responding to Kevin," Morey told reporters. "There is no time in the West," he added, referring to the highly competitive Western Conference.
The departure of McHale, 57, who guided the Rockets into the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, follows a players-only meeting that was held on Tuesday in a bid by the team to find a solution to their four-game losing streak.
"It is embarrassing. We hate to lose, but at the same time we have a long season and we can't think negative when we lose," center Dwight Howard told reporters.
"We have to try and find the positive in any situation. You keep thinking negative, then negative things will continue to happen to you. You got to stay positive and fight through it. All this stuff will build our character."

WELLINGTON New Zealand rugby legend Jonah Lomu, who revolutionised wing play to become the sport's first global superstar, died on Wednesday in Auckland at the age of 40, prompting a global outpouring of grief.
Lomu had suffered from kidney disease for two decades and had a transplant in 2004 but former All Blacks doctor John Mayhew said his death was a complete shock.
"It was totally unexpected," Mayhew said. "Jonah and his family arrived back from the United Kingdom last night and he suddenly died this morning."
Lomu, who was awaiting another transplant and undergoing dialysis treatment, had undertaken commercial obligations at the recent Rugby World Cup in England, won by New Zealand.
His death took the rugby-mad country by surprise and triggered a flood of messages of condolence from around the world.
New Zealand's parliament expressed their sorrow before they began proceedings on Wednesday.
"Anyone who was living in New Zealand in the 1990s would not have failed to notice the massive impact Jonah Lomu had not only on sports fans but the wider community in this country," Sports Minister Jonathan Coleman said.
"He was a man who came from humble beginnings in Mangere, South Auckland and rose to become rugby's first global superstar."
World Rugby Chairman Bernard Lapasset led the international tributes: "Jonah's contribution to rugby cannot be overstated," he said in a statement.
"He was the first superstar player and, through his sheer brilliance and love of the game, he brought much joy to the rugby family and took our sport to a new level of profile."
   Lomu's record of 37 tries in 63 tests was an impressive haul, all the more so considering he played much of his career with nephritic syndrome, the disease that attacked his kidneys.
New Zealand Rugby, who arguably owe part of their huge commercial success over the last 20 years to Lomu's performances at the 1995 World Cup, said they were "shocked and saddened" by Lomu's death.
"We're lost for words and our heartfelt sympathies go out to Jonah's family," chief executive Steve Tew said.
    "Jonah was a legend of our game and loved by his many fans both here and around the world."

    ILLNESS
Born to Tongan parents in South Auckland, Lomu spent some of his childhood back in the Pacific Island nation after a cousin was hacked to death in a street attack.
He was then sent to Wesley College where he quickly found his niche on the sports field and was timed running under 11 seconds in the 100 meters.
All Blacks coach Laurie Mains plucked him out of sevens rugby in 1994 but Lomu found his transition from the loose forward position he played at secondary school to the wing a challenge.
He was dropped after his first two tests against France in 1994 and barely made the Rugby World Cup squad for South Africa the following year after being deemed not fit enough for the fast-paced game the coach wanted to play.
He proved almost unstoppable at the tournament, however,  electrifying the rugby world with seven tries -- four in the semi-final against England alone, including one when he trampled over fullback Mike Catt that left many speechless.
The pace and power displayed by the 1.95m tall and 119kg Lomu changed the wing position forever, with the traditional lightweight flyer gradually all but disappearing from the test game.
    The impact he made at the tournament catapulted the quietly-spoken Lomu to worldwide fame and was one catalyst for the rugby turning professional shortly afterwards.
The ravages of Lomu's disease had begun to affect him and his performances went downhill from 1998, although he still made the 1999 World Cup squad and scored eight tries. He played his last test against Wales in 2002.
Lomu's health deteriorated from that point and he had a transplant in 2004 when a friend donated one of his own kidneys for the procedure.
By the time of the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, when Lomu featured heavily in the opening ceremony, the kidney had begun to fail and he was forced back onto dialysis.
"Jonah Lomu was a player who changed the face of modern rugby," the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said.
"He was an icon not just for New Zealand fans but for all rugby fans around the world. It is sad that he did not live to see the sport return to the Olympics Games next year in Rio de Janeiro."

LONDON No country suffered more spectacularly at the hands of Jonah Lomu than England but his victims have long forgiven the New Zealand winger whom they held in the highest regard and were united in their grief at news of his death on Wednesday.
Lomu's remarkable haul of four tries, and the way he scored them, in New Zealand's semi-final demolition of England in the 1995 World Cup catapulted him to a level of fame unprecedented in the sport.
Lomu, 20 at the time and a magnificent physical specimen, brushed England's defenders aside as if they were children. And when he could not go round them, he just ran straight over them -- with fullback Mike Catt the most memorable victim as he was trodden into the Cape Town turf.
"He's 18 stone, I was 13 stone -- the rest is history," Catt told the BBC on Wednesday.
"I laughed at myself, I thought it was brilliant. I'm lying on the floor and (All Black lock) Robin Brooke came over to me, hit me across the cheek and said: 'Mate, that's just the start of it'.
"Lomu put me on the map. Everybody knew who Mike Catt was. All for the wrong reasons of course."
Team mate Rob Andrew said Lomu was a "a nightmare to play against.
"He was intimidating and he had a smile on his face when he did it, which made it even worse," Andrew said of the winger who scored eight tries in seven games against England, more than against any other nation.
"I was left horizontal on the ground, grasping at him. He ran over most of the team, I was just pleased he chose to run around me instead of over me.
"Those were iconic images of one of the greatest players of all time and I was privileged to play against him that day and discuss it since."
Andrew said he has a photograph of Lomu bulldozing through him -- signed by the New Zealander, who died after a near-20-year battle with kidney disease.
"There is no doubt he changed the sport," Andrew added. "It went professional after that World Cup and it was almost like Jonah was a professional athlete in amongst a bunch of amateurs.
"He wasn't just running over our backs, he was running over our forwards as well. There have been big players in the game but it was the pace and the skill of Jonah and he was 20-years-old in 1995.
"I don't think there will ever be another player who had such an impact on the world stage.
"He's one of, if not the greats, of all time."
Four years later Lomu crossed the line again as the All Blacks thumped Clive Woodward's England at Twickenham in the 1999 World Cup.
"We used to give him a huge amount of attention," Woodward told the BBC when asked what he had told his men before they faced Lomu.
"I remember saying at a team meeting on Friday night that there was nobody in their team would get in our team and man for man I wouldn't swap anybody and was doing my motivational talk.
"When I got to the end Will Greenwood put his hand up and said  'Clive, we're all with you but I think I'm speaking on behalf of all the team and I think we'd probably swap Austin Healey for Jonah Lomu.'
"It was one of those magic moments you don't forget.
"But in all seriousness, I'm just really, really sad for rugby today because he was one of the all time greats.
"And when you met him he was the nicest, nicest guy and very softly spoken. We'll miss him."

BERLIN/MAINZ, (Germany) Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans not to be cowed by the threat of Islamist attacks, saying a concrete security threat had forced officials to cancel Tuesday's soccer match against the Netherlands.
With security worries running high in Europe after Islamist shootings and bombings in Paris last Friday which killed at least 129 people, Merkel gathered top ministers for a special meeting on the situation.
"I was just as sad as the millions of fans that the match was canceled. But the security officials took a responsible decision," Merkel said in a brief statement.
"These are difficult decisions, perhaps the most difficult given the conflicting priorities of freedom and security. But yesterday it was right to decide based on security," she said.
The state premier of Lower Saxony Stephan Weil said a firm indication about a "concrete danger" based on secret information had prompted the cancellation of the match, which Merkel had been due to attend in state capital Hanover.
His Interior Minister Boris Pistorius said indications of a security threat had hardened up during Tuesday but he declined to confirm or deny media reports that a tip-off came from a foreign intelligence agency, possibly from France.
In the end, no arrests were made and no explosives found.
Pistorius sought to reassure the public, saying the security situation in the Hanover area had stabilizes and there was no sign that Christmas markets might be targets for an attack, something that is worrying many Germans.
Weil urged people to continue with their normal lives.
"I will certainly not retreat into my shell, neither in my position as office holder, nor as a private person unless I receive concrete recommendations by those who deal with these issues intensively," he told reporters.
Germany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told a security conference in Mainz that the Paris attacks would probably not be the last of their kind in western Europe.
"There cannot be absolute protection or 100 percent security in an open, pluralistic society, people know that," he said.
Germany has so far been spared a major attack on the scale of those experienced by Paris, London and Madrid in the last decade or so but security services and voters are on alert.
The head of Germany's BfV domestic intelligence agency stressed that while Germany is an enemy of Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, it should not cancel public events in response to security fears.
The head of the federal police, Holger Muench, warned that the ranks of potential Islamist attackers are growing, posing an increasingly difficult challenge to German security.
Muench said police know of about 750 people from Germany who have traveled to Syria and Iraq, possibly to military training camps, and about one third of them have returned.
"We are sticking to our assessment that there currently is a serious threat in Germany but we now have no concrete evidence for a further (terrorist) target," he said.

SANTIAGO The president of Chile's ANFP national football association Sergio Jadue has gone to the United States to talk to the FBI as part of its ongoing probe into corruption at soccer governing body FIFA, local media reported on Wednesday.
Local police had served Jadue a subpoena on Friday as part of what the ANFP said was an investigation into how it allocates salaries, hours after he announced he would take a 30-day leave for medical reasons.
"The trip is confirmed. He traveled to Miami last night," an ANFP spokesman told Reuters, without providing details about why Jadue traveled.
"He has a special permission for a 30-day medical leave and he continues to be the ANFP's president."
The spokesman added that the organization would make an official statement later on Wednesday. Local media had earlier reported that Jadue had resigned from his role at the head of the ANFP.
Under the flashes of cameras and with police escorts, Jadue boarded a flight in Santiago late on Tuesday night, headed for New York via Miami, said newspaper La Tercera earlier on Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the Chilean police force declined to comment.
South American soccer confederation CONMEBOL and the sport's world governing body FIFA are reeling from a corruption scandal. Several leading directors were indicted in May in a probe led by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation into allegations of bribery, money-laundering and wire fraud.
A majority of the 14 FIFA officials and sports marketing executives indicted by the FBI were from South America.
Local newspapers La Tercera and El Mercurio quoted unnamed ANFP officials as saying that Jadue was planning to collaborate with the FBI investigation.
"It's not a holiday," El Mercurio cited one official as saying. "He is due back May 10 next year. Jadue is traveling as a protected informant of U.S. justice."

MELBOURNE A year-ending tour of Australia has become an unlikely launching pad to a season of triumph for some of golf's brightest stars, so Adam Scott is hoping his home courses can work their magic again for his own game.
The former world number one has had an underwhelming year by his own lofty standards and arrived Down Under this week feeling some pressure to clinch a title and maintain his proud record of at least one tournament win every year dating back to 2001.
Scott should fancy his chances at the Australian Masters which tees off at Melbourne's storied Huntingdale Golf Club on Thursday, where he will bid to win his third trophy in four years against a modest field of local professionals.
The Australian Open in Sydney next week offers a tougher challenge, however, and the prospect of a mouthwatering battle with American world number one and defending champion Jordan Spieth.
Scott has previously arrived in Australia searching for answers and found them on the sunbaked greens of Melbourne's sandbelt in 2012, when he won his first Australian Masters trophy at Kingston Heath.
Edging Briton Ian Poulter in a tense shoot-out helped Scott ease some of the disappointment of his British Open meltdown that year, when he gave up a four-stroke lead in the last four holes to blow his best chance at a maiden major championship.
Months later, he was the toast of Australia after becoming his country's first player to win a U.S. Masters at the 2013 tournament.
"All events are important, but when you're looking for that momentum to get back in the winner's circle, these (tournaments) play a big role in that," he said.
"I can think of a lot of guys who have really kickstarted great runs by winning in Australia, and I did it in 2012."
Former world number one Rory McIlroy can also swear by the restorative powers of a trip Down Under, having ended a miserable 2013 with a win at the Australian Open at Royal Sydney Golf Club.
McIlroy would go on to win two of the following year's four majors and recapture the world number one ranking.
Spieth then stole the show from both McIlroy and Scott at last year's Australian Open, his second professional win leading into his astonishing 2015 season in which he also won two of the four majors.
"Yeah, it's on my mind," Scott said of his record of tournament wins going back to 2001.
"I'd love to (continue) it. Just got to go out and put four good days together, and that's something I haven't really done."

Kuwait look set to be kicked out of World Cup qualifying after failing to resolve a case of government interference in their local football association before Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Myanmar.
The Kuwait Football Association were suspended from FIFA last month because of the issue, three days after they drew 0-0 at home to Lebanon in a World Cup qualifier.
They had been scheduled to play Myanmar on Tuesday in their sixth fixture in Asian qualifying Group G but the FIFA ban prevents them from taking part in international competition.
"The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier between Myanmar and Kuwait, scheduled for 17 November 2015, did not take place," world governing body FIFA said in a statement.
"The matter has been referred to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for its consideration. Further information will follow in due course."
Kuwait are currently second in Group G with 10 points, level with Lebanon and eight behind leaders South Korea.
Only the eight group winners and four best runners-up will progress to the 2019 Asian Cup and third round of 2018 World Cup qualifying in the continent.
Indonesia were also banned for government interference in the running of the local football association in May and immediately kicked out of Group F of joint World Cup and Asian Cup qualifying.

AUBURN HILLS, Michigan (The Sports Xchange) - Andre Drummond powered for 25 points and 18 rebounds and the Detroit Pistons rallied from a 13-point, second-half deficit to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers 104-99 on Tuesday night at The Palace.
The fourth-year center scored 10 fourth-quarter points as the Pistons (6-5) snapped a four-game losing streak. Point guard Reggie Jackson supplied 23 points, including six free throws in the final minute, along with 12 assists.
Power forward Ersan Ilyasova added 20 points and six rebounds and small forward Marcus Morris chipped in 14 points for Detroit.
Small forward LeBron James scored a game-high 30 points and passed Jerry West on the all-time scoring list but the Cavaliers (8-3) lost their second straight.
James reached the scoring milestone on a 3-pointer with 3:06 remaining in the first quarter. James needed 10 points to pass the Los Angeles Lakers legend for 19th place on the all-time scoring list. West finished his career with 25,192 points.
Power forward Kevin Love had 19 points and nine rebounds while guards J.R. Smith and Mo Williams tossed in 15 points apiece.
The Cavs opened up their biggest lead at 70-57 by starting the second half on a 14-2 run. Smith capped it off with his second 3-pointer in that span.
Morris' four-point play with 4:48 left in the quarter pulled Detroit within six, 77-71. The Cavs were up by the same amount at 81-75 entering the final quarter.
When Ilyasova drilled an open 3-pointer with 5:26 remaining, Cleveland's lead was just 89-88. Love hit a baseline shot to push the lead up to five but Drummond's three-point play with 3:37 left got it back to two, 95-93.
Jackson's pull-up jumper tied it and Drummond made one of two free throws with 2:07 left to give Detroit its first second-half lead, 98-97.
James turned the ball over in the final minute but Jackson missed a jumper. Center Timofey Mozgov misfired from the left side on Cleveland's ensuing possession and Jackson hit two free throws with 21.3 seconds left.
James made a layup but Jackson matched those points with two more free throws. Smith missed from long-range and Jackson clinched the victory with two more free throws.
NEW YORK Joe Maddon likes to think outside the box about how to bring a baseball team together and treat his players.
And after leading the young Chicago Cubs to the 2015 playoffs, the National League Manager of the Year is aiming higher and dreaming of recruiting others to join his magical mystery tour.
In his first season with the Cubs, a team full of youthful potential and a history of failure dating back more than 100 years, they won 97 games, got to the 2015 National League Championship Series and are now scooping up postseason awards.
"The spotlight is shining on Wrigley Field," Maddon said on a conference call after receiving his third career Manager of the Year honors one day after his third baseman, Kris Bryant, won the Rookie of the Year award.
On Wednesday, Jake Arrieta is one of three finalists for the Cy Young Award as the National League's top pitcher.
"You just like to think that will attract other people to want to be there," said Maddon. "Obviously, a huge attraction is that we have not won a World Series in over a hundred years.
"I think there's a lot of competitive nature in ... major league players, ones that would want to be a member of that first group that did that."
Maddon likes to create a relaxed atmosphere but at the same time is dead serious about baseball.
"The most rewarding part was the way we came together as a group," he said. "It's not easy to walk into the situation not knowing anyone and extracting the kind of year that we did."
Maddon dipped into some old tricks from his tenure as skipper of the Tampa Bay Rays, who he lifted from American League door mats to a trip to the 2008 World Series.
He brought in a magician to entertain the team and on another occasion had a petting zoo set up in Wrigley Field's outfield corner complete with a sloth, a penguin, a snow leopard and a pink flamingo for the players and their families.
After a four-game losing streak, he organized a pyjama party for the players and families to break up the tension.
"Get the players to bond together, keep them relaxed," he said. "But let them know you mean business."
One crucial call Maddon made was to shift three-time All-Star Starlin Castro from shortstop to second base to make room for rookie Addison Russell.
"Starlin was a star. He handled it superbly," Maddon said. "Looking at me, listening to me. Not pushing back and not getting angry. And knowing, I think, in his heart, that it was the right thing to do."
The Cubbies finished the season with eight straight wins and dismissed the Cardinals before falling to the Mets in the playoffs.
"Ninety-seven wins. Not a bad recruiting situation to be in," said Maddon, whose franchise has not reached the World Series in 70 years and not won one since 1908.
"Ninety-seven wins. We want to get beyond the NLCS. We want to get to the next level next year."

MELBOURNE Former world number one Adam Scott has dented Australia's hopes of a medal when golf returns to the Olympics at Rio next year, saying he is unlikely to make room for it in his schedule.
Scott, Australia's second highest-ranked player after world number two Jason Day, would be an automatic qualifier for the tournament if he can maintain his current ranking in the top 15 by June, 2016.
"It's not really a priority of my scheduling next year and I'll still base my schedule around the majors," he told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday.
"Looking at the schedule some time off looks quite good actually.
"That's nothing to take away from the Olympics but I'm just not sure that they have got it quite dialed in for the format and might have missed an opportunity there to do something pretty special for golf."
Golf will be played at the Olympics for the first time since the 1904 Games in St. Louis and will consist of men's and women's 72-hole individual strokeplay tournaments.
The world's top 15 in both the men and women's events  qualify automatically in maximum fields of 60 players, but places are limited to four from nation in each tournament, which is likely to rule out a number of top-class Americans.
"I would have liked to have seen it be a little more creative than a 72-hole strokeplay event," Scott added.
"I'm not really sure how just having another golf tournament is really going to enhance the game or grow the game any more than any other tournament just because it's the Olympics.
"And certainly with the field criteria, it doesn't necessarily get the strongest field in the game.
"Some kind of a team event, even a mixed team event with the guys and girls would have been really interesting and something different."    Scott will bid for a third Australian Masters trophy at Huntingdale Golf Club from Thursday.

HANOVER, Germany A soccer game between Germany and Netherlands which German Chancellor Angel Merkel was due to attend in Hanover was called off two hours before its scheduled start on Tuesday over fears of a planned bombing.
The match was due to have been held four days after the deadly attacks in Paris on Friday, when suicide bombers targeted the soccer stadium where Germany were playing France.
"We had received specific indications that an attack with explosives was planned," Hanover Police President Volker Kluwe told NDR state broadcaster. "We took them seriously and that is why we took the measures."
"We do not know if these people, who had planned something for the stadium, had planned something else so we try to have a presence throughout the city," he said
Police vans with loudspeakers ordered fans to leave the Hanover stadium and heavily armed officers positioned themselves outside the arena.
Police also evacuated Hanover's TUI multi-purpose arena where a concert was about to start while officers checked cars and pedestrians in the city centre and sniffer dogs were deployed.
A train on its way to southern Germany was also stopped at Hanover station with police removing a suspicious package before giving the all-clear for the train to continue its journey.
There were no arrests made and no explosives were found, Lower Saxony Interior Minister Boris Pistorius said.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the threat was credible and cancelling the game was the right thing to do, but did not provide any details.
"I understand the question but I will not answer it," he told a hastily convened news conference when asked what had forced the decision. He said divulging details could undermine security at other events.
"I am asking for an advance of trust from the German people. We will have such cases in the future, maybe not Hanover but somewhere else," he said.
After Friday's attacks in Paris security measures in Hanover had been tight. In a show of solidarity, Merkel was set to attend the soccer match with Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel and several government ministers.
Interim German Football Association President Reinhard Rauball said he called up the team in the bus some five kilometres (3 miles) from the stadium, telling them the game was cancelled.
Both the German and the Dutch teams were then rushed to a secure undisclosed location before the hosts left individually for their homes and the visitors for the airport.
"That we would go through this twice in four days is not something I could imagine," Rauball, visibly shaken, told reporters. "It is a sad day for Germany and a sad day for German football."
Two Dutch government ministers who were due to attend the match – Defence Minister Jeanine Hennes and Health and Sport Minister Edith Schippers — were also returning home.
World champions Germany had not initially wanted the game to go ahead after having played in Paris on Friday as a wave of attacks hit the city, killing 129 people.
The contingent of 80 Germans, including players, coaches and staff, spent the night holed up in the changing rooms of the Stade de France stadium, before heading for the airport on Saturday morning.
The players, coaches and the national football association decided to go ahead with the Hanover game in a gesture of solidarity with France.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado If Russia could build Sochi in seven years to host the 2014 Winter Games, they can fix their doping problems in nine months and compete at the Rio Olympics, former WADA chief Dick Pound said on Tuesday.
The International Association of Athletics Federation banned Russia from the sport last week after a stunning report by a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent commission, led by Pound, had detailed alleged unprecedented doping offences.
The explosive report accused Russia's state security services of colluding with the country's athletics federation to enable athletes to freely dope with confidence that test results would be suppressed.
The report also uncovered evidence of the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in Russian athletics and allegations of corruption and collusion by Russian and IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) officials.
Despite damning evidence and calls to have Russian athletes barred from the track and field competition in Rio, Pound made it clear there was a road back to the 2016 Summer Games for Russia if officials there made the necessary changes.
After spending $51 billion and moving mountains to transform Sochi into a glittering Olympic venue for the 2014 Winter Games, Pound felt that tearing down and rebuilding the country's corrupt anti-doping program should be a straightforward task.
"Russia built Sochi in seven years so this is child's play," said Pound, after briefing the WADA executive committee on his commission's findings and recommendations.
"All you need is some direction from the political authorities and say, "look, RUSADA (Russia Anti-Doping Agency) is independent and the lab is independent and anybody who doesn't make that happen is in trouble'.
"The same with coaches, you say, "folks the old Soviet system is over, we're not going to do that anymore and if that is your method of coaching don't let the door hit you in the butt on the way out'.
"I don't think you will get the culture fixed in nine months but you can do actions that will come to the same result," added Pound.
The WADA foundation board will meet on Wednesday and is widely expected to approve recommendations made in the independent commission report and officially decertify RUSADA and the Moscow lab which processed blood and urine samples from Russian athletes on behalf of the athletics federation.

MONITORING THE CLEAN-UP
The world governing body of athletics (IAAF) also announced a five-person inspection team which will monitor the clean-up process in Russia.
Norwegian anti-doping expert Rune Andersen, who is heading the probe, told Reuters he did not rule out the chance of Russia putting their house in order in time for them to compete in the Aug. 5-21 Rio Games.
"We said we'll show you the road out of this and it's up to you whether you take it," said Pound. "We can't force you but you're not going to like what we say about the things we found.
"So you can either fight the findings or say, 'ok we've got to change'. If they want to be there for Rio they've got to really act. They've got to bite the bullet and go full speed ahead to really get all this done in time for Rio.
"If they start fighting over everything then fine, take your time, all the time you want but you are not going to work on your tan (in Brazil) next summer."

Jeff Banister of the American League Texas Rangers and Joe Maddon of the National League Chicago Cubs, who both produced turnaround seasons, won Manager of the Year honors in results announced on Tuesday.
Maddon, a two-time winner of the American League award while managing the Tampa Bay Rays, directed the Cubs to 97 wins, 24 more than in 2014, for the third-best record in Major League Baseball and a wild card berth in the playoffs.
Banister, in his first season as a major league manager, oversaw an improvement of 21 games to 88 victories that gave the injury-hit Rangers the AL West title.
The Texas manager received 17 of 30 first-place votes and 112 points, 30 more than runner-up A.J. Hinch of the Houston Astros (eight first-place votes). The third finalist, Minnesota Twins' Paul Molitor, had 33 points and two first-place votes.
Maddon claimed 18 first-place votes on his way to 124 points, with St. Louis Cardinals skipper Mike Matheny next with 87 points and nine first-place votes. Mets manager Terry Collins finished third with 49 points and three top votes.
Voting members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America cast ballots prior to postseason games.
Banister's Rangers overcame a spate of injuries, most prominently Japanese pitching ace Yu Darvish, who was lost for the season, and made a late-season charge to claim the division title despite standing 8-1/2 games off the pace in August.
Maddon, in his first season in charge of the Cubs, relied on a core of talented young players, including NL Rookie of the Year Kris Bryant, to shrug off the team's history of failure and image as lovable losers on the way to the playoffs.
"It's really staggering to do it twice in the American League and get it in the National League and be part of this wonderful Cubs organization," said Maddon, the seventh manager to win three or more awards and seventh to win in both leagues.
"It's about the players. A lot of it has to do with the fact that we had all these young players that came to the forefront this year and are able to win 97 games.
"At the end of the day, it's a players' game. To be the steward of this wonderful group of young players, I feel very fortunate," Maddon told MLB TV.
Banister was also humbled.
"I'm truly honored and blessed," said Banister, who had never managed above the Double A minor league level before this season. "It's an organizational award for me. I get to accept the award for an entire organization."

New York state's top prosecutor on Tuesday filed for a temporary injunction that would shut down daily fantasy sports leaders DraftKings and FanDuel in the state in the latest blow to the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar industry.
Daily fantasy sports gaming "is nothing more than a rebranding of sports betting," New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in legal documents filed in a Manhattan trial court. "It is plainly illegal."
In response to the state attorney general's moves, FanDuel stopped allowing New Yorkers to participate in paid contests as of Tuesday afternoon.
"We believe that this restriction is temporary and we hope to be able to offer our paid contests to New Yorkers again very soon," FanDuel said.
DraftKings, however, has pledged to continue running its business as usual in the state.
New York has more daily fantasy sports players than any other U.S. state, according to Eilers Research, so being forced to shut down there could cripple the companies.
The move by Schneiderman, which was expected, followed a failed effort on Monday by the two fantasy sports companies to obtain a separate court order that would have headed off Schneiderman's proceeding.
A hearing on the injunction is set for Nov. 25.

GAME OF SKILL OR CHANCE?
Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online. Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey.
Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game, have developed over the past decade. Players draft teams in games played in just one evening or over a weekend.
Schneiderman last week sent cease and desist letters to DraftKings and FanDuel, demanding that they stop taking money from players in the state.
While the letter established Schneiderman's view that daily fantasy sports are illegal gambling, he must obtain a court order to shut the companies down in New York state.
Schneiderman, in the legal papers filed on Tuesday, argued that daily fantasy sports contests are not games of skill, which are allowed in the state, but games of chance, citing the companies' investor presentations and comments by their chief executives.
For example, Schneiderman pointed to a DraftKings presentation to prospective investors that makes comparisons to poker and sports wagering.
Moreover, the attorney general said the companies had "basic compliance issues," encouraging their employees to play daily fantasy sports games on their competitors' platforms.
Schneiderman also said in the DraftKings complaint that nearly 90 percent of daily fantasy sports players lost money in 2013 and 2014, citing the company's data.
The injunction requested in New York is the latest threat to the daily fantasy sports industry. The two companies have become the subject of congressional inquiries as well as a ban in Nevada after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on television advertising in 2015.
DraftKings has contacted the sales division of at least one television network asking for flexibility for their ad commitments and are asking to shift some money out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter of next year, according to sources familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous because the conversations were confidential.
A spokesman for DraftKings said the company has not specifically asked to move ads from the fourth to the first quarter.

LONDON England beat France 2-0 in an emotional friendly at Wembley on Tuesday when more than 70,000 fans paid tribute to the victims of the Paris attacks with English fans roaring out a spine-tingling rendition of the visitors' national anthem.
The supporters of both teams also impeccably observed a minute's silence to honour the victims ahead of a match that will be remembered more for the symbolic nature of the occasion than for most of the action on the pitch.
Played just four days after the Islamic State's assault in  Paris left 129 people dead, the English fans, along with the away supporters, showed remarkable dignity and respect.
The players were led on to the field by Prince William and the team managers -- England's Roy Hodgson and France's Didier Deschamps -- who carried wreaths while fans waved the tricolour.
"It was a very poignant occasion and we achieved all the things we wanted to achieve in the rememberance. An act of defiance was better than the other alternative," said Hodgson.
France defender Laurent Koscielny, who plays for Arsenal, added: "It was important for everybody that we played, for those who were watching us and for the victims. I know the English, they have a lot of respect for the French, we saw that tonight."
After kickoff, although France appeared to settle first, almost relieved the pre-match observations were over, England held the upper hand and took a grip with goals from man of the match Dele Alli and Wayne Rooney either side of halftime.
Understandably, after a traumatic few days, France found the going tough on the Wembley turf. "The performance was not easy for us. We had a lack of aggression and concentration but I think maybe it's a bit normal," Lloris said.

OUTSTANDING ALLI
England midfielder Alli, 19, blasted the ball past his Tottenham Hotspur club goalkeeper Lloris into the top corner for his first international goal after 39 minutes.
"He was almost faultless, he was outstanding," Hodgson said of Alli, who was winning his fourth cap on his first start."
Rooney, playing in what is becoming a more usual deep-lying role, doubled England's lead in the 48th minute after Alli, who started the move, found Raheem Sterling who crossed for Rooney to volley home his 51st international goal.
England striker Harry Kane twice went close to scoring, including a searing long-range drive in the second half which flew just wide.
England, who played poorly in a 2-0 friendly defeat away to Spain on Friday, had not beaten France in six meetings since 1997, but the visitors never made it easy for the home side on what was obviously a difficult evening for their players.
The visitors' best chance fell to midfielder Yohan Cabaye of Crystal Palace, one of 13 players in the 23-man France squad who are playing, or have played, their club football in England. His seventh minute shot flew just over Joe Hart's crossbar.

DIFFICULT NIGHT
The unusual nature of the occasion was clear during the game with the crowd applauding France substitutes Lassana Diarra and Antoine Griezmann when they came on in the second half.
A cousin of Diarra's was killed in Friday's attacks, while Griezmann's sister escaped unhurt from the Bataclan concert venue where 89 people lost their lives.
There was hardly a foul during the game and afterwards the fans and the England team roundly applauded the France players.
"It was a difficult night for everyone, especially for the  French players and staff," Rooney said.
"I thought both teams handled it really well. I'm sure this will get shown round the world and show the togetherness and unity in ourselves and France and in football.
"As Didier Deschamps said, it's not about religion, it's not about race, it's about togetherness.
"Anyone can play the game of football and hopefully tonight shows whoever you are around the world, you can come together. We need to stand tall and stand together at this tough time."

AMSTERDAM A friendly soccer match between Germany and the Netherlands was canceled on Wednesday because police in host city Hanover received a "concrete threat," Dutch TV broadcaster NOSH reported, citing police.
The stadium was evacuated and two Dutch government ministers were ushered away to catch a flight home.

BRUSSELS A soccer friendly between Belgium and Spain scheduled for Brussels on Tuesday has been postponed for security reasons after the Paris attacks, the Belgian soccer federation (URBSFA) said.
"The URBSFA was contacted by the government this evening and advised not to organize the Belgium-Spain match tomorrow evening," it said in a statement late on Monday.
The statement, in French, said the game between the European heavyweights had been canceled though a tweet from the URBSFA official English account said it had been only postponed.
More information would be made available to ticket holders later this week, the statement added.
The federation explained the advice was due to the current state of high alert and a Belgian-based French suspect from Friday's attacks being on the run.
"We deeply regret that such a friendly match between two motivated teams is canceled so late and we understand the disappointment of many supporters," the federation said.
"Taking into account the exceptional circumstances, we cannot however take any security risk for our players and fans."
The match had been thrown into doubt following Friday's attacks in Paris, particularly after investigators identified a Belgian national as the possible mastermind, with Brussels seen as the springboard.
"We have no idea why the game was called off but we can imagine," Spain coach Vicente del Bosque told reporters.
"We wanted to play the match, our final one of the year," he added in an impromptu news conference on the team aircraft on Tuesday.
"It wasn't to be and the best thing is to get back to Madrid as quickly as possible and that the players rejoin their clubs."
France were playing Germany in Paris last Friday as a wave of attacks hit the city, killing at least 129 people.
The friendly match at the Stade de France was targeted by some of the attackers though they did not get into the stadium.
The French side will play England in London on Tuesday.
Major sporting events throughout France were suspended at the weekend.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado The World Anti-Doping Agency's crucial two-day meeting aimed at mapping out a future plan for the global war on drugs began on Tuesday under a veil of secrecy.
WADA's hierarchy will spend much of the gathering at the posh Colorado resort assessing the findings of its independent report into allegations of widespread doping, corruption and collusion in Russian athletics.
Described by one official as a defining moment for the global anti-doping agency, the meeting could mark the start of a dramatic restructuring of WADA and their role in the war against performance-enhancing drugs in sport.
But as anti-doping crusaders gathered, media were denied access into the building while those already inside were asked to leave the property.
Media will be allowed to attend the agency's foundation board meeting on Wednesday and have access to members but TV crews and reporters were kept at arm's length when the powerful executive committee met on Tuesday.
The executive committee will spend the day going through a packed agenda that includes the official decertification of the Moscow lab which processed blood and urine samples from Russian athletes on behalf of the athletics federation.
The independent commission report, led by former WADA chief Dick Pound, alleged that the lab destroyed samples despite being told by WADA to preserve them, and that staff took bribes from athletes or their coaches in exchange for covering up positive tests.
The executive committee will take their recommendations to the foundation board on Wednesday for approval.

CAPE TOWN Wheelchair-bound athletes could face tougher checks at next year's Rio Paralympics to stop them risking their health by sitting on their scrotums, or clamping off catheters to fill their bladders, in order to boost adrenaline and performance.
Officials said on Tuesday the International Paralympic Committee is reviewing guidelines against "boosting", a practice employed by some athletes with spinal cord injuries.
Banned for more than a decade, it does not use any artificial stimulants. Instead, it involves tricking the brain into triggering "autonomic dysreflexia" (AD), causing the body to flush with adrenaline to achieve more power and greater oxygen uptake during races.
Squeezing the scrotum or filling and then tapping the bladder are the most common external stimuli to induce AD, resulting in elevated heart rates and blood pressure.
Research shows deliberately induced AD can enhance athletic performance by as much as 10 percent, especially in endurance events such as long-distance wheelchair races.
But it can also raise blood pressure to dangerously high levels, leading to strokes and even death. Besides athletics, authorities are also monitoring hand-cycling, rowing and wheelchair rugby.
"The problem with the pathology of a spinal cord injury is that this response is deviated to the cardio-vascular system, including hypertension and increased heart rate," IPC medical and scientific director Peter Van de Vliet told Reuters.
"About 30 to 40 out of 4,300 athletes for Rio are vulnerable to this mechanism," he said in a telephone interview.

STRETCHING BOUNDARIES
The Paralympic movement has largely escaped the drugs scandals that have tainted able-bodied athletics. Revelations of state-backed doping among Russian athletes are the latest in a string of high-profile disclosures to hit the sport.
But with the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro aiming to cement its position as a major global sporting event, the movement is strengthening its defenses against cheating.
"The profile of Paralympics sports has increased and that carries with it an intrinsic risk that people will try to stretch boundaries, by means of technology, by means of unauthorized substances and whatever is humanly possible," Van de Vliet said.
He said the IPC is considering plans to lower the 180 mm of mercury threshold it uses in a standard blood pressure test to detect boosting.
"We now have the data and it shows the majority of athletes are way below 180 mm," Van de Vliet said of a testing and education program in place since the Beijing Games of 2008.
If an athlete’s blood pressure is over 180, they are given 10 minutes to cool off before another pre-race test. The normal blood pressure during a rest period for high spinal cord-injured athletes is around 100 over 60 or 90 over 60.
Imposing a lower threshold could detect more boosters and have a deterrent effect, said Van de Vliet, adding that no athlete has so far ever been handed the minimum two-year sanction.
However, this could change should the new rules be adopted, he said. Most of the IPC’s doping sanctions, which include life bans, involve athletes competing in power-lifting.
“People think that the Paralympics is a more benign version of the Olympic Games and that it is not as pointed, as targeted and as fierce," said Wayne Derman, the IPC’s chief medical officer at October’s Doha championships.
"That is such a wrong misconception," he said.

DUBAI Rory McIlroy is surprised to still be the frontrunner for a third European money list title in four years this week after sitting out this month's BMW Masters in Shanghai.
McIlroy can seal the money list crown, known as the Race to Dubai, by winning the season-ending $8 million DP World Tour Championship, which begins in the emirate on Thursday.
Danny Willett could have overtaken the four-time major winner in the standings, but the Englishman finished joint 28th on Sunday and trails by 1,613 points.
“I didn't think I would still be there,” McIlroy told a news conference. “I felt a few guys had a chance last week to overtake me. That didn't quite materialize.”
Earlier, Willett said he hoped he and McIlroy would be fighting it out to the last hole on Dubai’s Earth course, but the Northern Irishman was less enamored by such a scenario.
“I just want to win the tournament,” said McIlroy. “I don't care who finishes second, third. If I am the champion at the end of the week, it means that I win The Race to Dubai and that's all I'm really thinking about.”
McIlroy has endured a topsy-turvy season. He won February’s Dubai Desert Classic to cement his position as the world number one, but finished fourth at April’s U.S Masters while chasing the only major title he has yet to win.
Two further victories followed but in July, he ruptured ankle ligaments playing football and missed out on the chance to defend his British Open crown.
United States’ Jordan Spieth and Australia’s Jason Day have since usurped the 26-year-old in the world rankings, with McIlroy now number three.
“When I came back toward the end of the summer and into autumn, the right and left ankles weren't quite feeling the same but it was still good enough to do what I needed to do,” he said. “Now they feel exactly the same, which is great.”
He and Willett are two of seven players that can win the Race to Dubai. Also, in the frame are Justin Rose, Shane Lowry, Louis Oosthuizen, Branden Grace and Byeong-hun An, but McIlroy will be favorite after winning the Dubai event in 2012 and making top-five finishes five years out of six on the Earth course.
“This course plays into the long hitters' hands,” McIlroy added. “There's some carries that if you can carry the ball sort of 300 off the tee, you can really shorten some of the par 4s and it gives you a big advantage on the par 5s.”

The world governing body of athletics (IAAF) has announced the five-person inspection team which will monitor the clean-up process in Russia, which has been suspended from the sport over widespread, state-sponsored doping.
Russia was barred on Friday after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report accused its state security services of colluding with the country's athletics federation (ARAF) to enable athletes to take performance-enhancing drugs with confidence that test results would be suppressed.
IAAF president Sebastian Coe has said that ARAF can only return to athletics once it had proved it had set up a new framework to stop doping.
Former Olympic sprinter Frankie Fredericks from Namibia was among the four IAAF council members who will join Norwegian anti-doping expert Rune Andersen, who had been named as the independent head of the team on Friday.
"I have devoted my life to clean sport and it’s on behalf of the innocent athletes who are Russia’s athletics future that we begin our task to ensure that fair and honest competition is guaranteed,” said Andersen in an IAAF statement.
The other members on the team will be Abby Hoffman from Canada, Anna Riccardi of Italy and Geoff Gardner from the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.
“The team...has an extraordinary amount of experience to ensure ARAF meets the criteria and is eligible to once again enter athletes into international competition,” said Coe.

BERLIN Russia's track and field athletes should be banned from competing at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics in order to send a strong signal against doping, the Institute of National Doping Organisations (INADO) said on Tuesday.
"The ARAF – Russia’s national federation for athletics – and its athletes must be suspended from the 2016 Rio de Janeiro summer Olympic Games. The corruption in Russian athletics deserves no less," INADO, the Germany-based umbrella  organization with 53 members worldwide, said in a statement.
"ARAF has not demonstrated that they are capable of sending a clean team to Games. A strong deterrent message must be sent that national federations cannot participate in the highest levels of competition when anti-doping has been intentionally subverted."
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended ARAF last week following allegations of widespread and state-sponsored doping as detailed in a World Anti-Doping Agency independent commission report.
Russia has since announced a three-month road map to clean up its act, with the nation's Olympic Committee leading efforts to ensure honest athletes can compete at the 2016 Games.
Russia said on Sunday it would ask the world athletics body to allow its athletes to compete under an Olympic banner rather than the Russian flag to circumvent a ban, but the idea was quickly brushed aside by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
"The actions by the ARAF, which deliberately flouted the rules of sport, have tainted all Russian athletes in the sport of Athletics," INADO said.
"The corruption of anti-doping uncovered by the independent commission is a tragedy for sport and for clean athletes everywhere. It reinforces the need for anti-doping work to be conducted independent of sport organizations and without government interference.

LONDON Russian Athletics needs to prove it can operate without interference from state security services if it is to compete on an international stage again, the author of an explosive anti-doping report said on Tuesday.
Russia was suspended from international athletics after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report accused its state security services of colluding with the country's athletics federation to enable athletes to take performance-enhancing drugs with confidence test results would be suppressed.
Dick Pound, author of the WADA report, told the BBC Russia's anti-doping laboratory and anti-doping agency needed to prove they could act freely of government pressure in order to bring an end to a state-sponsored drugs culture.
"They'll have to find a new laboratory director that will satisfy the world anti-doping agency as to his or her ... willingness to make sure that the laboratory acts independently and is not subject to any pressures regarding the non-disclosure of positive samples," he said.
"As far as the Russian anti-doping agency is concerned it's a matter again of making sure that it operates independently of the government of Russia, even though it will be funded by it."

"INTIMIDATION"
The allegations marked Russia's biggest sporting scandal in  decades and could cost it a place at next year's Rio Olympics. They also carry political resonance, international sporting prestige being an important element in President Vladimir Putin's re-assertion of national identity.
Amongst the charges, the report said the presence of Russian security services in the Moscow anti-doping laboratory "actively imposed an atmosphere of intimidation on laboratory process and staff".
It said the WADA-accredited laboratory destroyed 1,417 samples shortly before an inspection.
As a result, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted overwhelmingly to suspend the Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF). IAAF also stands accused of "systematic failures" and its former president Lamine Diack is under investigation on suspicion of corruption.
The scandal, and revelations of graft within soccer's world governing body FIFA, point to broader problems of mismanagement and misconduct across international sport.
Asked by BBC Radio if he could see a "way out" for Russia, he replied: I think if there is a will there is certainly a way.
"While I don't think you can necessarily change the culture that has developed over the years you can certainly change the conduct pretty quickly if you want to."

In a campaign plagued by changing quarterbacks and critical injuries, wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has remained a constant for the Houston Texans, emerging as one of the top catchers in the NFL.
With his flowing hair and highlight reel grabs, the third-year Hopkins has single-handedly kept the Houston offense afloat during a tumultuous season.
Hopkins once again worked his magic on Monday when he sparked the Texans to a 10-6 upset victory over the previously undefeated Cincinnati Bengals.
After Houston lost their starting quarterback Brian Hoyer to a potential concussion in the third quarter, Hopkins caught a one-handed touchdown pass from backup T.J. Yates to put his team ahead for good.
"Unbelievable catch," Texans defensive end J.J. Watt told reporters of Hopkins' acrobatic leap and left-handed grab.
"(Hopkins is) having a heck of a year. I don't think people give him enough credit for what he's been doing. But he's an incredible receiver."    Hopkins' catch was just the latest of his aerial show as he has made a habit of spectacular leaping grabs and once caught a pass off his helmet earlier this year.
The 23-year-old has also recorded TD receptions from three different quarterbacks during a Texans campaign that has had uncertainty at the QB position.
Four-time Pro Bowl running back Arian Foster has also been a big loss for Houston after he played in just four games before a season-ending injury.
But Hopkins has carried the load with 71 catches for 920 yards and seven touchdowns through just nine games.
Houston (4-5) has fed off the production and is now tied for first place in the AFC South with the Indianapolis Colts.
Drafted in the first round by the Texans in 2013, Hopkins learned under longtime standout receiver Andre Johnson.
But after Johnson and Houston parted ways and he signed with the Colts in the off-season, Hopkins assumed the lead role in the passing game and has not looked back.
"He's one of the best receivers in the league," Yates said. "If he's got one on one coverage that's a good match-up."

(The Sports Xchange) - Veteran forward Dirk Nowitzki scored seven of his 21 points in the final three-and-a-half minutes as the Dallas Mavericks held off the winless Philadelphia 76ers 92-86 on Monday.
Forward Chandler Parsons added a season-high 20 (all in the first half) for Dallas, who used a game-ending 11-4 rush to win its fourth straight game. Guard Deron Williams contributed 12 points and six assists.
The Mavericks (7-4) beat Philadelphia for the sixth consecutive time but it was far from easy, with Dallas shooting just 39.5 percent from the floor, compared to 44.7 percent for Philadelphia, as they were out-rebounded 46-39.
While the Mavs forced 27 turnovers, they committed 19 themselves.
"This is a hard team to get good shots against," Dallas coach Rick Carlisle told reporters of the Sixers.
"They have young, motivated guys on small contracts. They're playing their (butts) off. It's good to see from a competitive standpoint but it makes it hard to get shots."
That includes Nowitzki, a perennial All-Star, who missed 10 of his 16 attempts from the floor.
"They kept staying in the game, clawing and scratching," he said. "And they're obviously desperate to get their first win. We had to dig deep and grind it out."
Rookie center Jahlil Okafor had 19 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Sixers (0-11), who have dropped 21 straight contests dating back to March 25, when it beat the Denver Nuggets.
Rookie guard T.J. McConnell had a season-high 13 points, as well as seven rebounds and six assists for Philadelphia. Forward Jerami Grant also scored a season-high 13 points, and forward Nerlens Noel chipped in 12 points and 12 rebounds.
The Sixers' turnover total was, however, a season high, and it resulted in 28 Dallas points.
"You're not going to win any basketball games with 27 turnovers," Sixers coach Brett Brown said.
Philadelphia, which trailed by 19 in the first half, rallied to lead on three occasions in the fourth quarter, the last time at 82-81 on Noel's free throw with 4:23 left.
Nowitzki, fouled by McConnell while attempting a jumper from the left baseline with 3:23 to play, sank two free throws to put Dallas ahead to stay.
Williams added a jumper with 2:41 left and Nowitzki drilled two free throws 21 seconds later.
After a dunk by Okafor, Nowitzki took a pass from center Zaza Pachulia and nailed a three-pointer from the left wing with 1:47 remaining to give the Mavs a 90-84 cushion.

Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning will sit out this Sunday's road game against the Chicago Bears after struggling with multiple injuries this season, the team said on Monday.
Manning, who was benched after throwing four interceptions and completing just 5-of-20 passes for 35 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, will be replaced as by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler.
"I told the team that this week Peyton is not going to play, that Brock is going to play this week and all of our full attention is going to be on getting Peyton back and healthy," Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said during a news conference.
"I know that's the best decision for him (Manning), for us to get him back and healthy, and we need to know where we are heading this week ... getting Brock and our football team ready to play Chicago.
"All our focus is in that direction as we move forward here today. I've gotta do what's best for the player, for the team. I've been through it as a player. It's a different week for (Osweiler)."
Kubiak said that the 39-year-old Manning had been struggling in recent weeks with a shoulder injury, painful ribs and a partially torn plantar fascia in his right foot.
"I just think it's the grind of the season," Kubiak added. "He was doing everything he could to play for his football team."
Manning, a 14-time Pro Bowl selection, became the National Football League's all-time passing yards leader early in Sunday's game against the Chiefs before he was benched after delivering one of the worst performances of his Hall of Fame career.
Kubiak said after the game that he probably should not have started the veteran quarterback.
"He came in Saturday and his ribs were bothering him a little bit. I probably should have made the decision not to play him in the game," Kubiak told reporters. "I'm disappointed in myself. This is on me."
Manning, a seven-time All-Pro, has just nine touchdowns and a league-high 17 interceptions this season, a far cry from the numbers he has racked up as one of the game's best quarterbacks.
The Broncos are 7-2 this season and lead the AFC West.

New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz will have season-ending surgery on his left calf to resolve an injury he suffered during training camp, the National Football League team said on  Monday.
Cruz, 29, tore the patellar tendon in his right knee in October last year and has not played for the Giants this season due to his calf injury.
"It's very disappointing and I feel very badly for Victor." Giants head coach Tom Coughlin said during a news conference.
"In terms of this one issue, (it is) obviously most difficult to get over the hump with. He's going to have this taken care of and hopefully it will solve the issue and he can move forward, and so can we."
Cruz, a Pro Bowl selection in 2012, had spoken about his season-ending surgery earlier on Monday in a video posted on Bleacher Report's 'Uninterrupted' site.
"This hurts because I've worked so hard to come back from patellar tendon surgery, fought hard day in and day out, rehab, physical work, strength work," said Cruz.
"(I) felt like I was back to 100 percent and then the calf happens and it's tough thing to go through. It's a tough thing to go through emotionally, physically."
The Giants, who were beaten 27-26 by the New England Patriots on Sunday, are 5-5 this season but still lead the four-team National Football Conference East division.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado Anti-doping crusaders losing ground in the war on drugs in sport will meet this week to discuss dramatic new battle plans including a more robust role for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Fallout from the WADA Independent Commission report into allegations of widespread doping, corruption and collusion in Russian athletics will dominate the agenda when WADA's executive committee and foundation board meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.
WADA's Foundation Board, which represents governments and the Olympic Movement, are expected to vote and formally suspend the Moscow laboratory that is alleged to have participated in a coverup while several other countries face warnings and possible sanctions for non-compliance of the new WADA Code.
A large part of the allegations in the 323-page report centers around the Moscow lab which processed samples from Russian athletes on behalf of the athletics federation, and tested them for banned performance-enhancing drugs.
The report alleged that the laboratory destroyed samples despite being told by WADA to preserve them, and that staff took bribes from athletes or their coaches in exchange for covering up positive tests. Russian authorities said WADA itself asked them to destroy them.
Much of the meeting, however, is expected to be spent taking a clinical look at the current structure set up to combat doping.
Described by one WADA official as a defining moment for the global anti-doping agency, officials are expected to debate an International Olympic Committee (IOC) proposal to have the Montreal-based agency take over drug testing from federations.
WADA, with a current annual budget of $31 million, has previously dismissed the plan as unrealistic saying it would need hundreds of millions of dollars to take on such a massive logistical challenge.
However, the Independent Commission led by former WADA chief Dick Pound has exposed glaring deficiencies in the anti-doping fight and the urgent need for a new game plan.
Pound suggested that his report only scratched the surface and the shocking revelations were only the “tip of the iceberg” alluding to wider corruption outside of Russian athletics.
The Canadian lawyer and IOC member will be on hand to brief members on his report and could offer some hints at what his investigation uncovered beyond the events in Russia.
Some believe the scandal could have bigger ramifications than the graft affair at FIFA, where president Sepp Blatter has been suspended, 14 officials and marketing executives have been indicted, and Switzerland is investigating the awarding of two World Cups hosting duties to Russia and Qatar.

LONDON Andy Murray said he would put security concerns about next week's Davis Cup final in Belgium to the back of his mind despite several arrests near Brussels in connection with last Friday's deadly attacks in Paris.
Police in Belgium's capital have detained two suspects in connection with the attacks while a Belgian national living in Syria has been identified as the possible mastermind.
The Davis Cup final takes place in Ghent, about 50km from Brussels, and Murray was asked at the ATP World Tour Finals on Monday whether he was concerned.
"I think everybody right now is concerned about things," the 28-year-old told reporters. "But I do think the best thing that we can do is to live our normal lives, not change too much, because then the terrorists are the ones that are winning.
"We need to go out there and do what we always do and try not to change too much. That's all we can do. I don't want to live my life in fear each time I step on a tennis court."

Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell ended a title drought of more than two years on the PGA Tour with a wonder shot to cap a spectacular playoff victory in the weather-delayed OHL Classic at Mayakoba in Mexico on Monday.
McDowell sealed the win after very nearly holing out with a five-iron on the first extra hole at the El Camaleon Golf Club in Playa del Carmen, his approach shot grazing the rim of the cup before finishing just three feet away.
The 36-year-old tapped in for birdie at the par-four 18th to edge out Scotland's Russell Knox and American Jason Bohn, the trio having finished the regulation 72 holes at 18-under-par 266.
McDowell, who had not won on the PGA Tour since the RBC Heritage in April 2013, closed with a five-under 66, Knox with a matching 66 and Bohn with a 68.
McDowell, who had endured a mediocre year by his own standards with just one top-10 in 15 starts on the 2014-15 PGA Tour, was thrilled to see his hard work on the practice range over the past three months finally pay off with a win.
"I've been dreaming of this day and I said that I was going to appreciate it when it came," the 2010 U.S. Open champion told reporters after clinching the third PGA Tour title of his career.
"I'm going to appreciate this one, because this year has been a grind. You go through a year like this and you think, 'Am I finished? Am I not good enough?' You ask yourself all the questions.
"This is a result of three or four months of grinding. I've been working hard on my swing ... and you've got to take the rough with the smooth and keep trying."
Knox, who had led by one stroke with just one hole to play in regulation, had to settle for a runner-up spot in his bid to clinch consecutive PGA Tour titles on different continents.
"I gave it my best shot and got beat by a great birdie there," the 30-year-old Scot said of McDowell's stunning approach on the first extra hole.
Knox, who eight days ago won the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai, was at 19 under playing the 18th at El Camaleon but hit his tee shot into a fairway bunker en route to a bogey, forcing a three-way playoff for the title.
Twenty-seven players had been unable to complete the 72 holes on Sunday after the final round was interrupted by inclement weather that led to a delay of nearly four hours.

LONDON France will be keen to represent their colors with more pride than ever when they take the field in a friendly against England at Wembley four days after the deadly attacks in Paris, coach Dider Deschamps said on Monday.
The decision to play the highly emotional game was taken on Saturday morning by French federation president Noel Le Graet and Deschamps.
"We are here now to take the field to represent our country probably with even more pride than we normally would and to make sure that our colors, blue, white, and red, will be represented with more pride," Deschamps told a news conference at Wembley on the eve of the game.
"It will be much more than a sports event. We are here to represent our country and show that we are proud to be French in a historical stadium and I want to thank the English fans for their messages of solidarity.
"It will be an emotional game."
Les Bleus were playing Germany at the Stade de France on Friday when three explosions were heard outside the stadium as suicide bombers blew themselves up, killing one.
In central Paris, gunmen attacked bars, restaurants and a concert hall killing an additional 128 in the worst atrocity in France since World War II.
"We were focused on our game on Friday," said Deschamps. "We were told what happened at the end of the match."
Players and staff stayed inside the stadium with their German counterparts until late in the night before they decided the England friendly should go ahead as scheduled.

GREAT MOMENT
"To play or not to play we had doubts but the situation was well managed by the coach and the president," said captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.
"It will be a great moment of solidarity. The last three days have been traumatic. We mourned, together."
Before the news conference, British reporters laid flowers with a note saying "Vive la France", one of many signs of solidarity that have been made all over the world.
Wembley fans have been urged to sing the French national anthem, with a few British newspapers printing the lyrics of the French national anthem, La Marseillaise.
"La Marseillaise sung by the English will make the moment even greater," said Lloris, who plays in England for Tottenham Hotspur.
"We are very moved by all the messages of support in England and indeed across the world. Tomorrow, representing France as a nation will be more important than merely representing French football."

MOSCOW Russia will not boycott the Rio Olympics after being suspended from the International Association of Athletics Federations over a doping scandal, RIA news agency cited Russian Olympic Committee head Alexander Zhukov as saying on Monday.

PARIS UEFA has confirmed that the 2016 European Championship soccer tournament will take place in France as planned despite the deadly attacks that struck Paris on Friday.
"The EURO final draw will go ahead as scheduled on 12 December at the Palais des Congres in Paris and the final tournament will be played in France from 10 June to 10 July 2016," UEFA said in a statement on Monday.
Coordinated attacks, for which Islamic State has claimed responsibility, took place in Paris bars, restaurants, a concert hall and outside a soccer stadium on Friday killing at least 129 people and wounding 352 -- the worst atrocity in France since World War II.
"Following the dramatic events that occurred last Friday in Paris, UEFA and EURO 2016 SAS wish to reaffirm their commitment in placing safety and security at the center of their organizational plans," the statement read.
"While there is no reason to believe that the EURO might become the target of any attack, the potential terrorist threat has always been taken into account, since the beginning of the project."
On Saturday, organizing committee president Jacques Lambert said the risk level around the Euro 2016 finals had "gone up".
"EURO 2016 SAS and all stakeholders involved in the organization of the tournament will continue their joint work and will regularly monitor the level of risk for the tournament and their respective organizational plans," UEFA added.
"For over three years now, EURO 2016 SAS has been working closely with the relevant authorities to develop the most appropriate mechanisms in order to guarantee there is a safe and secure tournament and we are confident that the necessary measures will be taken to ensure that is the case for all involved."

LONDON Andy Murray fought past a dogged David Ferrer to win his opening match at the ATP World Tour Finals on Monday, showing no sign of being distracted by next week's Davis Cup final in Belgium.
The Briton, aiming to win the prestigious season-ender for the first time in his career, needed to be at full tilt to finally subdue his Spanish opponent 6-4 6-4.
After Sunday's two opening singles in the other group saw easy wins for world number one Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, Murray and Ferrer produced some absorbing rallies in a near-capacity O2 Stadium.
World number two Murray took the first set when Ferrer, trailing 4-5, served a double-fault.
But he was broken to love at the start of the second set and 33-year-old terrier Ferrer seemed to have the bit between his teeth before dropping serve in the sixth game.
An increasingly-confident Murray piled on the pressure and Ferrer again buckled at 4-5 with Murray completing victory with a volley into an open court.
Murray had spent most of the build-up to the tournament practising on clay in preparation for next week's Davis Cup final in Ghent where he hopes to lead his country to the title for the first time since 1936.
Later on Monday in Ilie Nastase Group Ferrer's compatriot Rafael Nadal, who missed the tournament last year, takes on French Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka.

LONDON France wanted Tuesday's friendly international against England to go ahead at Wembley Stadium mainly for symbolic reasons following Friday's deadly attacks in Paris, said FA chief executive Martin Glenn.
"The eyes of the world will be on the game. It's important to do something to show that terrorism can’t win," Glenn told a packed news conference which focused mainly on the security situation ahead of the match.
France were playing Germany in Paris on Friday as a wave of attacks hit the city, killing at least 132 people.
The France squad spent Friday night inside the Stade de France with their Germany counterparts after their 2-0 friendly win over the world champions.
"We spoke to the French Federation on Saturday, and were in touch with the French presidents' office and there were two conditions to hold the game," added Glenn.
"UK authorities and government need to make sure it was safe and the French wanted to play. They wanted to go ahead, for mainly symbolic reasons, and we were very happy to meet their concerns."
England manager Roy Hodgson added: "It will be tough I'm sure for the French players but I'm sure it will be a chance for them to do the country proud. They'll give everything they can to make France proud."
Glenn advised supporters to get to the game early because of the extra security checks that will be carried out in the wake of the attacks that also left more than 350 people wounded.
Islamic State claimed responsibility and said it sent militants with suicide bombing belts and carrying machine guns to various locations in the heart of Paris.
Glenn added: "I just want to reconfirm that the security apparatus and the people that advise us say that there is no material risk so the game should go ahead. We would like fans to turn up earlier and we will do more checks."
France midfielder Lassana Diarra's cousin, Asta Diakite, was among those killed on Friday, while striker Antoine Griezmann's sister escaped from the Bataclan theater where 89 people died.
A bystander and three suicide bombers died in explosions outside the stadium while the game was being played.
The France squad has arrived in London for Tuesday's match with England, whose players observed a Europe-wide minute's silence at 1100 GMT before their training session on Monday.
Wembley's iconic arch will be lit in the red, white and blue of the French flag to show solidarity and screens outside the ground will show the motto 'Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite'
The words of the French national anthem will be shown on screens before the match, with Glenn saying: "We will be singing it in French. I think that will be a powerful thing."

SYDNEY The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) could face recommendations that include suspension from the Olympics when the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) report is released, according to one of the doping body's independent commissioners.
Any decision to suspend the IAAF from the Games would need to be made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The IAAF is reeling from the aftermath of a major doping scandal that has led to Russia's provisional suspension from all competition following a WADA report that uncovered evidence of state-controlled doping in the country.
IAAF president Sebastian Coe has conceded there are "unlikely to be many tomorrows for athletics" [L8N1391EV] and WADA commissioner Richard McLaren did not rule out a provisional suspension for the world governing body of track and field.
"That might well be some recommendations that come forward when we do the second phase of our report," McLaren told Australia's ABC radio when asked if the IAAF could face a possible suspension from next year's Rio Games.
"We had to withold some information relating to the international athletics federation because of the possibility that if we disclosed it it would jeopardize ongoing criminal enquiries that are being conducted by the French police.
"We really haven't reported on the IAAF so we haven't made the recommendations, we haven't even revealed our findings in relation to the IAAF because of the ongoing sensitivities of the criminal investigation but we will be doing that in the next report.
"I think I need to leave it at that."
In response to McLaren's comments, the IAAF said focus was on making the Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF) "compliant for re-entry into international competition".
"Our job right now is to focus on the work that needs to be done to make ARAF compliant with the IAAF and, together with WADA, compliant for re-entry into international competition," an IAAF statement read.
"We will continue to work alongside WADA with whom we developed the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) to review its processes and, if any failings are found, redress them and we have already begun a root and branch reform program within the IAAF.”  
Former IAAF president Lamine Diack is being probed by the French authorities after the 82-year-old Senegalese was alleged to have received more than one million euros ($1.07 million) in bribes in 2011 to cover up positive doping tests of Russian athletes.



Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell and Scotland's Russell Knox were in a share of the final-round lead in the OHL Classic at Mayakoba in Mexico on Sunday before play was suspended due to darkness.
McDowell, chasing his first PGA Tour victory since April 2013, was six-under for the round after 13 holes at the El Camaleon Golf Club in Playa del Carmen while Knox, who won last week's WGC-HSBC Champions event, was six-under after 12 holes.
The final round, which will resume Monday at 8 a.m. ET (1300 GMT), was interrupted by inclement weather and the nearly four-hour delay prevented all but 27 players from finishing their rounds.
McDowell, who started the day three shots behind overnight leader Derek Fathauer, picked up three strokes with a string of birdies starting at the par-five fifth hole.
The 2010 U.S. Open champion maintained that form on the back nine where he birdied the 10th, 12th and 13th holes before being forced off the course with a 19-under total of 200.
Knox, who triumphed in his World Golf Championship debut in Shanghai, was red-hot on the front nine where he made four consecutive birdies from the par-four third hole before picking up another shot at the eighth and 11th holes.
American Jason Bohn was two shots behind the leaders with six holes to play while compatriot Fathauer was at 15-under for the tournament with six holes to play.

LONDON Swiss maestro Roger Federer will have an early chance to disprove the notion that Novak Djokovic is untouchable when they meet in their second round-robin match at the ATP World Tour Finals on Tuesday.
Federer outclassed Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-2 to kickstart his 14th consecutive appearance at the season-ender on Sunday, a few hours after world number one Djokovic had demolished Japan's world number eight Kei Nishikori 6-1 6-1.
Both already look odds on to take the top two spots in Stan Smith Group but Tuesday's 43rd meeting between the pair (both have won 21) looks set to decide who will advance to the semi-finals as group winner.
Djokovic has won his last 23 matches and has been unstoppable since he picked up his third grand slam of the year by beating Federer in the U.S. Open final.
Asked if the near 7,000-point gap between Djokovic and the rest in the ATP ranking points was proof of the Serb's invincibility, Federer was not convinced.
"That depends on who looks at the gap," Federer, who pulled out of last year's final against Djokovic with a back problem, said. "I don't think I'm that far off.
"Then again, let's speak in two days. Two days is not the match that I care the most about, to be quite honest.
"It's an important match, very important. But it's not the match. It's going to be interesting to see how I play that one. I'm curious to find out myself."
Federer knows he can ill afford the sloppy start he made against Berdych when two double faults gifted the Czech a 2-0 lead. After that, however, he barely put a foot wrong.
"It was not the best start. I have to clean that up clearly for the next match," he said.
Sunday's opening matches were reminiscent of many of the one-sided singles matches here last year, and Federer said the slowish court surface meant it was very difficult to turn around a match once you fall behind.
"Maybe it's the end of the season, maybe it's the surface, we saw the faster results here last year," he said.
"Seems like whoever takes charge of the baseline, and if you cannot serve your way out of trouble often enough, which is hard to do here because of the pace of the court, the guy from the baseline wins, the better one.
"That's why we see some crushing scores."

LONDON Novak Djokovic looked unstoppable when trouncing Kei Nishikori but for sheer swagger Roger Federer remains unrivalled as he demonstrated again when dismantling Tomas Berdych as the ATP World Tour Finals began on Sunday.
World number one Djokovic extended his latest winning sequence to 23 with a 6-1 6-1 hammering of world number eight Nishikori who was powerless to stop the rampant Serb.
Far from easing up with the finish of his best ever year a week away, Djokovic clearly wants to lay down a marker for next year's assault on the top silverware and showed Nishikori no mercy.
"No question, it felt like the best tennis I played this year," the 28-year-old, aiming for a fourth consecutive title at the O2 Arena, told reporters.
"I was at my best and it was an incredible performance."
Djokovic and Nishikori had stood heads bowed before their match to respect a minute's silence in a darkened arena for the victims of Friday's Paris attacks.
Following his immaculate performance he was presented with a trophy for the year-end number one ranking he has achieved for the fourth time in five seasons.
Home fans were given some early excitement when Jamie Murray, older brother of Andy, marked his debut at the tournament when he and Australian partner John Peers beat Italian duo Fabio Fognini and Simone Bolelli in a thriller.
But the atmosphere was subdued later as Djokovic snuffed out any chance of a shock when he thrashed a helpless Nishikori.
"He played unbelievable tennis. I'm very ashamed with this score," second-time qualifier Nishikori, who will hope for a better showing in his next two round robin matches, said.
Federer will provide Djokovic with a far sterner test when they meet in the "Stan Smith" Group on Tuesday, if his level for most of a 6-4 6-2 defeat of Berdych was anything to go by.
The 34-year-old, cheered on by a sizeable army of Swiss fans in various sorts of red and white attire, made a mess of his opening service game, falling 0-2 behind after serving two consecutive double-faults to gift Berdych a break.
But he responded with a break to love and then from 3-4 down in the opening set he produced a dazzling show reel of his favorite tricks to win seven games in a row -- throwing in a couple of his trademark half-volleyed returns for good measure.
"Was one of the worst starts I've had in years," Federer told reporters. "No first serves, two double-faults, nothing coming from the baseline. So it was rough.
"But thankfully I was able to pick it up."
Play begins in the Ilie Nastase Group on Monday with Andy Murray up against David Ferrer and Rafael Nadal taking on French Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka.

SAO PAULO Nico Rosberg won the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix for the second year in a row on Sunday and denied Mercedes team mate  Lewis Hamilton a first success in the homeland of his late hero Ayrton Senna.
Triple champion Hamilton, who has now failed in nine attempts to win in Brazil, finished 7.756 seconds behind for Mercedes's 11th one-two in 18 races so far this season.
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel finished third for his 79th podium finish.
"Yeah guys, awesome," whooped Rosberg after controlling the race from pole to chequered flag.
He and Hamilton had been separated by less than a second for 10 laps after the first pitstop but the gap then widened.
"It was a good challenge from Lewis but I was able to control the pace," added the German, who refrained from too much exuberance on the podium out of respect for the victims of Friday's Paris attacks.
"We saw Lewis dropping off a lot with degradation and that confirmed it was important to take care of the tyres."
The victory in the season's penultimate race was Rosberg's fifth of the year, second in a row and 13th of his career, and secured the German second place in a championship already won by his British rival.
"I had good pace, it's just you can't overtake here," said Hamilton, who started on the front row alongside Rosberg but could not find a way past his team mate into the opening corner despite trying hard.
"I just killed my tyres. It's such a great track but you can't get close enough to race," he added after his planned two stops turned into three.
The Briton, who clinched his third championship in Texas last month, has spoken much of his wish to emulate triple champion Senna -- who took eight attempts to win his home race -- but he will have to wait another year.
The harder he tried, the more he suffered from tire degradation even if he at least set the fastest lap as a consolation.
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth with compatriot Valtteri Bottas fifth for Williams and securing that team's third place overall for the second year in a row.
Force India's Nico Hulkenberg was sixth with Red Bull's Russian Daniil Kvyat seventh.
Brazilian Felipe Massa, who took his last grand prix win at Interlagos in 2008, finished eighth for Williams but was then excluded by stewards for having an overheated rear tire before the start.
That lifted Frence's Romain Grosjean up a place, with Max Verstappen ninth for Toro Rosso after some standout overtaking moves by the 18-year-old Dutch rookie in a race short on excitement.
Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado was 10th for Lotus, despite collecting a five second penalty for banging into Sauber's Marcus Ericsson as he tried to pass on lap 32 of 71.
Verstappen's team mate Carlos Sainz started from the pitlane after his car broke down on the way to the grid and he then retired on the opening lap.
McLaren had another miserable afternoon, with little to laugh about after Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso made a joking visit to the podium on Saturday, with the pair 14th and 15th respectively after Massa's exclusion.

Team by team analysis of Sunday's Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix (listed in current championship order):
- - - -
MERCEDES (Nico Rosberg 1, Lewis Hamilton 2)
Rosberg's fifth win of the season, 13th of his career and second in a row in Brazil. Mercedes have 11 one-twos from 18 races. Rosberg has secured second place in the championship for the second year. He has also been on pole for five races in a row. Mercedes and Hamilton had already secured both titles. Hamilton set the fastest lap. The win was Mercedes' 44th. Both drivers made three stops.
-
FERRARI (Sebastian Vettel 3, Kimi Raikkonen 4)
Vettel shared the podium with the two Mercedes drivers for the ninth time this year. He now has 79 career podium finishes, and 13 for the season -- more than any other Ferrari driver in their first season with the team. Vettel switched from two to a more aggressive three stops. Raikkonen stayed on two stops and suffered higher tire degradation.
-
WILLIAMS (Valtteri Bottas 5, Felipe Massa excluded)
Williams made sure of third place overall for the second year in a row. Bottas had a three place grid penalty but recovered them quickly at the start and made a two-stop strategy work. Massa was excluded from his home race for having an overheated tire before the start.
-
RED BULL (Daniil Kvyat 7, Daniel Ricciardo 11)
Kvyat lost out to Hulkenberg at the first pitstop. Ricciardo started 19th after a 10 place penalty due to the decision to use the latest specification Renault engine. He made an early pitstop but tire wear then forced him to make three stops.
-
FORCE INDIA (Nico Hulkenberg 6, Sergio Perez 12)
Force India made sure of fifth overall in the championship, the team's highest ever placing. Hulkenberg did two stops. Perez felt he had got his setup wrong.
-
LOTUS (Romain Grosjean 8, Pastor Maldonado 10)
Grosjean started 14th, Maldonado 15th. The Venezuelan was handed a five second penalty for tangling with Sauber's Ericsson while trying to pass. Both moved up a place after Massa's exclusion. Lotus pulled nine points clear of Toro Rosso.
-
TORO ROSSO (Max Verstappen 9, Carlos Sainz retired)
Sainz's car had engine problems before the start and went to the pitlane. He then stopped on the first lap, his seventh retirement of the season for technical reasons. Verstappen stood out with the overtaking moves of the race and can be sure of ending the season as rookie of the year.
-
SAUBER (Felipe Nasr 13, Marcus Ericsson 16)
Nasr made his home debut and had battles with both the Lotus drivers, as did Ericsson.
-
MCLAREN (Jenson Button 14, Fernando Alonso 15)
Both cars finished after another woeful weekend for the former champions, struggling with the Honda power unit. The team tried new front wings which seemed to be an improvement. McLaren will need at least 10 points from the final race to overhaul Sauber, a tally they have managed only once this year.
-
MARUSSIA (Will Stevens 17, Alexander Rossi 18)
Rossi's last race of the season, with Roberto Merhi returning for the final round in Abu Dhabi.

Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning delivered the latest milestone of his Hall of Fame career when he passed Brett Favre to become the National Football League's all-time passing yards leader on Sunday.
Manning, who started Sunday's game versus the Kansas City Chiefs three yards shy of the all-time mark of 71,838 yards, broke the record after completing a four-yard pass to Ronnie Hillman in the first quarter.
The game was briefly stopped to recognize the achievement and the Broncos also showed a video tribute to the 39-year-old quarterback, who acknowledged the ovation from the home crowd and tossed the Hall of Fame-bound ball to the Denver sideline.
He and Favre, who retired following the NFL's 2010 season, are the only two quarterbacks to have thrown for more than 70,000 yards in a career.
Manning, who has led Denver to a Super Bowl berth and three division titles since joining the team in 2012, already owns a slew of NFL records and can add another one to the list with a victory on Sunday as it would move him ahead of Favre's 186.
He spent the first 14 years of his career in Indianapolis, where he tossed for 54,828 yards.

MARACAIBO, Venezuela Argentine soccer great Diego Maradona underwent a gastric bypass in the western Venezuelan city of Maracaibo over the weekend and is recovering well, doctors said on Sunday.
The 55-year-old former World Cup winner went through a similar operation around a decade ago and has battled ill health since his soccer heyday in the 1980s.
"He is walking and in good spirits," said Carlos Felipe Chaux, one of the surgeons who treated him, told reporters at a Maracaibo hotel.
Maradona will remain in Venezuela for at least 12 more days to recover, he added.
Suffering shortages of medicines and surgical equipment, Venezuela may seem an odd choice for the operation. However, Maradona has long been close to the country's socialist government.
Soon after the arrest of high-ranking FIFA officials earlier this year, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro suggested Maradona would be a good fit for the next president of the embattled soccer organization.
Maradona captained Argentina in their 1986 World Cup win though less than a decade later, he was excluded from the U.S. World Cup finals for doping.
Drug-addiction, overeating and alcoholism had put a sharp end to an otherwise glorious career. He nearly died in 2000 after a cocaine overdose.
Yet, in 2010, he managed Argentina's national team at the South Africa World Cup.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. From Seattle to New York, the National Football League stepped up security inside and outside of stadiums on Sunday as America's most popular sports league responded to a series of coordinated attacks across Paris that left at least 129 dead.
Football fans, who were subject to vehicle searches and banned from bringing backpacks and purses into arenas, greeted new measures with a mixture of good humor, annoyance and resignation.
"We’ve had our 9/11. They had what happened to them. We’re all one, without question. We sympathize absolutely," Craig Corcoran of the Bronx told Reuters, referring to the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on New York's World Trade Center.
"It’s not going to stop us from having a good time. Over there, it’s the same way. They’re still going to go out and have their fun and they should," Corcoran said outside of MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
While the U.S. Department of Homeland Security informed the National Football League there were no known specific threats, Commissioner Roger Goodell was taking no chances and ordered beefed-up security at all venues.
"The safety of our fans, stadium personnel, and teams at all NFL games is our priority, and security at our games is robust," the league said in a statement.
The NFL and other North American professional sport leagues went on high alert after one of the attacks on Friday targeted a friendly soccer match between France and Germany where suicide bombers apparently attempted to enter the Stade de France, in a suburb just north of Paris.
At MetLife, where the New York Giants were hosting the unbeaten, reigning Super Bowl champion New England Patriots in one of Sunday's marquee games, trucks and vans got special attention at the stadium complex.
"We've been coming here for 17 years but this time they were stopping all the pick-up trucks and some of the vans coming in because of what happened in Paris," said Tony, who along with Bob and Rocco had come in early from Connecticut to tailgate in the stadium parking lot before the game.
"If they had the thing (cargo area) covered, they uncovered it. If they had boxes, they had to open up the boxes. This never happened before."
Bob noted another first. "It's the first time I saw bomb-sniffing dogs," he said.
"They were checking inside every one of those pots," he said about the line of concrete planters that served as barriers ringing the perimeter of the entry gates.
In addition to the NFL's routine metal detector screening at its games there were multiple layers of perimeter security employed including State troopers, who were out in full force at entry gates and in the parking lots to provide a watchful eye.
Among special precautions was a complete ban on entering stadiums with backpacks, satchels or purses. Fans could only carry in small, clear plastic bags.
A moment of silence was observed at Sunday's games with the French flag shown on video boards, and in some stadiums the French flag was involved in national color guard details during the anthem.
Paris was left reeling and the world was in shock after three jihadist cells on Friday staged coordinated attacks at bars, a concert hall and the soccer stadium, killing 129 people and injuring 352, including 99 who were in a serious condition.
Despite the devastating attacks, the usual pre-game party atmosphere prevailed with barbeque sizzling and libations flowing.
"We’re a powerful nucleus, all of us together. There is nothing we should be afraid of," Corcoran said. "All of these countries will respond together and they will get theirs, without question.”
The National Hockey League paid tribute to the victims of the Paris attacks on Saturday night with a moment of silence before each of the 12 games scheduled in Canada and the United States.
At some hockey arenas, including Bell Centre in Montreal, the largest city in the French speaking province of Quebec, "La Marseillaise," the French national anthem, played before "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "O Canada."

SAO PAULO Brazilian Felipe Massa was excluded from his home Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday after his Williams car was found to have an overheated rear tire before the start.
The former race winner had finished in eighth place at Interlagos.
Checks on the grid before the start revealed that his right-rear tire tread was 27 degrees celsius above the maximum temperature allowed by Pirelli.
Massa's exclusion promoted Lotus's Romain Grosjean to eighth, with Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen moving up to ninth and Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado taking the final point for Lotus.
Williams said they would appeal against the penalty.

Atlanta Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer is taking an indefinite leave due to his wife's "emergency medical situation", the National Basketball Association team said on Saturday.
The team did not disclose details of his wife's condition and the coach said in a statement he would "return to the team as soon as possible".
Budenhozler is in his third season in charge of the Hawks, who are 8-3 this season.
The 46-year-old never played in the NBA but spent 17 years as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs before taking the top job in Atlanta in 2013.
In his second season with the Hawks, he guided them to top spot in the East with a 60-22 record in the regular season, before they were swept 4-0 by Cleveland in the Eastern Conference finals.





STOCKHOLM Sweden captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic has expressed his sympathies for his fellow Parisians after gun and bomb attacks in the French capital on Friday left 129 killed, hundreds injured and the city traumatized.
"It's sad, tragic. Things like that shouldn't happen," the Paris Saint Germain player told broadcaster Kanal 5 after Sweden beat Denmark 2-1 in the first leg of their Euro 2016 playoff. "I stand behind those who have passed on and the families there.
"I tried hard to focus on the game, which was very hard," added the 34-year-old, who is in his fourth season at PSG, having moved to the French capital in July 2012 from AC Milan.
The Friends Arena in Stockholm was lit up in the red, white and blue national colors of France, with a minute's silence observed before play while the players also wore black armbands.
Sweden coach Erik Hamren said the attacks in the French capital had affected his side's preparations.
"The terrible and despicable has happened," Hamren told reporters.
"We had a chat when we assembled and we must show that evil cannot be allowed to win, that football is important on days such as this."

LONDON Sebastian Coe has conceded that unless he and his fellow leaders fully grasp the enormity of the crisis in their sport, there are "unlikely to be many tomorrows for athletics".
In his Sunday Telegraph newspaper column, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said he and his colleagues could "almost certainly" have done more to get to the heart of the scandal that has rocked the sport.
Coe, writing at the end of a dramatic week which saw the IAAF provisionally suspend Russia following a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency that uncovered evidence of state-controlled doping in the country, added it had been a "horror show" for athletics.
The Briton also said the "architecture of anti-doping" systems had failed the world's track and field competitors and acknowledged a difficult self-examination as he reflected on whether the sport could have approached the unfolding crisis more effectively.
Friday's decision to suspend Russia after a conference call of IAAF Council members, Coe said, was made amid an atmosphere of "sadness and anger" and "the recognition that unless we fully grasp the enormity of our plight there were unlikely to be many tomorrows for athletics".
The double Olympic champion, who has found himself in the unusual position of being criticized, explained this week's events had led him to ask, "How did we get to this?
"The decision ... to penalize Russia was also a difficult one and running against every instinct around that conference call. But the best way to protect clean athletes is to be unflinching in our commitment to them, and not just in words," said Coe.
"We have to create structures that are always in their corner and here none of us come out very well including my federation.
"The architecture of anti-doping has failed them and, we have to ask, were the walls too high in many of our organizations to properly investigate abuses? Almost certainly 'yes' has to be our uncomfortable answer," he added.
Coe reflected on an unnamed, no-nonsense coach who helped kickstart his running career several decades ago.
"The toughest question I grapple with is inevitably a very personal one, self-examination is never easy," he said.
"I guess the question I am asking myself at this very moment is, 'How on earth have we got from a sport that was underpinned by people like that (coach) to the horror show that played out on the global stage last week?'.
"Could I, should I, have inserted myself into the three independent investigations (set in motion by a German TV documentary which uncovered the Russian evidence)? Possibly," added Coe.
"Should we all have been more alert and in tune with our natural instincts? Almost certainly.
"That is probably the toughest truth to face but the sport must if we are to start our recovery. And the search for the answer will be my North Star," said Coe.

NEW YORK The National Football League said on Saturday it would increase security and beef up the law enforcement presence both inside and outside of stadiums for this week's games as a precaution after a series of attacks throughout Paris on Friday.
"Following the events in Paris on Friday, we are closely monitoring events and have been in communication with the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, which have informed us that there are no known threats against NFL stadiums," it said in a statement.

American journeyman Derek Fathauer played flawless golf to grab the first 54-hole lead of his PGA Tour career in the OHL Classic at Mayakoba in Mexico on Saturday.
The 29-year-old carded a bogey-free, five-under 66 at the El Camaleon Golf Club in Playa del Carmen to move one shot ahead of compatriot Jason Bohn (65).
Overnight leader Graeme McDowell (70) and former British Open champion Justin Leonard (67) were among a group of four players three strokes off the lead.
Fathauer, trying to become the sixth consecutive first-time winner on the PGA Tour, birdied the third, fifth, seventh and ninth holes to reach the turn with a two-stroke lead.
He then reached five-under for the day after a birdie at the par-five 13th.
McDowell, fresh off an eight-under 63 in the second round, made a poor start as he followed a double-bogey at the opening hole with a bogey at the second.
But the Northern Irishman recovered nicely with four birdies over a seven-hole stretch before bogeying the par-five 13th.
The 2010 U.S. Open champion then birdied his penultimate hole to put himself in contention for his first PGA Tour win since 2013.
Bohn was cruising along with four birdies on his front nine and then followed a birdie at the 12th with an eagle at the par-five 13th before a lightning delay halted play for about 90 minutes.
He would have had a share of the lead going into the final round if not for a bogey at the 18th.

PARIS All major sporting events in the Paris region were suspended on Saturday as France mourned the victims of the attacks in the capital city the night before that left 129 people dead and 352 wounded.
Shows of respect, sadness and support took place well beyond French borders as sport's global family, from Sydney to Washington to Sao Paulo, united in sympathy.
Before the Euro 2016 soccer playoff between Sweden and Denmark at the Friends Arena in Stockholm, the stadium was lit up in red, white and blue.
Both teams wore black armbands and, led by Sweden and Paris St Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, observed a minute's silence.
A minute's silence was also held before the playoff between Ukraine and Slovenia in Lviv, with European soccer's governing body announcing that UEFA games could feature similar tributes over the next few days.
The shows of solidarity with France went beyond Europe.
Sydney FC soccer fans held up a vast French tricolore ahead of an A-League match against Melbourne Victory while the ice was illuminated in red, white and blue before a Washington Capitals NHL game with Calgary Flames.
Jockeys at a major horse-race meeting in Cheltenham, England, all wore red, white and blue armbands and in the BMW Masters golf tournament in Shanghai, French golfer Benjamin Hebert had the message "Pray for Paris" emblazoned on his cap.
No matches were scheduled this weekend in France's elite Ligue 1 but domestic TV stations Canal Plus and TF1 said they were calling off their main soccer programs on Sunday.
A friendly international against England scheduled for Wembley on Tuesday will go ahead as planned, the French Football Federation said.
"As we speak the game is on, yes," a spokesman for the federation told Reuters by telephone.
France were playing Germany at the Stade de France when the Saint-Denis attack took place outside the stadium.

REMAIN UNIFIED
Former Real Madrid, Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Lassana Diarra, who played for France in the friendly, said his cousin died in one of the shootings that took place in Paris.
On his official Twitter account, Diarra wrote: "In this climate of terror, it is important for all of us, who are representatives of our country and of diversity, to speak up and to remain unified in the face of a horror which has no color, nor religion.
"Together, we must defend love, respect and peace."
European Professional Cup Rugby said on Saturday that all Champions Cup and Challenge Cup games in France this weekend would be canceled.
All basketball and volleyball matches in the country were also called off.
The risk level for the Euro 2016 soccer finals in France has increased but the competition should not be canceled, the head of the organizing committee said on Saturday.
"The risk had gone one level up in January, it has just gone higher," Jacques Lambert told French radio RTL. "Wondering whether Euro 2016 must be canceled is playing the game of the terrorists."
The committee handling France's bid to host the 2024 Olympics said: "As Parisians we stand in solidarity with the people of Paris and of France in uniting against these acts of terror".
The International Olympic Committee (IOC), based in Lausanne, said the Olympic flag would fly at half-mast.
"We stand united with all people from all around the globe. Our thoughts are of course with the families and friends of those who have been killed or wounded," the IOC said.
There will also be a minute's silence before the start of the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday. French Lotus driver Romain Grosjean tweeted: "From Brazil we think of you."
French tennis doubles pair Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert plan to pay tribute to the victims during the ATP World Tour Finals in London that start on Sunday.
"We are discussing with the ATP to do something, at least to wear something on the shirt," said Mahut who lives in Paris.

SAO PAULO Brazilian rookie Felipe Nasr was handed a three-place grid penalty on Saturday for impeding compatriot Felipe Massa in qualifying for their home Formula One Grand Prix.
Stewards ruled Nasr, who had been due to start Sunday's race in 10th place for Sauber, had held up the Williams driver in the first phase of qualifying.
He drops to 13th while Massa, whose last win came at Interlagos in 2008 with Ferrari, will line up in eighth place.
"It was a difficult situation," said Nasr, who also collected two penalty points. "I was told that all the cars around me were on a slow lap."

PARIS The Euro 2016 finals in France should not be canceled even though the risk levels have gone up, the head of the organizing committee said on Saturday following the attacks in Paris.
Islamic State claimed responsibility after 129 people were killed and 352 wounded on Friday, saying it sent militants strapped with suicide bombing belts and carrying machine guns to various locations in the heart of the French capital.
"The risk had gone one level up in January, it has just gone higher," Euro 2016 chief Jacques Lambert told French radio RTL.
"We will make the decisions we need to make so that the Euro finals can be held in the best security conditions. Security in stadiums works well, the risk is more in the streets, in spontaneous gatherings.
"Wondering whether Euro 2016 must be canceled is playing the game of the terrorists," said Lambert.
There was one bombing near the Stade de France on Friday, killing three, as the national team were playing a friendly against Germany inside the venue.
Euro 2016 will be held from June 10-July 10.

LONDON The Manor Marussia Formula One team appointed ex-McLaren stalwart Dave Ryan as racing director on Saturday and have sounded out retired Austrian racer Alexander Wurz for the job of principal.
The team, last in the championship without a point, said in a statement that current principal John Booth and sporting director Graeme Lowdon are leaving at the end of the season.
Wurz, who announced earlier in the week that he was hanging up his helmet after the coming world endurance championship finale in Bahrain, told the BBC he had been approached.
"I would have preferred it not be out in public but I can't deny it," added the 41-year-old former McLaren driver, without saying whether he would accept the principal role.
Ryan resigned as McLaren sporting director in 2009, after 34 years with the team, following a furor in which he and the team's then-world champion Lewis Hamilton were found to have misled race stewards in Australia.
Manor said Ryan, who is now 61 and has spent the last six years running his own sportscar team, would be joining with immediate effect.
The team are switching from Ferrari to Mercedes engines next season and owner Stephen Fitzpatrick said Ryan's arrival was "another important step towards our goal of creating a truly competitive racing team."
There is one race in Abu Dhabi remaining after this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix and Ryan said he was excited to be back in the paddock.
"Having spent time with Stephen and understood his vision for the future, it is clear he has ensured there is a strong platform from which the team can make big steps forward in the seasons ahead," he said.
"There is clearly a big challenge ahead and a lot of work to do, but I can't wait to meet the wider team and get down to business."
Manor entered Formula One as Virgin Racing in 2010 and were then transferred to Russian ownership, becoming Marussia.
They then hit financial hard times and went into administration last year, missing the final three races.
Fitzpatrick, who runs Independent British energy supplier Ovo, took over as owner in March with the team benefiting from an estimated $50 million in prize money after finishing ninth last year.
That was due to the efforts of French driver Jules Bianchi, who died this year after suffering severe head injuries in a crash in Japan last October.

SAO PAULO McLaren drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button stepped onto the Formula One podium for the first time this season on Saturday -- but only in jest after yet another qualifying nightmare in Brazil.
Neither of the two former world champions made it through the opening phase at Interlagos, with Spaniard Alonso told by the team to pull over before he had even got a timed lap under his belt.
"No power," he said, before parking on the grass.
Alonso had spent much of Friday afternoon watching from the barriers after a similar failure in practice and on Saturday he made himself more comfortable.
Lying back in a foldable picnic chair, feet resting on his helmet, he winked theatrically at a television camera and  soaked up some afternoon sun.
"I need to be a little bit more prepared next time in Abu Dhabi (the final race of the season in two weeks' time), take the telephone and the sun tanning (lotion) or something," Alonso told the BBC. "It was quite hot out there."
When the session was over, the two drivers -- who won their titles in Brazil with Renault and Brawn respectively -- drew a roar from the crowd when they sneaked onto the podium for old times' sake.
"We passed that close to the podium, Jenson and me, and we said we will not be that close any more this year and we took a picture at least," said Alonso.
"Jokes apart, I think it has been a very frustrating weekend with two engine failures. I didn't take part in the race in Mexico, I didn't take part in qualifying here...
"As long as we learn from all these problems that we are having this year and not repeat them any more next year, it's good but definitely it's tough right now."
Alonso, one of the quickest and most highly paid drivers in Formula One, has scored just 11 points in 17 races as McLaren's first year of a new partnership with Honda has delivered the team's worst ever season.
Button has scored only five points more than the Spaniard, both men hampered by regular engine failures and a lack of performance from a power unit that Honda can do little to improve until the season is over.
From 18 qualifying sessions, both McLarens have failed to make it through to the second phase in eight of them.

MOSCOW The acting head of the Russian Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said on Saturday he was ready to resign to help the sport recover from a doping scandal, Tass news agency reported.

MOSCOW Russia's Olympic chief Alexander Zhukov said on Saturday the country's Olympic Committee was ready to reform the Russian Athletics Federation following allegations of widespread doping in the sport, RIA news agency reported.

Zhukov said the reforms must be implemented as soon as possible so that Russian athletes can compete at the Games.

MOSCOW Russia's suspension from international athletics will be resolved in two to three months, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Saturday as officials moved to play down the ban.
The International Association of Athletics Federations' (IAAF) voted overwhelmingly on Friday to suspend Russia from the sport for widespread and state-sponsored doping, a decision which could cost the country its place at the 2016 Olympics.
"It is a predictable and understandable decision," Mutko told R-Sport news agency. "We need to understand what they want and where they see threats.
"We will develop a joint road map and try do it quickly. I think we can do all the work in two to three months."
Russia is one of the main superpowers in world athletics and finished second behind the United States in the track and field medal count at the 2012 Olympics in London.
President Vladimir Putin has also used sporting successes to promote his image of Russia as a resurgent global power, portraying its hosting of a successful winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 as a symbol of a newly confident nation.
Now Russia will be stripped of hosting the world race walking and world junior championships next year and will have to work fast to make the Rio Olympic Games in August 2016.
But Mutko dismissed the possible consequences of the IAAF's decision.
"What will happen? Yes, nothing will happen. Athletics will develop, the guys will train. Well, they will miss maybe one tournament," R-Sport quoted him as saying.
Vadim Zelichenok, the acting head of the Russian Athletics Federation, said the IAAF ban was harsh and everything must be done to rectify the situation, R-Sport reported.
"I believe, the IAAF council made a decision which was too severe," Zelichenok was quoted as saying.
"Most important is that our sportsmen can appear at international competitions as soon as possible."

LONDON Reaction to the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) council's vote on Friday to provisionally suspend Russia from the sport for widespread, state-sponsored doping. The ban will include the 2016 Olympics unless the country can demonstrate a major change in their approach and controls.

MOSCOW The International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) decision to suspend Russia from the sport was too harsh but Russia must do everything to rectify the situation, the acting head of the Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA), was quoted as saying on Saturday.
"I believe, the IAAF council made a decision which was too severe, but it was made and now we will do everything to rectify the situation," the R-Sport news agency quoted Vadim Zelichenok as saying.
"Most important is that our sportsmen can appear at international competitions as soon as possible," he said. The governing body of world athletics on Friday voted overwhelmingly to suspend Russia from the sport for widespread, state-sponsored doping.



(The Sports Xchange) - Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook overcame an ankle issue in the first quarter to score a triple double in a 102-85 victory over the winless Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.
It was a second triple-double of the season for Westbrook, who recorded 21 points, a career-high 17 rebounds and 11 assists to cover for the absence of leading scorer Kevin Durant, who missed the first of an expected five games with a strained hamstring.
Thunder coach Billy Donovan said he had come close to pulling Westbrook early.
"I said 'Do you want to come out?' and he kind of nodded and then when I went to put someone in, he said 'No, no, I'm fine'," Donovan said. "After that, I didn't ask him any more about it."
Visiting Philadelphia (0-9) took the game to Oklahoma City, jumping out to a 24-18 lead after the first quarter as forwards Nerlens Noel and Christian Wood each scored six points.
The Thunder grabbed the lead for good midway through the second quarter with an 8-0 run. Forward Nick Collison finished the spurt with a tip-in to give Oklahoma City its biggest advantage of the half at 39-32.
The Thunder led by four at halftime, but the Sixers refused to fold, closing the gap every time Oklahoma City threatened to pull away.
Philadelphia's last charge brought the Sixers within 62-61 before Westbrook took over. He led the Thunder on a 9-0 run to end the third quarter, scoring three straight buckets, including one on a spectacular steal and dunk.
That helped the Thunder (6-3) end the third quarter with a 71-61 advantage, and they went on to wrap up their third straight win and 12th in a row over Philadelphia.
Donovan was most impressed with Westbrook's work on the defensive boards, which sparked the Thunder to 24 fast-break points.
"He created some offensive rebounds, but the defensive rebounds enabled us to get on the fast break and run and that was a positive," Donovan said.
Westbrook said it was something he had been working on.
"I learned over the summer whenever I rebound and start the break it's better for our team and it gives the opposing team problems when I am able to do that and push the break," Westbrook said. "That leads to easy points."
Guard Anthony Morrow, starting in place of Durant, scored eight of his 12 points in the first quarter. Guard Dion Waiters added 14 points and forward Enes Kanter came off the bench to contribute 13 points and eight rebounds.
Wood topped the Sixers with 15 points, and Noel had 13 points and 11 boards.

The United States recovered from conceding a surprise early goal to crush Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 6-1 in their CONCACAF region, World Cup fourth round qualifying game in St Louis on Friday.
The Caribbean side, made up mainly of semi-professional and amateur players, stunned Jurgen Klinsmann's team in the fifth minute when Oalex Anderson cut in from the left and curled a right foot effort past American keeper Brad Guzan.
The United States were back on level terms six minutes later when Michael Bradley fed DeAndrew Yedlin, whose cross was headed in by striker Bobby Wood to ease the nerves of the 43,433 crowd at the home of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball club.
Wood and Bradley both went close before the Americans took the lead in the 29th minute when a Fabian Johnson free-kick took a big deflection and wrong-footed goalkeeper Winslow McDowall.
Jozy Altidore made it 3-1 in the 32nd minute with a simple header from close-range after he was left unmarked at the back post to convert after Jermaine Jones had flicked on a Johnson corner.
Klinsmann's team had utterly dominated, with over 83 percent of the first half possession and they made sure of three points from their opening Group C game after the break.
Defender Geoff Cameron looped in a header from another Johnson corner to make it 4-1, six minutes after the re-start.
Gyasi Zardes added the fifth when he was put through by Altidore and beat McDowall with a confident low drive.
Altidore added his second to make it 6-1 in the 74th minute, collecting a pass from Jones, twisting and turning to make space to score with a deflected shot.
Defender Matt Miazga and midfielder Darlington Nagbe were both handed debuts with substitute appearances in the second half.
Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, also in Group C, were playing later on Friday.
The top two teams from each of the three groups of four nations will progress to the final round of qualifying.

CONCACAF big guns Mexico, the United States and Costa Rica all got off to winning starts on Friday in their qualifying campaign for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
The fourth round of qualifying in North and Central America and the Caribbean region saw few surprises with the United States crushing Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 6-1, Mexico defeating El Salvador 3-0 and Costa Rica enjoying a 1-0 win over  a determined Haiti.
The trio all qualified for the last World Cup in Brazil in 2014, with Costa Rica making the last eight and Mexico and the United States going out in the second round.
Jurgen Klinsmann's American team suffered a shock early goal from their Caribbean opponents with St Vincent striker Oalex Anderson opening the scoring in the fifth minute when he cut in from the left and curled a right foot effort past keeper Brad Guzan.
But goals from Bobby Wood (11) and Fabian Johnson (29) put the United States on their way to a comfortable Group C victory in St Louis.
Two goals from Jozy Altidore (31, 74), a Geoff Cameron header (51) and a Gyasi Zardes (58) strike made sure of a winning start for the U.S. who have not missed out on the World Cup since 1986.
Mexico's new Colombian coach Juan Carlos Osorio made a winning start to his stint in charge of El Tri at the Azteca Stadium.
Andres Guardado calmed early nerves with a beautiful, curling free-kick into the top corner in the seventh minute of the Group A clash.
Hector Herrera was credited with the second goal in the 42nd minute when he floated in a dangerous ball which made its way into the far corner with Javier Hernandez's attempt to flick it home distracting El Salvador keeper Henry Hernandez.
Striker Carlos Vela completed the win after the break with a delicate chip over the advancing Hernandez.
Costa Rica are favorites to top Group B but they faced determined opposition in San Jose against a much-improved Haiti.
Cristian Gamboa slotted in the 29th minute winner after a superb passing move from the Ticos, who in Brazil managed to qualify ahead of Italy and England in their group.
In Group B's other game, Panama enjoyed an impressive 2-0 win in Kingston against 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup runners-up Jamaica.
Panama, who missed out on a place in Brazil on the final day of qualifying last time round, made sure of three points with goals from Armando Cooper (43) and Alberto Quintero (52).
Trinidad and Tobago, who have not made the World Cup since their appearance in Germany in 2006, got off to a positive start in Group C with a hard-earned 2-1 win in Guatemala.
Khaleem Hyland's long range strike (67) and a superb Kenwyne Jones volley (80) gave Stephen Hart's team a two goal cushion before substitute Carlo Mejia's last minute consolation goal.
Canada edged Honduras 1-0 in the late Group A game on Friday after Will Johnson's first half goal in Vancouver.

NEW YORK Top daily fantasy sports companies DraftKings and FanDuel filed lawsuits on Friday to contest an order to shut down their online gaming operations in New York state, asking a state court to rule that the games are not illegal gambling.
The New York attorney general's office on Tuesday ordered the two companies to stop taking money from New Yorkers and declared the games to be against state law because customers "are clearly placing bets on events outside of their control or influence, specifically on the real-game performance of professional athletes."
DraftKings said in its lawsuit that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was "using strong-arm tactics and defying the rule of law," accusing him of acting as judge, jury and executioner of the companies.
Being forced to shut down in the state could be a crippling blow for the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar industry, as New York has more daily fantasy sports players than any other U.S. state, according to Eilers Research.
DraftKings accused Schneiderman of abusing his authority by threatening to take action against the company's payment processors, Vantiv Inc and PayPal Holdings Inc, if they did not stop working with DraftKings.
The attorney general's declaration that daily fantasy sports is gambling, if correct, would make it "nearly impossible" for New York's legislature to pass a law allowing the games, said Bennett Liebman, former New York state deputy secretary for gaming and racing.
New York's Constitution prohibits gambling though the state has carved out a handful of exceptions, including horse racing and the state lottery. But each of those changes required amending the state's Constitution, a years-long process that requires approval of legislation by two successive legislatures, followed by a public vote, he said.

PLAYERS, EMPLOYEES PROTEST
Earlier in the day, around a hundred protesters - a significant number of whom work for daily fantasy sports sites - gathered outside Schneiderman's office to protest his decision.
Jason Green, 35, visiting from Nashville for a daily fantasy sports conference being held this weekend, came to the protest after reading the cease and desist letters to the companies from Schneiderman's office.
"Regulation is one thing, but this isn't regulation - just one guy making a decision," he said. "There's a lot of misinformation out there and hopefully we've shown that people should be allowed to keep playing."
Green works at a video game company and enters up to twenty hockey lineups per night, spending a few hundred dollars a week on the games.
Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online with participants typically creating teams that span an entire season in major professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey.
Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game, has developed over the past decade. In these, players draft teams in games played in just one evening or over the course of a weekend.
The companies may have painted targets on their backs through aggressive advertising at the start of the National Football League season that promised large winnings to participants. FanDuel has said it planned to pay out $2 billion in cash prizes this year.
"They got very big, very fast," Schneiderman said on Thursday at an event, saying New York won't be the first or last state to make daily fantasy sports illegal. "New York state regulators and regulators in a lot of other states weren't paying attention."
The companies have been at the center of controversy since early October when a DraftKings employee won $350,000 from a $25 entry in an American football contest on the rival FanDuel site.
The two companies then banned their employees from playing, but local and federal authorities began to investigate whether the fantasy sites offered games of chance, which were essentially gambling.
As the companies grew, they raised hundreds of millions of dollars, giving both DraftKings and FanDuel valuations of more than $1 billion. Investors in the companies include Fox Sports, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, KKR & Co LP, Raine Group, Google Capital and the venture arms of Time Warner Inc and Comcast Corp.
DraftKings also partnered with Major League Baseball to advertise in ballparks while FanDuel signed partnerships with several NFL teams.
Daily fantasy players are not the only ones fretting about the possible loss of the games. A cottage industry of blogs, magazines and apps that provide advice and information to fantasy players has sprung up and the revenue lost from daily fantasy sports sites could hurt their bottom line.
RotoGrinders.com, for instance, is a popular blog offering tips by "grinders," or professional daily fantasy sports players who spend thousands per day on games. RotoGrinders also has a daily satellite radio show on SiriusXM.
Fantasy advice is often the lead story on ESPN.com, and Matthew Berry, the company's senior fantasy analyst, is a paid spokesman for DraftKings. NBC Universal also saw success with their own news website for fantasy sports, Rotoworld.

NEW YORK Daily fantasy sports site FanDuel said on Friday it stopped taking new deposits in New York after the state's attorney general declared the games to be illegal gambling.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent cease and desist letters this week to daily fantasy sports market leaders FanDuel and DraftKings, demanding that they stop taking money from players in the state.
Both companies filed lawsuits in state court on Friday, contesting the order and asking the court to rule the games are legal.
FanDuel stopped taking new money from New Yorkers, but said players who deposited money previously could play in this weekend's contests. It said users in New York could also continue to withdraw from their accounts.
On Tuesday, the state attorney general's office declared the games against state law because customers "are clearly placing bets on events outside of their control or influence, specifically on the real-game performance of professional athletes."
DraftKings said in its lawsuit that Schneiderman was "using strong-arm tactics and defying the rule of law." DraftKings plans to continue taking money in New York during the five business days Schneiderman allowed for a response to his order, Chief Executive Officer Jason Robins said in New York on Friday.
“DraftKings will continue to operate in New York while we pursue all legal options available to prevent the New York Attorney General from denying our customers their right to play the games they love,” a company representative said in a statement.
New York has more daily fantasy sports players than any other U.S. state, according to Eilers Research, so being forced to shut down there could cripple the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar industry.
DraftKings accused Schneiderman of abusing his authority by threatening to take action against payment processors Vantiv Inc and PayPal Holdings Inc.
Vantiv has stopped processing payments for DraftKings, the fantasy sports company said in its lawsuit. PayPal is still processing payments, pending developments in New York, a spokeswoman said.
The attorney general's declaration that daily fantasy sports is gambling, if correct, would make it "nearly impossible" for New York's legislature to pass a law allowing the games, said Bennett Liebman, former state deputy secretary for gaming and racing.
New York's Constitution prohibits gambling. The state has carved out some exceptions including horse racing and the state lottery, but each change required amending the constitution. That years-long process requires approval by two successive legislatures, followed by a public vote, he said.

PLAYERS, EMPLOYEES PROTEST
About a hundred people, including a significant number of daily fantasy sports site workers, protested Schneiderman's decision on Friday outside his office.
Jason Green, 35, visiting from Nashville for a daily fantasy sports conference this weekend, came to the protest after reading the cease and desist letters.
"Regulation is one thing, but this isn't regulation - just one guy making a decision," said Green, who spends a few hundred dollars a week on the games. "There's a lot of misinformation out there and hopefully we've shown that people should be allowed to keep playing."

A U.S. federal appeals court in Virginia ruled on Friday that a college football player who nearly died from heatstroke during a practice two years ago cannot rejoin the team at Towson University in Maryland, overturning a lower court's decision.
The case involves Gavin Class, who was an offensive lineman on Towson's team but had been blocked by the school from returning to the squad after he collapsed during an August 2013 practice, with his body temperature rising to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 Celsius).
Class remained in a coma for nine days after he collapsed. He needed a liver transplant and 13 other operations to recover.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia ruled that the school acted reasonably in rejecting his bid to return to the field.
"Giving deference to Towson University's judgment, as we are required to do, we uphold its determination," Circuit Judge  Paul Niemeyer wrote.
Doctors at the Maryland Medical Center cleared Class to resume playing football, but Towson refused because of the risk to his health and because the team's medical staff would be unable to adequately monitor his condition.
Class, now a 22-year-old senior, had sued the suburban Baltimore school. A federal district judge then ordered Towson to let him play, but the appeals court overturned that ruling.
Towson University issued a statement that praised Class "for his hard work, courage, and determination over the past two years" and said the ruling was "about more than ensuring the safety of one football player" at the school.
"It is about ensuring the safety of current and future student-athletes by allowing team physicians, in the exercise of their professional judgment, to determine who may safely play and who may not," the statement read.
"It is those current and future student-athletes who will benefit the most from today's ruling."

SAO PAULO Nico Rosberg turned the tables on Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton with the fastest lap in Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix practice on Friday.
After triple world champion Hamilton had set the pace in the morning with a lap more than half a second faster than the German, Rosberg ended the afternoon 0.458 quicker than the Briton with a lap of one minute 12.385 seconds on soft tyres.
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third fastest in both sessions.
With both titles already decided, Hamilton having won his third world crown in Texas last month, teams used the morning session to work on developments for 2016 with aerodynamic sensors prominent on bodywork.
"Times in the afternoon were not showing the real picture as Lewis drove in different engine modes to me," said Rosberg, last year's winner at Interlagos who will be chasing his fifth successive pole on Saturday.
"He was also very quick today and it looks like we will have a great battle again this weekend," Rosberg told reporters.
Fernando Alonso brought out red flags early in the afternoon, in what looks like being another difficult weekend for the Spaniard, when his McLaren stopped on the track with smoke coming from the engine.
Hamilton, who had delayed his arrival in Brazil due to a fever and following a car accident in Monaco in the early hours of Tuesday morning, has never triumphed in Brazil in eight attempts but is hoping to break that run.
"They've changed the kerbs quite a bit. Before we could abuse them a little bit more but now you need to go around them," he said.

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, using the latest specification Renault engine, was fourth and fifth respectively in the sessions.

FAMILIAR GUISE
Mercedes drew a lot of interest for a prominent bulge on the nose that was rumoured to be an 'S Duct', a device helping to channel air from under the car to the top surface of the front section.
The car ran in the afternoon in more familiar guise.
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who was fifth and fourth fastest, saw his rear brakes lock into turn four and he tracked across the mud and gravel without further incident.
"Overall it was a difficult day," said Vettel who can still finish second overall in the championship. "I tried to do the best I could but maybe I wasn’t quick enough. The car was moving around and sliding quite a lot."
Lotus reserve Jolyon Palmer, who will be one of the team's race drivers next year, was involved in the morning's other moment of near drama when his car was released from the garage into the path of McLaren's Jenson Button who braked.
Hamilton's return to the track came amid headlines about his party lifestyle with the 30-year-old, whose helmet this weekend carries a tribute to his late boyhood idol Ayrton Senna, recognising he had been overdoing things.
"Heavy partying and not much rest for a week and a half," said the Briton.
"I am a bit run down. I have been non-stop and trying to fit training in at the same time and not getting a lot of sleep."

LONDON Four members of a gang whose ram-raid robberies in southern England included the theft of Formula One trophies won by former champions Red Bull were sentenced to jail terms on Friday.
Surrey Police said the four men were sentenced at Guildford Crown Court to terms of between two and seven years for conspiracy to commit burglary and steal.
The gang hit the headlines when they smashed a car through the front doors of the Red Bull Racing factory in Milton Keynes in December last year, seizing more than 60 trophies from a display cabinet in the atrium.
That incident was caught on CCTV cameras. Team principal Christian Horner said at the time that he was puzzled why anyone would want to steal items that had low intrinsic values.
About 20 of the trophies, many of them damaged, were recovered 10 days later from a lake some 95km from the factory.
The gang also carried out thefts of more than 1 million pounds ($1.52 million) worth of goods across southern England, including a raid on a cash machine at Mercedes-Benz World in Weybridge.

LONDON However Novak Djokovic fares at next week's ATP World Tour Finals, and most expect him to win a fourth successive title at London's O2 Arena to cap an amazing year, the world number one will be setting equally high goals for 2016.
The 28-year-old Serb has enjoyed an astonishingly consistent year, winning three of the four grand slams, narrowly missing out on a first French Open, and scooping six of the year's Masters Series titles.
His 78-5 record this season is comparable to Roger Federer's 2006 campaign (92-5) and John McEnroe's in 1984 (82-3) in terms of domination.
The question is how will he back it up next year?
That's simple, according to Djokovic, who begins at the season-ender with a Sunday afternoon clash with Japan's Kei Nishikori, who he beat in last year's semi-finals in London.
"I'm in love with the game and it's not difficult to prepare myself in the off season and to set new goals," Djokovic told reporters on Friday after a practice session overseen by coach Boris Becker and the rest of his team.
The first of Djokovic's 10 grand slam titles came at the 2008 Australian Open and he had to wait three years until his next one -- after which the floodgates opened.
Whereas he used to look vulnerable in long matches and occasionally retired hurt in the heat of battle, Djokovic these days looks invincible physically and mentally.
There is no secret, Djokovic insists.
"I've been through a process of evolution and I feel like I've learned a lot mentally how to handle situations on the biggest stages when I play against my biggest rivals," Djokovic said. "I've found a formula that works.
"I've developed and emphasized certain training routines on the court and my fitness routine as well has changed, not drastically, but we've found an optimal training system and a program that works.
"There is not a single thing that I can say is the secret, an elixir or potion, I've realized a holistic approach to life and tennis helps me and gives me the best results."
Djokovic faces a tough group with six-times champion Roger Federer and powerful Czech Tomas Berdych, as well as Nishikori, but even with the round-robin system allowing some margin for error, Djokovic wants perfection.
"Of course it gives you an option to survive the group stage with lost matches but I'm not considering to lose any matches," he said.

SAO PAULO Manor Marussia's sporting director Graeme Lowdon confirmed on Friday that he would be leaving the Formula One outfit at the end of the season.
"Abu Dhabi is going to be my last race with the team," he told a news conference at the Brazilian Grand Prix, the penultimate round of the championship, without expanding on the reasons behind the decision.
"From my point of view this has been a pretty difficult season but that's secondary to the fact that the team continues and that's the most important thing."
Reports, confirmed by team sources, emerged at the previous race in Mexico that Lowdon and team principal John Booth had  handed in their resignations and would leave once the season had ended.
Neither man, both well-regarded in the paddock as motor racing veterans who have been involved in the sport from the junior series upwards, had confirmed the reports.
Lowdon helped secure Marussia's survival after the team, who entered Formula One in 2010 as Virgin Racing, went into administration and missed the last three races of last year.
Stephen Fitzpatrick, who runs the Independent British energy supplier Ovo, then took over as owner in March and has said he was funding the team personally.
Media reports have spoken of differences of opinions between the owner and those running the team, which could yet change hands before the start of next season.
Tavo Hellmund, the Texan-based entrepreneur who is close to Formula One's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone and helped Mexico return to the grand prix calendar this year, has expressed an interest in buying the team with a group of investors.
Manor have been racing with year-old Ferrari engines this season, and have not scored any points, but are due to switch to Mercedes power units in 2016.
They qualified for an estimated $50 million in prize money this season after finishing ninth in 2014 thanks to the efforts of their late French driver Jules Bianchi who suffered fatal injuries in Japan last year.

CAIRO, Nov 13 (Reuters) – Acting FIFA president Issa Hayatou has undergone a successful kidney transplant and will continue leading soccer’s world governing body for the foreseeable future, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said on Friday.
CAF president Hayatou, who has suffered with kidney problems for some time, plans to rest for few days.
“I am pleased with the positive news given by the medical personnel,” CAF secretary general Hicham El Amrani said in a statement.
“In the coming days, I will be in regular contact with him and I’m glad to know that in future, he will be back on our side,"
The 69-year-old Hayatou became FIFA's interim president when Sepp Blatter was suspended last month while under investigation by the ruling body's ethics committee.
Hayatou, who has been a member of FIFA’s executive for the last 25 years, is the organization's most senior vice-president.
He will hope the surgery ends years of regular dialysis sessions that have to restricted his traveling, though have not stopped him leading Africa football.
"It has never been a secret that in recent years kidney-related problems has seen him undergo regular dialysis sessions,” CAF said in a statement last month, two days after Hayatou was placed in interim charge of FIFA.
“The programming has always been done in harmony with the agenda and (his) multiple professional obligations honored smoothly."
Cameroon-born Hayatou, a former athletics official, has had few challengers for power in Africa since getting elected in 1988 and this year forced a change in CAF rules that said the maximum age for a president was 70.
That will allow Hayatou to remain in the role past his current seventh term which expires in 2017.

LONDON Stanislas Wawrinka knows the challenge Andy Murray faces as he juggles the ATP World Tour Finals with preparing for a Davis Cup final but says the Scot will cope with his tricky schedule.
Wawrinka reached the semi-finals at the O2 season-ender last year, losing a grueling epic to Federer, before they teamed up to lead Switzerland to glory against France a few days later.
This year's Davis Cup final, like last year's, will be contested on an indoor claycourt, as Belgium seek to make the most of home advantage in Ghent and try to erode the impact of world number two Murray who will spearhead Britain's challenge for a first title since 1936.
With his first match at the Tour Finals looming on Monday against David Ferrer, Murray said on Friday he had yet to hit a ball on the medium-paced indoor hardcourt at the 02, preferring instead to cram in some more claycourt practise.
"I think he's already practised this week on clay and he has a good plan and he knows exactly what he's doing," said Wawrinka, who beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the opening match of last year's Davis Cup final to put Switzerland on the way.
"He knows how he is feeling. I'm sure Andy will be ready. He's had an amazing year, not just on the Tour but also what he did in the Davis Cup which has been quite impressive. I'm sure he will be ready for the final."
Murray, who has been drawn in a group with Spaniards Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer, and Wawrinka, will finish the year as world number two for the first time with a strong showing in London, and looked relaxed at his news conference on Friday.
"It's been good, practised Monday to Thursday on the clay and that went well," Murray said.
"The preparations have been tricky, it's never going to be perfect, but, you know, I would have signed up to be in this situation at the end of the year in comparison to last year and hopefully I can play some good tennis here and the Davis Cup."
Federer, who pulled out of last year's final against Novak Djokovic with a back injury that threatened his appearance in the Davis Cup final, said British fans should not be too worried about Murray's ability to switch surfaces so quickly.
"It's something we do, maybe not in a few days, but it's not very worrying," he said.  "If you had more time you would play better tennis but (the Davis Cup final) it's not a tournament, it's a two or three day thing and it's more important you are mentally ready.
"It's a great challenge for Andy."

LONDON Roger Federer believes tennis players should undergo more anti-doping tests to ensure the sport does not suffer the problems that have plunged athletics into crisis.
The Swiss 17-times grand slam champion said he was still surprised when he walks off court and is not routinely asked to provide a doping sample.
He has also called for more out-of-competition tests.
Speaking at a news conference at London's O2 Arena where the ATP World Tour Finals begin on Sunday, the 34-year-old said: "I think they are trying their most but we can do more.
"Whenever you make the quarter-finals of a tournament, when the points are greater, the money is greater, you should know that you will be tested.
"I think that would be very clear and simple. And if they keep the tests for longer, I'm all for that, not just weeks and months, years I'm talking about. That's when you scare people."
Federer was talking following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report, published on Monday, which said there was a state-sponsored doping culture in Russian athletics and that other sports could also be affected by the issue.
The Tennis Anti-Doping Programme, introduced in 1993, is administered by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) along with the ATP Tour and WTA Tour.
Since 2013 it has included the Athlete Biological Passport.
According to ITF figures there were 1,439 out-of competition blood and urine tests in 2014, out of a total 3,529.
A breakdown of samples shows the majority of professional players were tested between one and three times in competition while many underwent no out-of-competition tests in 2014.
Typically, top players including Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, had at least seven out-of-competition tests last year.
"There needs to be more resources," Federer said. "It's very important. Players need to feel that they're going to be tests. So they will shy away from any silly thought they might have.
"I'm always surprised when I walk off court after a final and I'm like 'where is anti-doping?'"
While the sport's big names earn million of dollars in prize money, the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme is funded by the ITF, ATP, WTA and the four grand slams.
Whether or not some of their winners' check should be taken to bolster the doping program is a bone of contention.
"Tennis is a rich sport and people who run the sport need to make sure the sport is completely and 100 percent clean," Nadal said on Friday. "It's not the players' responsibility, it's the management's responsibility."
Murray said he had been tested more this year than ever before, adding: "The prize money now is so high that there is no reason not to have as perfect a process as possible really and the more money invested in it gives you a better chance of catching anyone who is cheating."
World number one Djokovic said the introduction of the biological passport had been a welcome step.
"From the point of view of tennis, we've been very good that we've hadn't had many doping scandals," he said.
"It's very solid."

MADRID Five years after playing a part in Europe's Ryder Cup triumph in Wales, Edoardo Molinari must go through the trials and tribulations of six rounds of golf at Qualifying School in Spain in order to claim his tour card.
The 34-year-old Italian has endured a torrid season, plunging to 158th place on the money list after missing 10 cuts in 22 events.
Molinari is one of 156 players chasing a tour card at the PGA Catalunya Resort in Girona, with the top 25 and ties earning a place among Europe's elite next season.
"It's always a very long week, very stressful, and you need to be careful not to waste too much energy in the first few days because it’s almost like a marathon," the double European Tour winner said in a news release on Friday.
"You just have to be patient and play good golf and that will take care of everything else," said Molinari who made his Ryder Cup debut alongside younger brother Francesco at Celtic Manor in 2010.
"Experience always helps but I think the most important thing is to play well, play good golf shots, and everything else will be fine."
Francesco Molinari has fared better than his sibling, sitting 44th on the money list.
Rookie professional Paul Dunne, who was still an amateur when he shared the lead going into the final round of the British Open at St Andrews in July, is also in the field at Q School.
"Hopefully, it'll be a good week but if it's not, it's not the end of the world, I'll still have playing opportunities next year," said the 22-year-old Irishman.
"I’m just excited for the opportunity and hopefully I can play well, keep my composure and hit good shots at the right time. Everyone is going to hit bad shots so it’s a case of making par when you do."

MOSCOW Russia is ready to sack senior sports officials and shake up its system of anti-doping checks in order to convince world athletics' governing body not to bar Russian athletes from the next Olympics, the country's sports minister said on Friday.
The minister, Vitaly Mutko, was speaking shortly before the world governing body, the IAAF, meets in Monaco to decide what action to take against Russia after an international report alleged there was a culture of doping in Russian athletics.
Mutko unveiled concessions he said would be on the table, including sacking the leaders of the national athletics body, creating a new Russian anti-doping agency, and possibly bringing criminal charges against people involved in doping.
"He (Russian President Vladimir Putin) instructed us to do everything ... to once again analyze and study the facts and if necessary to create a new system that has the confidence of the international community," Mutko said.
He said he had removed the head of a Moscow anti-doping laboratory because he had lost the confidence of the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA). And he said he would consult with WADA when choosing a new boss for the laboratory.
But he also sounded a defiant note, saying Russia should not be singled out for special treatment when other countries were performing worse when it came to stamping out performance-enhancing drugs.
And it was not clear, he complained, why the World Anti-Doping Agency had decided Russia was suddenly not compliant with its rules after years of saying it was doing well.
"We have done work on anti-doping that no other country has been able to do," Mutko told a news conference. "We have invested colossal resources in fighting against this."

FULL COOPERATION
"We have clear instructions from the president to find common ground with international organizations and I will do that, I will cooperate with them. If we need to fire everyone, we will do that, but I will find common ground and cooperate."
Mutko said he did not believe the IAAF would go as far as to bar Russia's athletics team from international competition, saying some kind of temporary sanction was more likely.
If Russia went ahead and reformed its anti-doping system and its athletics federation, it would need a firm undertaking from the world anti-doping agency that it would not demand a fresh round of changes later on, he said.
"What should we do? Dance on the table? I do not know what else we should do," he told reporters. "We cannot have any anti-Russian investigations."
Asked if he had considered resigning over the doping affair, Mutko said: "I have not thought about that."

Park In-bee put down her golf clubs for eight days after withdrawing from her last start due to a cyst in her finger but showed no ill effects as she took the opening-round lead at the Lorena Ochoa Invitational on Thursday.
The South Korean world number two fired a four-under-par 68 at Club de Golf Mexico in Mexico City for a one-shot lead over Suzann Pettersen of Norway, Minjee Lee of Australia and American Angela Stanford, the 2008 winner.
Park, who had the cyst on her middle finger drained, made up for lost time with five birdies in her first eight holes.
“I was a little bit worried about not practicing for a few days, but I had a good day today, especially the front nine,” Park said.
“It was a good putting day. Obviously on the back nine I could’ve shot a little bit better but I have three more days to go and I just got to work on my ball striking."
Park needs at least an eighth-place finish to keep the Rolex Player of the Year race alive against frontrunner Lydia Ko.
Stanford used a hot putter to get into contention after enduring a bad bout of jet lag travelling to Mexico City after losing in a three-way playoff on Sunday at the Japan Classic.
The American said she felt like she had been "hit by a train” but did not think it would be an issue the rest of the week.
“I was putting really well again today,” she said. “Had 24 putts again today and did that two times last week in Japan."
Amateur Gaby Lopez of Mexico, among seven players tied for fifth at one-under 71, had no need for her putter on the par-three fifth.
“I hit a 170-yard shot perfect and it landed like three paces on and jumped and landed just right, right into the cup,” Lopez said.


Former British Open champion Justin Leonard fired a six-under-par 65 to join a four-way tie for the lead after Thursday's weather-interrupted opening round of the OHL Classic at Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.
Leonard, who had a bogey-free round at Mayakoba before wind and rain caused a 74-minute delay, shared the lead with Australian Aaron Baddeley, Shawn Stefani and Derek Fathauer.
The first round was suspended due to darkness with 21 players still on the course.
Tied for second on 66 were former winner D.J. Trahan, Charles Howell III, Michael Thompson and Patton Kizzire.
Leonard, 43, is planning to cut back on his playing schedule this season to spend more time with his family after moving with his wife and four young children from Dallas to Aspen, Colorado.
"We just moved to Colorado in August, and I want to just play the tournaments that I'm excited to go play and see what I can do," said 12-time PGA Tour winner Leonard, who won his only major at the 1997 Open.
Baddeley, a three-time winner on the Tour but who has lost his card, qualified for the event by finishing fourth at last week's Sanderson Farms Championship.
Stefani was runner-up at this event last year to Charley Hoffman.
Former U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell overcame a horrendous start to shoot 67.
The Northern Irishman pushed his opening tee shot out of bounds, then put his provisional on a similar line but stayed in play and scrambled to save double-bogey.
“I thought I was going to make about a 12 off the first, shake the lads’ hands on the second tee and say, ‘See you later,’” McDowell told Golf Channel.
“Golf’s a funny game. Sometimes some of your best rounds start off with a bogey or a double,” he said.


LONDON With three of the four grand slam titles and a record six Masters Series crowns scooped up in a year of domination, Novak Djokovic could be forgiven for using the ATP Tour Finals in London as a well-earned lap of honor.
Not a bit of it.
The 28-year-old world number one's appetite for stomping all over his supposed rivals is insatiable.
Serbian Djokovic will start as overwhelming favorite to claim a fourth consecutive title at the year-ender, having won 14 matches in a row at the Thames-side venue where last year ended in anti-climactic fashion as Roger Federer withdrew from their showdown with a back injury.
The numbers Djokovic has compiled this year surpass even his dominant 2011 campaign when he also won three majors.
He will arrive with a 78-5 win/loss record and on a 22-match winning streak, stretching back to his defeat by Federer in the Cincinnati final in August.
He has owned the number one ranking since July 2014 and he will end the year there for a fourth time -- the same as John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl.
"In terms of the grand slams, this has been a better season than 2011," Djokovic, who would have won all four but for an inspired Stanislas Wawrinka in the French Open final, said in an interview with Sport Magazine.
"It's about the overall feeling of my game -- the way I play and the way I feel on the court. I'm a more complete player physically; technically I've improved since 2011, and mentally I'm more stable."
Worryingly, no one seems to have a clue how to stop him.
World number two Andy Murray, who is juggling the Tour Finals on home soil with trying to win the Davis Cup for Britain for the first time since 1936 the week after, has lost 10 of his last 11 matches against Djokovic.
Murray failed to survive the round-robin stage last year when he was demolished by Federer.
Since losing to Djokovic in last week's Paris Masters final he has practiced mainly on clay in readiness for Davis Cup duty in Ghent.
He was, however, placed in the easier-looking group in Thursday's draw, avoiding Federer and Djokovic.
Federer, 34, always puts on a show in London -- having reached the final four times since the event moved from Shanghai in 2009, winning twice.
Unlike last year when several new faces qualified, this year's eight are the usual suspects, with Japan's Kei Nishikori the least experienced on his second appearance.
A rejuvenated Rafael Nadal is back after missing out last year through injury and while still not quite the formidable foe he was at his peak the Spaniard will relish testing his improvement against Murray and Wawrinka in group play.
David Ferrer and Tomas Berdych will do well to reach the semis, Wawrinka could be the dark horse after reaching the last four in 2013 and last year when he lost an epic to Federer.

AUSTIN, Texas Texas A&M University sued the Indianapolis Colts on Thursday, saying the NFL team has violated its trademark "The 12th Man" through the unauthorized use of the phrase in marketing material and merchandise.
The university has been aggressive in defending the trademark associated with its nearly century-old tradition of "The 12th Man," taking on the likes of the Seattle Seahawks football team and a double amputee in Buffalo it suspected of trademark infringement.
In the lawsuit, filed in U.S District Court in Houston, Texas A&M said its marketing connections to "The 12th Man" is likely being tarnished by the Colt's unauthorized use.
"We're aware of the media reports of the Texas A&M lawsuit but we've not yet had an opportunity to review the actual complaint," a Colts spokesman said.
According to the lawsuit, "The 12th MAN Mark was initially adopted in 1922 as a remembrance of a student at Texas A&M, E. King Gill, and his spirit of readiness to serve Texas A&M’s football team in time of need."
A dispute over the use of the phrase to refer to the fans of the Seattle Seahawks was settled in 2006, with the Seahawks paying a licensing fee and acknowledging the phrase it is the trademarked property of the Texas university.
Texas A&M President Michael Young says the university contacted the Colts at the same time and informed them it trademarked the phrase in 1990. He says the Colts did not adequately address the university's claims.
"We would prefer not to file lawsuits to protect our trademarks," Young said in a statement. 
"However, when our intellectual property, especially the 12th Man Mark, which is so important to our students and former students, is used without our permission after repeated attempts to engage on the matter, we are left with no choice."
In 2006, the university sent a cease and desist letter to the Colts and was assured by the team that it wanted an amicable outcome, and the Colts would not use the 12th Man beyond its stadium.
Over the next several years, Texas A&M became aware of new uses of the 12th Man, and in July 2105, it said the Colts used a "Join the 12th Man" in solicitations for football tickets. The team also used the phrase in Colts-branded items sold over the NFL's Internet shop, the lawsuit said.
There was no monetary amount for damages mentioned in the lawsuit.



LONDON The season-ending ATP World Tour Finals feature the top eight players in the rankings.

1 - Novak Djokovic (Serbia), aged 28, ninth appearance (champion four times)
Ending the year playing tennis at a level no one can match. But for losing to Stan Wawrinka in the French Open final, his 2015 would have gone down as one of the greatest seasons in the sport's history. He won the other three grand slams and six Masters Series titles and has a vice-like hold on the world number one ranking. Almost unbeatable.
- -
2 - Andy Murray (Britain), aged 28, eighth appearance
Murray reached the Australian Open final and the semis at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, won Masters crowns in Montreal and Madrid and can end the year ranked two for the first time. Has never won the season-ender and may have his mind elsewhere with the Davis Cup final looming.
- -
3 - Roger Federer (Switzerland), aged 34, 14th appearance (champion six times)
Still the top ticket in town, the 17-times grand slam champion's popularity in London knows no bounds. No discernible drop in his level and his Wimbledon win over Murray was arguably the best tennis he has ever played. With his serve working like clockwork and his volleying skills more in evidence he will be the favorite to stop Djokovic. Won six titles this year.
- -
4 - Stanislas Wawrinka (Switzerland), aged 30, third appearance
The only player to beat Djokovic in grand slam play this year when his lethal single-handed backhand, one of the great strokes in tennis, stopped the Serb in the French Open final.
Semi-finalist the last two years, Wawrinka will be expected to do at least as well this time.
- -
5 - Rafael Nadal (Spain), aged 29, seventh appearance (qualified 11 times but missed four years because of injury)
Finishing the year showing signs of a return to his best after  a disappointing season in which he failed to win a grand slam for the first year since 2004. Slipped out of the top five for the first time since 2005 early in the summer and was beaten by Djokovic in the French Open quarter-finals.
Good runs in Beijing, Shanghai and Basel made sure of his London spot, but no title since Hamburg in August.
- -
6 - Tomas Berdych (Czech Republic), aged 30, sixth appearance
The powerful Czech had another consistent year although again he spent most of it below the radar, picking up a couple of titles late in the season in Shenzhen and Stockholm. Beat a weakened Nadal at Australian Open. Reached the semi-finals in London in 2011.
- -
7 - David Ferrer (Spain), aged 33, seventh appearance (played last year as alternate)
Described his season as "unbelievable" after picking up his fifth title of the year by winning in Vienna. One of the most durable players on the Tour, he may not win many style points but will always give 100 percent and his game is under-estimated.
- -
8 - Kei Nishikori (Japan), aged 25, second appearance
The youngest of the eight qualifiers, Nishikori made the semi-finals on his debut a year ago but has struggled to live up to his 2014 breakthrough season when he made the U.S. Open final. Losing in first round at Flushing Meadows was a low point but he still picked up three titles and clearly has the weapons to challenge for majors in 2016.

BENGALURU India salvaged some pride and dented Guam's chances of making it to the next round of World Cup qualification with a 1-0 win on a rainy night in Bengaluru on Thursday.
Robin Singh's 10th minute strike was enough to secure the hosts's first points of the campaign, despite going a man down at the end of the first half after defender Sehnaj Singh was shown a straight red for a lunge on midfielder Justin David.
The winners of the eight groups and four best runners-up will advance through to the next stage qualification for Russia 2018, where Asia will have at least four representatives.
India, on three points after six games, have no hope of progressing and prop up Group D, but the defeat left Guam's hopes hanging by a thread.
The side from the tiny U.S. territory of less than 200,000 inhabitants in the North Pacific Ocean have been the surprise package of the five-team group so far.
Guam sit fourth in the standings, tied on seven points with Turkmenistan, whom they beat 1-0 in June in what was their first World Cup fixture since being thrashed 16-0 by Tajikistan in 2000.
Coach Gary White's team followed that up by beating India 2-1, before being trounced 6-0 by group leaders Iran.
They bounced back to hold Oman to a goalless draw, leaving them with a shout of making it to the next stage.
Guam have risen 19 places to 155th in the FIFA world rankings since the current round of qualifying began in June. India have sunk 31 places, to 172nd, just one spot above their worst-ever rank of 173rd.
"I'm very disappointed with the result. We dominated the game but were denied by a world-class finish. And that's the difference between the two teams, that we missed several goalscoring opportunities," White said.
With two qualifiers left to play, Guam host group leaders Iran next.
The Iranians, who have 11 points and a game in hand, lead Group D on goal difference, ahead of Oman, who Guam visit in their final fixture in March.
"We've got to get our heads back up," White said. "We need to dig deep and try to get some points in our next two games."

LA PAZ Striker Rodrigo Ramallo scored two first-half goals as Bolivia got their World Cup qualifying campaign off the ground with an exciting 4-2 home victory over Venezuela on Thursday.
The win at the Hernando Siles stadium lifted Bolivia off the bottom of South America's qualifying standings following two defeats last month in which they failed to score.
Bolivia, who have not reached the World Cup finals since 1994, avoided equaling their worst run of 10 qualifying matches without a win set between 2005 and 2008.
Venezuela, who had managed a 1-1 draw on their previous visit to La Paz for a qualifier in June 2013, struggled with Bolivia's pace 3,600 meters above sea level and are bottom with no points.
Ramallo opened the scoring in the 19th minute with a chip over goalkeeper Alain Baroja and four minutes later midfielder Juan Carlos Arce converted a penalty to put Venezuela in further trouble.
Mario Rondon got La Vinotinto back into the match after half an hour when deflected Tomas Rincon's initial effort past goalkeeper Daniel Vaca into the net.
The home side, however, took a 3-1 lead into the interval after Ramallo’s second goal, a diving header in first-half stoppage time.
Bolivia went three goals up three minutes into the second half when Rudy Cardozo converted on the rebound after Baroja had parried a shot from Ramallo.
Richard Blanco pulled another goal back in the 55th and Rondon had a header ruled out for offside in the dying minutes before Venezuela had striker Luis Seijas sent off deep into stoppage time.

SAO PAULO McLaren's Fernando Alonso says he has been 'on standby', or economy mode, this season to save his energies for what the Spaniard hopes will be a much better 2016.
"I did some good laps here and there," the double Formula One world champion told reporters at the Brazilian Grand Prix, singling out qualifying in Japan and then the U.S. race in Austin last month.
"But apart from these two moments I don't think that I had the best season, so definitely I need to improve for next year," he added.
"When you are at the front and you have more motivation that helps...but I'm on standby, let's say, in economy mode, to have full energy next year."
Alonso joined McLaren at the end of last season from Ferrari, where he finished championship runner-up in three of his five seasons at Maranello.
At McLaren, he and British team mate Jenson Button have endured the worst season in the history of the sport's second most successful team as new engine partners Honda struggle to fine performance and reliability.
While Button has scored 16 points from 17 races, Alonso has managed just 11.
Despite that, Alonso said it would be a surprise if McLaren were not "very, very competitive" next season.
"We have high hopes for next year and I really trust the team and really believe we have the talented people and the resources to have everything to do well," he said.
Button, the 2009 champion, also sounded optimistic.
"I know we keep saying it, but it is still a very young partnership," said the Briton.
"We’ve learned so much this year with the power unit, with the idea of the aerodynamics of the car, because it’s very different to a normal McLaren, so there is a lot of learning to take from this season.
"We obviously need to make a big step next year -- we know that -- so it’s going to be a long, hard winter, but an exciting one as well."

AUSTIN, Texas Texas A&M University sued the Indianapolis Colts on Thursday, saying the NFL team has violated its trademark "The 12th Man" through the unauthorized use of the phrase in marketing material and merchandise.
The university has been aggressive in defending the trademark associated with its nearly century-old tradition of "The 12th Man," taking on the likes of the Seattle Seahawks football team and a double amputee in Buffalo it suspected of trademark infringement.
In the lawsuit, filed in U.S District Court in Houston, Texas A&M said its football and marketing connections to "The 12th Man" is likely being diminished and tarnished by the unauthorized use by the Colts.
The Colts were not immediately available for comment.
According to the lawsuit, "The 12th MAN Mark was initially adopted in 1922 as a remembrance of a student at Texas A&M, E. King Gill, and his spirit of readiness to serve Texas A&M’s football team in time of need."
A dispute over the use of the phrase to refer to the fans of the Seattle Seahawks was settled in 2006, with the Seahawks paying a licensing fee and acknowledging in the use of the phrase that it is the trademarked property of the Texas university.
Texas A&M President Michael Young says the university contacted the Colts at the same time and informed them that it trademarked the phrase in 1990. He says the Colts did not adequately address the university's claims.

Over the next several years, Texas A&M became aware of new uses of the 12th Man mark, and in July 2105, it said the Colts used a "Join the 12th Man" in solicitations for single-game football tickets. The team also used the phrase in Colts-branded items sold over the NFL's Internet shop, the lawsuit said.
There was no monetary amount for damages mentioned in the lawsuit.



MADRID Jorge Lorenzo's celebration of his MotoGP world title on his home island of Mallorca on Thursday was interrupted unexpectedly when the Spanish Yamaha rider suffered what appeared to be minor burns to his leg from a motorcycle.
Lorenzo, who wrapped up his third title when he won Sunday's Valencia Grand Prix, was about to leave the airport near the capital Palma to ride in a cavalcade with fans when hot smoke poured out of the machine forcing him to leap off.
He later appeared at an event with Balearic Islands president Francina Armengol with a thick bandage covering his left leg from knee to ankle.
"If I was able to race in Assen having just had a collarbone operation this is nothing," Lorenzo was quoted as saying in local media.
Lorenzo beat Italian Yamaha team mate Valentino Rossi to the title by five points, with Spanish compatriot and defending champion Marc Marquez of Honda third.

Spain's Sergio Garcia shot a sparkling eight-under-par 64 to grab the first round lead at the European Tour's BMW Masters in Shanghai on Thursday.
The Spaniard produced nine birdies in his round at Lake Malaren Golf Club in Shanghai to sit one clear of South Korea's An Byeong-hun and Victor Dubuisson of France in the penultimate event of the European Tour's Race to Dubai series.
World number 11 Garcia is looking for his first win this year and was optimistic of breaking the drought after another trademark strong round tee-to-green.
"I drove the ball very well and that gave me a lot of opportunities to hit some good iron shots. It was a nice round," the 35-year-old Spaniard said.
"I had a couple of nice birdies, three birdies in the first four on my front nine and then another three or four birdies on the first four or five on the back nine.
"Hopefully, I keep improving as the week goes on and we'll be out there on Sunday having a chance."
Northern Ireland's Rory McIlory, the current Race to Dubai leader, is not playing in Shanghai this week which gives the chasing pack an opportunity to close in on the world number three before next week's finale in the UAE.
England's Danny Willett is second in the standings, Ireland's Shane Lowry third and South African Louis Oosthuizen fourth but all three struggled to keep pace with Garcia on Thursday's opening day.
Willett could only manage a level par 72, while Lowry and Oosthuizen were at two-under in a share of 24th.
England's Justin Rose boosted his chances of improving on his fifth place standing by firing an opening round five-under-par 67 to share sixth with compatriot Paul Casey and Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee.
Thongchai's card was spoiled by two dropped shots in his final four holes.

Daily fantasy sports sites FanDuel and DraftKings are prepared to fight in court against New York state's top prosecutor, who said that they were running illegal gambling operations and ordered them to stop taking bets in the state.
DraftKings called the cease and desist order issued by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Tuesday "hasty and uninformed" and said it was prepared to mount a legal challenge so the company could continue operating in the state.
"We will pursue this fight to the fullest to ensure that New York fantasy sports fans do not need to stop playing," DraftKings said in a statement on Wednesday.
FanDuel also said it plans a legal challenge.
In addition, DraftKings and FanDuel began mobilizing hundreds of thousands of their users in New York state, asking them to send Schneiderman emails voicing support for the games. FanDuel said they have more than 600,000 players in the state; DraftKings said there were more than 500,000 daily fantasy players there.
The two companies, which have five business days to respond to the order issued by Schneiderman on Tuesday, have continued to take money from customers in the state, they said.
In the games, fans pay to compete for daily cash prizes based on imaginary teams assembled from rosters of real players, which accumulate points based on how those players perform in actual games. This has enabled fans to spend money on the games with a frequency that critics say is akin to sports betting.
Schneiderman's order does not apply to season-long fantasy sports contests.
The order is the latest to threaten the fast-growing, multi-billion dollar daily fantasy sports industry. The two companies have become the subject of congressional inquiries and a ban in Nevada after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on television advertising in 2015.
They have been at the center of controversy since early October when a DraftKings employee won $350,000 from a $25 entry in an American football contest on the rival FanDuel site. The two companies then banned their employees from playing, but local and federal authorities began to investigate whether the fantasy sites offered games of chance, which were essentially gambling.
Schneiderman said they were in violation of state law against illegal gambling because customers "are clearly placing bets on events outside of their control or influence."

BIG-TIME BACKERS
DraftKings and FanDuel are private companies with valuations of more then a billion dollars.
High-profile investors poured money into both this year.
DraftKings raised $300 million from investors including Fox Sports, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the Madison Square Garden Company, the Raine Group and Wellington Management. Around the same time, FanDuel raised $275 million from investors such as private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), Google Capital and the venture arms of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).
DraftKings and FanDuel have both hired former New York prosecutors for advice as scrutiny by regulators and law enforcement agencies intensifies.
FanDuel’s lawyer, Sharon Cohen Levin, previously headed the money laundering and asset forfeiture unit at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. She was not immediately available for comment. Avi Weitzman, who represents DraftKings, spent seven years in the same office. Weitzman declined to comment.
Both companies have hired lobbyists in Washington.
FanDuel hired Steptoe & Johnson and spent $20,000 on lobbying, the company said in its first lobbying disclosure filed in late October.
DraftKings hired Morgan, Lewis and Bockius and reported spending $10,000 for the quarter, the company said in its lobbying disclosure filing.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Several smaller daily fantasy sports sites have stopped doing business in New York after the state's attorney general ordered market leaders FanDuel and DraftKings to stop taking bets there.
DailyMVP and DraftOps said they stopped taking payments in New York after Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought to shut down the business in the state by their larger competitors. In addition, European daily fantasy site Mondogoal also said it would cease taking money in the state for now.
Schneiderman, in a letter to DraftKings and FanDuel on Tuesday, declared that the two daily fantasy sports sites were running an illegal gambling operation.
The move jeopardizes a major market in the multi-billion dollar daily fantasy sports industry and leaves many smaller operators in limbo over their New York operations.
Schneiderman's order is an edict for other daily fantasy sports sites in New York’s market, said David Klein, a New York lawyer who advises daily fantasy sports sites on compliance issues. Klein immediately told his clients to stop doing business in the state because of the order, he said.
"To proceed otherwise is dangerous, to say the least, at this juncture," said Klein, who does not advise DailyMVP or DraftOps.
In the games, fans pay to compete for daily cash prizes based on imaginary teams assembled from rosters of real players, which accumulate points based on how those players perform in actual games. This has enabled fans to spend money on the games with a frequency that critics say is akin to sports betting.
Schneiderman was pleased by the smaller operators' decisions to cease operations in New York.
"We urge FanDuel and DraftKings to follow this example, by immediately meeting the terms of the Attorney General’s letter, and by ending their illegal gambling enterprise -- and the economic and public health harms that come with it -- here in New York," spokesman Matt Mittenthal said.
DraftKings and FanDuel have five business days to respond to Schneiderman's order and continue to take money from customers in the state. Both are working to fight the order.
DailyMVP and DraftOps said they would wait and see how their larger competitors fare in contesting the order.
"While we disagree with this decision, we have determined to respect the order of the attorney general," a DailyMVP spokeswoman said. New York customers can continue to play games that are free, she said.
DraftOps did not receive an order, but also wants to follow all laws and regulations in the places where it operates, said Marie Vozikis, Operations Manager, in a statement.

(The Sports Xchange) - Forward Kenneth Faried's layup with five seconds left gave the Denver Nuggets a 103-102 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday.
Faried finished with 19 points and nine rebounds, and forward Danilo Gallinari had 25 points for the Nuggets (4-4). Guard Emmanuel Mudiay finished with 16 points and 11 assists.
Faried delivered the win when he grabbed an errant jump shot by Gallinari and put it in.
Milwaukee guard Khris Middleton missed a 20-foot jumper from the baseline that would have won it for the Bucks (4-5).
Guard Jerryd Bayless led Milwaukee with 22 points off the bench, and center Greg Monroe had 18 points and 10 rebounds. Guard Greivis Vasquez added 15 points and nine assists.
Milwaukee led most of the game before falling behind by 13 early in the fourth. Bayless scored 11 points in a 13-2 Bucks run that cut Denver's lead to 95-93.
Bayless tied it with a three-pointer with 1:54 left, and forward Johnny O'Bryant's baseline jumper gave the Bucks a 100-98 advantage with 1:21 remaining.
Mudiay then split a pair of free throws to make it a one-point game before Milwaukee forward Giannis Antetokounmpo hit a soft jumper at the rim with 17.5 seconds left. Denver called timeout and set up the winning sequence.

(The Sports Xchange) - After a quiet first half, Stephen Curry turned up the volume in the second half and finished with a game-high 28 points as the Golden State Warriors remained the league's only unbeaten team with a 100-84 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday.
A little more than a week after the Grizzlies had suffered a franchise-worst 50-point defeat to the Warriors (9-0) at Oracle Arena, Memphis scrapped to within a point of the defending NBA champions in the third quarter.
After a pair of free throws from power forward Zach Randolph (19 points, seven rebounds) with 3:37 left in the third quarter, the Grizzlies trailed 57-56. But Curry's 17 points in the third quarter were too much and a steal and buzzer-beating 3-pointer from the league's reigning MVP gave the Warriors a 74-63 lead going into the final frame.
Memphis (3-6) lost its fourth straight and shot just 34.3 percent, going 24-for-70 from the floor. Memphis, which entered the night ranked 29th in the NBA in made treys and 3-point percentage, went 3-for-15 from beyond the arc for 20 percent.
The Warriors shot 48 percent from the floor, going 36-for-75. They hit 11-of-27 from 3-point range for 40.7 percent.
Swingman Andre Iguodala had 20 points off the bench for Golden State and forward Harrison Barnes finished with 19 points. In addition to his 28 points, Curry had five rebounds, five assists and five steals.
Center Marc Gasol scored a season-best 26 points and seven rebounds for Memphis and swingman Tony Allen chipped in 15 points. Starting point guard Mike Conley went 1-for-12 from the field and scored just four points.

SOCHI, Russia President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia needed to conduct its own investigation into allegations its athletes had systematically taken performance-enhancing substances and that someone needed to take personal responsibility for the problem.
Putin, in his first comments since an independent commission from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) levelled its accusations, said Russia needed to cooperate with international organisations looking into the issue as openly as it could.
"I ask the minister of sport and all our colleagues who are linked in one way or another with sport to pay this issue the greatest possible attention," Putin said ahead of a meeting with sports officials in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
"It is essential that we conduct our own internal investigation and provide the most open -- and I want to underline -- the most open professional cooperation with international anti-doping structures."
A judo black belt, Putin, who has built much of his own image on Russia's sporting prowess, said the problem of doping was not only confined to Russia, but said his country had a duty to protect its athletes from banned substances.
"The battle must be open. A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest," said Putin, adding that if problems were found someone would have to personally assume responsibility for the issue.

LOS ANGELES Walt Disney Co CEO Bob Iger has teamed up with the National Football League's Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers to try to build them a stadium in a Los Angeles suburb, backers of the project said in a statement on Wednesday.
Iger has been named non-executive chairman of Carson Holdings LLC, the joint venture between the two teams that is working with the city of Carson, California, on a project to build a stadium in the city.
He will continue as Disney's chairman and CEO, and will not be required to do anything that conflicts with that role, the statement from Carson Holdings said.
Iger, one of the most powerful executives in Hollywood, could have the clout to attract major sponsors for the stadium project. His hiring represents a boost to the effort to bring the two National Football League teams to Carson.
The Chargers and the Raiders are seeking to gain support for their plan from NFL owners. The owner of the St. Louis Rams has been pursuing a rival proposal to build a stadium in Inglewood, just north of Carson, and relocate his team there.
The announcement of Iger's role on behalf of the Chargers and the Raiders came on the same day those two teams and the Rams presented their proposals to relocate to the Los Angeles area to NFL leaders in New York.
The Los Angeles region, the second-largest market in U.S. sports, has been without an NFL team since 1995, when the Rams left Anaheim for St. Louis and the Raiders returned to their previous home of Oakland.
Iger, who will receive a salary of $1 a year in his position with Carson Holdings, will have an option once he departs his role at Disney to acquire a minority share in either the Raiders or the Chargers, said the statement from Carson Holdings.
One of his main tasks is expected to be hiring the president of Carson Holdings.
"Should the owners approve the move, Los Angeles will proudly welcome two incredible teams to our community and build a stadium worthy of their fans," Iger said in a statement.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland Former world athletics (IAAF) president Lamine Diack has resigned as honorary member of the International Olympic Committee following the launch of a formal investigation against the Senegalese for suspected corruption and money-laundering, the IOC said on Wednesday.
Diack, provisionally suspended by the IOC on Tuesday and who has also resigned as president of the International Athletics Foundation, is alleged to have received more than one million euros ($1.07 million) in bribes in 2011 to cover up positive doping tests of Russian athletes.
The 82-year-old, an IOC member from 1999 to 2013 before becoming an honorary member a year later, was placed under formal investigation in France this week and questioned by authorities before being released on a bail bond of 500,000 euros ($536,700) and banned from leaving the country.
Diack's resignation from the Olympic body came two days after the publication of a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent commission report on allegations of widespread corruption and collusion by Russian officials, including state security services, to cover up results of drug tests, destroy samples and intimidate laboratory staff.
The report also identified "systematic failures" by the IAAF governing body, already rocked by the probe against Diack and other officials.
"This was shocking and saddening news," IOC President Thomas Bach told reporters.
"I could never have imagined in an international federation the leadership would solicit bribes from athletes in order to manipulate sports competitions. This is unbelievable.
"But we will not just stay there at being sad. We will take action," he said. "You will see medals withdrawn, athletes sanctioned by the IAAF, athletes and officials excluded from the Olympics and you will see action led by the IOC to make anti-doping testing independent from sport organisations.
Diack served as president of the IAAF from 1999 until August this year when he was succeeded by Briton Sebastian Coe. His son Papa Massata Diack and three others have also been charged with various alleged breaches of the IAAF's Code of Ethics.
Diack was a powerful figure within the IOC as he controlled the flagship sport of the Olympic Games for more than 15 years, with athletics also a big beneficiary, along with swimming, of the IOC's Olympic Games financial contributions.
Bach said it was now up to the new leadership of the IAAF under Coe to take the necessary measures to restore trust in the sport.
"I am confident Sebastian Coe and his team will do everything necessary to clean the federation there," Bach said, when asked whether a Russian team would be cleared to take part in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics next year.


Formula One's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone has expressed concern for the future of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin following the reduction of a Texas state subsidy.
"If it's changed, it's going to be difficult to continue the race in Austin," the Briton told the Austin American-Statesman (www.mystatesman.com) from Brazil, where the sport holds its penultimate race of the season this weekend.
The newspaper said the governor's office had confirmed that  state payments to support the 2015 race would drop by more than 20 percent.
It said that this year's payment, based on a different formula for calculating how much economic activity the race generates for Texas, would be closer to $19.5 million than the previous $25 million.
"To use a technical term, I think we're screwed," said Circuit of the Americas chairman Bobby Epstein, who has to pay Ecclestone a significant annual sum in race hosting fees.
"The state clearly made promises. I think we made a deal, and we lived up to our end of the deal," he said of the recalculation.
"It's like if you go to a restaurant and order a dinner, and then after you've eaten the meal they change the price."
The Austin circuit is Formula One's first purpose-built track in the United States and has hosted a grand prix since 2012.
This year's event, which saw Britain's Lewis Hamilton take a third world championship last month, was badly hit by the weather with Epstein saying the heavy rain had been "financially devastating".
Saturday's final practice took place behind closed doors and, when fans were admitted, qualifying could not go ahead and was postponed until the Sunday morning.
The race also attributed the reduced crowd in part to the return of neighboring Mexico to the calendar after a 23-year absence.
The race day crowd in Mexico City was put at 135,000.
"The big question now is: "Is the race coming back?,"  Epstein told the newspaper.

BERLIN Athletics was struggling to compete for funding with money-spinning sports such as soccer and baseball even before the latest doping scandal; but that task has now grown much harder despite the booming popularity of amateur running.
An independent commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) alleged on Monday widespread corruption and collusion by Russian officials to cover up drug test results and identified "systematic failures" by the sports world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
"This is a real punch to the jaw for athletics. Already it was a difficult sell. This is going to make it a very, very difficult sell," said Andrew Woodward, a sports marketing consultant who was director of public relations for Olympics sponsor Visa until 2011.
IAAF partner Canon Inc, the world's biggest maker of cameras and printers, said it was disappointed by the reports of unethical behavior in the sport and said it expected the IAAF "to respond swiftly and responsibly".
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for China's petrochemical corporation Sinopec, which is still listed on the IAAF website as an official partner, said that it had completed its cooperation with the organization, and would need to consider whether further sponsorship was in line with group strategy.
Athletics takes center stage at the Olympics every four years but lacks a high-profile annual event and is a small fish in the pool for sponsorship and rights money dominated by the likes of soccer, baseball and basketball.
The flagship Diamond League series of events lost its title sponsor Samsung two years ago and has gone ahead without a title sponsor since.
Underlining the relative status of the sport, Adidas, another IAAF sponsor, did not even mention the forthcoming Rio Olympics in its quarterly results presentation last week, as it focused instead on product launches for the soccer Euro 2016 competition.
Sebastian Coe, the former British Olympic champion and businessman who was elected IAAF president on a manifesto promising reform last year, has said he wants to overhaul the athletics calendar, attract more young people, restructure the IAAF commercial department and improve athletes' finances.
Coe, still a special adviser to Nike, headed the bid for and organization of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.

FEW ATHLETES BENEFIT FROM RUNNING BOOM
The IAAF has struggled so far to capitalize on the booming popularity of amateur running. General U.S. running participation has grown 70 percent over the last decade, according to the National Sporting Goods Association.
Adidas expects to double the size of its running business by 2020, while rival Nike predicts it can grow the business to $7.5 billion by end of its 2020 fiscal year from $4.9 billion in fiscal 2015.
However, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, sponsored by Puma, is the only star from track and field to make it into the Forbes magazine's list of the highest paid athletes, earning some $21 million annually, still putting him only 73rd in a list headed by boxer Floyd Mayweather on $300 million.
The other best paid track and field athletes are mostly long-distance runners like Kenya's Dennis Kimetto and Mary Keitany, both sponsored by Adidas, who benefit from the exposure and prize money from a busy marathon calendar.
A survey by the U.S. Track & Field Athletes Association showed that approximately 50 percent of athletes who rank in the top 10 in the United States make less than $15,000 annually from sponsorships, grant and prize money.
Many athletes are forced to take full time jobs or a variety of part time work to continue their participation in athletics.
Britain's Olympic heptathlon gold medalist Jessica Ennis-Hill, who is sponsored by Adidas, says she might have pursued a career as a sports psychologist if National Lottery funding had not allowed her to train full time.
The scandal in athletics may be more damaging than that enveloping soccer body FIFA, since it goes beyond illegal profiteering and touches on questions of the sport's legitimacy. Suppression, in return for payment, of test results showing athletes had used drugs means medals may have been awarded to cheats and more worthy competitors denied recognition.
The fraud is played out on track and field, sometimes before an international audience.
"Obviously track and field is not a top-of-line sport except during Olympic years," said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco.
"So any sort of scandal is going to hurt the event and is going to hurt it more just because legitimacy is such an issue."
"It's similar to the Tour de France. You talk about cycling and what scandal has done to that sport and how it is just not taken as seriously as it used to be. I would put it (track and field) in that same category."

LONDON Triple Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton is unwell and has delayed his flight to Brazil on medical advice but will compete in this weekend's penultimate race of the season, Mercedes said on Wednesday.
A team spokesman said the 30-year-old Briton had a fever but would be flying to Sao Paulo later on Wednesday, a day later than planned.
Hamilton had earlier pulled out of a sponsor event in Sao Paulo, triggering speculation locally that he could miss the race.
The Briton clinched his third title in Texas last month, with three races to spare, and Mercedes have also retained their constructors' crown.
"No, he's not going to miss the race," the spokesman said. "He's going to be a day late... the doctor advised him to cancel the earlier flight so he missed a press conference today."
Hamilton has never won the Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos, the home race of his late boyhood idol and fellow triple champion Ayrton Senna.
The Briton's German team mate Nico Rosberg won the race last season.

MELBOURNE The explosive report on Russia's anti-doping regime came as no surprise to former World Anti-Doping Agency president John Fahey, who held grave doubts about the country's commitment to catching drug cheats during his time in charge.
The agency's chief for six years until 2013, one of Fahey's last acts as president was to suspend the accreditation of Russia's sole WADA-approved laboratory in Moscow after an audit found it had failed to meet standards.
The same laboratory's accreditation was suspended again on Tuesday after an independent commission set up by WADA alleged it had destroyed samples and its staff had taken bribes in exchange for covering up athletes' positive tests.
"(The report) certainly didn’t surprise me," Fahey told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"We had Russia under constant watch in my time.
"What was apparent during my time was that they weren’t doing enough in their anti-doping efforts and that this report shows that it’s only got worse."
Fahey said WADA had regularly outlined the concerns about Russia to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
"We did everything we could to try to improve the standards of Russian anti-doping, we made it clear to the IOC of our concerns on a regular basis.
"Nevertheless you just knew there was a limited effort being made."
The Kremlin has dismissed the allegations in the report as groundless, while Russian sporting chiefs alleged the international furor over doping was politically motivated.
Some believe the scandal could have bigger ramifications than the graft affair at FIFA, where president Sepp Blatter has been suspended, 14 officials and marketing executives have been indicted, and Switzerland is investigating the awarding of two World Cups: to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022.

'BAD DAYS'
Fahey said he made one visit to the Moscow laboratory during his term at WADA. During which the lab's director, Grigory Rodchenkov, who was accused in the WADA report of covering up test results and bribe-taking, said he had doped when he was a track athlete in the 1980s.
"He showed me a picture of four runners on one of the walls, I asked him who the athletes were in the picture," Fahey said.
"He said he was one of them and all four were doping. I was somewhat staggered.
"He then said, 'of course, things have changed since then. Those were my bad days,' -- or words to that effect."
Rodchenkov resigned as the lab's director on Tuesday, TASS news agency reported citing Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko.
Fahey said he met Mutko at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and voiced his concern over what he described as Russia's "miniscule" annual anti-doping budget of $6 million at the time -- "about half that of Australia's".
Russia had implemented some measures during his time at WADA, he added, including allowing anti-doping officers from outside the country to visit after having previously denied them visas.
But he was never convinced any testing occurred outside the capital.
"It was pretty clear the testing was only going on when the athletes were being tested in Moscow. And Russia’s a big country," he said. "What was going on in the vast expanses of Russia, there was no indication.
"There’s a lot of a things you just can’t get near in Russia. It’s much easier to ask questions in a place like England."
The WADA commission recommended that Russia be banned from international athletics, including the 2016 Olympic Games.
Fahey would not offer his opinion on the recommendation, but said it would not have been delivered lightly.
"It's abundantly clear that there are gross breaches of standards (in the report) and the application of the WADA code," he said.
"Given the importance they play in the international sporting world, it’s really disappointing and does require some very serious responses."


LONDON The International Olympic Committee (IOC) wants disciplinary procedures to be opened against athletes who have violated doping rules as the fallout continued on Tuesday from WADA's explosive report on the issue.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commission on Monday alleged widespread corruption and collusion by Russian officials, including state security services, to cover up drug test results, destroy samples and intimidate laboratory staff.
It also identified "systematic failures" by the sports world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
The IOC said competitors, coaches or officials mentioned in the WADA report who were proven to have violated doping regulations should be punished and stripped of any medals.
"The IOC has asked the IAAF to initiate disciplinary procedures against all athletes, coaches and officials who have participated in the Olympic Games and are accused of doping in the report of the independent commission," it said in a statement.
"With its zero-tolerance policy against doping, following the conclusion of this procedure, the IOC will take all the necessary measures and sanctions with regard to the withdrawal and re-allocation of medals and, as the case may be, exclusion of coaches and officials from future Olympic Games."
The former global athletics head Lamine Diack, who is under investigation in France on suspicion of corruption and money laundering, was also provisionally suspended by the IOC and resigned as International Athletics Foundation (IAF) chief.

RUSSIAN DEFIANCE
The early effects of the report were starting to be felt on Tuesday as a Moscow laboratory used for doping tests stopped operating after its accreditation was suspended by WADA.
The Russian Sports Ministry said it was open for closer cooperation with WADA to eliminate any irregularities committed by Russia's anti-doping watchdog and its accredited laboratory.
The overall tone emanating from Moscow, however, was defensive with a string of officials denouncing the findings of WADA, which has recommended that Russian athletes are excluded from international events including the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.
The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, described WADA's doping allegations as "quite groundless".
The Sports Ministry also said Russia's anti-doping policy had strictly complied with WADA norms.
The now-closed Moscow laboratory processed tests for more than 20 sports, suggesting the alleged drug cheating could be widespread.
Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the laboratory's head, Grigory Rodchenkov, had resigned.
"Rodchenkov, an experienced man, took the decision to resign to take all the negativity with him," Tass news agency quoted Mutko as saying.
In the face of defiance from Russian officials, a WADA spokesman issued a statement defending the report, which they said left "no stone unturned in producing its evidence".
"The report offers a real opportunity for wrongs in anti-doping processes to be righted," the statement read.
“Many of the recommendations will be on the table at WADA's Board meeting in Colorado Springs next week."

DIACK SUSPENDED
Diack, the former IAAF president and until Tuesday an honorary member of the IOC, quit his position as head of the IAF, a Monaco-based charity best known for its work with the year-end world athletics gala in Monte Carlo.
Diack, who stepped down as IAAF chief in August, last week was placed under formal investigation by French authorities.
The office of France's financial prosecutor claims he received over 1 million euros ($1.07 million) in bribes in 2011 to cover up positive doping tests of Russian athletes.
While the current scandal has focused primarily on Russia, Kenya is another country facing possible action from WADA if it does not make serious efforts to tackle doping.
The chairman of Kenya's Olympic committee said on Tuesday the country needed to act swiftly to prevent its athletes being banned at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
Several Kenyans have failed doping tests in recent years, staining the reputation of the east African country whose middle and long-distance runners have been among some of the globe's most dominant athletes.
WADA last week threatened Kenya with a four-year ban unless it improved its efforts to catch cheats, but Kipchoge Keino, a Kenyan running great and chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK), said government officials had shown little stomach to chase down offenders.
"I have personally tried to reach government officials to agree on how to act on this menace but I don’t get appointments. I make calls that are unanswered," Keino told Reuters.

MOSCOW A possible ban on Russian athletes in the 2016 Olympics would be because "some wish to remove a direct competitor and some find it beneficial to damage the country's image", Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko told the sports agency R-Sport.
Mutko added that Russian Anti-Doping Agency would be able to prove it acted in line with the rules of a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

WELLINGTON Olympics chief Thomas Bach expects Russia will comply with doping regulations in time for its athletes to compete at next year's Rio Games despite calls for the country to be banned amid allegations of state-backed cheating.
An independent commission set up by the World Anti-Doping Association (WADA) recommended Russia's athletics federation be banned from the sport following allegations of widespread corruption and collusion by Russian officials, which include covering up positive drug tests.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it wanted disciplinary procedures to be opened and warned that any competitors, coaches or officials mentioned in the WADA report who were proved to have violated doping regulations would be punished and stripped of medals.
In an interview with New Zealand television on Wednesday, IOC President Bach would not speculate on whether all Russian athletes should be banned from the 2016 Olympics.
He said it was up to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to determine if sanctions were necessary.
"I will not speculate on this," Bach said. "Now we have this enquiry about athletics, the international federation will draw its conclusion and will take the necessary measures."
Bach added he had full confidence that new IAAF President Sebastian Coe would take action to clean up the sport and also expected Russian officials would comply with all procedures to ensure their athletes compete in Rio.
"We're convinced that the president, Sebastian Coe, will do whatever is necessary," Bach said.
"I think also Russia will cooperate to make progress and to be sure that Russian athletics are compliant with WADA.
"This is what it needs to be in order to participate in the Olympic Games."
The IOC has provisionally suspended former global athletics head Lamine Diack, who is under investigation in France on suspicion of corruption and money laundering, and reiterated its stance that it had a zero tolerance policy against doping.
Bach, a trained lawyer, said it was important that the right procedures were followed to protect clean athletes.


(The Sports Xchange) - The New Orleans Pelicans snapped a six-game losing start to the season with a 120-105 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, but celebrations for a first win of the campaign were muted in the wake of an injury to Andrew Davis.
Star forward Davis suffered a right hip contusion at the conclusion of the first half and did not return. He was not on the bench during the second half nor in the locker room after the game. X-rays came back negative.
"He got hit with a knee," Pelican coach Alvin Gentry told reporters, adding he was not sure if Davis would make the trip to Atlanta for Wednesday's game against the Hawks.
"Such is life," he added with a wry smile.
Ryan Anderson recorded his first double-double of the season, scoring 25 points and grabbing 11 rebounds off the bench to lead New Orleans.
Davis, Eric Gordon, Ish Smith and Toney Douglas scored 17 apiece for the Pelicans, while Jrue Holiday added 10 points in a little more than 15 minutes.
"Obviously, when (Davis) goes out, guys have to step up," Anderson said. "We did that. I mean you go down the line, guys really just played their hearts out."
Dirk Nowitzki scored 18 points to lead the Mavericks, who have lost three of their past four games.
Charlie Villaneuva added 15 points, Zaza Pachulia 12, Justin Anderson 11 and Dwight Powell and J.J. Barea 10 apiece for Dallas, who trailed 58-40 after two quarters and by as many as 28 in the second half.
Nowitzki played a little more than five minutes in the second half, all coming early in the third quarter when he scored nine points but Dallas was still unable to pose a threat.
"Overall, just not good enough tonight," Nowitzki said. "We had some great looks. We finished the (first) half brutal. We had to put some stops together, and we did not do that."
The Mavericks, who missed numerous uncontested shots throughout the game, were 5-of-20 in three-point attempts and shot 44 percent from the field.
Testimony to their hustle and sense of urgency, the Pelicans out-scored Dallas 23-9 in fast break points.
"We have to do a (heck) of a lot better," Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. "We missed some open shots. Their level of force was higher without question."
Dallas got off to perhaps it worst start of the season and never recovered and even with Davis sidelined, the Pelicans out-scored Dallas 36-35 in the third quarter to enter the final period with a 19-point lead.
"That is very important in every game, to get that fast start and create that tempo," Gordon said. "We wanted to play fast."

(The Sports Xchange) - Cleveland forward LeBron James reminded the NBA of his raw power on Tuesday, scoring 31 points, including 17 in the fourth quarter, as the Cavaliers muscled their way to a 118-114 victory over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday.
The Cavaliers trailed by as many as nine in the fourth, but James stole a pass and dribbled the length of the floor for an impressive three-point play.
Jazz guard Rodney Hood did his best to wrap up James and prevent the shot, but the Cavs forward powered through for the basket and foul. He looked at Hood and slapped his biceps as the sellout crowd roared.
"Bron is the greatest player in the game. I don't think there's anyone with a higher basketball IQ or a better understanding of the moment," Cavs coach David Blatt said.
"I think he just understood the moment. He took over the game and lifted the rest of the guys with him. He did the things that a great player like him, only him, can do."
James' three-point play pulled the Cavs within 95-94 but gave them all the momentum. It revived a slumbering team that remained unbeaten at home (5-0) with their seventh consecutive victory.
However, Cleveland (7-1) had to work for it on a night when they were sloppy with the ball (17 turnovers) and off rhythm.
"The win is the only thing that's important to me," James said. "We had some good points, we had some bad points, but we stuck with it."
James added eight assists and seven rebounds, while Mo Williams had 29 points, six rebounds and six assists. He made his first eight shots and did not miss until 1:37 remained. Kevin Love had 22 points and eight rebounds for the Cavaliers.
Alec Burks scored 24 points off the bench for the Jazz (4-3), while forwards Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors each scored 17 points. Rudy Gobert had 15 points, seven rebounds and five assists, and Hood fouled out with 16 points.
"They're a veteran team that knows how to close out games and how to win basketball games," Hayward said. "That's something that we can learn from."
The Jazz trailed most of the night until late in the third quarter. They extended their lead to 95-86 on a dunk by Gobert with 7:22 left before James and the Cavs began to roll.
Hood responded to James' power play by stroking a three-pointer at the other end, but it was the only basket the Jazz scored for nearly five minutes in the fourth quarter. The drought allowed the Cavaliers to regain the lead.
"You can see why they're as good as they are," Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. "I was happy with the way we hung in there ... we didn't get rattled.
"Our guys need to feel good about how hard we played, and we need to figure out how to win some of these, too."

WASHINGTON The New York state attorney general on Tuesday ordered the fantasy sports sites DraftKings and FanDuel to stop accepting bets in New York, saying that the operations were essentially illegal gambling, according to copies of letters to the companies seen by Reuters.
DraftKings and FanDuel have been at the center of a firestorm of controversy since early October when a DraftKings employee won $350,000 from a $25 entry in an American football contest on the rival FanDuel site. The two companies then banned their employees from playing, but local and federal authorities began to investigate whether the fantasy sites offered games of chance, which were essentially gambling. [nL1N12J1S9]
The letters on Tuesday from the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said that the fantasy sites were considered gambling because customers "are clearly placing bets on events outside of their control or influence, specifically on the real-game performance of professional athletes."
In the games, fans pay to compete for daily cash prizes in simulated athletic contests.
In the letters, the attorney general's office said it demanded that the companies "cease and desist from illegally accepting wagers in New York state." The letters were sent to both DraftKings and FanDuel and given to Reuters by a spokesman for Schneiderman.
The state of Nevada took a similar action in mid-October, with the Nevada Gaming Control Board saying the companies had to cease operations in the state.

'HASTY ACTION'
A spokesperson for DraftKings said the company was disappointed at New York's "hasty action."
"We strongly disagree with the reasoning in his opinion and will examine and vigorously pursue all legal options available to ensure our over half a million customers in New York state can continue to play," the spokesperson said.
DraftKings estimated that 56 million people in the United States played fantasy sports.
FanDuel also disagreed with the decision, saying in a statement: "This is a politician telling hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers they are not allowed to play a game they love."
"The game has been played - legally - in New York for years and years, but after the attorney general realized he could now get himself some press coverage, he decided a game that has been around for a long, long time is suddenly now not legal," FanDuel added.
According to media reports, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the industry.
The Federal Trade Commission, which investigates companies accused of unfair and deceptive acts, has noted that it has authority over the companies, Senator Bob Menendez and Frank Pallone, both New Jersey Democrats, said on Tuesday.
The attorney general's order in the midst of an investigation against two targets of that investigation is a "somewhat unprecedented development," said Jeff Ifrah, a lawyer in Washington whose clients include online gaming and daily fantasy sports sites.

MOSCOW A Moscow laboratory used for doping tests has stopped operating after its accreditation was suspended by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the head of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Nikita Kamaev, said on Tuesday.
Kamaev, responding to allegations of widespread doping among Russian athletes, urged commentators to distinguish between the laboratory and Russia's anti-doping agency, which he said was acting "in full compliance with the demands of the WADA codex".
His comments are the latest in a string of defensive remarks by Russian officials, following a hard-hitting report commissioned by WADA which alleged widespread doping by Russian athletes and official collusion in a cover-up.
Earlier, the Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, described the allegations as "quite groundless".
The same laboratory processed tests for at least 20 other sports besides athletics, suggesting the alleged drug cheating could be widespread.
Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the laboratory's head, Grigory Rodchenkov, has resigned. "Rodchenkov, an experienced man, took the decision to resign to take all the negativity with him," Tass news agency quoted Mutko as saying.
Kamaev said there were question marks about the credibility of the sources used in the WADA report because they included sports people who had themselves failed doping tests.
"When the words of a sportsman who has broken the rules several times, and has already been disqualified, carry more weight than ours, then questions arise," he said.
He said Russia was working to clean up sport, emphasising the broadly efficient activity of the agency he heads.
"There are problems, but … the objective facts, based on statistics, show that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency … is quite effective," he said.
"The agency takes the highest number of sanctions against transgressors in the world."

RIO DE JANEIRO The men's and women's Olympic football finals will be played at the Maracana stadium, FIFA announced on Tuesday.
The opening game will be a women's group match on Aug. 3 at the Olympic Stadium in host city Rio de Janeiro, FIFA added. The tournament officially kicks off two days later.
The opening men's match will be on Aug. 4 in Brasilia, the most expensive stadium built for the 2014 World Cup but little used since because no big teams play in the city.
Seven stadiums will host games --  two in Rio, plus arenas in Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Manaus, Salvador and Sao Paulo.
"As at London 2012, the hosts have been drawn as A1 and E1 in their respective tournaments," a FIFA statement said.
"This means that, during the group stage, the home crowd will be able to cheer on its men in Brasilia and Salvador, and its women in Rio de Janeiro and Manaus."

BERLIN The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has provisionally suspended former IAAF president Lamine Diack and urged the ruling body of athletics to open disciplinary procedures against those found to have violated doping rules.
The IOC said competitors, coaches or officials mentioned in a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent commission report on Monday who were proven to have violated doping regulations would be punished and stripped of any medals.
Diack, an honorary IOC member until Tuesday, is under formal investigation in France for corruption and money laundering.
The WADA commission reported allegations of widespread corruption and collusion by Russian officials, including state security services, to cover up results of drug tests, destroy samples and intimidate laboratory staff.
They also identified "systematic failures" by the IAAF governing body, already rocked by the probe against Diack and other officials.
"The IOC has asked the IAAF to initiate disciplinary procedures against all athletes, coaches and officials who have participated in the Olympic Games and are accused of doping in the report of the independent commission," it said in a statement.
"With its zero-tolerance policy against doping, following the conclusion of this procedure, the IOC will take all the necessary measures and sanctions with regard to the withdrawal and re-allocation of medals and, as the case may be, exclusion of coaches and officials from future Olympic Games."
Several Russian athletes are mentioned in the report but the true extent of the doping affair, and which sports have been affected, has yet to be established.
WADA also wants the accreditation of Russia's drugs-testing laboratory to be removed.
The IOC said the doping scandal in the country did not affect performances at the 2014 Sochi Games where WADA experts had given the thumbs up to testing procedures.
"The IOC studied the functioning of the WADA accredited laboratory in Sochi during the Olympic Winter Games 2014," it said.
"In this context the IOC relies on the-then report of the WADA independent observer group which makes no mention of any such irregularity. Nor was any such irregularity reported by the international experts involved, nor found by the IOC itself.
"Therefore, the IOC has no reason to question the credibility of the results of the anti-doping tests carried out at the Olympic Winter Games 2014."
It did, however, say it reserved the right for any re-testing of samples as the IOC keeps them frozen for 10 years to check for new substances or fresh methods of testing.
"The IOC...will retest samples in an appropriate way should substantial doubts arise. The IOC may retest samples once new scientific techniques become available."

MOSCOW The international investigation into alleged drug cheating inside Russian athletics could draw in other Russian sports since they used the same laboratory that now stands accused of covering up failed drugs tests.
In a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), investigators described a state-sponsored drugs culture in Russian athletics. "There is no reason to believe that athletics is the only sport in Russia to have been affected," it said while acknowledging its own remit was limited to athletics.
The allegations of drug-taking in athletics - and the prospect Russian athletes could be barred from the Rio Olympics next year as a consequence - is already the biggest sporting scandal to hit Russia for several decades.
But if the affair snowballs to include other sports, including some that are hugely popular, it could cut even deeper into Russian pride which in the past few years has been riding high after a run of sporting successes.
A large part of the allegations in the 323-page report centers around a laboratory in Moscow which processed blood and urine samples from Russian athletes on behalf of the athletics federation, and tested them for banned performance enhancing drugs.
The report alleged that the laboratory destroyed samples despite being told by WADA to preserve them, and that its staff took bribes from athletes or their coaches in exchange for covering up drugs tests that showed up positive. Russian authorities said WADA itself asked them to destroy them.
The Kremlin has dismissed the doping allegations as groundless, while sporting chiefs alleged the international furor over doping was politically motivated.

MULTIPLE SPORTS
According to the Internet site of the Russian anti-doping agency, Rusada, the Moscow laboratory also processed tests for at least 20 other sports besides athletics.
These included such sports as ski jumping, cross-country skiing, power-lifting, boxing, rowing, ice hockey, soccer, biathlon and bobsleigh.
Some of those sports have had experience with drug cheats. In 2013, three Russian swimmers were handed bans after they breached anti-doping regulations. Several Russian skiers have tested positive for banned substances in the last few years.
This year, Russian biathlete Alexander Loginov was banned for two years for doping offences, while two female biathletes, Irina Starykh and Ekaterina Iourieva, were banned in 2014 for testing positive for Erythropoietin, which enhances performance by boosting oxygen levels in the blood.
The world anti-doping body has signaled in the past that it had concerns about the work the Moscow laboratory was doing testing competitors outside athletics.
In 2013, it demanded the laboratory make improvements to its procedures before the Olympic Winter Games the following year in the southern Russian city of Sochi.

BUSY DOCTOR
Apart from the laboratory, there is another point where, according to the WADA report, the drug cheating in Russian athletic intersects with other Russian sports.
The report alleged that Dr. Sergei Portugalov, Chief of the Russian Athletics Federation's Medical Commission, provided banned substances to Russian athletes and conspired to cover up their positive test results.
The report contains a transcript of a secretly recorded conversation in which an athlete, Yulia Stepanova, discussed with a coach how Portugalov was overloaded with work helping sports people dope.
"He has too many people. When I was visiting him, he had people from swimming – coaches and athletes, other kinds of sport, cross country skiers," Stepanova was quoted as saying in the report.
Stepanova, an 800-metre runner who was herself caught doping, has since become a whistle blower on cheating in Russian athletics.
Reuters was unable to reach Portugalov for comment. A person answering the phone at the Russian Federal Research Center of Physical Culture and Sports, said Portugalov used to be the center's deputy director but no longer worked there.
The person declined to say when he left or why. The center did not reply to written questions from Reuters about the allegations in the report against Portugalov.

DOPING FREE SPORT
A representative at the Russian ski federation said they could not comment on the prevalence of drug cheating in the sport because the federation boss was out of the office.
Jenny Wiedeke, communications manager with international body the International Ski Federation (FIS), said Portugalov had no ties to her organization.
Asked if FIS planned to investigate the sport in Russia, she said: “We’re always working together with WADA to ensure that the sport - all of its disciplines - are clean from doping. With there being hundreds of pages of report, obviously we have to go through it and then work with WADA.”
The All-Russian Swimming Federation said there was no one immediately available to comment. The International Swimming Federation and European Aquatics, the sport's governing body in Europe, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ivan Tugarin, an adviser to the head of the Russian Biathlon Union, said the union at the moment had no grounds to conduct an additional anti-doping investigation. He said the union had no professional ties with Portugalov.
"The Russian Biathlon Union categorically condemns any use of banned substances in sport and constantly conducts work to prevent situations arising connected to the use of doping," he said.
Calls to the headquarters of the International Biathlon Union were not answered.

WASHINGTON Baseball is known as the national pastime of the United States. The same cannot be said in Israel, but a new program enlisting American Jewish ballplayers is aimed at honing the skills of Israeli hopefuls and elevating the game there.
The Israel Association of Baseball (IAB) is hoping its "Israel Baseball Experience" program, importing the American players for five months starting in January to play in the top Israeli baseball league, will turn out to be a grand slam.
"We want guys to come over just to raise the level of playing and coaching in the country," said Nate Fish, the  association's head national team coach. "If you can take 10 or 20 Division I college baseball players and you put them in the Premier League it would drastically impact the level of play. I'm not really worried about having too many of these guys."
Art Shamsky, an outfielder with the 1969 World Series champion New York Mets who in 2007 served as manager of a team in a now-defunct Israeli baseball league, said his Israeli players "didn't understand the nuances of the game."
"Baseball is a very subtle game in a lot of ways," Shamsky said. "Sure, there's run, throw, hit, pitch and field. But there are parts of the game you learn playing Little League or in high school. They didn't have that."
Shamsky, who is Jewish, said there are some Israeli players who have some ability. "I wouldn't rule out some player over there eventually playing minor league ball and then make it to the big leagues (in the United States). This program could help make it happen."
Shamsky, 74, said the program, sponsored by the IAB and Masa Israel Journey, could help Israel qualify for the World Baseball Classic (WBC), an international tournament sponsored by Major League Baseball.

'NOT SO FAR-FETCHED'
"It's not so far-fetched to think that the game can get developed there and kids can play it at a competitive level," Shamsky said. "Who knows what can happen? At one point they said that about Japan, about China and Australia. It can be done."
The American players, ages 18 to 29, will be set to play in the Premier League and go into communities around Israel to help promote and develop the game, the program's organizers said. The Americans are due to work with Israeli coaches and children in five cities, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
The Israeli national team, ranked 22nd in the world in baseball and sixth in Europe, is preparing to try to qualify next year for the 2017 WBC.
Few of the Israeli national squad's players are on Israel's WBC team, which consists mainly of American Jews who qualify to play for Israel in the tournament. WBC rules allow players to represent a country if they are merely eligible for citizenship.
Israel lost in the WBC qualifying round in 2012, losing to Spain in the finals.
Shawn Green, 42, a retired two-time Major League Baseball all-star outfielder who is Jewish, said baseball "has started to take off in Israel" and that "the key is to get American players there."
"Not only can they help instruct and show the Israeli players how to play the game, they can also go out there and demonstrate what it takes to perform as a professional baseball player and exemplify the right way to play the game," Green said.
Fish acknowledged that current Premier League attendance is little more than "a few parents and friends scattered around," with no stadium announcer or concessions.
He also noted that Israel's current security problems can intrude on sports.
"Baseball is an escape," Fish said. "We've had a lot of problems over the last month. For the kids that play, it's essentially a time where they don't have to think about it."
Fish added, "We were running summer camps last year and almost every day the sirens would go off and we'd have to hustle kids into the bomb shelter behind the third-base dugout. It's just a reality that we deal with."

LONDON Tier Two rugby nations such as Japan, Georgia and the U.S. will have a greater say in the running of World Rugby after wide-ranging reforms aimed at growing the sport's global appeal.
In the wake of a successful World Cup in England in which Tier Two sides made a huge contribution, voting rights on the World Rugby Council will be widened.
All unions who have qualified for the last two Rugby World Cups will have one vote and one representive on the World Rugby Council, rising to a maximum of three votes depending on certain criteria being met.
In addition all six regional associations will also receive two votes.
"We have enjoyed a very special and record-breaking Rugby World Cup in England and rugby is experiencing record participation growth, media interest and commercial appeal," World Rugby Chairman Bernard Lapasset said in a statement.
"This exciting new model, developed following extensive review and consultation, will ensure that World Rugby, and by extension, the sport, has the governance structures and tools to support future growth as rugby continues to inspire and thrive."
In other reforms aimed at modernizing and streamlining the governing body, two independent skills-based directors will be included on the 12-man Executive Committee.
"This is a great step forward for World Rugby. The World Rugby Council will now have a wider range of voices," USA Rugby Chairman Bob Latham said of the reforms.
"We are confident that USA Rugby will satisfy the Committee that we meet the criteria to have our own seat on the Council -- something that has long been a goal of USA Rugby."

MOSCOW A Russian member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Tuesday the Russian Athletics Federation would not be disqualified due to a doping scandal surrounding the sport.
"The situation is very complicated," RIA news agency cited former Olympic swimming champion and IOC member Alexander Popov as saying. "I don't think it will lead to the disqualification of the whole federation."

ATLANTA Former Atlanta Braves pitcher Tommy Hanson, once considered among baseball's most promising young talents before being beset by shoulder injuries, has died in Atlanta at age 29, the team said on Tuesday.
The Braves said Hanson died Monday night at a local hospital. Atlanta television station WSB said he suffered "catastrophic organ failure" after first being hospitalized on Sunday after suffering breathing difficulty and falling into a coma. The station said it was unclear what triggered his illness.
"We are incredibly saddened to learn of Tommy's tragic passing," Atlanta Braves President John Schuerholz said in a statement. "He was a favorite in the clubhouse and with our staff and he will truly be missed by everyone in Braves Country."
The 6-foot-6-inch Hanson pitched four seasons with the Braves, finishing third in the 2009 National League Rookie of the Year balloting. After suffering shoulder injuries, he was traded to the Los Angeles Angels in 2012.
In four seasons with the Braves and one with the Angels, Hanson had a career 49-35 record with a 3.80 ERA in 123 games.
Earlier this year, he signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants.

LONDON Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne, this year's champion in the GP2 support series, will be McLaren's Formula One reserve driver in 2016 but intends to combine it with racing.
"I definitely want to race something next year, but what it will be we don't know yet," he told mclaren.com. "There's definitely some options though and we're talking about them.
"I'm going to be test and reserve driver at McLaren anyway, which is a good position to be in," added the Belgian who could compete in Japan's Super Formula series and has a test already lined up.
Vandoorne replaces Danmark's Kevin Magnussen, who was released by the team after a season on the sidelines and was testing with 2015 world endurance champions Porsche in Spain on Tuesday.

LONDON Lotus say next year's Formula One car is coming along well while they wait for Renault to finalize an expected takeover of the financially-struggling team.
"We’re well progressed through the design process and most of the layout has been done," technical director Nick Chester said on Tuesday in a team preview of this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix.
"There hasn’t been the greatest amount of development through the year on the E23 (the 2015 car) so we’ve been able to dedicate quite a bit of additional manpower to our 2016 challenger.
"Manufacture of some of the parts is already underway and we’re looking at a lot of the final detailing currently," added Chester.
Lotus have struggled to pay their suppliers this season, facing several court cases brought against them as well as having to overcome difficulties at the race track.
In Belgium in August, bailiffs prevented the team from removing their cars from the Spa circuit as part of legal action taken by their French former reserve driver Charles Pic.
They also managed to fend off an attempt by the British tax authorities to put the team into administration as a result of unpaid dues.
Renault, who previously owned the British-based team before selling control at the end of 2009 and exiting it completely in 2010, are expected to make an announcement in the next few weeks.
Deputy team principal Federico Gastaldi told Reuters at this month's Mexican Grand Prix that the takeover remained on course with due diligence completed and Renault following their own internal procedures.
"They hire a company to go through the due diligence, they have done it and it’s signed and presented to the board of Renault," said the Argentine.
"We started liaising with the Renault technical department during the Singapore race weekend (in September) and it’s been an ongoing process with the technical department, marketing and administration.
"Renault is a mega multinational company, they have their own procedures and timing and we cannot put pressure on. But they have been hands on and helping us since they signed the letter of intent. It’s just a normal process," added Gastaldi.

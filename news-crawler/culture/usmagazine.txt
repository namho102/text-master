They can kick it again! Q-Tip took to Instagram on Friday, October 28, to announce that A Tribe Called Quest is releasing a “final” album 18 years after they released their 1998 LP, The Love Movement.

The rapper, 46, shared a series of handwritten notes to explain why the hip-hop group  — made up of Q-Tip, Al Shaheed Muhammad, Jarobi White (until 1991) and the late Phife Dawg — decided to jump back in the studio.

“To all the good people worldwide! We hope this letter finds you and yours safe and without a scratch! Last year this time myself, Jarobi, Ali and Phife had the extreme pleasure of performing on the Tonight Show. It was our first TV performance in 18 years,” the rapper wrote. “The energy for us that night was one that we hadn’t experienced on stage together in some time!”

Q-Tip went on to explain that ATCQ’s Tonight Show performance happened to fall on the same night as last year’s terror attack in Paris. He also acknowledged Phife’s death. The rapper passed away at age 45 on March 22, 2016, after a long battle with diabetes.



“As we left 30 Rock I felt the need, we all did, to get back to the studio and start that cookup!! So we got to it!!” Q-Tip continued. “It was coming together nicely and as you may Know we lost our brother. May God rest his soul on March 22. But he left us with the blueprint of what we had to do.”

In Phife’s absence, the “Can I Kick It?” performers recruited rappers Busta Rhymes and Consequence — both have been featured on A Tribe Called Quest tracks before — for their upcoming, as-yet-untitled album.

“So we collected ourselves and along tribesmen, Busta and Cons … we completed what will be, obviously the final A Tribe Called Quest album!” he enthused. “No this isn’t filled with old Phife bars … This is that pure, unstopped on pure!!”

He concluded: “And on November 11, 2016, we will complete our paths of rhythm … Join us! Peace!! Q-Tip.”

Don't mess with mama bear! Michael Bublé revealed during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live on Thursday, October 27, that Kris Jenner once chastised him for making a joke about her daughter Kim Kardashian.
The Canadian crooner, 41, gave host Andy Cohen and fellow guest Abbi Jacobson a quick recap. Back in 2011, while on stage at the iHeartRadio Live concert in Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood, Buble teased Kardashian, now 36, for her sex tape with Ray J.

"[She] gave me a ton of s--t for a joke I made about Kim Kardashian. … I said, 'Ladies and gentleman, please welcome to the stage Miss Kim Kardashian.' And so they all thought she was coming. I was joking and she wasn't," Bublé explained on Thursday night. "Then I was like, 'No, I'm just messing with you. That bitch is never coming on my stage. Because she didn't put me in that video.' I said, 'I'm so jealous of Ray J.' I was putting myself down, but all that her mom read was that I called her a bitch. They weren't happy about it."
The "Home" singer didn't reveal when the momager, 60, confronted him, but did say that they patched things up. "I had to explain it to her," he said. "She went, 'Oh, [because] I wondered what we did to you.'"
Cohen, 48, joked that Jenner must be constantly busy keeping tabs on her famous family. "It must be exhausting," he said. "You have a lot of stuff to clean up."

It's been less than a week since his character, Glenn, was killed off on The Walking Dead but Steven Yeun revealed on Thursday, October 27, that he already has a new job — as Conan O'Brien's stand-in.

Yeun — whose character met a grisly end at the hands of Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) on the AMC show's Sunday, October 23, episode — said during an interview on Conan on Thursday that after seven years on The Walking Dead, he had quickly scored a new gig, filling in for the comedian during rehearsals.



"I don't come in for rehearsals, as you can tell," O'Brien explained to the audience. "Andy [Richter] and I are flown in by helicopter seconds before the show begins."
He then showed a clip of Yeun, 32, at rehearsal.

"Look at me, I'm Conan!" the actor laughed as he reached across the host's desk to grab a coffee mug before pretending to interview a guest. "Joke. Interview. Talking to you. Listening. Joke. Interview. Band. Cut to," he said before exclaiming, "It's easy!"
Then he began playing guitar (in a nod to the former Tonight Show host's love of music).
The next shot found Yeun with tears streaming down his face as he stared at his reflection in a mirror. "Today's Thursday. You are going to be funny," he said to himself in a pep talk.


He then used the mirror to see how high he could brush his hair as he tried to replicate O'Brien's trademark 'do.
Yeun — who memorably stripped naked with O'Brien during a visit to a Korean spa in 2015 — finally gave up and donned a red wig.
Watch the video above to see who weighs in on his new look.

Your move, Channing Tatum. James Corden and One Direction's Niall Horan sang about Halloween to the tune of Ginuwine's 'Pony' (best known as that song from Magic Mike) on The Late Late Show on Thursday, October 27.

The music video for "Candy" starts with Corden, 38, dressed as the Caped Crusader as he rings a doorbell. "I'm just a Batman, looking for some Pop Rocks, something that's sweet inside, you look like the right fun size," he sings as he raids a woman's candy bowl and then suggestively rubs a piece over her face.



Next, it's Horan's turn, as the 23-year-old — who's dressed as a pirate, complete with earring — tells a woman, "I'm gonna make your Tootsie Pop."

The pair then appear in a cemetery and are dressed as corn and a peapod as they sing the chorus, "If you're scary, let's do it, give it, my candy. My satchel's waiting, trick or treat on it."
After a woman provocatively pours the candy over her head, Corden and Horan, dressed as an astronaut and Dracula, use every suggestive candy phrase in the book. For example: "I'm about to Starburst," "I'll give it to you Good & Plenty," "Girl, you're just so Red Hot."

A group of women then rush onto a stage that features male dancers dressed as horror-movie characters, including Frankenstein's monster and a werewolf.
Later in the video, the pair go to a another woman's door and Corden holds up a fun-size Hershey's bar, but is trumped by the pop star, who pulls out a family-size bar.
Watch the video above to see how the hilarious moment plays out.

Tempting fate. Two patients' shocking deaths caused the doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to make life-changing decisions. Read on for the five shocking moments from Grey's Anatomy’s Thursday, October 27, episode:

Bailey Fought With — and for — Karev
After Catherine (Debbie Allen) told Bailey (Chandra Wilson) to fire Karev  (Justin Chambers) following his arrest, Bailey spent the episode debating what the right choice was. Karev didn't help his case, as he picked fights with Bailey over their patient — a pregnant woman with cancer who chose her baby’s life over her own. As Karev challenged Bailey’s assessment, Bailey snapped: "When I tell you to know your place, know your damn place." #ChiefBailey

Ultimately, after seeing the impact Karev had on the patient, she decided to let him keep his job.

DeLuca Lost His Trust in Jo
In the beginning of the episode, new-friends-but-probably-more DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti) and Jo (Camilla Luddington) caught up over coffee. She told him that she and Karev weren’t talking anymore, explaining, “It’s a little like he and I never existed.” We’re not sure of much these days when it comes to Karev and Jo, but one thing that we know is that their relationship definitely still exists.

Later, DeLuca was walking down the hall and just so happened to see Jo and Karev intensely talking. (Seriously, when do these guys find time for surgery?) When Jo ran into DeLuca later in the day, she asked him about his court date, to which he replied, "We shouldn’t talk about the case anymore." When she insisted that she and Karev were just talking about the patient they were treating, and that she wasn’t being a "double agent," DeLuca told her, "You pick the bad guy, Jo." And then to really make her really feel guilty, he added, "You deserve better." Hot doctor who gives inspiring speeches? Anyone else getting McDreamy (or McSteamy — or even McKiwi) vibes here?

Leah and Arizona Have Tension
Doctors at Grey Sloan may come and go, but awkward tension with old hookups lasts forever. Leah (Tessa Ferrer) returned, causing a mixed reaction among the hospital staff, but the most awkward encounter happened when Edwards (Jerrika Hinton) introduced Leah to Arizona (Jessica Capshaw), which would have been nice except for the fact that they have hooked up before. Spoiler: It didn’t end well. After uncomfortable hallway small talk, the two parted ways on a seemingly amicable note, which we're sure will definitely (read: absolutely never) last.



Amelia Revealed She Doesn't Want Kids — and Confided in Alex
After a negative pregnancy test revealed Amelia (Caterina Scorsone) and Owen (Kevin McKidd) weren’t expecting a baby, Amelia avoided her husband at work. Later, after losing a child patient in the operating room, Amelia broke down in front of Karev, and revealed what happened to her late child, a son who was born without a brain. "I haven't told Owen about it — I don’t think I can,” she said. “When that stick was negative, Owen's heart broke, and I was so relieved.”



Bailey Will Make a Tough Choice
After telling Catherine that she would not be firing Karev, Catherine said that was fine — that Karev wasn’t the problem. Catherine brought old records for the hospital’s surgeons, including Karev, Meredith, April and Leah, saying they had all been given second chances after screwing up. She noted it wasn’t the fault of the surgeons, but of the way they had been teaching residents, and there would have to be a change. “The residency program is your husband's department,” Bailey said, to which Catherine replied, "I know it is."

The second-biggest decision of the year — we suppose the presidential election is bigger — is finding out who Rory (Alexis Bledel) ends up with in the Gilmore Girls revival. Even though it is more realistic that Rory would ditch all of her high school and college sweethearts and find someone new, we don’t need that much realism on a TV show — we just want to know if it’s Team Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), Team Logan (Matt Czuchry) or Team Dean (Jared Padalecki).

Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life's recently released Netflix series trailer gives us a glimpse at all three of Rory’s former flames, but due to one telling scene of dialogue, the internet is convinced that Rory picks Jess in the end.


In the scene, Rory and the erudite bad boy sip whiskey at what looks to be a newsroom desk. She’s very distraught, exclaiming, “I'm feeling very lost these days. I have no job. I have no credit. I have no underwear!” (That last one was a joke, her expression suggests, but who jokes about underwear with an ex?)
“I could’ve been a contender,” she says with a sigh. “You’re still a contender,” Jess encourages, and the smiles exchanged could light up all of Stars Hollow. Although this just proves that Rory and Jess are talking and not that they’re living happily ever after, it seems telling that the trailer would highlight one couple over the other two. (Logan and Dean both appear briefly in the footage, but neither speaks.)

It could be a red herring and Rory could even be out of a job while Jess holds her dream role at a newspaper or publishing house, but we’ll have to wait until November 25 to find out.


Check out tweets from fans below and see if they convince you that Rory and Jess are the endgame.

The biggest twist yet! This Is Us fans were in for an unquestionable shocker during the Tuesday, October 25, episode when it was revealed that the remains of Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) currently reside on his daughter's mantel, meaning the show's patriarch is no longer alive in the present-day scenes. Ventimiglia told Entertainment Weekly in a recent interview that the NBC drama's fans can expect to soon learn a lot more about Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Jack's marriage, along with how Miguel (Jon Huertas) — Rebecca's current husband and Jack's onetime best friend — plays into the story line.

Ventimiglia, 39, said he feels a "sense of relief" in no longer having to keep quiet about the fact that his character perishes. "I guess there is a bit of relief, but it's also knowing that I'm never going to be with my kids in the present day," the actor said. "It’s a little bittersweet."



Of course, there is still plenty of mystery surrounding Jack's death, including what caused it. "I think there’s going to be a whole lot of disrepair and repair that happens between where we see Jack now as well as where his end is met," the Gilmore Girls alum said. "I would urge people to not worry too much about how and when, and just accept that Jack has limited time, and know that every moment he has with his kids, with his wife, is going to be the most important thing to him."
Fans also continue to be in the dark about whether Jack and Rebecca's marriage ended before the death, and whether Miguel played any role in all of this. 

"There's a lot to discover about who Miguel is and how he was involved in the family's life," Ventimiglia pointed out. "That's where we are even still building from — just nine, ten episodes [into filming], there's still a lot that’s going to be happening in the past with Miguel and Jack and Rebecca, as well as in the present day. You’re going to learn a lot more about him as you see he's just 'Grandpa' to [Randall's daughters,] little Tess and Annie."

Tell Us: Do you think Jack and Rebecca split up before his death?

In these days of peak prestige television, it's no surprise that all our favorite small-screen series have certain things in common. But does one of those things have to be graphic, blood-soaked beatings about the head with a blunt object?

Apparently, yeah. If you've been watching any of the hottest TV properties this season, you might have noticed that bludgeoning is kind of the new black. The record-breaking premiere on Sunday, October 23, of The Walking Dead's seventh season featured new baddie Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) cracking the skulls of two beloved characters with a barbed wire–wrapped baseball bat. Three days later, American Horror Story gave us a scene where Shelby (Lily Rabe) bashed her husband's head in with a crowbar after she caught him having sex with a witch in their basement. And less than two weeks ago, a malfunctioning robot on Westworld crushed his own skull to a bloody pulp with a giant rock (for as-yet-unrevealed reasons, but damn, it was gross.)

That's a whole lotta bludgeoning in a very short period of time, and frankly, it could start getting tiresome. Here's why TV needs to cool it with the cranium-crushing already.

If you've seen one bludgeoning, you've seen 'em all.
The sight of André Holland (Matt) lying on the ground with his brains spilling all over the place on the October 26 episode of AHS was a whole new level of ghastly horror … or rather, it would have been, if The Walking Dead hadn't shown us the exact same thing, twice, only a few days prior. Lesson learned: There are only so many ways you can crush somebody's skull with a blunt object before it all kinda starts running together. 






It's bringing down the level of post-show discourse.
"Dude, did you see that bludgeoning scene? ... No, the other one. No, the other other — you know what, never mind. Let's just talk about tacos or something."
It's as upsetting as it is gross.
There's something especially horrible about seeing a favorite character with his head all mangled (just look at the way fans have reacted to Glenn's graphic death on The Walking Dead). Don't get us wrong, it's not that you can never do bludgeoning — but it's probably a good idea not to overdo it, lest it lose its impact. Save it for special occasions!


Plus, we know y'all can do better.
American Horror Story has given us stoner cannibals, self-cremation and a murderer with the head of a pig. The Walking Dead has given us Well Zombie, an aquarium full of severed heads and the single greatest death-by-Subaru ever shown on screen. After such a diverse array of wildly creative killings, all this head-bashing is just one big yawn. Here's hoping the writers flex those creative muscles to give us all a nice dismemberment or death by meerkat to keep things from getting stale.

Tell Us: Do the skull-smashing scenes still blow your mind?
The Walking Dead airs on AMC Sundays at 9 p.m. ET. American Horror Story airs on FX Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET.

Was Figtails the ultimate demise to Jessica “Figgy” Figueroa’s life on Survivor? On the Wednesday, October 26, episode it certainly seems that way.



The downfall for Figueroa began when the Vanua tribe showed up to the reward challenge and she couldn’t hide her excitement that Michelle Schubert had lived to see another day. The 23-year-old bartender clapped and announced to everyone, “I love Michelle.” After an awkward pause, she added, “I mean, I love Zeke [Smith] too.”

“I was very excited; I couldn’t control myself!” Figueroa tells Us Weekly exclusively. “She was my sister out there, and I feel like a bitch for how I did not say I was excited to see Zeke but come on, he wrote my name down at our first Millennial tribal council!”


“Honestly it didn’t affect my game at all, because we’re on opposite tribes,” she explains. “But for Michelle’s sake, I felt like, ‘Oh, s--t.’ I even talked to Taylor [Lee Stocker] and Adam [Klein] about it, like, ‘Should I have said that, did that put a target on her back?’ And it probably, possibly did, I have no idea. But I don’t regret it, because if so then it would have taken a target off of my back come the merge, because all of her alliances are on the table and she’s strong in puzzles — so it would have almost put something on her back versus mine.”

At the immunity challenge, the Takali tribe lost after Ikabula member (and original Millennial tribe member) Michaela Bradshaw coached Vanua to a second place finish. Back at camp, Figueroa says it became “tug of war” with her and love interest Taylor fighting Ken McNickle and Jessica Lewis over Adam.

“I was always iffy with Adam because of the fact that he originally wrote my name down to begin with!” Figueroa says of her fellow Millennial who ultimately voted her out. “It could be too early to do something like that. Say we all would have went to merge together, he had me as a number, he had Taylor had a number — meaning he also had Jay [Starrett], he would have also had Michelle and whoever else we picked up along the way. It may not have been the best decision for his future game, or maybe it was; I have no idea.”



Ultimately Klein chose to break up the power couple by voting Figueroa out. While the power couple lasted 18 days in Fiji, they didn’t last when it came to the real world.

“Taylor and I are no more,” admits Figueroa. “Real-life situations got in the way of him and I ultimately. Coming from an island, everything is all peachy and then you get in the real world and find stuff out and it’s not peachy, so … Figtails is no more.”

The Nashville resident, who assures Us she will redeem herself in a future game of Survivor, reveals more in the rest of her Q&A.

Us: Looking back do you have any regrets about being so open with Taylor?
Jessica “Figgy” Figueroa: I genuinely cared about Taylor out there, and I couldn’t fight how I felt, so I don’t regret anything with Taylor. I just wish that he could have controlled himself a little bit more out there. I’m like, "Don’t hug me, don’t touch me, don’t look at me, don’t talk to me." I tried to keep a secret, but he literally just could not get it together! So we just had to come out about it. But I always had somebody I could trust 100 percent, so that was really cool and awesome to sit there and also to have somebody at the end of every day tell me how beautiful I was and just be there, take the paranoia away. That was something nobody else had out there and I was very thankful for that.




Us: You seemed so confident and chill at tribal, what was really going on there?
JF: I just laugh a lot. I’m a superhappy person. I’m not laughing because I feel comfortable! I genuinely was laughing at the whole marriage thing and all the stuff that’s going on, like it’s hilarious to me. But I had one hand holding Taylor’s hand, the other on Adam’s knee freaking out. I definitely wasn’t at all calm.

Us: Were you really considering marrying Taylor at tribal?
JF: No, but, it was interesting; it was like Survivor first! Let’s go! Literally. That’s just my mindset; I’m just all about doing things for the first time, like, "Oh yeah let’s do it." And it was also kind just a joke at the same time, but Taylor was like, "Oh wait, what? Are you serious? Are we doing this?" And I was like, "I was just saying Survivor first!" It was so funny to watch.

Us: What was going through your head when Jeff said you were voted off?
JF: I feel like I died and my ghost came out of my body and came and grabbed my torch because I honestly, I feel like I kind of blacked out at that point, I was like, "Oh, man, this is not happening right not, this is not happening." I wanted to play this game. I wanted to make it to the end and really let Figgy come out of her box, and come out of her shell and play this game like I know I could.

Us: Who do you see as the biggest threat in the game?
JF: I think Jay and Michaela. I think Michaela is a beast in challenges and now that she knows that Jay has an idol it’s like wow. Come individual immunity challenges she could kick everybody’s ass and win all of them each time. And Jay, he’s cool with everybody and that being said that’s a force to be reckoned with as well because he’s good at challenges, he’s a leader, he has an idol and people listen to him.

Us: Do you think the winner will be a Millennial or a Gen Xer?
JF: Honestly I would love to see somebody like David come out of it. I would love nothing more than to see the panicky, frantic, scared David come out on top. But with the Millennial numbers it’s kind of hard not to think that a Millennial will win.

Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X airs on CBS Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

1. Amelia tells Owen she doesn't want babies yet …
After a pregnancy test revealed she wasn't expecting, Amelia (Caterina Scorsone) tells Owen (Kevin McKidd) she wants to stop trying for kids. "Why the rush?" she asks. "We were barely engaged and now we're barely married and we're already trying for kids." After seeing that her new husband is clearly disappointed, she explains: "Let's just be us for a minute, enjoy us and feel what it's like to be two people in a marriage, newlyweds, before we add to it."

2. … and also struggles with her new identity
Amelia has way more than babies on the brain. "She really dove into this new identity, where she was no longer the black sheep but suddenly the chief of neuro and adored by a responsible guy like Owen," Scorsone tells TVLine. "Then the pregnancy test triggered the bridge between those compartmentalized pieces of her life and all the trauma that she experienced came flooding into Seattle in a way that she [hadn’t anticipated]." Adds the actress, who is currently pregnant off screen: "She's suddenly being hit with the reality that she can't really run away from the past."
3. Leah comes back
Despite her rocky history (read: she hooked up with Arizona and Karev and then got fired by Richard Webber) with the Grey Sloan Memorial staff, Leah (Tessa Ferrer) comes back to work at the hospital. Aside from her heated relationships with the other doctors, Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton) tells Jo (Camilla Luddington) about Leah's flaws as a surgeon. "She didn't fight hard enough to get in the OR, or study, or prepare," Stephanie says. "She drilled through her patient's leg, all the way down to the table. … Did I also mention she almost brought the hospital down with harassment lawsuits and complaints against attendings because she was sleeping with attendings?"
4. Catherine is determined to fire Karev
Catherine (Debbie Allen) confronts Bailey (Chandra Wilson) over Karev (Justin Chambers) still working in the hospital after he beat up DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti). "You made no move to fire Karev, there's no replacement search. What is the plan?" she asks. "If a doctor on our staff has been charged with a felony assault, he should not be a doctor on our staff." After telling Bailey that she's too lenient on her staff, Catherine warns, "If you don’t take some steps to replace Dr. Karev, I will."




5. Bailey defends her choice to keep Karev on staff
Bailey, who has been subtly helping and defending Karev throughout the season, explains to Catherine why she hasn't forced him to leave the hospital entirely. "He's innocent until proven guilty. We have a justice system," she says. "I don't want to throw away a good surgeon's career because of one mistake."

Oh, honey! Following Will & Grace's recent election-focused reunion, the Emmy-winning sitcom is in talks to return to NBC, The Hollywood Reporter reported on Thursday, October 27.

According to THR, the network is working on bringing back stars Eric McCormack (Will), Debra Messing (Grace), Megan Mullally (Karen) and Sean Hayes (Jack) for a 10-episode limited run. Nothing has yet been finalized with the cast or creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, and there is still a good chance that the project could fall through.

NBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Will & Grace — which centered on gay lawyer Will and his interior designer BFF, Grace — signed off in May 2006 after eight seasons. But it has returned to the zeitgeist with gusto lately, with the cast reprising their roles for a popular September video about the upcoming presidential election.
McCormack, Mullally and Hayes also participated in NBC's Must See TV: An All-Star Tribute to James Burrows special in February. When asked where Karen would be today, Mullally quipped, "She'd be married to Donald Trump."

Reboots and series based on existing properties have been more popular than ever lately, as networks look for ways to stand out in an increasingly oversaturated market. On October 27, Us Weekly reported that the Disney Channel is developing a spinoff series for That's So Raven that would return Raven-Symoné to her signature role of Raven Baxter. Meanwhile, Gilmore Girls fans are waiting with bated breath for Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life revival, launching next month.

Luke Pell isn't harboring any, er, thorny feelings toward ex JoJo Fletcher.

In fact, at the September 23 iHeart Music Festival in Las Vegas, the singer-songwriter, 32, had a very undramatic reunion with The Bachelorette star, 25, and her fiancé, Jordan Rodgers, who also vied for her heart on season 12 of the ABC reality dating series. (Refresher: Fletcher broke Pell's heart and sent him packing after his hometown date in Texas.)


"It was good to see everyone and come full circle," Pell exclusively tells Us Weekly. "It's interesting to have that chance to bury the hatchet, wish each other the best and talk about everyone's plans for the future."




In Sin City, he also caught up with fellow alums Robby Hayes and Chase McNary. "You've been through the same experience," says the single Nashville-based stud. "Everyone goes their own direction moving forward and it's interesting to hear the different stories of how people's lives are changing and what they're up to now."
These days, Pell is spending quality time in the studio recording his debut album, which is set for a January 2017 release.

"A lot of artists write about past relationships and current ones. You write about the good and the bad and the ugly as a way to paint of picture of what happened," he tells Us. "You're a storyteller at the end of the day. So, absolutely, there will be some of that about JoJo in my writing."

But you'll have to listen closely for the subtle clues. "People will pick up on it because they've seen what happened in reality, but I don't say her name," the Army vet reveals. "They'll be able to draw connections from what the music is saying. But I try not to go too cliché. I don't have a rose song!"

Decisions, decisions. James Corden forced Niall Horan to choose between exes Selena Gomez and Ellie Goulding on the Wednesday, October 26, episode of The Late Late Show.

The ex–One Direction singer, 23, and Corden, 38, joined guests Isla Fisher and Ewan McGregor for a round of “Spill Your Guts Out” — a game where one must either answer a tough question or eat something disgusting.

Horan, who teamed up with Fisher against the late-night host and McGregor, was asked to pick between former lady loves Gomez, 24, and Goulding, 29.



“Niall, you’ve dated both Selena Gomez and Ellie Goulding,” Corden pressed. "It’s your last night on Earth — out of the two of them, who would you rather spend it with?”

If he chose not to answer, he and Fisher would have had to chow down on beef tongue. Ultimately, though, he decided to give an honest (and supersweet) response to the query.

“Because it’s the last night on Earth, Ellie is a big fan of Planet Earth by David Attenborough, so I would sit and watch that with her,” he replied. "For that reason, Ellie Goulding."



This isn’t the first time Horan has named the “Lights” singer his No. 1. During an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, he played a game of “Who’d You Rather?” and at the end, the “This Town” crooner chose Goulding over sexy stars such as Rita Ora and Kendall Jenner.
Horan was linked to Gomez in late 2015 and briefly dated Goulding in 2013. In a cover story for Seventeen’s April 2016 issue, the British songstress opened up about maintaining an amicable relationship with the boy-bander even after they split.


"We're still friends," Goulding told the mag. "We went on a few dates, and it was really fun. He's a really, really lovely guy. He's got the biggest sense of humor, he's very caring, and I see him as a genuine friend in the industry."

To infinity and beyond! Fans of Woody and Buzz Lightyear will now have to wait even longer to see them reunite on the big screen. Pixar announced on Wednesday, October, 26, that Toy Story 4's release date has been pushed back from 2018 to June 21, 2019. (Console yourself by watching a classic scene from the original movie in the video above!)

As previously reported, Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger announced in November 2014 that the beloved franchise was returning with director John Lasseter on board. "John created Toy Story and directed the first two films, and it’s great to have him back directing one of our most valuable properties," Iger said at the time, via Entertainment Weekly.
Lasseter added: "We love these characters so much, they are like family to us. We don’t want to do anything with them unless it lives up to or surpasses what’s gone before."
Toy Story premiered in 1995 and stars Tom Hanks (Woody) and Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear). (Toy Story 3 remains Pixar's highest-grossing film ever, making $1.1 billion globally.) The movies have remained a fan favorite, with Vans even launching sneakers inspired by the adventurous toys earlier this month.
In December 2015, Hanks, 60, posted a video of his commute to the Pixar studio. "Back to Oakland! Pixar! Working on #ToyStory4, partners! Hanx," he wrote, via WhoSay.
A lot will change for Hanks' lovable character in the fourth flick. In August 2015, Lasseter revealed that cowboy Woody is finally finding love with Bo Peep, voiced by Annie Potts.

Pixar has even more movies on deck. Per Variety, Toy Story 4 and The Incredibles 2 switched release dates, and audiences can now catch the return of the Parr family on June 15, 2018. Additionally, Cars 3 is set to debut next year.

Oh, brother! In a new Keeping Up With the Kardashians clip, Kim Kardashian worries about her brother, Rob Kardashian, after he mysteriously deletes all of his Instagram photos with his pregnant fiancée, Blac Chyna.


“What’s going on with my brother?” Kim asks Scott Disick in the clip from the Sunday, October 30, episode. “He just deleted all his pictures of Chyna and everywhere in the media it says they’re broken up.”





The Selfish author, 36, then decides to take matters into her own hands and give Chyna a call to see what’s going on and whether Rob will be attending grandma Mary Jo Campbell’s upcoming birthday party in San Diego.









The 28-year-old model explains that she and her fiancé, 29, had a fight, and he’s using it as an excuse to skip the birthday bash. “He does stuff for a reaction. For example, he asked me about his business stuff and then I gave him my honest opinion and he got upset with me,” Chyna said. “Honestly, I think he doesn’t want to go to MJ’s birthday party on Tuesday. And I feel like that’s what this is all about because [he thought], ‘If I start arguing with Chyna and I really don’t want to go, this would be even more reason for me not to go to MJ’s party and I can blame it on Chyna, maybe.’”

Kim later seems a little skeptical of Chyna’s account. “I know that Rob and Chyna have an unstable relationship,” she said. “There’s obviously two sides to every story."

As Us Weekly reported back in July, the couple were indeed going through a rough patch when the Arthur George sock designer wiped his Instagram account of any trace of Chyna. “They didn’t break up; they had a fight,” a source told Us at the time. “It was from the pressure of filming the show and everything moving too fast. Rob is just not used to filming again, and it’s been hard on him. Everything with Chyna is moving so fast. … She’s a single parent and filming the show and all of her other work commitments, so Rob has been feeling neglected by her.”
See what happens with Rob when Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E! Sunday at 9 p.m. ET.

Taking a little time to enjoy her signature sitcom! Raven-Symoné is leaving her role as cohost of The View to return as Raven Baxter in a spinoff of her Disney Channel series That's So Raven, Us Weekly can announce.

Symoné, 30, will executive-produce and star on the updated series, which is currently in development and does not yet have a title. The Cosby Show alum will exit The View later this year after having joined the daytime panel series as a permanent cohost in June 2015.

The spinoff's pilot episode centers on Raven's life as a divorced mom raising her two preteen children, a son and daughter, one of whom has inherited her psychic powers.

"Raven's brilliant style of fearless comedy was a driving force for Disney Channel's success around the world," said Disney Channels Worldwide exec Adam Bonnett in a statement. "Her performance in That's So Raven is timeless. We now have our eyes on the future with her, and we're looking forward to telling more stories for a new generation with an adult Raven Baxter raising her young family."
The Emmy-nominated sitcom, which costarred Orlando Brown (Eddie), Kyle Massey (Cory) and Anneliese van der Pol (Chelsea), ran for four seasons before signing off in 2007, becoming the network's first series to hit the 100-episode mark. It has not been announced whether other members of the cast will return, and there is no word about a planned premiere date.

Reviving popular series has become quite a trend lately, especially for shows geared toward family audiences. Girl Meets World, a spinoff of Boy Meets World, launched in 2014 and is airing its third season on the Disney Channel. Meanwhile, Netflix has made something of a cottage industry out of this, with Fuller House, its Full House reboot, returning for its second season in December, and Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life bringing back the Gilmore Girls characters next month.
Tell Us: Would you watch a That's So Raven reboot?

What, this old thing? Miley Cyrus talked about her husband-to-be, Liam Hemsworth, and her engagement ring during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday, October 27. See what she said about her bling in the clip above!

The "We Can't Stop" singer, 23, and Hemsworth, 26, called off their engagement in September 2013, but rekindled their romance this past January. Cyrus has been wearing that Neil Lane sparkler ever since, but has kept mum on the rock —  until now.
"This is really weird because this is like real jewelry and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy and they don’t look that good together because they kind of mix up," Cyrus explained to host Ellen DeGeneres. "So sometimes I replace it with an actual unicorn or a Looney Tune [character]."

The Aussie hunk usually notices the swap, though. "He’s kind of like, 'What’s going on?'" Cyrus said. "[And] I am like, 'This isn’t really my aesthetic, but I’ll wear it because you love me."
DeGeneres, 58, quipped: "He could have saved a lot of money by giving you a gummy bear ring."
As Us Weekly exclusively reported, Cyrus and Hemsworth's wedding plans are currently up in the air. They recently scrapped the idea of a beach wedding and a Bora Bora honeymoon, but now may tie the knot later this fall.
"Miley is pretty adamant about having a small, private ceremony," an insider told Us in August. "But Liam wants a really big wedding, so I’m sure they’ll come to a compromise."

About that. Justin Timberlake joked about his illegal voting selfie during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday, October 26. Watch what he said in the video above!
As previously reported, the Trolls actor, 35, snapped a photo of himself casting his ballot in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, on Monday. Unfortunately, in May 2015, Tennessee govenor Bill Haslam signed a statewide bill that voters could only use their cellphones at polling stations for "informational purposes," and violators could face a 30-day jail sentence. Apparently Timberlake didn't get the memo.











"What have you been up to? We never talk," Jimmy Fallon asked during the show.
"I recently voted. Super quiet, under the radar," Timberlake teased. "Went home to Tennessee and voted. Super quiet, in and out. No one even knew."







In the selfie, Timberlake urged his peers to vote as well. "Hey! You! Yeah, YOU! I just flew from LA to Memphis to #rockthevote," he captioned the post, which has since been deleted. "There could be early voting in your town too. If not, November 8th! Choose to have a voice! If you don't, then we can't HEAR YOU! Get out and VOTE! #exerciseyourrighttovote."
The former boy bander (who has campaigned for Hillary Clinton) did the same on Wednesday night. "Get out and vote. Damn straight. But don’t take a picture of yourself in there," he told the crowd. "I had no idea! I thought, this is going to be great! Inspire people to vote! Nope."

With Halloween nearly here and your kids' costumes finally picked out, it's time to relax and enjoy the holiday with a spook-tacularly festive cocktail! What better way to celebrate than with a Cointreau Autumn Shandy or a Vampire Blood Cocktail? Scroll through this list of boo-tiful Halloween-inspired cocktails and test one or two out! 



With last week's episode having revealed the big (and presumably final) secret of this roller coaster–style season, the FX series kept the blood flowing and scares coming on Wednesday, October 26. From graphic disembowelings to a skull-crunching scene that would've been right at home in this week's Walking Dead premiere, American Horror Story wasn't holding back in its last episode before Halloween. Here are the top five most screamworthy moments from American Horror Story: Roanoke, chapter 7.

Behold the Butcher
Sidney (Cheyenne Jackson) hoped out loud that Agnes (Kathy Bates) wouldn't be deterred by a restraining order keeping her away from the "Return to Roanoke" set — and this, my fine fellow, is why you gotta be careful what you wish for. While Rory (Evan Peters) was bleeding to death inside the mansion, the crew inside the production trailer met their own bloody end courtesy of good ol' Agnes, who is either a) the legit second coming of her character, or b) the most committed method actor ever. Also, thanks a lot, AHS, for that gratuitous shot of Sidney's intestines strewed all over the lawn like sausages.

Getting Real Blair Witch-y Up in Here
After fleeing the house through the underground passage — and having a creepy encounter with the screaming undead specter of the mansion's original owner — Audrey (Sarah Paulson) gave us a fascinating glimpse at what it would've looked like if a young Julie Andrews circa Victor/Victoria had been cast in The Blair Witch Project.

"Know you gave me the best months of my life," she sobbed in a selfie closeup video message to Rory (Evan Peters), who she didn't realize was dead … right up until his blood started dripping on her from above. Blech.

A Smashing Good Time
Poor Shelby (Lily Rabe): She might have nearly lost an arm to Agnes and her meat cleaver, but at least the experience would help bring her and Matt (Andre Holland) back together … right? Nope. Hours after Shelby's near-murder, Matt woke up in a trancelike state and wandered down to the basement.

"I've been waiting for you," he whispered, before being grabbed by a fast-moving shadow. Cue Dominic (Cuba Gooding Jr.) bringing Shelby downstairs, to find Matt in flagrante delicto with the forest demon.

"I came back for her! I'm in love with her!" he said, and Shelby — in a fantastic homage to either the Walking Dead season premiere, or Gallagher's greatest hits, or maybe both — responded by taking a crowbar and smashing poor Matt's head like an overripe cantaloupe. Splat.

Toothless Redneck-People Eaters
Bad news, folks: Those hillbilly cannibals weren't just a bit of fictional flair to punch up the dramatization of "My Roanoke Nightmare." Lee (Adina Porter), Monet (Angela Bassett) and Audrey were captured by the Polk family, who turned out to be the proud owners of a booming marijuana grow house. And what happens when people who eat people get the munchies? Nothing good, friends. After oiling and seasoning Lee's leg, the Polks appeared with a plate of bloody meat that they forced Audrey and Monet to chow down on. And that's all we're going to say about that.

The end of Agnes survived long enough to enter the main house and do a little nonlethal hacking. (Pro tip: If this were a game of Clue, you couldn't go wrong accusing the Drama Butcher, in the bedroom, with the meat cleaver.) But as it turns out, she was profoundly ineffective compared to the *actual* Butcher — who only needed one swing to cleave Agnes' skull all the way down to her nose.
American Horror Story: Roanoke airs on FX Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET.

Justin Timberlake paid a visit to his good friend Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show on Wednesday, October 26, and the pair reprised their hilarious Camp Winnipesaukee sketch, this time singing Alanis Morrissette's "Ironic." Check out the awesome musical moment in the video above!

The sketch — which is really just an excuse for the pair to channel their inner nerd, put on wigs and sing a song like "Jumper" by Third Eye Blind or "Africa" by Toto — began with the pair in their beds at camp in 1996 as Fallon asked his curly-headed pal what he was going to be for Halloween.




"It's a TV character," the "SexyBack" singer said.

"Steve Urkel?" Fallon asked, before guessing again and coming up with Saved by the Bell's Zack Morris.
"No," said Timberlake, pulling a face.
"Blossom?" asked the Saturday Night Live alum.
"Yes!" yelled Timberlake.

The pair then began to sing "Ironic" and had trouble keeping a straight face as they recited the lyrics and harmonized loudly, attracting the attention of Mr. Fletcher, the camp counselor.
As soon as Fletcher left the room, they began giggling and sang some more, leading to Fletcher's return.
After shooting him in the shorts with their water pistols, the pair finally decided to try to get some sleep but not before Timberlake said, "Hey Jimmy, best friends forever?"
"Best friends forever," Fallon replied. (Cue the "aww" noises from the audience.)
Later in the show, the pair took on the Best Friends Challenge to prove how well they know (or don't know) each other.
Watch the video below to see how many times Timberlake and Fallon struggle to keep it together and stop laughing.

He’s back! Will Ferrell broke out his hilarious George W. Bush impression to weigh in on the presidential election — and share his thoughts on “disgraced pumpkin” Donald Trump.

The Saturday Night Live alum, 49, returned with his spot-on impression of the 43rd president as he stopped by Comedy Central’s @Midnight with Chris Hardwick on Tuesday, October 25.
Ferrell’s Dubya appeared on a segment called Voter Voices, where he represented the small but influential voting block of former presidents.

He began by addressing the controversy around his cousin Billy Bush, who was let go from NBC’s Today show October 17 after his lewd video with the Republican presidential nominee, 70, resurfaced earlier in the month.
“He’s been in the news a lot lately, him and that disgraced pumpkin Donald Trump, talking on that bus,” Ferrell as Bush began.  

“I just wanna say one thing: We Bushes don’t act like that, OK? We have standards and we’re raised a certain way. And we would never, under any circumstances, ride a bus. When you’re a Bush, you ride in a limousine or a jet. 

"Or maybe a monster truck called Sasquatch Express, but never a bus. It boggles the mind.”

Ferrell’s Bush slammed the former Celebrity Apprentice host, but admitted Trump’s controversial campaign had distracted people from his own shortcomings as president.


“This dunderhead is making me look great,” he bragged. “I destablized an entire region, Chris, but no one seems to care anymore. Thanks to the bozo Trump here, folks have forgotten how I tanked the economy or how I didn't get [Osama] bin Laden. Heck, Kanye West even said I hated hurricanes. But that's all forgotten now.”
Calling Trump a “dangerous man,” Ferrell as Bush also poked fun at the New York businessman’s claims that the election is being rigged against him.

“The only thing that’s rigged is that stuffed chupacabra on top of his head,” he said. “I don’t know how he keeps it on there, but I hope Hillary [Clinton] knocks it off.”
“Don’t do it, America. Don’t let that rotten sack of sweet potatoes anywhere near the White House,” he warned.
The comedian debuted his uncanny Bush impression during his popular run on Saturday Night Live from 1995 to 2002. He later played the former president in his one-man Broadway play, You’re Welcome America: A Final Night With George W. Bush, which ran in 2009 and aired as a special on HBO.
Watch the hilarious video — including Bush’s plan to move into an underground bunker if Trump wins the presidency — above!

Don’t be tardy to the … slot machines? Don't Be Tardy's Wednesday, October 26, episode took us for a wild ride with more of Kim Zolciak's shenanigans. Sure, the Real Housewives of Atlanta alum may have just revealed the early signs of a serious gambling problem — but at least it’s good TV, right?

Kroy Doesn’t Believe in Sex Before Marriage … ?
Bit of a hypocrite? Kroy Biermann and his wife, Kim, may have different parenting styles when it comes to their children’s sexual health. Kim explained to her daughter Brielle, “Kroy doesn’t think anyone should have sex until they’re married.” The brilliant postproduction department then cut together a quick montage of clips of the couple finding out they were pregnant, and even showed their wedding the following year. We died laughing. Later, in a confessional, Brielle revealed, “Kim says I should try five to 10 penises before I get married.” That sounds like a fair amount of penises to tell your daughter to try … right?


Brielle Admits She Will Never Date Her Best Friend, Zach
While shooting pool with her BFF, Zach Baus, Brielle dished about her upcoming date with her other friend Bennet. When Zach asked her about her ex, Slade Osborne, Brielle admitted, “I ran into him the other day, and he won’t leave me alone ever since.” Uh-oh. While there may have been some chemistry between the two pool buddies, Brielle later admitted, “I will never date Zach. He’s just too nice.”

Kim Takes Out $25,000 to Gamble
Kim, Kroy and Tracey arrived at the casino and, after a quick spritz of sage for “positive energy,” Kim headed straight for the cashier. When Kim asked for “25,” the woman behind the glass responded, “25 … hundred?” Kim responded, “Thousand.” OMG! You go, girl! Can we borrow some money?!



Kim Lashes Out at Kroy, Loses Tons of Money
While at the casino, Kim repeatedly asked her husband, Kroy, for more and more money. She continued to lose, even telling her blackjack dealer, “Rachel, we need to come back about $7,000. Let’s go.” When Kroy told Kim she needed a “new game plan,” she slammed him, saying, “The way you’re treating me is unacceptable.” Kroy followed with, “Don’t say stupid s‑‑t.” While the casino fight was intense, and morale was certainly low, the couple seemed in high spirits when they returned home, despite the huge financial loss.



Brielle’s First Date Post-Slade Is a B-
Brielle and her friend Bennet seemed to have an OK time at the bowling alley, but overall the chemistry appeared weak. Brielle even admitted, “Going on my first date since me and my ex-boyfriend broke up wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. But I’m not looking for anything serious — by no means. I’m just looking to have fun and get free food.” Looks like our girl’s got her priorities straight! Sort of!
Ariana Disses Her Little Sister, Kaia
Girls will be girls! While in the car with Brielle, Ariana Biermann mused about what her nearly 3-year-old sister will be like when she grows up. The sassy 15-year-old said, “I feel like she's gonna be a big bi-otch.” Brielle butted in, “She already is.” Oh, the toddler shade!

Brielle Biermann: A Beacon of Female Empowerment?
Brielle concluded the episode with an empowering statement, declaring, “I don’t really have feelings toward anybody but myself.” OK, now her priorities are straight.
Tell Us: When will we get to see Kroy back on the field? Do you think Kaia will watch this episode one day and resent her older sisters for talking some serious smack?
Don't Be Tardy airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET.

They'll always have Rosewood! Pretty Little Liars wrapped its final day of filming on Wednesday, October 26, and stars Lucy Hale (Aria Montgomery), Ashley Benson (Hanna Marin), Troian Bellisario (Spencer Hastings), Shay Mitchell (Emily Fields) and Sasha Pieterse (Alison DiLaurentis) shared parting words and adorable photos on the emotional day.

The Freeform mystery drama, which focuses on five pals whose lives are destroyed by the dastardly "A," airs its 10 final episodes beginning in April 2017 after seven thrilling (not to mention car accident–filled) seasons.
Seven years later the day has come to say goodbye.
A photo posted by Ashley Benson (@itsashbenzo) on Oct 26, 2016 at 12:09pm PDT
"Seven years later the day has come to say goodbye," Benson wrote on Instagram, alongside a pic of herself with the other four stars.

Hale shared a photo of the five ladies lying down on the grass with their heads forming a circle. "The day has come to say goodbye to my second home, a character that helped shaped me and so many people who mean the world to me," Hale wrote in the caption. "Bittersweet feelings today, but so proud of what we've done."
The day has come to say goodbye to my second home, a character that helped shaped me and so many people who mean the world to me. Bittersweet feelings today, but so proud of what we've done. ❤️

Keegan Allen posted a group shot of the cast that included Bellisario, Pieterse, Benson, Mitchell, Ian Harding (Ezra Fitz), Tyler Blackburn (Caleb Rivers) and Janel Parrish (Mona).
As I reflect on these years together in my dressing room on stage 6 on the WB lot (apparently James Dean once climbed above it and hid in the rafters) it is silent. I am unable to find the words to equate how tremendously emotional I feel. It is unlike anything I could ever explain. I will think about this often, and look back fondly on what we all shared together. I can't even believe it. So grateful for the support of our fans and friends. I will miss this family so very much.

How can they miss you if you never leave? Leah Murphy (Tessa Ferrer) makes an incredibly awkward return on Grey's Anatomy's Thursday, October 27, episode, as seen in a sneak peek.

The ABC medical drama's preview clip shows the Grey Sloan team discussing the fact that the former surgical resident is returning, despite her bumpy history with the hospital's staff. Leah — who previously hooked up with both Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) — was fired by Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.) during the second year of her residency.

"Can Webber really rehire her?" Arizona asks her coworkers in the cafeteria. "I mean, I am on the board."


Later, Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton) explains to Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) that Leah got the boot because of her questionable behavior. "She didn't fight hard enough to get in the OR, or study, or prepare," Stephanie says. "She drilled through her patient's leg, all the way down to the table. … Did I also mention she almost brought the hospital down with harassment lawsuits and complaints against attendings because she was sleeping with attendings?"
"It all screwed with her head, so Webber asked her to leave," Stephanie continues. "It just goes to show, don't crap where you eat." Of course, this is the exact moment when Leah happens to walk up to their table and asks to sit down.

Watch the cringeworthy moment in the clip above to see Alex and Arizona both defend their relationships with the returnee. Grey's Anatomy airs on ABC Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.

Every rose has its thorn. But that pain struck a chord with Luke Pell.
Since vying for JoJo Fletcher’s heart on season 12 of The Bachelorette, the singer-songwriter has been recording his debut album, which is set for a January 2017 release. The inspiration? Fletcher herself!

“A lot of artists write about past relationships and current ones. You write about the good and the bad and the ugly as a way to paint of picture of what happened,” Pell, 32, exclusively tells Us Weekly. “You’re a storyteller at the end of the day. So absolutely, there will be some of that about JoJo in my writing.”

Though he won’t put Fletcher on blast, he does drop subtle hints about their time together.  (Dramatic reminder: Pell was heartbreakingly sent home following his home date in Texas, making him the season's third runner-up.)  

“People will pick up on it because they’ve seen what happened in reality, but I don’t say her name,” the Nashville-based Army vet reveals. “They’ll be able to draw connections from what the music is saying. But I try not to go too cliché. I don’t have a rose song!”
In full, the record will cover the story of his life, from relationships to the more general areas. “It’s the full spectrum of emotions,” says the single stud. “There are songs that cover the happy times and the falling in love. But you’re remiss if you don’t cover the sad times too — the parts that are confusing and the parts that hurt a little bit. People who have been through it themselves will listen and be like, ‘I get what he’s talking about!’”


In fact, Fletcher, 25, may have already heard some of the tunes. While filming the reality series, “I actually did some writing,” he adds. “I played it for JoJo one day, but it never aired. I think she loved it — I hope!” (TBD if the tracks make it on the album, though.)
As Us exclusively revealed, Pell was set to begin filming season 21 of The Bachelor before ABC pulled the plug on him just 11 hours before his flight to L.A. Instead, the network chose Nick Viall to star on the show.  “Now,” he tells Us, “I’m back doing what I love with the people I love. I’m happy and excited!”

A fate worse than death? A mom gives her daughters a dose of tough love before their beauty pageant on Little Miss Atlanta's Wednesday, October 26, episode, as seen in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek.

The TLC unscripted series' preview clip shows Kevisha grilling her 10-year-old daughter, Heaven, before the little girl's performance at the upcoming Little Miss Black USA pageant. Heaven is feeling the pressure, given that she did not win the top prize at the group's previous event.

"Do you want to lose?" Kevisha asks her. "You're going to find yourself holding a doggone runner-up again, or you're going to find yourself holding nothing."

Kevisha continues to the camera, "We should have won last time, and it was just unfair. So this time, she got to come back for that win. If she lose this pageant again, it's going to be hell to pay."


This time around, Kevisha has two children competing, as her 3-year-old daughter, Camaro, is also a contestant in the pageant.
"Worst-case scenario: Neither one of them win — I'm dead," Kevisha says. "I don't even think I would do a pageant again. That would hurt me to my core. … If both of them bring home the crown — oh, my God! I'm going out to celebrate! I probably won't be home for another three or four days."

As the family prepares for the big moment, Kevisha asks Camaro in front of Heaven, "Are you ready? You're going to be looking better than her [gestures to Heaven], right?"
Watch the wild clip in the video above. Little Miss Atlanta airs on TLC Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET.

Lordy, lordy! Scott Disick’s alter ego, Lord Disick, is making a comeback on the upcoming episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians that airs on Sunday, October 30.

In a new clip, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian encourage the 33-year-old to bring back his Lord persona in an attempt to cheer him up. Disick has said in previous KUWTK episodes that he’s been feeling down since his split from Kourtney Kardashian in summer 2015. 
“This is for you. We’re bringing back the Lord. This is epic,” Jenner told the dad of three, as she pulled out car flags, a house flag and an eye patch branded with the monogram LD.




Khloé added, “We miss the Lord, okay? So bring it back!” Disick officially gained the title when he took place in a traditional knighting ceremony in London, which was filmed for a 2012 episode of the reality series. Watch the scene in the clip below!
“My mom and I decided that we want to try to prevent any more of our family members from being stuck in a dark, sad place, so why not show Scott his old Lord swag and see if he misses it the way we miss the Lord?” Khloé said.

Disick was certainly happy to see his old stuff, but was shocked that the Kardashian-Jenner clan enjoyed his “obnoxious” Lord character.
“I’m not going to lie. Seeing all of my old Lord paraphernalia feels pretty good,” Disick said. “I mean, I just felt like when I was a Lord I was flying all over the world getting in trouble. But if everybody wants it, I’m more than happy to bring it back!”
See Lord Disick’s return when Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

The Batesville Daily Guard, an Arkansas newspaper, published the perfect obituary for The Walking Dead's Glenn Rhee following the beloved character's shocking, gruesome death on the season 7 premiere Sunday, October 23.
"Glenn Rhee, husband, father-to-be, warrior and friend departed from this world October 23rd. He was 32," the message memorializing the AMC drama's mainstay (portrayed by Steven Yeun) reads. "Born and raised in Michigan to Korean immigrant parents, he settled in Atlanta to undertake his career of delivering pizzas and brightening the world around him until the unthinkable happened — the Walker Apocalypse. It was then that the real Glenn emerged: a man of impeccable moral grounding and logistical wizardry."

The obituary continues, "A faithful friend, Glenn spared no personal risk or inconvenience to care for and provide for his adopted Apocalyptic family of survivors. His bravery in the face of both the Undead and the Brutal Living inspired all who knew him. He exhibited top-notch leadership when his leader and mentor was either unavailable or unable to lead, and with his commitment to moral principles in a world-gone-mad breathed hope and promise into those around him (who meant him no harm)."


As Us Weekly previously reported, Glenn was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat by newcomer villain Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who also killed Sergeant Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) in an equally brutal manner. The Walking Dead's showrunners later warned viewers on the Talking Dead aftershow that the season's carnage is "just getting started."
The Batesville Daily Guard's eulogy concludes, "He is survived by his loving wife Maggie and their unborn child; Rick, Carl and Judith Grimes; Carol Peletier; Daryl Dixon; the Warrior Woman known only as Michonne; and various other adoptive family members and associates that will be more memorable in their eventual deaths than they ever were in life. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations of LITERALLY ANYONE WHO CAN HELP THEM DEFEAT NEGAN be made in his memory."


The Walking Dead airs on AMC Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

How could she do this?! Lady Gaga asked Matt LeBlanc to chose between two Friends characters during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden on Tuesday, October 25 — and his surprise response earned plenty of cheers from the audience, as seen in the clip above.

The "A-YO" singer, 30, who was sitting in as a special guest in James Corden's band, interjected the Man With a Plan actor's interview to ask, "Matt, who'd you rather: Monica or Rachel?" (Monica and Rachel, of course, being the characters Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston, respectively, played on Friends.)


After some hesitation, LeBlanc, 49, responded, "I would have me some Phoebe. She's very bendy." As fans may remember, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) famously said she was "very bendy" on the NBC comedy's season 5 episode "The One Where Everybody Finds Out."
"Matt, that is correct," Gaga smiled and replied.

The "Perfect Illusion" entertainer was an unofficial cohost on Tuesday night's episode of The Late Late Show. At the start of the show, she crashed Corden's opening monologue and poked fun at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's supporters.
"Donald Trump is launching a nightly news show on Facebook, which will stream Trump's rallies," she told the crowd. "It'll be kind of like airing my concerts, except instead of Little Monsters, there's actual monsters."

Later in the show, Gaga starred in the beloved Carpool Karaoke segment, where she belted some of her biggest hits, as well as new songs from her recently released fifth album, Joanne. Relive the showstopping moment in the video below!
The Late Late Show With James Corden airs on CBS weeknights at 12:37 a.m. ET.

Here's a twist the Survivor castaways actually saw coming: Jessica "Figgy" Figueroa and Taylor Stocker are (gasp!) hooking up.

Perhaps blinded by love, the millennial duo don't realize their fellow castaways are very well aware of their, er, alliance. So on the Wednesday, October 26, episode, Figueroa, 23, pulls aside Jessica Lewis to confess about the love connection, as seen in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek.




"I want to talk to you about something," she tells the Gen Xer, who she became close with when the two generations were mixed together to form three separate tribes. "I haven't told you this or Ken [McNickle] this because I was just kind of nervous, but I kind of have a thing with Taylor."

Originally, the Nashville-based bartender wanted to keep the romance under wraps — and keep a target off her back. "That's what freaks me out the most," she tells the camera in the clip. "I don't know if it's going to be a good reaction or a bad reaction.”




As host Jeff Probst previously told Us, the young duo aren't pros at laying low. "In typically millennial style, they're not very concerned about hiding it, which baffles some of the other people," the Emmy winner said. "I was amazed at the brazen nature of it, because typically on Survivor, people would go, ‘Wait a minute. That’s two votes. We’re going to get rid of one of you.’”

So how do her tribemates react? Find out in the video above!

Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X airs on CBS Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

She’s got jokes! Lady Gaga crashed James Corden’s Late Late Show monologue on Tuesday, October 25, the night of her epic "Carpool Karaoke" appearance. During her impromptu performance, the “Perfect Illusion” singer, 30, humorously poked fun at those who support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

“You may all know me as Lady Gaga, but tonight I am Lady Haha,” Gaga (known to her fans as Mother Monster) said during her set, which you can watch in the clip above. “Who’s ready for some topical monologue jokes, yeah? Donald Trump is launching a nightly news show on Facebook which will stream Trump’s rallies.”

The Grammy winner added: “It’ll be kind of like airing my concerts, except instead of Little Monsters, there’s actual monsters.”






Gaga’s wisecrack was met with a thunderous round of laughter. The superstar, who is a vocal supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, continued to go in on the controversial politician, 70, referencing the vulgar remarks he made about women in a leaked 2005 Access Hollywood video.

“And according to the show’s creators,” she added, “the program is expected to really grab viewers by the p--sy.”





That’s when Corden, 38 — dressed in a white button-down and a pair of boxer briefs — stormed onto the stage wondering what was going on with his late-night show.

“You just figured you’d come out and do my monologue?” Corden said. “No! That’s like me coming out to sing one of your songs. I mean I could, brilliantly.”

The more you know! Martha Stewart revealed she’s sexted during a round of “Never Have I Ever” with Snoop Dogg and Anna Kendrick on the Wednesday, October 26, episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Watch the crazy clip above!
Ellen DeGeneres gave each celeb a sign that read “I Have” on one side and “I Have Never” on the other. The talk show host, 58, told her guests that they must be 100 percent honest with their answers — a.k.a. hold up their signs accordingly — as she read off a series of statements.

She kicked off the game with a very NSFW topic. “Never have I ever sexted,” DeGeneres said.

Snoop, 45, and Kendrick, 31, had no shame and immediately revealed that they both have engaged in some X-rated iMessage convos. Though Stewart, 75, paused for a moment, she finally held up her sign to admit that not even she can resist the temptation of sending a dirty text here and there.

For her part, DeGeneres said that she has never sexted. The former '90s sitcom star then looked at Stewart with a surprised expression and said, “Martha! You’ve sexted? Do you know what that is?”



She jokingly shot back: “I have used technology for a lot longer than you have, Ellen.”

“Yow!” an amused DeGeneres responded before pressing for more facts: “To who? Is this someone current, or is it someone from a while ago?”



Stewart  — whose VH1 series with Snoop, Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party, premieres on November 7 — then looked down at her handheld sign and sarcastically replied: “It doesn’t say ‘None of your business’ on here.”

This isn’t the first time the lifestyle guru has hinted at her naughty cellphone habit. During a June 2013 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, the Martha Stewart Weddings founder nodded "yes" when asked by show host Andy Cohen if she had ever sexted.

“I'm so happy to hear that! So that's who those texts were from the other night," Cohen, 48, quipped at the time. "Martha!"

The shockers keep coming! This Is Us continues to surprise fans with unexpected twists — including the revelation during the Tuesday, October 25, episode that the remains of patriarch Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) currently reside on Kate's mantle. 

Us Weekly caught up exclusively with Justin Hartley, who portrays Kevin on the buzzy NBC drama, about what fans can expect to go down in upcoming episodes, including what else will be revealed about the character's upbringing with parents Jack and Rebecca (Mandy Moore). And click here for our exclusive interview with Chrissy Metz (Kate)!

1.     Kevin will continue to face “stumbling blocks” in New York City.
“He won’t last very long! Well, we’ll see — he’s in it for the long haul, and he’s really dedicated to doing this whole acting thing, and I think he finds out really quickly though that it’s a struggle for him, and it’s a lot harder than he thought — it’s not a matter of packing a couple of bags, heading to New York, and being charming and getting a job. It’s heartbreaking to watch but kind of funny at the same time to watch him stumble through life a little bit but then grow up in front of our eyes.”

2. Kevin’s adjustment to life without Kate is far from easy.
“He’s realizing quickly how much he did depend on his sister, and there’s so much to do that he doesn’t know how to do. He sort of realizes his shortcomings really quickly. His acting ability didn’t really matter — what mattered was that he was a fish out of water, and he doesn’t know how to function as an adult.”

3.     We will start to see Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Kevin’s relationship unfold.
“It’s a long time coming, and it’s a lifetime of rivalry and sort of one-upmanship. They don’t have anything in common. But they happen to be brothers, and it’s really interesting to see how different these two people can be growing up in the same household with the same parents and the same opportunities and experiences — and how different they are as adults. Kevin’s finding that he wants to reconnect with his brother — he misses having a brother! And this is sort of what Kevin’s doing — he goes over to his brother’s house and says, 'Oh, I'm going to crash for a couple days, we’ll reconnect and he’ll be my best friend in two days!' It’s just that naive sort of attitude, and what he starts to realize is it's way deep-rooted, it’s deep-seated, there’s stuff they need to talk about. It’s not that easy. So again, he gets in over his head — that’s kind of what Kevin does.”

4. Randall’s daughters are very close to Kevin — in part because Kevin was "neglected" while growing up.
“He loves them. I think part of that is when Kevin was growing up, his parents thought he'd always be OK, he would be fine, and he doesn’t need as much as the other ones. So in a way, an unintended consequence of that is the fact that Kevin grew up feeling neglected his whole life. And these nieces come in and they think he’s cool and they watch his show and they give him attention, and he just wants to be around people who pay attention to him! He’s never had that. So therein lies his career choice, and he loves his nieces and all this kind of stuff, and he’s just looking for some kind of connection, someone who will pay attention to him and appreciate what he does.”

5.     Kevin approves of Kate and Toby dating!
“I think he loves the idea of Toby and Kate together, and that’s why he fired her. She’s telling him this story of how she fielded a phone call from him while they were on a date, and he’s like, 'No, no, hold on …' And then he realizes he’s getting in the way of her moving on with the rest of her life. He decides it’s time for them to separate or go their separate ways for a while. I think he is very fond of Toby — but I do think he thinks he's a goof. But I think they get along great, and they’re buddies, and in my mind’s eye they kind of talk about things, and he likes Toby a lot.”

6.     We haven’t seen the last of the shocking plot twists.
“Every episode has a little ah-ha moments, but some of them are big, and some of them are smaller. Some are like earth-shattering, and some are like, 'Oh, OK.' So they're not all twists, but they are all captivating, I think.”

7.     Should we pull out the tissue box and brace ourselves for more tear-jerking moments?
“That will happen. That will happen in every one — I can tell you that. That will continue to happen. That's what we do. That's when we win. When you cry, we win!”
8.     The next time the characters cry, those tears will be authentic!
“Oh, people cry during table reads. And even better when we're filming the show, if you see any of the characters crying on the show — that’s real! I think we all relate to each individual character so well — I know Chrissy does, I do, Sterling does for sure, and Milo's not a father but you would swear to God he was the way he relates to his character. … Mandy does, too, for sure. And so when you see that stuff happening, it's not that hard to get there when the writing is so good, and you’re sort of feeling it anyway. You sympathize with these characters."

9.     We can expect to learn a lot more about Kevin and Randall's connection.
“I will say there is some big stuff coming on the way. There are a couple of episodes and one in particular dedicated to that, to the brothers’ relationship. It’ll blow your mind. You’re going to be like, 'Is that what they’re doing?!' It’s crazy. You’re going to be like, 'Oh, so they’re going to deal with this right now?' It’s pretty stressful! You’ll see."

Trolling him! Anna Kendrick poked fun at her Trolls costar Justin Timberlake — and his lack of social-media skills — during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday, October 26. Hear what she said in the clip above!
It turns out that the former boy bander, 35, isn't exactly up to date with the latest technology. "I saw him trying to stumble through figuring out social media when we were on our press tour," Kendrick, 31, explained. "There was a point when I think someone explained Instagram Stories to him and he was on the red carpet and I was like, 'The camera is facing the wrong way. I know you just had a kid, but you are immediately, like, the ultimate dad.'"



Timberlake and wife Jessica Biel welcomed son Silas, now 18 months, in April 2015. According to Kendrick, the actor is like a kid himself when it comes to 3-D movies.
"He's also really into the 3-D version of Trolls," the Pitch Perfect star told DeGeneres, 58. "I hadn't seen it and he was like, 'It's like it's coming at you!' And I'm like, 'Are you a time traveler? I know what 3-D is.'"

Kendrick and Timberlake grew close while filming the animated flick. They even recorded a version of "True Colors" for its soundtrack together. "It will be a career highlight for me," she said. "He's very good at what he does."
She joked: "When it comes to music, he kind of knows what he's doing."

It finally arrived here, friends. Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Lorelai (Lauren Graham) reunite on screen for two-plus minutes of glory in the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life trailer — and their full-blown wit hasn’t gone anywhere. The trailer serves up some surprises (oh, hello, three of Rory’s ex-boyfriends) and familiar faces, including Luke (Scott Patterson) and Emily (Kelly Bishop). Plus, plenty of iconic Gilmore Girls sarcasm. Needless to say, it makes us feel a mix of emotions about the upcoming Netflix revival, due this November.

The good news is, the gals are back in town. However, life isn’t so happy-go-lucky, and every woman in the three generations of Gilmore goddesses have some things to sort out. Not to mention Rory’s exes are popping up like daisies, and we’re not sure if we’re having it. Below are the five greatest — and two most questionable — moments from the trailer.

The Best Moments:
1. The Return of Stars Hollow

C’mon. It’s exactly how we remembered it: the snow, Christmas decor, the townspeople cozied up in scarves and hats. Can’t wait to cozy up there come November with our ginormous coffees in hand. Oh, wait. It’s not a real place, is it … ?
2. Rory Has No Credit … or Underwear

All the Gilmore women have some thinking to do. We assumed Lorelai would be happy with Luke after their epic kiss in Gilmore Girls' 2007 season finale, but in the trailer, she doubts things. "I thought I knew exactly what I wanted … but lately, I don’t know, things seem hazier," she says. She then gives an unfulfilling "Luke and I are … happy" when talking about her man. Meanwhile, her mom, Emily, grapples with life after her husband dies, saying, "I was married for 50 years — half of me is gone."

Also, Rory, who we assume left her reporting job, is spotted wandering London and NYC with “no credit” and “no underwear.” They’re all a mess, but watching these women bond over life’s craziness and rise from the ashes will be epic. And who can actually afford a plethora of underwear these days anyway?
3. Lorelai and Rory’s Drunken Food Order

In a morning-after moment of confusion, Rory and Lorelai are truly all of us. “Did we order Chinese, Greek and Italian food last night?” Lorelai asks. “And hot dogs,” Rory chimes in. Just another morning, right? Glad to see they’re coping with life in the best way possible.
4. Rory’s Vagabond Life

In the trailer, we see glimpses of London and NYC as Rory semipurposefully roams the streets. “This is my time to be rootless,” she says. This is so unexpected of the overachieving, 74-résumé creator, and we can’t wait to see where her adventures take her. Even if it is to Logan in London …
5. Sookie Goes Porno

Amid the hard times previewed in the trailer, leave it to Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) to liven the mood and make things sexual. “That was pornographic,” she says when she gets a little excited with some frosting at work. A play-by-play of how we’re feeling watching this trailer, to be honest.


OK, the Questionable Moments:
1. Luke Denies Rory and Lorelai Delicious Junk Food

Um, excuse me, sir? You do not deny a woman her tater tots or frosted doughnuts. Never. Ever. Now we know why Lorelai is just a subpar “happy” with you. Makes total sense.
2. Rory’s Exes Return

Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) is back for a drink, Logan (Matt Czuchry) is settled in London life and Dean (Jared Padalecki) gives viewers a long, beautiful gaze — all in just two minutes. Don’t get us wrong — it’s nostalgic and amazing to see these three gorgeous faces. But Rory, without underwear and purpose in life, has enough on her plate to figure out. She’s on to bigger and better things — new chapters and, hopefully, new men (at least temporarily). She doesn’t need y'alls distraction.

Overall though, we’re reunited, and it feels so good.

Who needs a stage when you’ve got the front seat of a James Corden’s car? Lady Gaga gave such a show-stopping performance in "Carpool Karaoke" on Tuesday, October 25, she left Corden open-mouthed. Watch five of the most amazing moments in the video above!
The 30-year-old superstar was so flawless singing such hits as “Poker Face” and “Bad Romance" that at times the British host of The Late Late Show forgot to sing along.

For the first time ever, Corden allowed his guest to jump into the driver’s seat and chaperone him around Los Angeles — even though she only just got her license!
Much to Corden’s amazement, Gaga revealed she couldn’t drive until a few months ago.
“It was so embarrassing,” she regaled. “My whole family came with me to the DMV. My father cried when I got my driver’s license.”



Despite allowing her to take the wheel for a bit, Corden wasn’t feeling safe when she couldn’t work out how to get the car moving, swerved into traffic and even admitted she couldn’t see very well. So he hilariously donned a crash helmet before taking back over.

During the drive Gaga not only revealed she has 400 pieces of Michael Jackson’s clothing, but that some of her best songs were written in just 10 minutes.






Gaga proved she was a good sport too when she played along as Corden wore replicas of some of her most outrageous costumes.
But it all became too much when he began eating the processed ham he’d slapped on his chest, to showcase how gross her famous meat dress was.
“I really think you should take that off,” she said after holding her nose and gagging.
Check out what else the pair got up to in the video below.

It was an action-packed round 2 of the knockouts on The Voice's Tuesday, October 25, episode. Miley Cyrus heard her childhood fave sing, Tim McGraw smelled great, Faith Hill took over for Blake Shelton, and Miley announced she’s a hillbilly. Phew!

1. Blake had Faith. 
When Faith Hill had a few words of advice for Team Blake’s Bindi Liebowitz, Blake looked a bit worried that he was being replaced as coach. “I wish I knew what Faith was telling my artist,” he murmured to Tim McGraw. When Bindi asked Blake, “You want to say something?” Blake actually admitted defeat. "No, I'm leaving it like that," he said sheepishly.

Faith then gave Courtney Harrell pointers on how to walk soulfully while she sang, calling it the "drunk arm" technique. So good. We'd be worried too, Blake.

2. Miley offered Courtney a job! 
Even if Team Blake is keeping powerhouse singer Courtney for now, Miley might just recruit her to go on tour! As she said to Courtney, "You should never be singing behind anybody ever again, but if you do, you’re singing with me because I’ll take you on tour any day!"
Aw! So sweet, Miley.
3. Miley was a childhood fan. 
When Team Adam Levine's Ponciano Seoane squared off against former child country star Billy Gilman, Miley was living her childhood dream! "Growing up, I listened to your music," she told Billy, "so it’s very weird that I’m sitting here listening to you on the show." Supercute. But not as cute as Blake trying to pronounce "Ponciano."



4. The smell of Tim.
When contestant Christian Cuevas first spotted Tim McGraw, he confessed, “Oh, my God! I used to have your cologne, McGraw!”
And when Christian belted out his chosen song — “Superstar” by the Carpenters — Tim was sure it was his special smell that did the trick.
“That McGraw stuff works good for you,” Tim said. Well, Tim, we just hope Faith likes it.



5. Hillbilly Miley’s in love!
After Christian performed, Miley told him, “I was falling madly, deeply, in love with you!” Then a minute later, Adam ruined it by complaining about Blake: “I was once again interrupted by that hillbilly!” Miley shouted back, “Don’t talk about me like that!”
"I forgot there’s two of them now," Adam said quietly.
We like a woman who stands up for her hillbilly-ness … right, Miley?
Tell Us: Which team impressed you the most? And did Adam deserve Miley’s "hillbilly" smackdown?

Now that Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell have agreed to televise their wedding, they needed to start, uh, planning a wedding, as seen on Ben & Lauren: Happily Ever After's Tuesday, October 25, episode. After a wildly overwhelming phone call with their wedding planner, who asked 100 questions in one minute, the couple decided they need a break from wedding planning. And thus launched an entire episode of Ben and Lauren avoiding wedding planning.

Sharing Hobbies

To decompress, Lauren took Ben to aerial yoga, which just happens to be one of her secret hobbies. We didn’t see too much of her skills, but since most Bachelor activities are all about the outfits anyway, Ben changed into pink tights and a black workout tank. Lauren’s reaction: “I can see your whole wiener!” (For the record, we don’t get a close-up of Ben’s package.)

One aerial yoga class wasn’t enough to make the couple forget about tortuous wedding planning, so Ben showed Lauren his way of unwinding — camping with friends. Former Bachelor Chris Soules and Ben & Lauren regulars Emily and Haley Ferguson joined on the getaway. Ben told Chris that Chad Johnson might be joining the group, to which Chris responded, "I'm no longer afraid of the bears."

Grace’s Grand Entrance

One more of Ben's exes joined: Lace Morris, along with her Bachelor in Paradise fiancé, Grant Kemp, which was problematic because Lace has quite the history with Chad. (To refresh, Chad and Lace started hooking up on night 1 in Paradise, and the relationship quickly turned volatile. Chad was asked to leave by The Chris Harrison because of the situation.)

Allegedly, lines were crossed. Ben and Lauren thought Grace wouldn’t make the trip, so they invited Chad after meeting him at JoJo's After the Final Rose, thinking some camaraderie might be good for the known villain.

Ben broke the news to Lace and Grant that Chad may be joining the trip in the same tone he used to break up with women on The Bachelor. Grant and Lace made no promises that they would be there, and Grant aptly noted that Chad "needs a lot more help than a campfire."

A Bear Arrives
A real one — not Chad. Everyone was really jazzed about this, especially Ben, who went into the woods with Chris to try to find the bear.
Lauren was actually angered by these irresponsible actions, which Ben found funny and adventurous. “I’m a boy — I do crazy stuff! I’m wild, honey!” he pleaded.
It’s unclear whether they actually reached common ground on this issue, but Ben at least pretended to validate Lauren’s feelings while he held her close at sunset. This is romance!

Grant Reminds Us He's a Firefighter
Grant taught Ben and Chris how to put out a fire. This information might be important someday (hopefully not), so we suggest taking notes.
Step 1: Take your shirt off.
Step 2: Strike a pose.
Step 3: Put the fire out by pouring water over it.
Somehow we don’t think that’s exactly what they teach in firefighter school.

Another Bear Arrives
After a successful day of white-water rafting, the group was feeling like a unit. Ben worried that Chad showing up might ruin the sentiment, but they all had to wait and see if Chad would indeed arrive later that night.
The "will he/won’t he show up" was too much for Lace to bear, and she started crying at the evening’s campfire while everyone was making s’mores, marking the first time in history anyone has ever cried when there are s’mores around.
Just when Lace declared, “If there’s one person I wish didn’t exist, it was him,” Chad walked in. Wow! You couldn’t plan better timing if you tried.




Ben Just Wants Us All to Get Along
As soon as Chad sat down, Ben needed to address the situation at hand — essentially that Chad is a bully. Lauren came to Chad’s defense with, "I don’t think you're that person."
Chad seemed uncomfortable for the entire conversation and insisted that he was “just trying to make people laugh," and he’s "good to people who are good to [him]." In an attempt to explain his behavior, he totally nailed the way we all feel when we do bad things: "Sometimes we do things, and then those things become things."



Knowing this conversation was going nowhere, Ben told the cameramen to put their cameras down — a request they took literally and then continued to film from the ground. Finally, Chad admitted, "If I really sat down and thought about my actions, which I don't ever do, I would probably feel pretty bad," which is the closest we’d expect Chad to get to a real apology.
Grant tried to take it a step further and bring up Chad's mom, but Chad quickly shut that down. Lace was still upset about being around Chad, and Chad realized there was nothing he could do about it, so after a sweet "I've done you guys wrong" speech, Chad whistled away into the woods. Classic Chad.
Ever-positive Ben couldn't end the night on that note, so he led a toast for the rest of the group. “More hope, more love and more acceptance of the people in our life that have hurt us." We can probably all drink to that.
Ben and Lauren came home to 17 messages from their wedding planner. And so the saga of avoiding wedding planning continues on Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After? on Freeform Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

You know what you think of the Duggars, but what do the Duggars think of the Duggars? On the Tuesday, October 25, "After Show" special of Counting On, the TLC show's producers gathered the gang in Tennessee to watch footage of highlights from the season and get their reactions. First up was Jessa and Ben Seewald's recent pregnancy news.

"I am 17 and a half weeks along, and I'm feeling great," Jessa reported with a smile. "I think with the first pregnancy, it seemed a lot longer because every week we were counting down the weeks, the months, until the baby would be here, and this time around we are chasing little Spurgeon, and so I think the weeks are going by a lot faster. I can't believe we're almost to the halfway mark already." That said, she had yet to have an ultrasound, so she didn't know much else (like if there were twins in there or what the gender was). Even if she did know, however, it sounded like she and Ben weren't about to share.

"We might just keep it to ourselves," Ben said. ICYMI, that's what they did the first time around, just to keep the family in suspense. From there, the conversation shifted to basically mocking Ben for his terrible rapping skills, and replaying footage in which various family members confirm they're not rap fans.



Jill and Derick Recount a Scary Night in Central America
Another theme that came up again and again was how dangerous life was for Jill and Derick Dillard when they were in Central America with their son, Israel. "One night we were getting ready to go to bed, and we heard this loud crashing sound," Jill recalled. Her eyes welled with tears as she explained how she had gone to the bathroom with Israel (which was apparently their "safe room") while Derick checked out what had caused the noise. While she was in the bathroom, she was messaging people back in the States to pray for them — but it turned out that the crash was just a shower rack falling to the floor. (It was unclear whether that falling fixture was in the bathroom where Jill was hiding or not.)
They also admitted that while Jill wasn't pregnant yet, if she were to become pregnant, it could derail their plans to go back to do another round of missionary work.

Jeremy Surprised Jinger (Again!)
In what has become another theme of the season, Jeremy Vuolo arrived to surprise Jinger. He showed up with a dozen red roses for her, and she was delighted to have him there. Jeremy then discussed details of their courtship, like when Jim Bob grilled him over how he was planning to support Jinger's thrift-store shopping habit. (Jessa chimed in that Jinger had told her she was "giving up" shopping after she got married — good luck with that, Jinge!)
He also confessed that there had been drama about Jinger's ring because Jessa had initially told him Jinger was a 5½, but after he bought the ring (which was a 5½) she said she wasn't sure anymore and had to get her own finger remeasured to confirm if she had told him the correct size. Jeremy said this caused him a lot of stress because apparently no one told Jeremy that rings can be resized pretty easily.
As for their racy courting habits ("racy" in that he sometimes puts his arm around her), Jeremy explained, "Jinger and I are both very affectionate. It means a lot to have an arm around or something, and that's how we express our affection. We have a clean conscience as long as it's not leading us to impurity."





Jinger and Jeremy Reveal Baby Plans (Kinda)
Jinger and Jeremy also got grilled about their post-marriage plans. Jinger said that she would be moving all of her stuff to Laredo, Texas, before they got hitched so that she could settle in with him as soon as they got back from their honeymoon. In other news, when asked when they might start a family, Jeremy explained, "We really are just looking to the Lord to see what he provides."
Derick chimed in with his own prediction. "Expecting by the end of the year!" he said with a smile. Neither Jinger nor Jeremy commented on that.

Tell Us: Do you think Jinger and Jeremy will be expecting a baby before the end of the year?

It's decision day! On the Tuesday, October 25, episode of Married at First Sight, the remaining two couples had to announce— after six weeks as newlyweds — if they'd decided to stay together or get a divorce. Tensions were high as the date approached, and it seemed that each and every one of them was nervous about what the future might hold.

When in Doubt … Make a Vision Board
Remember when vision boards were a thing? Apparently they still are — at least in the world of relationship reality TV, that is. In an attempt to see if the couples were on the same page, each person was tasked with making a vision board showing what they hoped for in the future. Tom Wilson and Lillian Vilchez chatted as they pieced together their future lives with magazine cutouts and photos. During their crafting, Tom revealed that he'd like to adopt a child some day. "I am OK with adopting, as long as the first one comes out of me," Lillian chimed to the camera with a smile. But that hardly meant they saw eye to eye on everything.

Both parties were still very concerned about their different takes on money. (ICYMI, Lillian wants to make a lot of money, while Tom wants to … live on a bus.) "If you want to really accomplish your goals, you have to work harder to make them a reality," the ever-determined Lillian said. Tom replied that his future goal was "live a life that was very carefree."

Meanwhile, Nick Pedergrast and Sonia Granados worked on their happiness collages. Nick said he hoped to have a business he could run from his phone, while Sonia was more focused on having kids. Randomly, Nick shared that he would like twins and that twins ran in his family. Like Tom, Sonia said she'd like to adopt a child. Nick didn't say much to that.
When in Doubt … Exchange Gifts
After recounting to their respective friends their concerns about their relationship (which were pretty much confined to how differently they prioritized money), Tom and Lillian exchanged gifts. Tom gave Lillian a big, cheap clock that symbolized "time well spent together," while Lillian said she gave him her heart. After, Lillian said she'd made her mind up about whether she wanted to stay married or divorce, but she was scared to learn what Tom had decided. Tom, on the other hand, focused more on the journey than the destination, saying he was "really proud" of himself and Lillian for just trying to make it work. "It's been quite the journey," he mused to the camera.

Sonia and Nick also decompressed with friends for a bit. Nick argued that he was getting more attracted to his wife as they grew closer, though his own pals thought that was kind of weak. Sonia, meanwhile, openly said she didn't know if Nick was worth the effort. "My gut tells me to run," she confessed. (That's not good.)
In an interesting twist, however, shortly after airing her doubts to her friends, Sonia finally caved and moved back in with Nick — at least for the night (since they were deciding their fate the next day). Determined to show Sonia how much he cared for her, Nick gifted her with a book of photos from their honeymoon, as well as a delicate silver chain. In return, Sonia gave Nick a shirt with a cartoon pile of poop on it. Nick was determined to stay focused on the positive signs, however. "I'm happy she feels comfortable enough to stay," he said before adding, "Though maybe it would have been better a week ago."


Tom and Lillian Make Their Decision
After all of their hemming and hawing, Tom and Lillian finally sat down in front of Rachel DeAlto and Pastor Calvin Roberson. As they discussed points of conflict, Tom again looped back to his attachment to his bus. "Enough already with wanting to live in the bus!" Lillian shouted to the camera. (We hear you, girl.) Lillian was first to reveal her decision.
"I care for you so much. I want to look at the positives in our marriage and the good we've been through, and I would like for us to give ourselves the opportunity to grow in love," she began as her eyes misted with tears. "But I have decided that I would like to stay married to you." (But? "But" didn't seem to fit in that sentence, except for creating a sense of tension.) Then it was Tom's turn. He too had some interesting choices of words.

"Lily, I've thought all night and all morning and still couldn't make up my mind about exactly what would be good for you and I, and my biggest concern is that if I'm not happy, then I can't make you happy, and I've always put happiness on a pedestal, and I focus on how happy I am now versus how happy I was before our marriage began. I feel like the hardest thing about this is that you are such a great person, and … I have decided that I want to stay married." (Again, not sure why the hardest thing about deciding to stay married was that Lillian is such a great person, but whatever.)
Nick and Sonia Make Their Decision
Next it was Nick and Sonia's turn to announce their decision to Dr. Pepper Schwartz and Rachel DeAlto. Nick said his biggest takeaway from the experiment so far was to be more empathetic and understanding (i.e. to not say things like he wasn't attracted to the woman he'd just slept with). Sonia said she'd learned to become a better communicator. They both, generally speaking, seemed at peace with whatever they had decided. Nick went first and said quite clearly that he thought they were "in a good place and moving forward in the right direction" and therefore wanted to stay married. This meant the final call was up to Sonia.

"We've had a lot of ups and downs, and I have moved back in, but I just — there's just a lot of things that led me not to trust you," she began. After a breath she added, "And I feel like I want to stay married to you."
Nick was very obviously thrilled at this news, as he'd been unsure about what his wife had decided. "To be able to forgive me shows a lot about her and shows that she's willing to work on this relationship," he said to the camera.
A few days later, the two couples met up for brunch to check each other out. Though they all seemed happy and friendly enough, there was an obvious difference between the way Tom and Lillian were affectionate with each other and the way Nick and Sonia kept their distance. From their discussion, however, all four wanted desperately to make their marriages work.

Perhaps the fourth time really is a charm! Nick Viall is taking the reins as The Bachelor's season 21 star in his return to the ABC dating franchise, and multiple sources confirm exclusively to Us Weekly that his latest shot at love is, so far, a successful one.

"The season is going very, very well," an insider tells Us. "Like, one of the best seasons ever. Nick is finding love — for real."
By the light of the fire we shall find love #Thebachelor
A photo posted by Chris Harrison (@chrisbharrison) on Oct 21, 2016 at 12:30pm PDT
Another source concurs to Us that Viall's stint is going swimmingly. "Filming will wrap up in November," the source points out. 

The second insider adds that the lone drama this season has involved the contestant who Viall had previously slept with. As Us exclusively reported last month, the two-time Bachelorette runner-up met his women on the first day of filming for season 21, where he realized that one of them was someone he had hooked up with at a wedding and hadn't contacted again.


Among the dates Viall has been on so far this season include a Ferris wheel ride at a carnival, along with dancing on stage with his ladies during a Backstreet Boys concert.
The 36-year-old Milwaukee native was a surprise pick to star on The Bachelor, as Bachelorette season 12 standout Luke Pell was widely viewed as the front-runner for the coveted gig. Viall, who dated Jen Saviano on Bachelor in Paradise season 3, was the Bachelorette season 10 runner-up, where he lost Andi Dorfman's final rose to Josh Murray. Last year, Viall came in second behind Shawn Booth for Kaitlyn Bristowe's love on The Bachelorette season 11.

Tell Us: Will Nick Viall finally find his perfect match?
The Bachelor returns to ABC in January 2017.

Just when we thought the twists on This Is Us were over, we were hit with the biggest one yet! The Tuesday, October 25, episode of everyone’s favorite new drama had us bawling buckets and reaching for the tissue box. And, um, go Steelers!

Mandy Moore's Singing Voice!
The episode kicked off with a flashback to Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) in their pre-children days as they celebrated the 1980 Super Bowl. Rebecca, who was a singer at a bar at the time, kicked off the game by belting a beautiful country ballad. Oh, how we’ve missed those Mandy Moore pipes!

When Beth Thought She Was Pregnant
Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and his wife, Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson), left the kids with Kevin (Justin Hartley) and William (Ron Cephas Jr.) and jetted off for New York City. Kevin wasn’t using his hotel suite, so Randall decided to seize the opportunity to give himself and his wife a much needed mini-vacay. Randall was so excited about arriving in the gorgeous hotel room that he nearly didn’t notice his unusually quiet wife. When Beth said in a small voice, “I’m late,” it seemed like she was about to cry. Oh, Beth!





Rebecca Didn’t Want Kids
Back at the dive-bar 1980 Super Bowl party, Rebecca was letting loose. We got to see her in her younger days, taking shots of whiskey and rooting on her favorite team, the Steelers. When she told her husband, “Promise me we’ll never have kids,” it sparked a huge fight between them. When she told him this wasn’t the place to talk about it, he insisted, “We always say we’re gonna talk about it in the future, but it’s the future now. And I want kids.” We were wiping the tears out of our eyes when Rebecca got upset and asked Jack, “Am I not enough for you?” The couple eventually made up and then were making out in the bathroom. Spoiler alert: They end up having kids!

Randall and Beth’s Fight
When Randall and Beth made their way to a drugstore to buy a pregnancy test, the usually happy couple got into a huge fight. Randall got upset about no longer being able to retire in Charleston, South Carolina — a plan he never actually mentioned to his wife. Beth got upset about not being able to go back to work and continuing to put her career on hold. These two gave Us some seriously stellar performances, along with some serious tears falling down our faces.



When Kevin Told the Kids William Was Dying
Kevin, on literal manny duty, got flustered when Randall’s kids asked him what happens after a person dies. When he upset them by saying ghosts weren’t real and that everyone they know will eventually die, the kids got freaked out. When Randall’s daughter Tess asked if William was going to die, Kevin said bluntly, “Yes.” When the girls asked if William was going to die soon, Kevin told them, "Yes." Maybe Kevin can play a manny on TV, but he probably shouldn't be in charge of children anytime soon. We felt the little girls' pain as they ran away to the other room. Poor babies!



Randall and Beth Found Out Their Pregnancy Test Results
While sitting on the floor of their hotel bathroom, a beautiful moment occurred between Beth and Randall. He told his wife that they could get a nanny so she wouldn’t have to put her career on hold. They decided it might not be so bad to have another child, and Beth even said, “We do make good kids.” We were shocked when the pregnancy test then said “Not pregnant”! They seemed relieved.

We Found Out What Happened to Jack
Kate (Chrissy Metz) tried to avoid Toby (Chris Sullivan) for the entire episode so she could watch the Sunday night Steelers game by herself. When he finally confronted her about it, she revealed why she was acting so strange. She said she liked to watch the game every Sunday with her father. When Toby said he’d like to meet her father one day, she handed him … an urn. Wow. Our tears started running like a river. Jack is dead? For how long? The feels! The twists!
When Kevin Finally Opened Up
When Kevin came into Randall’s daughters' bedroom to apologize for scaring them earlier, he brought with him a gorgeous splatter painting. In a vulnerable monologue, he revealed that he likes to paint after reading every script. He said this painting reminded him of the never-ending nature of life through the generations. We were dying at this point — especially considering that during this monologue, we saw a shot of Randall packing up William’s belongings and holding onto his hat. Wait, are they trying to tell us that William died too? We can’t handle all of these deaths! We’re going to run into the other room now!
Tell Us: What did you think of the shot of Randall crying while holding William’s hat? Is that foreshadowing? And how do you think Jack died?

We can’t say we didn’t see this coming. The murder of Wes' father, Wallace Mahoney (Adam Arkin), re-enters the Keating Five's list of immediate concerns on How to Get Away With Murder's Thursday, October 27, episode, as seen in Us Weekly’s exclusive sneak peek.


This case hasn't been in the spotlight since the season premiere, when we learned that Frank (Charlie Weber) killed Mahoney before fleeing. Wes (Alfred Enoch) was questioned by police after the incident because he was standing right next to his father when the gun fired. Wes lied to police and stated that he didn't know Mahoney and was just asking for the time. Everyone hoped this death would disappear, but we knew that wouldn’t happen because when does anything ever disappear on this show?

Cut to the October 27 episode, when a seemingly tense moment is interrupted by an even more tense Wes, who urgently says in the preview clip, "Annalise! The police are at my apartment."

It’s poor Meggy (Corbin Reid) who finds the police outside the residence. Wes is avoiding Meggy's outreach, causing her to turn to Laurel (Karla Souza).

Meggy is freaked out, which is understandable, as we learned last week that Wes has been lying to his new girlfriend about everything major that’s happened to him in, well, his entire life. In the sneak peek, Laurel advises her to "tell them the truth: that you don’t know where he is."
"Oh, I thought that you guys were all studying together," Meggy shot back. It was another lie, and this time Meggy is starting to catch on. "Laurel, this is crazy. I mean, he never told me about any of this."
Laurel implores Meggy to tell the police that Wes is at the library, even though he is still with Laurel at Annalise's house. "Don’t worry, OK?" Laurel tries to soothe her best friend's girlfriend. "It’s all going to be fine. I’m sure he’s gonna be …"
This is when Annalise (Viola Davis) snatches the phone away from Laurel and chastises her in her typical Annalise way: "We don’t know that it’s gonna be fine." (Aaahh!)
Watch How to Get Away With Murder on ABC Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET to find out if it’s going to be fine.

Till the end of the season do us part? Married at First Sight's Nick Pendergrast and Sonia Granados finally decide whether to continue their marriage in the season 4 finale on Tuesday, October 25, as seen in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek.

The FYI series' preview clip shows Pendergrast putting it all on the line as he explains to his wife why he thinks they should continue working on the relationship. The pair have had their ups and downs this season, including Granados moving out of their home, but the newlyweds have been focused lately on reigniting their spark.

"Sonia, I think we've come a long way, and we're in a good place and moving forward in the right direction," Pendergrast tells her. "At this point, I know we're married, but I don't feel like I've assumed 100 percent husband duties — like, I feel like I'm learning them as I go. I want to continue our marriage, and I want to stay married to you." 

After that, it's Granados' turn to assess their status. "So we've had a lot of ups and downs, and I have moved back in, but there's just a lot of things that led me not to trust you," the realtor tells Pendergrast. "And I feel like I want to …" The clip ends before she can finish her sentence.
A previously released clip from the episode showed Tom Wilson and Lillian Vilchez also experiencing nerves leading up to Decision Day.

Watch the emotional clip above.

If you thought Negan's brain-bashing scenes in The Walking Dead's season 7 premiere on Sunday, October 23, were tough to take, you weren't alone. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, the actor who plays the baseball-bat-wielding leader of the Saviors on the hit AMC zombie drama, told Interview on October 24 that it was unpleasant for him to film the episode, which featured Negan horrifically turning two regular characters — Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) — into unidentifiable corpses.

When asked which scene in the highly anticipated premiere was the toughest to shoot, the Grey's Anatomy alum replied, "I think maybe it was the Carl's arm bit to be honest with you. Look, that whole episode was hard, and also because I did go through and smack everybody with Lucille at a certain point. Everybody took a hit. All of that was hard. It got to the point where I didn't want to do it anymore. … Emotionally I was completely drained — all of us were, I would imagine."



"It was just so f--king heavy at all times," Morgan, 50, continued about the episode's shoot. "In the show that aired, there's no letup, and it was like that for 10 days for us. It wasn't just 40 minutes of it; it was 10 days of that, every day, all day."
It's unlikely that Negan will ever be someone who viewers want to grab a beer with, but the actor does promise a bit more humanity from his villainous character as the season unfolds.

"I think that as we get to know him and see him in quieter moments, you'll see his charisma and his humor in a way that will be different than Lucille crashing into somebody's face, which I think will help," Morgan said. "Not that I'm going to make excuses for Negan, but we seem to forget as an audience, and as fans of the show, that Rick [Andrew Lincoln] and Daryl [Norman Reedus] and the rest of them killed probably 30, 40 of my men, and so far I've only killed two of them. Negan just did it with some panache."

The Walking Dead airs on AMC Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

HBD, KP! From her real name to the songs she secretly wrote for other pop stars, Us Weekly Video rounded up four facts you probably never knew about Katy Perry in honor of her 32nd birthday on Tuesday, October 2 — which you can watch in the video above!
First, let’s start off with the moniker Perry was actually born with: Kate Hudson. Before the “Firework” singer — who was previously known as Katheryn Hudson during her short-lived career as a teen contemporary Christian artist — hit it big, she decided to adopt a new stage name to avoid any confusion with the Almost Famous actress.


Perry is actually a friend of Hudson’s. During a 2013 SiriusXM Town Hall interview, the chart-topper opened up about their special bond. 



"When we text, it's like 'Hudson here,'" she said. "We are buds and we get along … We have become friends and go to game nights together, we play this game called Mafia …  We play it all the time."

Along with sharing her name with Hudson, 37, you may also not know that the Katy Perry: Part of Me star has collaborated on hits for a string of other Top 40 acts. Among the divas who have sung Perry’s music and lyrics are none other than Britney Spears (“Passenger”), Iggy Azalea and Rita Ora (“Black Widow”), Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande (“Get on Your Knees”) and Kelly Clarkson (“I Do Not Hook Up”).



During a 2009 interview with MTV News, Perry opened up about writing for Clarkson’s fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted.

“[I] wrote a song for my record called ‘I Do Not Hook Up,’ but it didn't make it on my record," Perry said of her sophomore 2008 LP, One of the Boys. "Just because there were so many different songs and there were only 12 slots allotted for the record, so ... it was kind of one of those songs that was just, like, still there. And Kelly Clarkson heard it. I guess she liked it, and she recorded it — and another song too."




She jokingly added: "I'm so excited, [Now I have a] house in Malibu! Thank you, Kelly!"

For more about Perry — and her uncanny talent for delivering babies — watch the video above.

A frightening experience. Jill Duggar breaks down in tears while recalling a time when she recently feared for her family's safety on Counting On's "After Show" special on Tuesday, October 25, as seen in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek.

The episode focuses on the Duggars recalling key moments from their TLC series' recently completed second season, with a producer asking Jill what the scariest moment has been for her so far in El Salvador. Jill, 25, and husband Derick Dillard have been living with 18-month-old son Israel in Central America for missionary work since 2015.

"Every week, it seems like there would be different instances because Derick would preach one night a week a little distance from our house, so I would be at home alone with Israel," Jill explains in the clip. "One night, we were getting ready to go to bed, and we heard this loud crashing sound. Derick's like, 'You go in the bathroom,' which is our safe room. We have our laptops, so we were messaging people back home like, 'Pray for us. We don't know what's going on.'"

Luckily, the family learned that the noise had only been caused by a falling shower rack. But Jill's younger sister Jessa agrees that the unrest in the area would worry her.
"I know whenever we've been down there, we hear gunshots all the time," Jessa, 23, says. "It's really, really intense down there, and I can't imagine being home with a little one and hoping that your husband makes it back every night."

Watch the intense clip above. Counting On airs on TLC Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

Future pop girl group? Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid did a dramatic reading of Justin Bieber's 2010 breakout hit "Baby" in a new video for W magazine — and it's too good not to watch twice.
The BFF models were good sports about the challenge but briefly hesitated at first. "Only for Lynn [Hirschberg] am I singing [this]," Hadid, 21, joked, referring to the director. "Guys, this is scary!"

Jenner, 20, and Hadid gave it all they got during the hilarious reading — in very different ways. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star read the lyrics slowly like a true dramatic reading. Hadid, however, decided to sing the catchy tune instead.

"You know you love me, I know you care / Just shout whenever and I’ll be there," the pals say. "You are my love, you are my heart / And we will never ever ever be apart."
The pair appeared satisfied with their performances. Jenner winked at the camera and threw the paper in the air while Hadid smiled big. "That's how you know I love you, Lynn!" she said.
In the same interview, Jenner confessed that she used to have a crush on Bieber, 22, when she was a preteen. The two were romantically linked in the past, and Bieber hooked up with her sister Kourtney Kardashian late last year.
Bieber runs in the same famous circle as Hadid too. In August, he accused his ex Selena Gomez of cheating on him with Hadid's current boyfriend, Zayn Malik.

No time to grab coffee! Netflix dropped the first trailer for the Gilmore Girls revival on Tuesday, October 25 — and it brings more chills than a winter in Stars Hollow.





In the nostalgia-filled clip, which you can gush over in the video above, Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Lorelai (Lauren Graham) are both at a crossroads in their lives. Yale grad Rory appears to be starting over at home, while her mom contemplates her future with Luke Danes (Scott Patterson), who she ended up with in the show's series finale way back in 2007.



"I thought I knew exactly what I wanted and where I was going, but lately, I don't know, things seem hazier," Lorelai says in one scene, seemingly to a therapist. "We're happy. Luke and I are happy."



Rory, meanwhile, bumps into — wait for it — her ex Jess Mariano, played by Milo Ventimiglia. (Squee!)
"I'm feeling very lost these days. I have no job. I have no credit. I have no underwear," Rory tells him, as the two drink whiskey. "I could've been a contender."
Jess, with dreamy shoulder-length hair, sweetly replies: "You're still a contender." (Bledel, 35, and the This Is Us actor, 39, dated in real life from 2002 to 2006 while filming the beloved series.)



But there's So. Much. More. Other (OMG!) scenes from the sneak peek include Emily Gilmore's (Kelly Bishop) weekly Friday dinners, Michel (Yanic Truesdale) rattling off a sarcastic remark at the Dragonfly Inn, Dean (Jared Padalecki) at Doose's Market, a town meeting, Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry) being his charming self and Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) cooking up a storm.

















Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life debuts on Netflix November 25.

When not killing off beloved TV characters in the goriest way possible, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (a.k.a. Negan) is satisfying his sweet tooth! Earlier this year, the Walking Dead actor, 50, revealed in an interview with Stephen Colbert that he actually co-owns a candy shop with Paul Rudd.
"Do you really also own a candy shop with Paul Rudd?" Colbert, 52, asked during the February episode.
"Yes! Yeah, that is true. Yeah, we own a candy shop," Morgan said, laughing.
Colbert quipped: "Are you Willy Wonka?"
Morgan had a simple explanation for their side business. He bought the store after he and his longtime partner, One Tree Hill alum Hilarie Burton, moved to upstate New York with their son Augustus 6. (Rudd, 47, grew up on the east coast in Passaic, New Jersey, and costarred with Morgan in the 2014 comedy They Came Together.)

"The first guy I met in this town called Rhinebeck was Ira, and he owned this candy store. He passed away a couple years ago, and Paul and I had been friends for a while and [Paul and I] just didn't want it to turn into a smoothie stand or something," Morgan explained to the late-night host. "It had been there since the early '90s, so we were like, 'Yeah, let's pool our money together and get a candy store.' So now we're the proud owners of Samuel's Sweet Shop!"
Morgan's appearance on The Late Show resurfaced this week following The Walking Dead's epic season 7 premiere on Sunday. In the episode, which was teased for months, Morgan's arch-villain Negan ruthlessly murders Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) by clubbing them to a pulp with his barb-wire baseball bat, Lucille.



Negan's attacks caused an uproar with die-hard fans of the AMC drama. Morgan's son, however, probably could not care less.
"He doesn't know exactly what I do for a living … But by far, the candy store wins out," the Grey's Anatomy and Good Wife alum told Colbert in February. "He thinks he owns it. People come into the store and if he's there he says, 'Welcome to my candy shop.' And then he steals the candy."

It’s a social media showdown! President Barack Obama appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday, October 24, and took the opportunity to troll Donald Trump during the famous "Mean Tweets" sketch. Hear his hilarious zinger in the clip above!
POTUS was a good sport as he read out a long list of insults people had posted about him, from mocking his ugly dad jeans, to being branded “the Nickelback of presidents,” but he saved the best for last.

Obama read out a tweet Trump himself had written about him: “President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!”
But his comeback was priceless: “Well, @realdonaldtrump, at least I will go down as a president.”
The 55-year-old then dropped the mic, to a round of applause from the audience.

Although he joked during the hilarious sketch, he got serious when he sat down for a chat with the host to talk about the controversial election.

He hinted that he feared for the future of the country if Trump, 70, is elected and spoke about why he and his wife, Michelle Obama, are backing Hillary Clinton, 68.

"We joke about Trump, but I do think part of the reason you’ve seen Michelle passionate in this election, part of the reason we get involved is not just because Hillary’s going to be a great president, but it’s also because there’s something different about the way Trump has operated in the political sphere,” he said. “I ran against McCain, against Romney. I thought I could do a better job, but they’re both honorable men. And if they won, I wouldn’t worry about generally the course of the country."

Kimmel asked if Obama would have considered running again if it was legal.
“If I were able to run for a third term, Michelle would divorce me. So it’s useful that I don’t have that choice to make.”
He added: “All the women in my life are looking forward to being able to live a more normal life.”

“Move Bitch, Get Out the Way!” That’s what Lady Gaga had to say when she had a fit of road rage during her appearance on James Corden’s "Carpool Karaoke."
The 30-year-old singer will appear on the show on Tuesday, October 25, but The Late Late Show gave fans a sneak peek of her feisty and music-filled car ride with the British host.

In the video Gaga angrily yells “move” to someone out of the window, before she and Corden launch into a version of the Ludacris hit.
The diversional singsong seemed to calm the New Yorker who stopped shouting to belt out a number of her own chart-topping tunes, from “Bad Romance” to “Perfect Illusion.”

She even reenacted the conversation she had with the NFL when they asked her to perform at the 2017 Superbowl.
Had a lil fun with @JKCorden today! 🚘🎤 coming soon! #JOANNE #CARPOOLKARAOKE #MILLIONREASONS #PERFECTILLUSION pic.twitter.com/QBJh783QyB
Although Gaga — who was promoting her new album Joanne — looked stylish in a sequined gold top, with her hair pulled back into a tight ponytail, Corden paid tribute to the OTT outfits she’s famous for.
He can be seen at the end of the clip wearing a white wig, that looks like cotton candy, a masquerade mask and a white ruffly top.

“I love it,” Corden says. “Not ideal for driving, but I do feel alive.”

It’s a knockout! On The Voice's Monday, October 24, episode, things were getting a little punchy in the first knockout rounds. Miley Cyrus admitted, “It’s so scary!” And … with a new round came a new outfit for the “Wrecking Ball” singer. This time it was a cute black shirt with "Team Miley" stitched in gold, a big black bow on top of her head and earrings that looked like mini polar bears … or cats? Anyone? In other news, Blake Shelton was showing the strain, Alicia Keys had a hat-cident with Tim McGraw, and Miley got tearful.

1. Sundance Head sings Miley. 
When old-school country singer Sundance Head picked Miley’s hit “The Climb” for his knockout round, reactions were mixed. Blake, for one, wasn’t sure, saying, “This song choice is blowing the brains out of my head,” while Miley was clearly thrilled, sang along and then actually curtseyed to Sundance to thank him. Adam Levine’s take? “No one with that big of a beard has ever covered a Miley Cyrus song.” OK. Thanks, Adam.

2. Timbre!
When Josh Gallagher sang “My Maria,” Alicia loved his sound. “The timbre in your voice was really special,” she said, using a musical term for tone and quality. Poor Blake looked like he’d never heard of it.“Timbre, huh?” he said. “I love that word!”
“You can use it now,” Alicia said kindly. Looks like Blake got schooled.

3. Hat head. 
This week, country duo Tim McGraw and Faith Hill were on set helping out.  But first there had to be an awkward moment when Alicia and Tim tried to hug — only both were wearing huge hats. Alicia said, “You gotta be way wide when you hug with hats!” Tim explained his wife Faith dealt with that issue a lot: "She’s used to me — she deals with it all the time.” See? This is what a happy marriage is about — compromise.
4. Miley tears up. 
When sisters Whitney and Shannon sadly got the boot after their duet of “I Won’t Give Up,” they actually made Miley cry. “We’re so blessed,” Shannon said. “I got to go on this journey with my best friend.”
Poor Miley couldn’t help the tears welling. “Oh, God, here I go,” she said.
Save the sadness for the finals, Miley — time to toughen up.
5. Blake’s got "Miley brain."
When Ali sang Sade’s “No Ordinary Love,” Blake tried to figure out if Miley would pick her or knock her out. “I spent that knockout round trying to think like Miley, and it scared the hell out of me,” he quipped.
Miley took this comment surprisingly well.
6. Word games. 
As usual, Alicia was trying to give her opinion, while Blake and Adam just wouldn’t stop chattering.“Good gosh,” she complained, “there’s no speaking around these people!”
Miley seemed confused by this, since no one in the history of the world has stopped her from talking. Ever. "I get plenty of words in," the "We Can't Stop" singer said, shrugging. Yes, Miley, we know.

7. Miley goes it alone.
At one point Miley looked around and realized the other judges had all headed backstage for a break without her even noticing, leaving her alone on stage in her chair. “They left me!” she squealed. “I kinda like it! Isn’t this nice with me as the only coach?” she asked the audience. “This is the way it should always be!” Imagine? Miley in charge. The audience seemed more stunned than anything.
8. Adam is … bubbly?
When Simone Gundy sang “Midnight Train to Georgia,” Adam called her "Bubbles," insisting, “That’s her nickname.” But then he picked her, and she was so pleased that luckily she seemed to have forgotten about the whole "Bubbles" thing …
9. Tim McGraw bows down!
When Wé McDonald rehearsed her blow-you-away version of Mary J. Blige’s “No More Drama,” Tim McGraw actually got down on his knees and bowed to her! Faith, on the other hand, was much more normal. After Wé said she sang Mary J. with her mom in the car, Faith sweetly replied, “I sing with the windows open with my daughter. too. I’m going to add this to my repertoire.”
So cute. So normal. Take note, Tim.
10. Blake’s personal hell.
So while Adam didn’t help things by proclaiming, “I’m Elton John,” after a bit of a singalong with Faith, he then made it worse by talking over Blake. Blake was having none of it. “Shut your mouth!” he told Adam. “My biggest fear is when I die, I’ll continue to hear your voice. It’ll be my hell.” Blake was clearly cracking under the strain, but Adam was loving it. “You should be so lucky,” he said, smiling sweetly.
Will Blake totally lose it by the end of this season? Seems possible …
Tell Us: Were Miley’s earrings cats or polar bears? It seems important! And is she building a strong team?

Pump it up! Tamra Judge’s huge fitness competition finally arrived on the Monday, October 24, episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County, but it came on the heels of a massive fight that took place right before the ladies got home from Ireland. In spite of the feuding, they all showed up to the fitness competition to support their friend. Read on to find out what happened!

Housewife vs. Housewife vs. Housewife vs. Housewife …
The episode started out with the ladies still drunkenly bickering on the 3 a.m. bus to the airport in Dublin.

Heather Dubrow was busy telling Kelly Dodd that she was nothing but trash, and Vicki Gunvalson was begging everyone to just shut up. Meghan King Edmonds said it was unfair that Vicki, Kelly’s “only friend” on the bus, was “letting” the other Housewives pick on her but, uh, Meghan? Aren’t you literally the reason Kelly is on the show? 

Anyway, to get back at Vicki for not having her back, Kelly told Shannon Beador that the OG Housewife had said that David Beador beat Shannon up, which started a fight between the blondes and allowed Kelly to slink back into her seat.

There were some flashbacks then that seemed to indicate this was the big secret of Shannon’s that Vicki was hiding right before they all went to Ireland!

After that, Kelly popped her head back up to say Vicki also told her Tamra’s husband cheated on her and may or may not be gay. Naturally, everyone turned on Vicki … except Meghan. She didn’t defend Kelly, but she did call Heather’s attacks on her “conniving,” and said she saw right through them.
Kelly Makes Things Right, Tamra Keeps Things Tight
Back stateside, Meghan got lunch with Kelly, telling the camera she’s not a “fair-weather friend” and will stand by the brunette “even when it’s hard to do.” OK, but … what about the bus?

The pregnant Housewife told Kelly that Heather hadn’t been right to be so mean, but she needs to stop sinking so low when provoked. She also supported Kelly’s choice to go talk to Tamra, which is what her husband told her to do too.
Before she could do that though, Vicki came to her house later that day. The two friends hashed out their problems from the Dublin trip, and Kelly explained that she felt abandoned by the older woman. Vicki explained that after she finally, finally was no longer the victim of their attacks, she hadn’t wanted to make everyone hate her again. They came to an understanding and hugged.

Kelly and Tamra met for dinner, but Tamra wasn’t eating much because her big fitness competition was in three days, and she had to keep her muscles and regimen tight. For the third time, Kelly aired out her suspicion that Heather is a “puppet master” and all the other women do her bidding. Tamra demurred, saying she didn’t mind Heather, but the other people Kelly shared her analogy with seemed to agree.
Tamra and Kelly worked out their issues, and Tamra told Kelly she was still invited to the competition, just as she had told Vicki earlier that day. Vicki, Kelly and the rest of the Housewives at a competition while their usual forgiveness-preaching mediator is on stage? What could go wrong?

In It to Win It
There seemed to be a reason that Tamra wanted Vicki to say around: She and Shannon were making a plan to confront her at an upcoming party Shannon was throwing. (How many confrontations can these women have in one season?!)
When the big day finally rolled around, Tamra was so nervous she started crying in the dressing room, but her trainer/spiritual adviser Mia told her to call on Jesus for the strength to put on her teeny-tiny bedazzled bikini and win. Whatever works!
Neither Jesus nor Mia would have been too excited by the icy way the women were treating one another as they sat in the audience, or the comments they made about Tamra’s competitors, but the muscular Housewife soon hushed all of the gossip with her appearance and blew them all away!
In fact, she ended up winning, so all of the drama was forgotten for a second while all the Housewives in the audience freaked out. Don’t worry, though — just moments later Shannon was fuming that she was expected to be in a photo with Kelly and Vicki during the post-awards celebration, so she walked away.
Good thing her big party for Tamra is next episode, and she won’t be able to walk away from that!

Every now and then it's good to take a trip through time. On Monday, October 24, it was "Era Night" on Dancing With the Stars, which meant that celebrities would compete with routines inspired by various decades. While some — like Calvin Johnson and Lindsay Arnold's 1950s jive — synched flawlessly, others, including Marilu Henner and Derek Hough's 1920s Charleston, were rocky at best.

But learning a decade-themed routine was just the first task for the stars this week, as they also had to compete in team dances, which could boost or hurt their overall standings. At the end of the night, however, neither of these two dances mattered for the couple who went home. Here were the winners, the losers and the pair that was sent packing.

Calvin and James Battle for First
As previously mentioned, Calvin and Lindsay performed a 1950s jive that knocked the judges' socks off. Though the former NFL player couldn't point his toes due to a football injury, he managed to show enough extension to please even Len Goodman (oh, yeah — Len was back!), who marveled at how much Calvin had improved over the course of the season. Carrie Ann Inaba gushed over their routine, calling it effortless, and Bruno Tonioli called it "spot-on."

The only celebrity who could touch Calvin was James Hinchcliffe, whose 1940s jitterbug with Sharna Burgess dazzled. In their video package, it showed both of them about to crack under the pressure that came with being at the top of the board, but they got their act together before the dance that mattered most. Len dubbed him a "major contender" for the Mirrorball, and Julianne Hough praised Sharna's choreography and commitment. For their efforts, both couples landed 36 out of 40 points.

Right behind them were three other couples, however, who all clocked in with 34. Laurie Hernandez and Val Chmerkovskiy, Terra Jolé and Sasha Farber, and Jana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko all had strong (if not stunning) showings that garnered praise and constructive criticism from the powers-that-be.

Ryan and Maureen Land at the Bottom
But it wasn't a great night for everyone. Ryan Lochte and Cheryl Burke continued to struggle at the bottom of the board. In his video package, Ryan deemed himself the luckiest man alive because his fiancée stuck by him through thick and thin. He tried to bring his passion for his future bride to his 1990s rumba with Cheryl, but it didn't seem to translate. Julianne gave him an A for effort, but said his technique fell short. Bruno argued that since Ryan was so weak when it came to actual dancing, he had to up his acting game, and Carrie Ann said he was obviously just doing whatever Cheryl said and had failed to make it his own. Len, however, offered a sunnier view of things, praising the couple for doing the routine without lots of props and distractions.
At the bottom with them were Maureen McCormick and Artem Chigvintsev. The pair performed a 1980s tango that involved Maureen dressing up like a cross between Madonna and Elvira. Artem didn't fare much better in an Axl Rose–inspired wig. Again, Len focused on the dance content and praised them for including actual tango steps. Julianne tried to keep things positive also by urging Maureen to take her dominatrix outfit home. But none of that could save their score, and they, like Ryan and Cheryl, ended up with a paltry 28.

Derek Hough Loses the Team Dance
Despite his very solid track record of winning team dances, Derek's team lost this time around. Derek was on Team Future, which included Laurie, Jana, Terra and Marilu. They performed a routine loosely based on teen dystopia stories such as Divergent and Hunger Games, but it never really gelled. In contrast, Team Past, which included James, Ryan, Calvin and Maureen, went bold with a Viennese waltz to a folk song from the 1700s that happened to also be the theme to Outlander. In the end, Team Future clocked in with 35, while Team Past earned 38.
Who Went Home?
Then it was revealed that two couples were in jeopardy: Maureen and Artem (which made sense) as well as Jana and Gleb (huh?). Considering the fact that Jana and Gleb had gotten a perfect score last week, it was hard to imagine them going home … and they didn't. Maureen and Artem were sent packing as Maureen said a graceful goodbye to the ballroom.
"There were times when I felt like I was floating and so beautiful, and I never thought that that could be possible in the dance world, and I mean the crew, the coolest most loving people work on this show. I love you guys," she gushed as Tom Bergeron pretty much told her to stop talking because they were out of time.

Making America laugh again? Larger-than-life Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has inspired some hilarious impressions over the years — watch the video above for some of the funniest parodies.

Actor Alec Baldwin is currently earning raves for his spot-on version of the controversial businessman, 70, while taking on Kate McKinnon’s impression of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on Saturday Night Live’s funny presidential “debates.”



But the former 30 Rock star, 58, is just the latest in a long line of Trump impersonators who have poked fun at everything from the GOP candidate’s outsize ego to his unique hairstyle.

Master impressionist Jimmy Fallon has also previously showed off a killer Trump, quipping that "you wouldn’t want your hair to make you look ridiculous” in one clip.

Fellow SNL vets Taran Killam and Darrell Hammond have also channeled the former Celebrity Apprentice host on the late-night sketch-comedy show, with Killam bragging about Trump’s appeal and explaining: "Here’s the bottom line. I’m just like you — a regular Joe, but better.”
While Trump can sometimes seem thin-skinned, the presidential hopeful has shown he can be a good sport. The business mogul turned politician appeared next to Killam and Hammond — in character as the Donald, with matching suits and bright red ties — when Trump hosted SNL in November last year.

But the former TV personality wasn’t worried about the competition. “They don’t have my talent, my money or especially my good looks,” the real Trump joked on SNL.
Watch the video above to see Johnny Depp, Phil Hartman, Conan O’Brien and more stars show off their best impressions of the GOP presidential nominee!

Clearing the air! Tired of all the rumors in the press, Amber Portwood called in a favor from everyone’s favorite onscreen doctor on the Monday, October 24, episode of Teen Mom OG. Meanwhile, Maci Bookout tried to have a nice birthday but was busy worrying about Ryan Edwards being a bad father. (What else is new?) At least one dad was being well-behaved, and most surprising of all, it was Tyler Baltierra’s father, who was celebrating a year of sobriety and freedom from prison! Read on to find out more.

Maci Grows Older; Ryan Grows Up
In honor of Maci’s birthday, her fiancé, Taylor McKinney, and son Bentley planned her a huge surprise. They even got her friend Keelie Lewis in on it! After Maci went over to her friend’s house to celebrate a little bit, Keelie produced a handwritten note from Bentley that implored his mom to come home right away.

When she got home, she found her kids with a plate of cupcakes. She was distracted from the fun by remembering that Bentley’s dad, Ryan Edwards, probably didn’t even realize that their son was starting the second grade the next day. Sadly, she accepted that Ryan probably wouldn’t show up to drop Bentley off.

She was actually excited the next morning when Ryan sent her a text saying he hoped Bentley had a good first day of school. As she and Taylor drove away from the school, he remarked, “He’s growing up.”
“Who?” Maci asked. “Ryan or Bentley?”
“Bentley!” laughed Taylor.
Maci laughed too, and said, “Both.”

Farrah Gets Fired Up; Kiana Gets Plain, Old Fired
The frozen yogurt shop Farrah Abraham opened wasn’t meeting her lofty expectations — well, one of her employees wasn’t anyway. A young woman named Kiana took the initiative to clean the machines, messed it up and infuriated the young mom and entrepreneur. Farrah said the girl had a “know-it-all attitude” and made a plan to confront her.







Kiana showed up to work early the next day and called Farrah to ask if she had permission to disable the alarm and go in. We couldn’t hear her side of the phone call, but Farrah swore she asked “with an attitude.”
When Farrah got in, she took Kiana outside and told her she couldn’t have a manager who acted the way Kiana had been. Kiana replied that she wasn’t used to being mistreated by bosses. Farrah took offense, got worked up and fired her on the spot. So … that escalated quickly.
Later, Farrah told her daughter, Sophia, that she hoped if the little girl ever grew up to hire and fire people, she’d “keep calm” because people who get fired can get hostile.

Amber Gets Her Story Out; Matt’s Son Gets on TV
Amber’s fiancé, Matt Baier, got a phone call tipping him off to the fact that a gossip magazine was running an article claiming Amber had a miscarriage due to her past issues with drugs. Matt was forced to go tell Amber the latest rumor, and she was understandably shocked. After all, this was the first she’d heard of her supposed pregnancy.
Furiously, she called up Dr. Drew Pinksy and arranged to go on his show and clear up all the rumors. As the couple got ready to head to L.A. for the taping, Matt’s son Christopher called and said he was struggling with his personal life. Matt made arrangements for him to join them in L.A., making it the first time he’d seen his son in 10 years. Since Christopher was the source behind some of the most shocking gossip pieces on Matt and Amber, what a fitting time to reunite!

Once they got to California, Chris was placed in the audience during the Dr. Drew taping and was able to apologize for being the source of a cruel gossip piece about his father. He revealed he had been struggling with his addiction when he agreed to talk to the magazine. For her part, Amber got Dr. Drew to confirm once and for all that she really was clean and sober.
Amber and Matt finally felt like they had busted every rumor and reminded the world that they’re real people too.

Catelynn Has a Party; Tyler and Butch Have a Moment
Tyler’s father, Butch Baltierra, was celebrating a full year out of prison! He hadn’t had any violations of his probation and he had stayed sober, so Tyler and Catelynn Lowell got to work thinking of what they could do for him.
They ended up throwing a little surprise barbecue party for him at a local park, in spite of Tyler’s concerns that he hadn’t done enough research about whether or not addicts like to celebrate that sort of thing. (That is so Tyler, is it not?)
The entire party was very emotional, but the conversation that Tyler and his dad had by themselves that evening was the real tearjerker. Butch thanked his son for finally showing him what it means to be loved unconditionally. Pass Us the tissues, please!

Fans of The Walking Dead are still reeling from the earth-shattering deaths that rocked the AMC drama's Sunday, October 23, season 7 premiere. But for the actor whose character was the first to be offed by bat-wielding psychopath Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the only surprises left are the ones he gets to reveal himself. 

Michael Cudlitz, who enriched our lives for years as the ginger-haired, endlessly quotable, awesomely mustachioed Abraham, hopped on a conference call with Us Weekly and other reporters on October 24 to answer all of our burning questions about how he prepared for this moment and what his next move will be. (Click here for thoughts from actor Steven Yeun, whose character, Glenn, was also offed in the traumatic episode.)

Here are the top 10 most interesting things we learned.
10. He's been keeping the secret of Abe's death for a long, long time.
A year and five months: That's how long Cudlitz, 51, has known that he'd be the one getting his head cracked open like a walnut once Negan and Lucille entered the picture.

9. The identity of Negan's victim(s) was never a secret to the cast.
"We spread a rumor that the cast didn’t even know who was going to die, and that we shot the death of every character, and people were going through contract negations," Cudlitz said. "And all of that was a lie, so we were able to have that to hide behind for about five months after shooting." In other words, this bought the cast about half a year of peace from being questioned about who was going to be offed. Smart!

8. Keeping Abe's death under wraps was a serious workout.
Cudlitz kept up a robust travel schedule throughout the year so that people would think he was away filming the show. He also held memberships at multiple gyms just for subterfuge purposes.
"It was a process, like the guy at the front desk at the gym was concerned because he'd seen I've been in a few days in a row," the actor explained. "I would tell him I was leaving for Atlanta, then for the next two weeks I would go to a different gym."
7. Only those closest to him knew the truth.
The only people Cudlitz didn't lie to about his character's death were his wife and kids — and then only because they were going to notice that he was home.

6. Abe's death was all about practical effects — including a life-sized, blood-soaked dummy with a bashed-in skull.
"They also made a mock-up of me on the ground with a busted head," Cudlitz said. "For everyone else, it was very disturbing. My wife said even though she knew it wasn’t me, she could go a whole lifetime without seeing that again."
5. Spoiler trolls, you're on notice.
Cudlitz got a little feisty when discussing the secrecy surrounding the big reveal, saying, "The whole thing was, how do we keep this secret because of those people out there who seem like it’s their only job to ruin other people’s TV watching experience." (Ah, yes. Those people. We hate them, too.)
4. That peace sign was just for Sasha.
Peace out, girl scout: That two-fingered swan song was Abe's sign-off to his special lady, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green), and a last-minute addition. "We saw that after Abe was hit down, we couldn’t turn round to look at Sasha. We needed to find a way for him to say bye to her — that’s what the peace sign was," Cudlitz explained.
3. Cudlitz's main concern? Making sure that Negan's other victim wasn't taking it too hard.
"I’m not some guru, but I’ve been doing this a long time. I knew Steven [Yeun] wouldn’t have been through this before like I had," the actor said. "He came on the show very young and grew up as a man and artist on the show. … I told him if he ever needs to, reach out."
2. "Suck my nuts" was a Cudlitz original.
Abe's last words were entirely up to the actor who played him, hence their utter perfection.
1. And Abe might be gone, but the mustache lives on … at least for now.
Of all the things Michael Cudlitz has done for his fans, this might just be the sweetest:
"I’m going to keep the mustache," he said. "We’re doing a fan event soon — we’re going to give the fans a chance to say bye. If you don’t watch the show that may sound weird, but it’s not. So I think it's a respectful thing to not take it off. For the fans, it just happened, so we’ll give them some time."

The end of the road? Married at First Sight's two remaining couples face the final verdicts on their marriages in the Tuesday, October 25, season 4 finale, as seen in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek.

The FYI relationship series' preview clip shows Lillian Vilchez and Tom Wilson leaving their house in the morning ahead of Decision Day, where they'll both be forced to choose whether to stay in the marriage. The newlyweds shared sparks right out of the gate but struggled a bit with compatibility issues as the season wore on.

"Obviously this is a really big decision — it's not something to take lightly," Vilchez tells the camera. "We're promising each other to be there for everything — good and bad, thick and thin. I am so nervous. I don't even know what I am going to say. No idea."


"I don't know what he's thinking," the realtor continues. "And I'm nervous — I'm scared. I'm scared of hearing his answer. I don't even know if I want to hear his answer. I'm a wreck right now, and I'm so worried that Tom will choose divorce."
For his part, Wilson says to the camera, "I'm a little bit nervous about my decision today. I know I don't want to break Lily's heart, and I don't want to set such a high expectation either. Things could go either way."

Watch the tense clip above, which also shows Nick Pendergrast and Sonia Granados psyching themselves up for the moment of truth. 
Married at First Sight airs on FYI Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. ET.

Not everything is coming up roses for Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell, as viewers witnessed in the first two episodes of Freeform’s Ben & Lauren: Happily Ever After?.

In the October 11 premiere episode, Bushnell became distressed over Higgins’ Bachelor runner-up JoJo Fletcher’s unending presence in their lives, and on last week's episode, the couple faced tension over the decision to have a televised wedding. With this much arguing, fans may get the impression that the Bachelor magic is nearing its expiration.

"Yeah, [the show's edit is] not always fair, and we'll watch it and be like, 'It’s not like that!'" Higgins, 28, tells Us Weekly exclusively of seeing his and Bushnell’s seemingly constant bickering on the show.



Bushnell, 26, really felt the criticism following the series premiere, which featured her reluctance to attend Fletcher's "After the Final Rose" taping. “You know, the first episode was tough because I think people were like, ‘Oh, gosh, Lauren, you were so confident on The Bachelor, and now you come off as insecure,’” the flight attendant admits to Us. “I am a human being at the end of the day. I’m no different! I have struggles. I have insecurities. Ben and I have struggles.”
Her fiancé is also hoping to shift the public perception of them a bit. “I am excited for them to see Lauren’s funny side, her goofy side. I’m excited for them to see my side that’s not as bland and vanilla. Because that’s us!" he insists. (No offense, Ben, but we'll believe it when we see it.)

To decide whether or not Lauren is actually goofy and Ben is truly vanilla, watch Ben & Lauren: Happily Ever After? on Freeform Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

Laurie Hernandez is on the move to a major milestone. On Dancing With the Stars’ Monday, October 24, episode, pro Val Chmerkovskiy turns the ABC competition's “Eras" week into a mock prom for the Olympic gymnast, as seen exclusively in Us Weekly’s sneak peek.

“It’s Era week and we got the '60s,” the season 20 Mirrorball winner, 30, explains to Hernandez. “The nonhippie, antigovernment '60s.” Hernandez, who was born in 2000, replies, “I don’t know what any of that means."
To clarify, Chmerkovskiy adds: “It’s a prom vibe,” only to have Hernandez reveal that she’s never been to prom! “You’re supposed to go to prom during high school,” she explains in an on-camera interview in the clip. “I don’t go to high school. I homeschool”
Chmerkovskiy sees the performance as an opportunity to help Hernandez experience the rite of passage. “You’ve never been to prom,” he says. “I think it’s the perfect opportunity to take you to prom.”
Hernandez is clearly excited by the idea. “I think it’s cool that my first prom is going to be with Val,” she says, noting one key difference from a typical high school event. “Because instead of just sitting on my phone the whole time, I’ll actually be dancing."

In her October 21 DWTS blog for Us Weekly, the New Jersey native explained how challenging the show has been thus far. "Coming into Dancing With the Stars, I thought it would be a lot easier. I didn’t think it would be just a breeze, I knew it would be difficult, but I wasn’t expecting it to be this hard,” she wrote. "It’s really hard to stay patient with myself and realize this is a whole different world than gymnastics."

Watch the sweet moment in the clip above.
Dancing With the Stars airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.
It's hard to believe that Taylor Swift's self-titled debut album turned 10 years old on Monday, October 24. At the time of the record's 2006 release, Instagram and Snapchat didn't exist, Keeping Up With the Kardashians wasn't a thing and an unknown DJ named Calvin Harris was still recording his first album.
When Swift first introduced herself to the music scene, she was a curly-blonde-haired, acoustic-guitar-toting, 16-year-old country singer and songwriter. The Pennsylvania native immediately wowed listeners as she shared diary-like confessions in the form of songs, all of which she penned during her freshman year of high school. (Swift's family even relocated to Nashville when she was 11 years old so that she could pursue her dreams!)

From the start, the country LP proved to be a success. First single "Tim McGraw" reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart; second single "Teardrops on My Guitar" peaked at No. 13 on the Hot 100; and third single "Picture to Burn" shot up to the top spot on the Hot Country Songs chart.
The former child prodigy, now 26, promoted the smash-success album as the opening act for the tours of many of her country music idols, including Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley and Rascal Flatts.
Taylor Swift was also a success at awards shows — a feat that foreshadowed the singer-songwriter's many wins to come. In 2007, she took home the CMT Music Award for Breakthrough Video of the Year ("Tim McGraw") as well as the Horizon Award at the Country Music Association Awards.

Nowadays, Swift is widely known as one of the most successful artists of all time. Her narrative tunes about her much-publicized relationships — and breakups — are all over the radio, while her 1989 World Tour recently became one of the highest-grossing shows of all time. She has also veered away from country with more pop hits.

Through it all, the 10-time Grammy winner hasn't forgotten her roots. In honor of Taylor Swift's 10th anniversary, she shared an adorable throwback photo on Instagram of herself playing the guitar.
"10 years ago today, my first album came out," Swift wrote on Monday afternoon. "I couldn't be more grateful today, thinking back on how much fun we've had and how you've encouraged me to change and grow. It's been such an adventure, guys. Thank you for all of it."
10 years ago today, my first album came out. I couldn't be more grateful today, thinking back on how much fun we've had and how you've encouraged me to change and grow. It's been such an adventure, guys. Thank you for all of it.

Another Rory love interest? Gilmore Girls casting director Jami Rudofsky revealed over the weekend that none other than Ryan Gosling almost landed a role on the beloved series.
Rudofsky made the revelation during a panel at the show's first-ever Fan Fest in Washington Depot, Connecticut. She was joined by dialogue coach George Bell, costume supervisor Valerie Campbell, casting director Mara Casey, writer and producer Sheila Lawrence and consulting producer and writer Stan Zimmerman.
Rudofsky told fans that she brought the La La Land actor, 35, in to read a small part after working with him on an independent film. Unfortunately, he completely blew the audition. "I rolled my eyes because he was late, and he was blond," she recalled, via MTV.
Gosling got a second try and impressed Rudofsky. She called him "amazing," but the other producers didn't see his potential. "Everyone was like, ‘Really, Jami?'" she said on Friday.
According to Rudofsky, the Oscar-nominated actor could have possibly been a high school football player in Stars Hollow.
Gilmore Girls ran for seven seasons from 2000 to 2007. Plenty of other stars made appearances on the series through the years, including New Girl's Max Greenfield, Chad Michael Murray, Adam Brody, Jane Lynch and Krysten Ritter.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life debuts on Netflix on November 25.

All’s fair in love and war! Brad Pitt and his onscreen wife Marion Cotillard get close and nearly kiss in a new poster for their upcoming World War II romantic drama, Allied. 

Pitt, 52, looks dapper in a tuxedo while Cotillard, 41, stuns in a silky silver gown as they lean in to lock lips in the photo. The Fight Club actor plays intelligence officer Max Vatan, who falls in love and marries French resistance fighter Marianne Beausejour (Cotillard) in the 1940s-set drama. Their love story gets complicated when he finds out she may be a Nazi spy.
The movie has been talked-about not just for its star-studded cast and suspenseful plot, but also because last month reports suggested that Pitt had an affair with Cotillard, causing the actor’s split from his wife, Angelina Jolie. However, a source told Us Weekly at the time that the Inception actress “had nothing to do with” Jolie filing for divorce.




Cotillard put the affair rumors to rest and confirmed that she’s pregnant and expecting her second child with longtime partner Guillaume Canet in an Instagram post on September 21. “This is going to be my first and only reaction to the whirlwind news that broke 24 hours ago and that I was swept up into,” she captioned a photo of a bird. “I am not used to commenting on things like this nor taking them seriously but as this situation is spiraling and affecting people I love, I have to speak up. Firstly, many years ago, I met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting. He is my love, my best friend, the only one that I need.”



Cotillard even sent well wishes to her costar during the difficult time. “Secondly, to those who have indicated that I am devastated, I am very well thank you. This crafted conversation isn't distressing,” she wrote. “And to all the media and the haters who are quick to pass judgment, I sincerely wish you a swift recovery. Finally, I do very much wish that Angelina and Brad, both of whom I deeply respect, will find peace in this very tumultuous moment. With all my love, Marion.”

A true Halloween nightmare. Saturday Night Live parodied drunk girls on Halloween — in which a female trio’s plans to have a “chill” night go totally awry — and it was hilariously spot-on.

In the “A Girl’s Halloween” skit, which aired during the October 22 episode, Aidy Bryant, Cecily Strong and Vanessa Bayer play three friends who start off the night perfecting their cute-but-basic costumes and discuss the game plan to keep it low-key this year. The girls, who are dressed up in tandem as a cat, a mouse and cheese, talk about how they’re just grabbing dinner then heading to their friend’s party for a bit.



Flash forward to 4 a.m.,  and the night has gotten very messy. There’s crying, lost credit cards and major struggles to walk gracefully in high heels on the cobblestone streets of New York City.
The wild night ends at a pizza place, naturally. The gal pals torment the poor owner, who tries to kick them out of his restaurant for being a little too intoxicated.

Ladies on social media thought that SNL nailed it. “This is the most relatable thing I’ve seen in a while,” one woman tweeted, while another added, “A GIRL’S HALLOWEEN WAS TOO REAL. It was like looking into some of my darkest memories!!!! #SNL.”
Watch the girls’ Halloween go horribly wrong in the video above!

Popping the surprise question! Jessa Duggar reveals on Counting On's Tuesday, October 11, episode that Jinger Duggar had no idea boyfriend Jeremy Vuolo would propose to her.

In a preview clip exclusive to Us Weekly, Vuolo and pal Luis Robles enjoy a barbecue with Jinger, Jessa and Jessa's husband, Ben Seewald. At the shindig, it is clear that Vuolo has a lot on his mind as he plans the perfect moment to ask Jinger to marry him. (As fans know, Jinger, 22, and Vuolo, 29, got engaged on a New York City rooftop in July after their brief courtship.)


"Jeremy is getting very excited as the day approaches, and he's trying to remain calm, though," Jessa, 23, tells the camera. "I don't think he's appearing anxious outwardly, but he's remaining very calm, so Jinger won't catch on."

Jinger says to the camera about her time in the Northeast to visit her beau, "Out of all the trips that I've taken in my life, I think that this is definitely one of the most memorable because it's been spent with my best friend, the most amazing person, gift from God."




However, Robles appears concerned that the pressure of proposing may be a bit much for his friend to handle: "What I'm nervous about is Jeremy — how he's gonna hold up, is he going to be able to keep a straight face the entire time, is he going to lose his mind, is he going to start crying halfway through the day because of pure joy and emotion? We'll see."
At the end of the clip, Jessa adds about her younger sister, "I don't think she has any clue what's coming."

Watch the scene above. Counting On airs on TLC Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

What a time to be alive! Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's ruthless, cringeworthy second presidential debate was turned into a musical duet — and it's masterful.



In a dubbed video first posted by Dutch Lucky TV, Clinton, 68, and Trump, 70, walk out to the stage in St. Louis, Missouri, at Washington University before battling it out. But instead of answering questions and trading jabs they begin to duet to Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes' 1987 hit, "(I've Had) The Time of My Life."
The beloved classic, of course, was the theme song for Dirty Dancing, which starred Jennifer Grey and the late Patrick Swayze. The Democratic and GOP presidential candidates didn't do a lift in the end, but they did appear (thanks to some magical editing) to sing together (that harmony!) before walking away from each other.
"This is everything!" one tweeter commented about the clip on Monday. A second added: "I needed this." During the actual debate, some viewers had joked that the pair appeared to be singing the Christmastime ditty "Baby, It's Cold Outside."
Clinton and Trump's real debate wasn't as soothing. The media mogul interrupted Clinton on several occasions, threatened to put her in jail if he became commander in chief and called her the devil. Trump also invited five women who alleged that Bill Clinton assaulted them in the past to sit in at the town hall event.
The former secretary of state and Trump's final debate will be held at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas on Wednesday, October 19.

This is udderly hilarious! Blake Shelton taught Jimmy Fallon how to milk a cow on The Tonight Show on Monday, October 10, and the results were highly amoosing.
The Voice coach was getting his own back on the late night talk show host for making him try sushi for the first time during a previous sketch, so he thought what better way than to take his friend down to the farm.

Shelton, 40, kicked off the humor by mocking his buddy’s ridiculous attire.
“You dressed very disrespectful, you look like Howdy Doody right now,” he joked of Fallon’s overalls and straw hat combo. “You think this is a game? This is serious!”



Both men struggled to keep a straight face as Shelton explained how Fallon, 42, was about to touch Oreo the cow in “her very private area."

But when the novice reached under the animal before the Oklahoma-raised singer had finished giving him directions he yelled: “You don’t just reach out and grab a teat. This is all about romance and finesse. So have a connection with Oreo.”
The conversation took an inappropriate turn as they discussed the proper hand motions when milking the udders.
Shelton insisted: “You don’t stroke it ... it’s more of a squeeze” and accompanied his explanation with some interesting hand motions.
Once the tutorial was over, Fallon reached for a bowl of cereal and attempted to squirt some fresh milk directly onto his breakfast.



He had no luck though, and Shelton had to get his hands dirty to show him exactly how it was done.

Together they managed to eventually fill enough for a couple of shot glasses, and Shelton said it was tradition to throw back a glass of your first milk.
As Fallon gagged on the warm, fresh beverage Shelton cheekily threw his over his shoulder.
Check out the hilarious video above.

Everyone loves a good trip down memory lane — especially when it's someone else's road. On the Monday, October 10, episode of Dancing With the Stars, the nine remaining celebs drew inspiration for their performances from their most memorable years. Some memories were happier than others, and some dances were better than others, but overall the night was more about feeling good than fierce competition (though there was some of that too). It's worth noting, however, that the names at the top of the leaderboard this week might surprise you.

James Hinchcliffe and Sharna Burgess Burn Up the Ballroom
James Hinchcliffe's most memorable year was 2015, which is when he suffered the biggest crash of his career. Recounting his near-death experience, James was poised and composed, though his family members were less so. He and Sharna Burgess tore up the dance floor with a sizzling tango celebrating his return to driving (and dancing!), and the judges absolutely loved it.

Bruno Tonioni praised him for being "super sharp," and said the whole routine was "wonderful." For her part, Carrie Ann Inaba called him a "miracle." She beamed as she added, "As far as posture, hold, technique, you are the one to beat."


A close second were Terra Jolé and Sasha Farber, as well as Marilu Henner and Derek Hough. Terra chose 2013 as her most memorable year, which was when she was on tour with Miley Cyrus when her father died. He had always encouraged her passion for an entertainment career, and she and Sasha dedicated their contemporary routine to him. Additionally, Marilu — after a rocky few weeks — had a major comeback when she and Derek did a routine in honor of 1978, the year her mother died and Marilu booked her life-changing role on Taxi. For their routines, both Terra and Marilu earned a whopping 27 points.
Laurie Stumbles Under Pressure
Where is Laurie Hernandez, you ask? The answer is near the bottom of the leaderboard this week, unfortunately. After earning the first perfect score of the season last week, she and partner Val Chmerkovskiy stumbled a bit doing their paso doble. Her most memorable year was 2016, and she recalled all of the sacrifices she made to get to Olympic gold.
In their video package, Laurie was in tears as she felt the weight of the pressure of earning the perfect score last week. Bruno said she was "an irrepressible force of nature," but noted that tonight she "messed up." Carrie Ann was also unimpressed with this particular routine, but Julianne Hough thought it was fantastic, noting, however, that she wanted Laurie and Val to connect more as a couple. After earning a 30 last week, they landed at 25 this week.




A Pile-Up at the Bottom
Laurie was still safely in the middle of the pack, however, because so many couples (four, in fact!) tied for last place with 24s. Maureen McCormick had her best dance to date, but she was so far behind many of the other dancers that not even her high-water mark could bring the former TV star and Artem Chigvintsev up a notch or two.
Newly engaged Ryan Lochte and his partner Cheryl Burke, as well as Amber Rose and Maksim Chmerkovskiy, also landed at the bottom — though that was hardly a surprise, since they have been two of the lower scoring couples who are left. Calvin Johnson and Lindsay Arnold rounded out the foursome, though, despite earning rave reviews from the judges (before the scores went in).
Jana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko slid comfortably into the middle with a contemporary routine in honor of 2016. That was the year that Jana gave birth to her daughter. In addition, however, she worked in a story about being in an abusive relationship, saying that her daughter helped her piece herself back together after that experience. Carrie Ann said Jana had "a breakthrough" this week, so it will be interesting to see if she continues her upward trajectory moving forward. At this point, it's really (almost) anyone's Mirrorball.
At the end of the night, Tom Bergeron broke the happy news that no one would be eliminated until next Monday, as the show goes back to airing once a week.

Here we go! After randomly deciding to take a group trip to Ireland during last week’s episode — with no producer input whatsoever, we’re sure — the ladies of The Real Housewives of Orange County set off during the Monday, October 10, episode of the show. How did the trip go for pregnant Meghan King Edmonds, semi-feuding Vicki Gunvalson and Shannon Beador, and stressed-out Kelly Dodd? Read on to find out!

International Love
First thing's first: When the ladies arrived at their hotel, they were each given a “black velvet,” which is champagne and Guinness. The RHOC ladies out-RHOC’d themselves this time.

After getting their drinks, they checked in, and Vicki received flowers that her new boyfriend had waiting for her! The women took note of how Steve Lodge had signed the card with the word “love.” Vicki wasn’t as surprised as her pals were, and she asked the camera, “Why wouldn’t he love me? I’m a great catch.”

Oh, Nose, Not Again
Meghan wasn’t drinking, and neither was fitness-obsessed Tamra Judge, but that didn’t stop anyone else from going on a pub crawl. Meghan left to go see her genealogist and discover her heritage, but the others got to work whooping it up. (Or, to use their new Irish terminology, kicking hoolie.)


Tamra eventually forgot about her fitness goals for one day and started doing shots with everyone else, so you can imagine how quickly the pub crawl turned to a pub sprint.
Then — and we are not making this up — everyone got into a huge fight because Kelly was flicking people in the nose. Vicki called it “disrespectful.” Heather Dubrow called it “stupid.” Kelly got defensive, as usual, and the whole mood of the day deteriorated dramatically, especially when Kelly told Heather she found it weird that as a woman of Jewish descent, she couldn’t take a joke.
We still don’t know what she meant by that, but Heather wasted no time in telling her she was being racist. Everything devolved rapidly as Tamra accused Kelly of having her real estate agent look up how much Heather had actually paid for her house’s lot. As they left the pub to go shopping, an irate Kelly denied the story and hissed, “No wonder [Tamra’s] daughter won’t talk to her!”
The cameras weren’t on the women after that, but audio picked up a lot of bleeping, as Tamra screamed, "You talk about my f--king daughter, and I'll f--king kill you!" Then Kelly was heard yelling to Tamra, “You hit me?!”
The women were asked to leave the department store, and Tamra had a panic attack on the bus as she cried so hard she couldn’t breathe. No one would speak to Kelly the rest of the day as they sat around Tamra and hugged her.




Genes and Maternity Jeans
As all of that went down, Meghan, who was both thrilled and horrified to have graduated to stretchy pants only 10 weeks into her pregnancy, sat down with her genealogist and learned that she was likely related to the majority of people in the area they were visiting! She also learned that her “great-great-however-many-grandfather” was a rebel who was executed for his crimes against the O’Toole clan.
There are surely plenty of past and present RHOC cast members who are glad that crimes against a clan can’t get you executed these days! One in particular!
The Real “Irish Miracle”
When everyone reunited at the hotel, the Housewives still weren’t talking to Kelly, so she got Meghan alone and explained her side of the story before anyone else could get to her. The pregnant beauty wasn’t very sympathetic, so while she and the other ladies went out to dinner, Kelly called husband Michael. He advised her not to apologize, and she came to the conclusion that he’s the only person who supports her.
That’s a big shift from the last few episodes, which have been all about her deliberation over whether or not to get a divorce.
Out at the restaurant, Vicki and Shannon were laughing together and having fun. Meghan told the camera she thought their reconciliation was an “Irish miracle,” but if it was, Kelly reconciling with her husband from around the world was a global miracle. No — it was a universal miracle! Only Kelly Dodd could make marital peace by bonding over her refusal to apologize for being wrong.
Tell Us: Whose side are you on in Tamra and Kelly's huge fight?
The Real Housewives of Orange County airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

Happy Father's Day! On the Monday, October 10, episode of Teen Mom OG, the dad-centric holiday was in full swing, but some of the fathers were very much checked out. Maci Bookout's ex Ryan Edwards was so busy fighting with his dad that he couldn't be there for his son, while Tyler Baltierra was so caught up in wife Catelynn Lowell's mental health issues he could hardly enjoy time with his daughter. Read on to find out more.


Maci's Four Kids
Maci was spending time with her new baby boy, Maverick, as her ex-boyfriend-slash-baby daddy, Ryan, continued to be a major drain on her time and energy. To be blunt, he was still being a mope about his fight with his dad, and she was still giving him way too much attention. As her friend Keelie Lewis put it while they were grabbing lunch, Ryan is basically her fourth child at this point.

Later, her son with Ryan, Bentley, made stepdad Taylor McKinney a Father's Day present. Meanwhile, producers were at Ryan’s parents' house talking about the big fight, but he was nowhere to be found. Ryan, get it together! Your 7-year-old is displaying more emotional maturity than you are!

Sadly, Ryan’s dad was telling producers that he was over his “blood-sucking leech” of a son and was glad not to have to deal with him anymore. It made Us really sad, as did the fact that after all of the fuss made about it last week, Ryan still didn’t show up to Bentley’s big baseball game.
Maci summed up the entire thing perfectly when she fumed, “Grow up. Everybody just grow the hell up.”
Amber's New Lifestyle
For Amber Portwood, last week’s issues with former fiancé Gary Shirley were replaced with a more manageable problem: her weight. She revealed that she was hoping to get a little healthier because she is aware of how many people watch her on the show, and she wants to be an inspiration to them. So sweet, right?
Less sweet was the very obvious ploy by her fiancé, Matt Baier, to make himself look good by laughing off tabloid reports about the drama surrounding the child support he may or may not be paying to the mothers of his seven kids. Coincidentally, the tabloid-trashing scene was staged to improve his image, but he was so supportive of Amber’s healthy new lifestyle that he put himself in a better light all on his own!
One sobering moment came when Amber admitted she had substituted an addiction to food for her old pill addiction, but we were glad to see her being so self-aware and making such smart decisions for herself! She was setting a great example for Leah, even if the little girl did make a face at her green beans and grilled chicken.




Catelynn's Ongoing Battles
Remember how Catelynn got back from rehab just two episodes ago? Well, husband Tyler wasn’t thrilled to see that she wasn’t going to her after-care program, so while she chilled out at home, he grabbed lunch with his mom. Luckily, Kim Forbes was there for him, and she commiserated with her son about how hard Catelynn had been to talk to, and how unsure she was that the OG star was really trying to help herself get over her problems.
“I feel like people don’t understand — and I don’t think even Cate understands — how damaged she really is,” Tyler sighed.
A few days later, Cate still hadn’t gone to after-care, so Tyler got lunch with her cousin Jordan. Tyler vented about wanting Cate to go but knowing he couldn’t ask her to go because he wasn’t supposed to “influence” her.
Eventually, Tyler went to see someone who could actually help: Kathleen, their therapist. He didn’t come to any conclusions about how to help his wife or himself. He then went home and confronted Cate, and their segment ended in her crying …
Farrah’s Business Venture
Farrah Abraham’s fro-yo shop, FroCo, was so close to opening, and after watching her get over “unstable” Simon Saran last episode, we were cheering for her as she made the final preparations!
One of the top highlights of the episode came when Farrah conducted job interviews while wearing novelty sunglasses, and forced some of her applicants to wear them too. Why? Honestly, we don’t know, which makes it so much better.

It’s Morphin Time! The teaser trailer for Power Rangers (out March 24, 2017) dropped on Saturday, October 8. Judging from the two-minute video, fans of the classic ‘90s television show can expect sleek new costumes, the return of villain Rita Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks) and of course, plenty of teenage drama.
Compared with the characters on the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV show that ran from 1993 to 1996, and the two Power Rangers films that came out in 1995 and 1997 respectively, there’s a grittier vibe to these color-identified rangers from Angel Grove, California. The Red Ranger, played by Dacre Montgomery, appears to be wearing an alcohol monitoring bracelet as he heads to a disciplinary Saturday program with the other future Rangers and a few extra bullies. The Pink Ranger, played by Naomi Scott, chops off her hair in defiance of snobby girls who make fun of her remedial group. The Blue Ranger, played by RJ Cyler, deals with some serious high school bullying by the lockers.


Bound by their outcast status, the Yellow and Black Rangers join the other three and the group stumbles on to those fateful glowing shards that give them super strength and the power to leap canyons in a single bound.
We don’t get a glimpse of Bryan Cranston as Zordon, that floating head who gives the Power Rangers instruction and guidance. But we do get a gander at baddie Rita Repulsa who warns “I’ve killed other rangers before,” perhaps in reference to the show or the 1995 or 1997 motion pictures that preceded this.

In the trailer, there’s only a hint of the reimagined Power Ranger suits. The famously campy spandex getups have been traded for glowing, muscle-emphasizing suits that are more Iron Man than horse jockey. 

The trailer was released on the heels of the cast appearance pegged to New York’s Comic Con over the weekend. Check out the movie's website for more information about the release of the film.

Olympian Laurie Hernandez is blogging exclusively with Us Weekly about her quest to take home the Dancing With the Stars season 23 Mirrorball Trophy! Check back each week for her latest update on the competition.

Last week was awesome. It was the most nervous I've ever been before a dance. We hadn't even got 9s before, and suddenly we got straight 10s! It was insane. I just tried to remember my steps, and then I blinked and it was over! I had a lot of fun while I was out there, because I felt like this very sexy chick in a music video. I really enjoyed myself. And I'm glad we got those 10s!


This week I'm still balancing school, dancing and gymnastics. I'm actually studying for the SATs right now, so it's a mix of SAT prep and regular schoolwork. I had my first math test of the year this week! Since I'm homeschooled, I send in my tests, and after a certain marking period, they send me a report card. I'm starting to like math a little bit better! They say that those who like algebra, they don't like geometry, and people who don't like algebra, they do like geometry, so I think I'm one of those people. I like this year! I think I still like science and art better, but geometry is a big improvement over algebra.

DWTS' theme this week is one of my favorites. It's "My Most Memorable Year," where every contestant will talk about a meaningful time in their lives. I'm really excited to hear everyone else's stories because you always learn so much about all the contestants when they talk about something that's super important to them. I'm dancing to "Rise" by Katy Perry, which is the song she wrote for the Olympics. They sped it up a little and added a few beats just because we're doing a paso doble, so it's a little more intense — but like the song already was, it's very intense and dramatic.




I did pick 2016 as my most memorable year, but it's more acknowledging what happened leading up to this year. The dance is about how I dedicated my whole entire life to gymnastics, but it wasn't until this year that I could really come out and show the world what I had been working on since I was 11 years old. 
Everybody just saw the Olympics and saw that I got medals, but they didn't see all the hard work that went behind it. So that's what we're going for this week: Not just to show that I got a silver medal in beam, but all the dedication I put into getting to that point. I don't think everyone realizes that I was extremely nervous before right I got up on the beam in Rio. We were talking about it yesterday, and I still got jittery just thinking about it! [Dance partner] Val [Chmerkovskiy] said, "Are you OK?" And I said, "I'm still nervous just talking about this!"

As the weeks go by, I'm starting to get a little more nervous as the competition gets more intense — but I don't think I'll ever be as nervous as I was at the Olympics!
Dancing With the Stars airs on ABC Monday, October 10, at 8 p.m. ET. Watch an exclusive clip above from the episode.

Who says Americans need to be at least 18 years old to have a sound opinion about the next commander in chief? To see whether Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are getting through to the nation's future titans of industry, Us Weekly encouraged (read: forced) a 7-year-old to watch the second 2016 presidential debate on Sunday, October 9.

Luckily, the youngster still has until 2028 to get excited about this civic duty.

No matter how crappy (so to speak — ahem, Charlotte in the movie) some situations on Sex and the City became, there was always an underlying sense of humor, optimism, great sex — and, of course, the grace of goddess Sarah Jessica Parker. Loyal fans should be excited to learn that the same essence is captured in the premiere of HBO’s new dramedy Divorce, starring Parker and Thomas Haden Church.

During the premiere on Sunday, October 9, there was no Mr. Big (Chris Noth) — devastating, but true — and no mention of designer shoes or cosmopolitans. However, there were plenty of familiar SATC-esque moments that made Us as happy as Carrie (Parker) holding a beautiful new pair of Manolo Blahniks. We swear. Swear on Chanel. 

Below are the top SATC-est moments from Divorce's first episode:
Shameless Talk About Men

At a 50th birthday party for her friend Diane (Molly Shannon), Frances (Parker) engaged in blunt, honest man talk over drinks with her girls. Sound familiar? When Frances asked Dallas (Talia Balsam) about the guy who was talking to her earlier, Dallas responded, "Oh, that human loaf of bread?" So Miranda of her. 
In true Carrie form, Frances questioned her head-on with, "When does the whole empathy thing kick in for you?" They then had a cheers over the man's dead wife. If that doesn’t scream SATC, we don’t know what does.
The Over-the-Top Fight

Between Diane whipping out a gun on her husband at the party, and Frances getting into a tireless argument with the granola guy Julian (Jemaine Clement), we had multiple mental flashbacks to Carrie's McDonald's food-fight scene with Mr. Big. It looked like no Big Macs or Filet-o-Fish sandwiches were harmed in the making of Divorce, but that didn’t make the intense fights and Frances' on-point delivery of relationship problems any less fascinating.
Caught in an Affair, Red-Handed

Turned out, Frances had been having an affair with Julian behind the back of her husband, Robert (Church). In a way, it felt like we were rewatching Carrie cheat on Aidan (John Corbett) with Mr. Big. But then once Robert caught Frances in the act, and we saw the pitiful look on her face — just like when Aidan found out about Carrie’s affair — it made the nostalgic SATC experience so real. Woman’s gotta do what a woman’s gotta do.


The Epic Monologue

Almost every SATC episode included a mesmerizing speech from Carrie. Some were short, like the "I couldn’t help but wonder" voice-overs of the show, but perhaps the most iconic was Carrie’s "I am someone who is looking for love" speech she gave Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov) in the series finale. Similarly, Frances sat Robert down and addressed wanting a divorce, point-blank, opening with, "I want to save my life while I still care about it. I don't love you anymore." Like Carrie, she demanded what she wanted, and owned how she felt. 
Later, she addressed her negative actions toward Robert, saying, "That is not who I am — that is not what I want." Tell 'em how you feel, girl.
Sex, Sex and More Sex

What would HBO — and anything slightly reminiscent of SATC — be without open sex talk? Absolutely nothing. 
Not only did Divorce serve up sex scenes, but also the kind of unfiltered sex chat that made SATC fans so obsessed with the show. When Frances explained her relationship with Julian, she unapologetically stated, "He doesn’t just make me come. He makes me come a lot." Yup. And this was after her friend Dallas real-talked, "You love his d‑‑k!" And just like the ladies of SATC, Frances found herself confusing sex with love, saying, "I love him … I think."

Whether it be the spirit of New York City, biting relationship dialogue or obviously, all of the sex, it seems Divorce is the small taste of Parker's previous smash hit that fans have been waiting for. Rejoice.

What presidential debate? Rob & Chyna's Sunday, October 9, episode packed a punch and took Us on an emotional roller coaster we weren’t prepared for. If you’re feeling anxious about all the election drama from this weekend, maybe sit this episode out. Or use it as a distraction. Whatever you do, don’t make Blac Chyna choose between her phone and her french fries.

Rob Wants to Move Back in With Chyna
The episode started off on a sweet note with Rob Kardashian glowing about the state of his relationship with his pregnant fiancée, saying, “Things have been going great with Chyna and I.” The father-to-be continued, “I’m ready to move back in with her.” Little did he know, things would soon take a turn for the worse.

Rob Finds Out He's Diabetes-Free and Says It's the "Best News I’ve Heard All Year"
Before we discuss the huge blowout fight that occurred between Rob and Chyna, we simply must address a very important guest-star appearance from everybody’s favorite Kardashian hanger-on, Jonathan Cheban. He showed up at Kris Jenner’s house to support Rob during his meeting with Dr. Goglia, Rob’s nutritionist. After administering a blood test, the doctor was pleased to announce that Rob’s sugar levels have gone way down. Later on, Rob — who found out he would be a father this year — said to Chyna, "I’m completely free of diabetes.… That’s, like, the best news I’ve heard all year." Oops.

Rob Might Lose His Driver's License Because of Chyna's Arrest
Then, in a brief scene with sister Kourtney Kardashian, Rob revealed that he may lose his driver’s license. He admitted, "If I get one more ticket, then I'll get my license taken away … 'cause I got a bunch of speeding tickets when I went to get Chyna in Texas." Uh-oh, looks like Chyna wasn't the only one who faced trouble with the law after her January 29 "drunk and disorderly" arrest at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. Kourtney wasn't fazed by this news and continued munching on her enormous salad as Rob drove.

Chyna Blows Up at Rob After She Spills Waffle Fries in His Car
Allow us to set the scene: Rob drove his SUV as Chyna held a bag of Chick-fil-A. Chyna initially managed to juggle both her phone and Rob's fries, but ultimately failed when Rob made a sharp turn, sending the fries flying. Rob then made a joke saying, “You gotta choose one. Food or your phone — either or.” This comment touched a nerve with Chyna, sending her into a blind rage. The fight devolved into Chyna screaming at Rob, and Rob calling her names like "psycho" and accusing her of having "serious anger issues."

Chyna Shames Rob for Having a "Chemical Imbalance"
As the fight escalated, Chyna — in a truly low blow — shamed Rob's mental health, saying, "Everyone knows you’re a psychopath, and you have a chemical imbalance." She continued to dis the father of her unborn child, saying, "And you lazy as f‑‑k." Rob, in an incredibly sad and exceedingly self-deprecating move, said to the camera, "It's pretty clear Chyna doesn’t support me. I don't blame her because I obviously haven’t lost all the weight." He’s so hard on himself!


Rob Deletes His Social Media, Chyna Discusses Breaking Up
The episode then continued, for the most part, without Rob. Chyna revealed to Kourtney over the phone, "He deleted all his stuff from social media, and he deleted all of his stuff from Instagram." An exasperated Chyna said to her pal Paige Addison, "I'm just so tired, and I don't know how much longer I can do this." Paige then asked the question that has been on all of our minds: "Are you gonna break up with Rob?" To which Chyna responded, "I dunno, but I know we just cannot live together."
Kim Thinks Rob Likes to Be Stalked by His Family
While Rob was MIA, Chyna decided to attend his grandmother MJ's birthday without her future baby daddy. Chyna discussed his radio silence with Kim Kardashian, and Kim said, "That’s how he's been for the last three years.… I think he likes it when we're all stalking him." Chyna admitted to the camera that she’s not the only one he’s been shutting out, saying, "Rob actually blocked all of his sisters. He blocked his mom." These are dark times, people.
Kris Pleads With Rob to Not Disappear
The episode ended with a tearful confrontation between Rob and his mother, Kris. In a tearful monologue seemingly out of a Meryl Streep movie, Jenner pleaded with her son to not block her calls and texts. His mother (not to mention, she's also his executive producer) told him, “You can’t just disappear and leave town.… I have pain. I do.… The more you pull away, the harder and more painful it is for me.” Rob responded flatly, “Everybody has their own demons, Mom.” So, where was Rob this whole time? The only place more exciting than a San Diego birthday brunch: Las Vegas.
Tell Us: Will Rob and Chyna patch things up? And should they have their own #PresidentialDebate to sort out their issues? Who should moderate: Anderson Cooper? Ryan Seacrest? Either way, we’d like to sign up for that town hall!

Yo, HillaryClinton.com: Can we get a fact-check on the dictionary definition of the word gentleman? Donald Trump didn't threaten to grab anyone by the [redacted] tonight — but he did have a lot of fighting words for opponent Hillary Clinton during their second 2016 presidential debate on Sunday, October 9. Watch a highlight above, and click here for our by-the-minute recap!

With his campaign in frantic damage-control mode, and even fellow Republicans rescinding their endorsements, Trump went big (some might even say YUGE) with a bombastic, provocative and at times vaguely threatening approach to the town hall–style event at Washington University in St. Louis.

We don't know how Trump will do at the polls come November, but he's certainly dominating this list of our top 5 craziest moments from the 90-minute debate.

The Ghosts of Clinton's Past
In what seemed like an attempt to rattle Clinton in advance of the debate, Trump held a press conference right before the event with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey — who had all accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior. Although Hillary Clinton didn't take the bait when Trump gave the women a front-row seat and pointed them out during the debate, she did take the stunt some kind of way, as she very studiously declined to shake Trump's hand when she walked on stage.
Trouble in Pence-adise
Even with all the sniping at his opponent, one of Trump's most memorable disagreements tonight wasn't with Clinton at all, but with his running mate. When asked to comment on Mike Pence's views on military intervention in Aleppo, Trump replied, "We haven't spoken, and I disagree."
"Because You'd Be in Jail"
This might be a first in presidential debate history: During a familiar rant about Clinton's email scandal, Trump's rhetoric took an unexpected and rather threatening turn when he promised that if elected, he'll appoint a special prosecutor to reinvestigate Clinton and put her in prison for her alleged mishandling of classified information.



What Was That Word, Again?
It was possibly the most ironic moment in an evening overshadowed by Trump's graphic, provocative comments, which were caught on a hot mic during an Access Hollywood taping. When offered the chance to respond first to a question, the same man who'd just had to explain how and why he came to brag on tape about grabbing women in a decidedly illegal fashion, by a decidedly private part of their anatomy, said this:
"No, I’m a gentleman, Hillary. Go ahead."
And by the way, there were actually more tweets posted about the debate discussion of Trump's 2005 comments than they were tweets about any actual policy that was brought up. People clearly had one thing on their minds. 
Lurker-in-Chief
And finally, the weirdest (and most meme-worthy) thing to come out of the evening: Immediately after that "I'm a gentleman" comment, Trump inexplicably stood up and followed Clinton downstage, where he proceeded to loom behind her à la Michael Myers in a dark window in the classic horror film Halloween. This moment immediately went viral; while almost certainly not what Trump intended, the visual effect was extremely creepy, particularly when we're right in the middle of a nationwide panic over scary clowns.

Two weeks into HBO's new sci-fi soap opera, it's clear that Westworld, the show, is a lot like Westworld, the theme park: You're going to need to spend a lot of time there before you've even scratched the surface of what's really going on.

The mysteries of Westworld deepened in the HBO series' second episode on Sunday, October 9, as characters on both sides of the human/host divide started to get their first glimpses of a world beyond their own. There's William (Jimmi Simpson), a brand-new visitor to Westworld who got his first taste of the park's immersive peculiarities; there's Maeve (Thandie Newton), a longtime host who woke up to find herself in a true-life nightmare. And  of course, there's the creepy black-clad gunslinger (Ed Harris), drawing ever closer to the heart of a whole new hidden world-within-Westworld. Read on for Us Weekly's recap.

An a-maze-ing experience
During last week's premiere, we met the sadistic Man in Black, a scalp-taking sexual predator who's trying to uncover Westworld's darkest secrets. This week, we learned that whoever he is, he's kind of a big deal; a Westworld technician observing the Man in Black's murderous rampage through the park was told, "That guy gets whatever he wants." 

And what does he want? To find the ultimate Westworld Easter egg: the entrance to a maze that contains … well, something the guests aren't supposed to see. Whatever it is, it looks like he's going to find it soon — at the end of the blood arroyo, where the snake lays its eggs.




Welcome to Westworld
If you've been wondering how people get into Westworld to begin with, this week brought your answer in the form of a fresh storyline: William, a soon-to-be-married first-time visitor, arrived at the park with a lot of the same questions we had while watching last week. How do you get in? Is there an orientation? Where do you get your old-timey clothes? How do the guns know the difference between a host and a guest? 

As it turns out, the answer to most of these questions — for both William and the show's audience — is that you'll figure it out as you go along. Fortunately, he'll have help: William's friend Logan seems determined to help him (and by extension, us) skip the Disneyland-esque entry-level Westworld experience and dig deeper into the park's peculiarities.




These violent delights have violent ends
Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) isn't the only old robot host in Westworld who's learned a new trick. Maeve, the tough-as-nails brothel madame, was plagued by nightmares of a horrific attack — which seem not to be dreams at all, but fragments of an old Westworld narrative in which Maeve played a wife and mother. 
The twist: Maeve has learned how to wake herself up from her bad dreams, which in this case meant that she regained consciousness back in the lab, right in the middle of having her innards cleaned out by a pair of freaked-out technicians. 

Between Maeve's extended look at the behind-the-scenes Westworld machine, and Dolores' discovery of a gun buried in her yard, it seems inevitable some of the park's guests are about to stop having the time of their lives. (That gun? We're guessing it's *not* designed to only kill robots.)

There's never a time like the present — to pick sides in a fight between friends.  On the Sunday, October 9, episode of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, the women were all still reeling from their Vermont vacation turning into a battleground. Siggy Flicker was struggling to decide whether her loyalty was with Jacqueline Laurita or Melissa Gorga. (Teresa Giudice didn't factor into Siggy's distress very much.)

The episode began with Siggy discussing the aftermath of the brawl with Dolores Catania. Siggy was certain that Jacqueline was giving her the silent treatment because she felt that Siggy didn't have her back enough during her fight with Teresa and Melissa. Beyond that, however, Siggy and Dolores were puzzled by Melissa's refusal to validate Jacqueline's version of "strippergate" from so many years before. (ICYMI: Way back in 2009, someone claimed Melissa had been a stripper.)
Jacqueline Is Done With Teresa and Melissa
Siggy and Dolores then paid a visit to Jacqueline, who revealed that she had not intentionally ignored Siggy after all, instead arguing that she was "focused" on Teresa and Melissa, and her lack of communication had merely been an oversight. Siggy agreed it was confusing that Melissa hadn't supported Jacqueline more when she and Teresa were going at it and Jacqueline agreed.
"I thought it was dirty that Melissa tried to rewrite history," Jacqueline said. "Are you afraid of what Teresa would say if you answer that honestly?" she added to the camera, noting that it was just "sad." She then declared she was "done" with Melissa and Teresa, and Siggy pledged her loyalty by saying she wasn’t going to attend Melissa's fashion show (or Kim D.'s fashion show, but that seemed like more of an afterthought).
Siggy Tells Melissa She's Not Going to Envy's Fashion Show
In an attempt to be transparent, Siggy got coffee with Melissa. "Thank God Vermont is over," Siggy began. Then she admitted to Melissa that her first impressions of the boutique owner were not that great, saying she had found Melissa to be "phony" and "self-absorbed." Somehow, she managed to make even this information sound nice. Then she gave the final blow: She couldn't go to the Envy fashion show because she thought it would hurt Jacqueline.
Melissa responded calmly, asking if Siggy was going to Jacqueline's event. Siggy said she was and Melissa said that this clearly meant Siggy was picking sides. Melissa also argued that Jacqueline didn't need to approach or speak to her the way she did and Siggy repeated how hurt Jacqueline was. At the end of their coffee date, Siggy and Melissa hugged each other. In other words, even though Siggy wasn't going to Melissa's event, all was well between them — practically a miracle.
Kim D. Tries to Stir the Pot (Again)
Jacqueline, Dolores and Kim D. went for lunch together to catch up (and gossip) at Kim D.'s fashion show. Jacqueline reported that Teresa had tried to imply she was the one behind strippergate and then said that she was not inviting either Melissa or Teresa to her Little Kernel event later that week.
Kim D. seized the opportunity to try to stir the pot, saying that if she were Teresa, she would divorce her husband, Joe, before he went to prison because he would be entitled to half of everything she earned while he was away. When no one really took the bait on that topic, she tried again asking, "Do you think she is delusional or do you think that she just doesn't know?"

The other women looked at each other and Jacqueline said, "Whatever their relationship is, it works for them." Basically, no one wanted to go there as much as Kim D. wanted to lead the charge.
Siggy Has a Change of Heart
Meanwhile, Siggy had been thinking about what Melissa had said the other day and had a change of heart. Over sushi with Teresa, Melissa and Dolores, Siggy announced that she was in fact going to attend Melissa's fashion show.
Teresa took a moment to call Jacqueline a "wacko" and "crazy person," and Siggy sort of just let it slide.
A Little Kernel for the Creators of Little Kernel
Everyone (except Teresa and Melissa) gathered to celebrate the launch of Chris and Jacqueline's Little Kernel. As Chris made a speech about their journey with their son Nicholas' autism diagnosis, Jacqueline got very emotional. "Nicholas is making progress and I can see the sparkle in Chris' eye," she said.
Then Chris turned his attention to Ashlee, Jacqueline's older daughter who had recently gotten engaged. "I would also like to congratulate Ashlee and Pete on their engagement," he began. "But we got some more news. We just recently found out they are sprouting a little kernel of their own. Yes, Jacqueline is going to be a glam-ma."

Siggy, Kathy and Rosie Wakile, and Dolores showered Jacqueline with hugs and congratulations and Jacqueline said she felt like she was "opening a new chapter" in her life.
Just before leaving, Dolores pulled Chris aside and urged him to stand by his wife and not go to Joe Giudice's party in a few days because Jacqueline was no longer invited after the fight. It was well intentioned, but it was unclear whether he was going to listen.
Later, Teresa and Dolores met up at church and bonded over the fact that their dreams for their family lives hadn't exactly played out the way they'd planned or hoped. "I have come to accept it now," Teresa said of her husband's impending jail sentence. "I guess I am kind of old-school." Teresa reiterated that she would not get divorced. "I love Joe and he loves me and we're going to just stand by each other."
Dolores said if she were in Teresa's situation, she would do the exact same thing.

The second 2016 presidential debate is behind us (much like a certain GOP candidate just might be)! Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton battled it out on Sunday, October 9, as the #TrumpTapes controversy continues to rock the nation. And fear not: Plenty of time during the debate was spent discussing Trump's shocking comments about women to Billy Bush that were caught by a hot mic in 2005.

Here is Us Weekly's by-the-minute roundup of everything that happened during the tense event, moderated by Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz. Be sure to start reading at the bottom if you want to get it in chronological order. 

10:44 p.m. ET: And finally, incredibly, the discussion ended on a positive note — albeit a begrudging one. An audience member asked each candidate to "name one positive thing you respect in one another," and we've gotta give both Clinton and Trump credit here for doing their best.
Clinton, for her part, complimented Trump's children.
"His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald," she remarked. She then ended her time on stage with some more familiar messaging about her intentions if elected.
And Trump? Although he couldn't resist suggesting that Clinton's compliment wasn't really a compliment, he said he respected his opponent's refusal to quit: "A very good trait."
And despite a very, very tough 90 minutes, the event ended better than it began: With their time on stage officially finished, the candidates shook hands. 

10:39 p.m. ET: After a relatively uneventful round of questioning about the Supreme Court, the second-to-last question in this wildly contentious debate was quieter: How will these candidates meet our energy needs? (Let's all thank a certain Ken Bone for offering that question — and providing the debate with one of its key memes.)
Trump's reply is, unsurprisingly, an attack at the outset:
"Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business."
However, he did have some meatier specifics: Namely, Trump intends to pay off every deficit in the U.S. with energy — whereas he believes the current climate is putting our best energy industries out of business.
Clinton's reply mirrored Trump in that it also focused natural gas, and the importance of being energy-independent (i.e., not dependent on Middle Eastern oil to keep our country running). Her plan: to channel resources into clean, renewable energy while revitalizing our current industries, i.e. coal. As always, she urged people to go to her website to check out her plan.

10:31 p.m. ET: The question of Trump's temperament ended up front and center once again after the moderators brought up the subject of his recent middle-of-the-night tweetstorm (including the memorable phrase "Check out sex tape"). Trump's response? For one, he wanted to point out that it's quite presidential to be awake at 3 a.m. in the first place — you know, to answer that ringing phone that was ubiquitous in campaign ads the last time around.
His final word on the subject, and on tweeting in general: "I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you."

10:26 p.m. ET: The conversation veers to foreign and military policy: What are we doing about Aleppo? What should be done?
Clinton responded with an answer focusing on the need to negotiate from a position of power — but also with a wee jab at Wikileaks.
"What is at stake here is the ambitions and aggressiveness of Russia," she said. "They've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States too, and it's not me."
Her plan? "I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now," said Clinton. But she said she supports an effort to investigate the apparent war crimes currently taking place at the hands of Russian and Syrian leadership.
Trump replied, consistently, by attacking Clinton first:
"Everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake — it's been a disaster," he said. But the real surprise came when he disagreed not with Clinton, but with his own running mate. After a repeat of the question and a reminder that Mike Pence, the GOP vice presidential nominee, stated in his debate vs. Tim Kaine that the U.S. should be prepared to fight against the Assad regime, Trump's reply was actually slightly shocking:
"We haven't spoken, and I disagree."

Did Trump just admit on live national television that he and his running mate aren't talking?
The rest of the GOP candidate's answer was familiar — namely, that he feels we're giving away too much information by announcing military strategy, rather than bombing places like Mosul in secret.
Meanwhile, on redirect, Clinton went into additional detail about how she would and wouldn't approach the problem of Aleppo.
"I would not use American ground forces in Syria," she said. "I don't think American troops should be holding territory as an occupying force."
Clinton supports more tactical involvement: special forces, enablers and trainers. She also hopes that by the time she becomes president, ISIS will have been pushed out of Iraq. And she supports an alliance with Kurdish forces, although she acknowledged it's controversial.

10:05 p.m. ET: A question from the audience: What would our candidates do to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?
"One thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest," Trump replied — which was the first and only specific plan he outlined before pivoting into attack mode. His complaint, roughly, was that Clinton is at fault for not changing the tax code while she was a senator, which he accused her of doing so that she can now use the money she made to run negative campaign ads against him. (This would require a near-magical level of foresight on Clinton's part, but let’s just go with it.)
Clinton's response was the same one she's used multiple times throughout the night — for which she apologized.
"Well, everything you've just heard from Donald is not true. I'm sorry I have to keep saying it."
Her answer referenced the Buffett Rule — a popular bit of the tax plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2011 — and a surcharge on folks making more than $5 million per year. She also took this opportunity to remind the audience, and the nation, that Trump may well not have paid a penny in federal income tax for 20 years — along with underscoring who loses out (soldiers, children, the elderly) as a result.
Trump's rebuttal was another bold claim:
"I understand the tax code better than anyone who's ever run for president."

9:52 p.m. ET: The question is, "How will you fight Islamophobia?"
Trump's answer is: RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR. As in, he wants our leaders to say these words — and intends to say them as president. What does this have to do with combating bigotry toward peaceful, nonterrorist American Muslims? It's not entirely clear, but his answer briefly bumped up against the idea that cooperation from the Muslim community (in the form of reporting their radicalized members) is our first step toward getting along.
Clinton's response was more on-topic, and hit on some very fundamental American ideals.
"We've had Muslims in America since George Washington," she said. "My vision of America is one where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, do your part and contribute to the community." She also described it as "very shortsighted and even dangerous" to say the kinds of things Trump has about Muslims, when we need them on our side to combat terrorism at home.
"I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations," she said, going on to make the point that comments like Trump's alienate our potential allies. "We are not at war with Islam, and it is a mistake — and it plays into the hands of the terrorists — to act as though we are."

9:41 p.m. ET: Topic: ObamaCare. There was more friction at the start of the question as Cooper tried to give the first response to Clinton (who was talked over by Trump for much of her prior answer); she declined, and then Trump stepped in: "You can go first — I'm a gentleman."
Clinton admitted at the start that not everything about the Affordable Care Act is working; among other things, premiums have gotten out of control. However, she doesn't want to completely repeal the plan; Trump does. His message: "Repeal and replace."
If you ignore his repeated midsentence sidebars to call ObamaCare "a fraud," this is, in fact, the most substantive answer Trump has given so far tonight. His argument is that encouraging competition among insurance companies, including opening up the system across state lines, will bring prices down and quality up. 

9:32 p.m. ET: For the past 10 to 15 minutes, Trump has essentially ignored the moderators' questions, taking the kitchen sink approach to debating Clinton: He's attacked her on everything from her work as a defense lawyer, to her husband's problems with women, to her senatorial campaign, to her email scandal. But hey, we've seen most of this before. What might just be unprecedented: a straight-up threat from Trump about his plans to nail Clinton to the wall if and when he becomes president.
“If I win, I am going to instruct a special prosecutor to look into your situation," he said, referring to Clinton's email scandal. (Is that constitutional, given she's already been investigated?)
Clinton mostly refused to take the bait, despite many, many attempts by her opponent to get under her skin. However, at one point — smiling but also visibly annoyed — she shot back, "I know you're into big diversion tonight — anything to avoid talking about your campaign and how it's exploding and how Republicans are leaving you."

9:24 p.m. ET: The second question was the one we've all been waiting for, and moderator Anderson Cooper didn't hold back.
"You bragged that you sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?" he asked of Trump.
To be fair, there's no answer Trump could give to this question that would make him look good — only one that might have made him look slightly less bad. This, alas, was not that answer.
"This is locker room talk," the GOP candidate replied before pivoting into a lengthy diatribe about ISIS — who are "really bad" — and his intent to defeat the terrorist group. (Pro tip: When you've gotta compare yourself to ISIS to make yourself look good, you probably … shouldn't.)
Called back on topic by the moderator, the rest of Trump's response was of a kind that we've heard him say throughout this campaign: "I have great respect for women — no one has more respect for women than I do."
Clinton, given her turn, compared Trump to other political opponents she's faced.
"I never questioned their fitness to serve," she said. "Donald Trump is different."

9:12 p.m. ET: The tone has been set: Clinton not only politely declined to shake Trump's hand upon taking the stage, she looked at it like she wanted us all to think very hard about what he may or may not have grabbed with that hand back in 2005. However, the first question was only an oblique reference at best to Trump's taped remarks, which have dominated the news cycle since Friday, October 9. The candidates were asked: Do you think you — and your campaign — have been a role model for children?
Clinton went first:
"I think it's important to make clear to our children that our country is great because we're good."
What does that mean to the Democratic nominee? Respect, diversity, collaboration and, of course, her campaign slogan: Stronger together.
Trump's response was a bit of a surprise:
"Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said," he said, although he didn't talk about his own campaign's positions. Instead, the somewhat meandering response was a long complaint about the shortcomings of ObamaCare, the Iran deal and our trade deficit. 

8:30 p.m. ET: The candidates haven't taken the stage yet, but Trump may have tipped his hand as to just where and how he wants to hit Clinton in tonight's debate. The GOP candidate, who is still under serious fire for his 2005 caught-on-a-hot-mic remarks about groping women, held a press conference shortly before the event with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Kathy Shelton. The first three women had previously accused Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, of assault and/or unwanted sexual advances; the latter was the 12-year-old victim of a rapist who Hillary Clinton was assigned to defend during her days as a court-appointed attorney.
Trump didn't take questions during the conference, but the four women have evidently been saved seats at the second presidential debate tonight, lending additional weight to the rumor that Trump intends to take a figurative swing at Clinton by going after her husband's checkered past.
8 p.m. ET: If you thought the first 2016 presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was intense, buckle up for round 2! With the GOP candidate's recently leaked 2005 comments to Billy Bush continuing to dominate headlines, the second debate on Sunday, October 9, is sure to make the feathers fly. 

The debate starts at 9 p.m. ET and will air on all major television networks, and you can also catch it above in our livestream. As with previous debates, this event will run for 90 minutes without commercial interruptions — but unlike the prior ones, this will be a town hall event, which means the candidates will be mingling with and taking questions directly from the audience, rather than being confined behind their respective podiums.

The debate's first questions are likely to focus on the #TrumpTapes scandal, as the candidate's lewd remarks to Access Hollywood's then-anchor Bush were picked up by a hot mic back in 2005 and surfaced on Friday, October 7. The comments, which included the real estate mogul boasting about hitting on Nancy O'Dell and groping women, have led some members of Trump's own party to call for him to exit the race, although the former Apprentice host says he won't drop out. 
The task of keeping the candidates on message in the first showdown fell to just one man, Lester Holt, but the October 9 event will be helmed by both Martha Raddatz, coanchor of This Week on ABC, and Anderson Cooper of CNN. 
In addition to fielding handpicked questions from members of the 900-person audience, the moderators will be looking to social media for guidance on which issues the American public wants to see Clinton and Trump address. Therefore, this debate, compared to the policy-heavy first one, will likely center a lot more on social issues, including abortion and LGBT rights; it also means we're likely to see more discussion of racial bias and/or violence in policing.
The second 2016 presidential debate airs live on all major networks on Sunday, October 9, at 9 p.m. ET.

The gloves are off! Alec Baldwin and the Saturday Night Live writers addressed Donald Trump's sexist comments in a leaked 2005 video on Saturday, October 8, and they didn't hold back, portraying the Republican presidential candidate as an arrogant sleaze who can't admit when he's wrong.

The NBC comedy institution opened the show with a sketch that began with the snoozy Vice Presidential Debate before it was interrupted by "breaking news" — and Baldwin as Trump appeared on the screen.

Addressing the controversy over the former reality star's lewd comments about women to Billy Bush, who was then the cohost of Access Hollywood, Trump said that he would like to "deeply apple-a-gize."
When Cecily Strong asked if he was trying to "apologize," Trump said, "No, I would never do that. What I am doing is apple-a-gizing to all the people who were deeply offended by my statements, but more importantly, to the people who were turned on by them. I hear it's really 50-50."

As Us Weekly previously reported the real estate mogul made those remarks to Bush while not realizing his mic was hot. Trump told George H.W. Bush's nephew that he had tried and failed to "f--k" a married woman, who was later identified as former Access Hollywood cohost Nancy O'Dell.
The former Apprentice host, 70, who was just a few months into his marriage to third wife Melania Trump at the time, then talked about his fondness for kissing beautiful women and how being a celebrity enabled him to "grab them by the p--sy."
In the sketch Trump was asked what he would specifically say to women voters. "I would say, women, if you give me a chance, I promise I can do a whole lot more than just grab it," he said. "I can also bop it, twist it and pull it." (Strong's horrified reaction was pitch-perfect.)

Crossing to Hillary Clinton's headquarters, the camera found the former secretary of state (played by Kate McKinnon) and her campaign workers dancing and drinking champagne.

The Democratic presidential candidate was clearly ecstatic over the Trump scandal breaking just ahead of the second presidential debate on Sunday, October 9, and called it her reward for every single thing she's been through in the last 30 years, including having Mary J. Blige sing into her face for a full hour last week.
"It's a very sad day for our country, and all women — minus one," she said with a wink and a shoulder shimmy.
She then addressed all of the women who heard Trump's comments and are still voting for him. "Mah babies," she said. "Ya brain broke. I love ya but bitch ya cray."

The must-see TV event of the night on Sunday, October 9, won't be a prestige cable drama or an NFL game. Instead, people all over America will be tuning in to watch Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump butt heads in real time during the second 2016 presidential debate that will broadcast live from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.

The nominees will take the stage once again to field tough questions — about everything from personal values to presidential policy — in the second of three debates aimed at giving the candidates a chance to make their case for any undecided voters. And compared to the relatively staid non-spectacle of the VP debate on Tuesday, October 4, there's a good chance this event will include some controversial moments — especially since CNN revealed earlier on Sunday that the first questions at the debate will be about the #TrumpTapes scandal involving the real estate mogul and a 2005 recording that surfaced of the GOP candidate telling Billy Bush some, er, colorful things about Nancy O'Dell and the way he prefers to introduce himself to women.

Below, we've rounded up five things to know before you tune in. Plus, be sure to check out Us Weekly's live blog of the debate on October 9.

The basics
The debate starts at 9 p.m. ET and will air on all major television networks. (You can also catch it via livestream from Us' live blog.) As with previous debates, this event will run for 90 minutes without commercial interruptions — but unlike the prior ones, this will be a town hall event, which means the candidates will be mingling with and taking questions directly from the audience, rather than being confined behind their respective podiums.

The moderator
Actually, it's moderators, plural: While the task of keeping the candidates on-message fell to just one man, Lester Holt, in their first showdown, this event will be helmed by both Martha Raddatz, co-anchor of This Week on ABC, and Anderson Cooper of CNN.

The questions
In addition to fielding hand-picked questions from members of the 900-person audience, the moderators will be looking to social media for guidance on which issues the American public wants to see Clinton and Trump address. Therefore, this debate, compared to the policy-heavy first one, will likely center a lot more on social issues, including abortion and LGBT rights; it also means we're likely to see more discussion of racial bias and/or violence in policing.







The pre-debate prep
Trump prepared for his first debate against Clinton by, um, not preparing at all — and the general consensus in the aftermath was that Clinton more or less wiped the floor with him. This time around, he's doing things differently … sort of. The Republican nominee held a town hall event in New Hampshire on Thursday, October 6, which means the format of the upcoming debate should at least be familiar. However, he didn't field the kind of hard-hitting questions there that he's likely to get while sharing a stage with his opponent, so unless he's practicing in secret, we might see him essentially winging it for a second time.
The in-debate tactics
And here's where things get interesting. For her part, Clinton will probably use the same approach to debating Trump that worked pretty well for her last time: making strategic digs at him for his unreleased tax returns, bombastic temperament and provocative comments about women and minorities. (Prediction: That recently released recording of Trump bragging about how much he likes to grab women by the genitals will almost certainly get a mention on Sunday.) But Trump, for his part, has hinted that he's going to take the gloves off this time around to attack Clinton on deeply personal topics, such as her past marital difficulties. Will he do it? Will it work?!

Only time will tell, so join Us as the event unfolds for a minute-by-minute live blog.

It's probably not a good sign if you've only been married for two months and you're on a show called Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars, but for Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert, that's the spot they're in. But while they were the newest couple on the WE tv relationship show's season premiere on Friday, October 7, they weren't even the pair with the most trouble.

They were joined on the show by former Real Housewives of New Jersey stars Amber and Jim Marchese, hip-hop diva Keke Wyatt and husband-manager Michael Ford, Love & Hip Hop's Margeaux and girlfriend Merika, and Mob Wives' Karen Gravano and boyfriend Storm.

Why They're All Here
The season kicked off by providing background on each couple. Amber and Jim have been married for a decade but have suffered because of the way they speak to each other. He called her spoiled, and she called him condescending. Additionally, he didn't think she was up for sex nearly enough.

Keke and Michael suffered from working together — or, as Keke put it, from the fact that Michael couldn't accept that he worked for her. Margeaux and Merika were having issues because Merika was insecure about Margeaux's commitment (or not) to their relationship. Meanwhile, Karen argued that Storm was a terrible communicator, and he asserted that she doesn't use common sense.

As for the newlyweds, Jade and Tanner insisted they were looking at this camp as an opportunity to improve their marriage, rather than a Hail Mary to fix things that were wrong with it. Uh-huh. Sure.
Judge Lynn Toler Lays Down the Law
The couple then met with Judge Lynn Toler, who would be presiding over their progress throughout the camp. One by one, she called each couple up to the podiums and dolled out some thoughts on the current state of their relationship. Most of her commentary was just a repeat of what the couples had themselves readily admitted during their introduction videos, but with Jade and Tanner she got a little deeper.
After Jade admitted she apologizes for things she doesn't think are her fault in order to avoid fights, Toler said the most dangerous word the Bachelor in Paradise star ever said was "OK." Jade agreed with this statement immediately, and Toler encouraged her to speak up in her relationship more. (Tanner didn't comment on that.)
Toler was sensing Jim was resentful that Amber had gotten cancer again, and that he was footing the bill for her treatment. Amber was relieved that her health had been brought up by the judge because she thought it was definitely an issue, but it was unclear if Jim agreed with what Toler was speculating.
The biggest bombshell, however, came for Margeaux and Merika.


Margeaux's Husband Shows Up
In a strange turn of events, Toler revealed she had a secret guest. That guest was Nikko London, Margeaux's husband. Not only was he there for court that day, but he also would be remaining at boot camp. This meant Margeaux was at relationship camp with both her girlfriend and her husband. Oops.
It turned out that Margeaux and Nikko had separated four years ago but had never filed the paperwork to make their divorce official. Judge Toler argued that the fact that Margeaux had not gone through with the filing meant she was not completely over Nikko, which Margeaux vehemently denied.
"Why is everybody ganging up on me?" she shouted. "You don't know me!"
After the "court" session ended, Margeaux, Merika and Nikko got another surprise: They would all be sleeping in the same room and potentially the same bed. "Get the f--king divorce!" Merika screamed. Nikko was clearly reveling in the situation, but Merika was struggling and wandered around the house drinking a cocktail, complaining to anyone who would listen.
For the most part, the houseguests were sympathetic to Merika's situation, agreeing it was pretty lame for her. Merika asked Karen if she could call the mob to help her. Karen laughed it off, so her assistance seemed unlikely.
Tanner Really Thinks Jade Is a Waste of Space
It had been revealed that Tanner said, "Jade doesn't do s--t" and called her a "lethargic slob," but later that night in their bedroom, it became clear just how resentful he was getting.
As they settled in for the night, Tanner told his wife, "You don't have a ton of value as a teammate in our marriage." Jade burst into tears and said she would never say such a thing to him. "You make me feel like all I am is my weaknesses," she replied.
He went on to say that all of his friends' wives who don't have actual jobs take care of everything else for their husbands, and pointed out that Jade couldn't even do the laundry. She snapped back that it was that she couldn’t remember to do the laundry (umm … no comment). Tanner insisted he just didn't want to feel like he was pulling all of the weight, and they went to bed without being any closer to a resolution.
Tell Us: Do you think there's any hope for Jade and Tanner?

Time to throw in the towel? Mohamed Jbali finally reaches out to estranged wife Danielle Mullins after she files to annul their marriage in 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After's Sunday, October 9, episode, as seen in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek. The episode marks the show's first airing in its new 9 p.m. ET time slot.

The TLC spinoff series' preview clip features Jbali phoning Mullins after telling the camera he is worried about getting deported from the U.S. if his marriage ends. Last week's episode included the Sandusky, Ohio, denizen boasting about going out with a new guy, following her spotting pics of her husband partying on a boat with his comely friend Luisa.

Mullins tells the camera, "I knew the moment that I filed the annulment, and he found out about it, that he'd want to talk because he wants to be in this country."

"I feel used by you," she tells Jbali over the phone. "You don't treat someone this way that has done so much for you. Do you know how that hurt me when I seen those pictures of you and Luisa?"

Jbali tells the camera, "Danielle [has been] accusing me of cheating and talking to other women, but I find out that she's cheating on me with another man. People all started messaging me on social media."
Mullins and Jbali have had a tumultuous journey since meeting and getting hitched on 90 Day Fiancé season 2. In December, she wrote on Facebook that they were "splitting," although they are still married.

She's not loving it! Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian get into a heated argument in the car over french fries in Rob & Chyna's Sunday, October 9, episode, as seen in a sneak peek.

The E! unscripted series' preview clip shows Kardashian, 29, driving the pair after picking up fast food, and he isn't pleased when his pregnant fiancée, 28 — who is using her phone at the time — accidentally lets some of the fries fall to the vehicle floor.
"You got to choose one — the food or your phone," the Arthur George sock designer admonishes. "Either/or. Either/or."

The makeup maven is not pleased by his attitude and fires back, "These are my fries! [The ones in the bag] was your fries."



"He's going to tell me I need to choose between my phone or holding his food?" Chyna grouses to the camera. "I'm not your mother. Like, you better hold your own food, or put it in between your lap. Now you are going to get mad at me over some french fries and start yelling at me. What?"
The Keeping Up With the Kardashians mainstay tells her, "You have serious anger issues! … Why are you yelling, you psycho? What's wrong with you?"

Chyna tells the camera, "Rob likes to pick with me. He loves to see me get hot, and I'm just sick and tired of him playing with me."
A previously released clip from the episode showed the pair bickering over his priorities, with Chyna saying it is "bizarre" that Kardashian — who has struggled with his health and weight in recent years — isn't more focused on "his fitness." This scene was exclusive to Us Weekly.
Watch the tense clip above. Rob & Chyna airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

The married woman has been identified. Access Hollywood opened its Friday October 7, episode with details about the recorded 2005 conversation that surfaced earlier that day between Donald Trump and former host Billy Bush on the show's bus.

Host Natalie Morales told viewers that former Access Hollywood personality Nancy O'Dell is the married woman who Trump, 70, tells Bush, 44, that he unsuccessfully made a pass at in the video released by the Washington Post earlier in the day. Trump and Bush, whose comments were caught by a hot mic, were visiting the Days of Our Lives set so that the current presidential candidate could meet one of the show's stars.

“I moved on her and I failed. I’ll admit it,” Trump said on the bus in the recording. “I did try and f‑‑k her. She was married.… And I moved on her very heavily in fact. I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, ‘I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.…’” Bush also made unsavory comments of his own.

Morales explained that Access Hollywood discovered the audio recording when they were sifting through old interviews conducted with the real estate mogul after reports that he made demeaning comments about women during his time as host of The Apprentice, which, like Access Hollywood, is an NBC show.
O'Dell left Access Hollywood in 2009, and has been with Entertainment Tonight since 2011. She married Keith Zubchevich in June 2005 after splitting from first husband Richard O'Dell in November 2004. 

Access Hollywood did not issue a separate statement of its own, even though Bush was working for the show at the time that the audio was recorded. O'Dell and ET declined to comment for this story.
Trump apologized in a statement, referring to his comments as "locker room banter." He added, "Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course." Bush also issued a mea culpa in a statement to Us Weekly: "Obviously, I’m embarrassed and ashamed. It’s no excuse, but this happened 11 years ago — I was younger, less mature and acted foolishly in playing along. I’m very sorry.”

From one New York City stage to another! Hamilton star Lin-Manuel Miranda hosts Saturday Night Live on Saturday, October 8, and he will be joined by musical guest Twenty One Pilots. Plus, Alec Baldwin just dropped a hint that he'll be appearing again as newly embattled Donald Trump!

Miranda, 36, who marks his first time hosting the venerable NBC sketch-comedy series, is hot off the success of his Broadway phenomenon, Hamilton. The musical about the first secretary of the Treasury won a whopping 11 Tony Awards in June and it's the toughest ticket in town. The talented performer's breakthrough success was the musical In the Heights, which took home four Tonys at the 2008 ceremony.

In the promos for the October 8 episode, SNL cast member Aidy Bryant shows her admiration for the host by rapping to him, "I loved Hamilton, I saw it a ton, in terms of fun, it was a ton." After hearing her effort, Miranda replies, "Maybe you take the rest of the promo off."

SNL season 42 got off to a hot start last week, thanks in large part to Alec Baldwin's headline-making debut portraying Donald Trump. (Margot Robbie hosted and The Weeknd performed.) 
Baldwin is almost certain to return as the presidential candidate on October 8, to comment on the recently surfaced 2005 audio of Trump boasting to Billy Bush about groping women and hitting on Nancy O'Dell. Hours prior to the start of this weekend's new episode, the 30 Rock alum retweeted a fan's message: "Gee, I wonder what @AlecBaldwin is up to today," a likely hint at the actor's upcoming SNL appearance. 

The October 1 season premiere was seen by 11.8 million viewers within three days of airing, earning the series its biggest audience for a launch since Steve Martin hosted in 1994.



NBC announced on Friday, October 7, that The Girl on the Train's Emily Blunt will host the October 15 installment, joined by musical guest Bruno Mars. 
Inferno's Tom Hanks will tally his ninth episode as host on October 22, accompanied by Lady Gaga.

Watch the hilarious promos above.

Nothing better than a catchy new jam. John Legend released a new song titled “Love Me Now” on Thursday, October 6.




The highly anticipated track, off his upcoming album Darkness and Light,  is about living in the moment while in a relationship.

"I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone / So I'm gonna love you now like it's all I have," he sings in the chorus. “I know it'll kill me when it's over / I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now.”
"The music is really, really good," the Grammy winner promised during a recent Facebook Live while discussing his upcoming album. "I think it's my best work yet."
Darkness and Light, which follows his 2013 album Love in the Future, will feature performers such as Chance the Rapper, Brittany Howard, Miguel, Blake Mills and saxophonist Kamasi Washington.
Legend most recently collaborated on tracks with Meghan Trainor and Kelly Clarkson in 2015.

He has yet to announce a release date for the upcoming album. Listen to "Love Me Now" above.

It's time, Tay. Taylor Swift has released new music every two years since 2006 — so where's the next record? A new theory suggests that the pop star will drop a surprise album on October 23.
The Washington Post's Emily Yahr came up with the specific date, and her reasoning is pretty convincing. It's one day before the anniversary of Swift's self-titled debut album, and all of the numbers added up together (10/23/16) come to 13, Swift's favorite number. (The most recent offering, of course, was her blockbuster, Grammy-winning 1989, which dropped on October 27, 2014.)


Swift has a ton of material to write about. Here, Us Weekly has rounded up 6 things that she must (pretty please!) address — starting with her headline-making recent romances and splits. Find out what we hope to hear in her new album in the video above, and detailed below!


1. Calvin Harris RomanceThe "Style" singer is known for taking pen to paper to write about her famous exes. She's previously wrote songs about Jake Gyllenhaal, Harry Styles, John Mayer, Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas. So, why wouldn't Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston make the cut?
Us confirmed in June that Swift and the Scottish DJ, 32, amicably split after 15 months of dating. The following month, things looked less than amicable when Harris accused Swift of making him "look bad" when it was revealed that she ghost-wrote his hit "This Is What You Came For." Despite his heated tweets, however, the two have recently started texting again.
"They are going to run into each other around town and at events, and they need it to be cool," a source told Us last month. "They are cool again but absolutely [have] no plans to get back together. It was more of an olive branch between them."




2. Tom Hiddleston SplitShortly after that breakup, Swift dated Thor star Hiddleston, 35, for three months. (Us broke the news of their split in September.) The "Blank Space" singer didn't wallow, however. She's been spending time with pals like Lily Aldridge and Cara Delevingne, and (wait for it!) has been working on new music in the studio, according to another close pal, Gigi Hadid.


3. Kimye FeudSwift writes about more than just former flames, of course. She's previously reflected on the, well, bad blood she's had with Katy Perry and Camilla Belle. Frenemies that she's yet to discuss include Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. This year, Swift reignited her feud with Kimye over the rapper's controversial "Famous" lyrics.

"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous," he raps on his track. West was referencing the time he ambushed Swift on stage when she was accepting the Video of the Year award at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009.
Swift's rep told Us that the remark was "misogynistic." West, meanwhile, insisted Swift knew about the line. In July, Kardashian posted, via Snapchat, a recording of the musicians speaking about the song on the phone. Swift retaliated by posting on Instagram that it was "character assassination."
The trio haven't appeared to make up just yet. Last month, West fueled the flames even more when he sang "Famous" three times during a concert in Swift's hometown of Nashville. "F--k Taylor Swift," he chanted to the crowd.





4. Squad 4 LifeFrom the runway to the studio! Swift could totally give a shout-out to her gal pals, aka her girl squad. From boy talk to baking in the kitchen, Swift's new album could potentially have another song like "22." Swift enlisted some of her gal pals to star in the upbeat music video for the 2012 hit.

Swift usually has her famous friends by her side. They always get an invite to her annual Fourth of July bash, and she even asked a bunch of them to join her on stage during her 1989 concerts. This week, member Hailee Steinfeld told BBC Radio 1 that the gang keep in touch with a WhatsApp group chat.
In addition to Steinfeld, other members of the girl squad include Selena Gomez, Aldridge, Hadid, Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Lena Dunham, Lorde, Martha Hunt and Jaime King.


5. Demi Lovato DramaSwift and Lovato had a falling out years ago — and the former Disney star won't let anyone forget it. Back in February, Lovato slammed Swift after the "Style" singer donated $250,000 to Kesha amid her lawsuit against Dr. Luke. "Take something to Capitol Hill or actually speak out about something and then I'll be impressed," Lovato tweeted.
Earlier this month, Lovato touched on the subject again while speaking about feminism with Glamour magazine. She even sniped at Swift's girl squad. "I think that having a song and a video about tearing Perry down, that’s not women’s empowerment," she said, referring to Swift's 2014 song "Bad Blood". "We all do things that aren’t, but I have to ask myself, Am I content with calling myself a feminist? Yes, because I speak out."





6. Cat Lady GoodnessBonus! Because, why not? Swift is obsessed with her felines, Meredith Grey and Olivia Benson — and so are her fans. The star often shares adorable videos of the kitties on social media.

Swift could have been inspired to cover the cute subject, too. In August 2015, Swift and Lisa Kudrow sang the actress' TV hit "Smelly Cat" during the 1989 World Tour in L.A. Kudrow often belted out the tune at Central Perk as Phoebe Buffay in the comedy smash Friends.

When froyo ain’t so fun. Farrah Abraham’s father, Michael Abraham, loses it during a family fight at Froco, his daughter’s frozen yogurt and bubble tea shop, in a preview for the Monday, October 10, episode of Teen Mom OG.
In the clip above, Farrah meets with her dad and her mom, Debra Danielsen, at her newly opened business in Austin, Texas, where she delegates duties to them.
The 25-year-old entrepreneur tells Michael, “The only job position that you can really have is being Coba the Boba. I will probably give you a chance to be the mascot.” (Yes, Farrah wants her dad to dress up as a life-size ball of tapioca.)

“I’ll start out to help you out,” he responds with a laugh. “I don’t think it’s too healthy for our personal relationship.”



The MTV starlet — who repeatedly butts heads with her folks, as documented on TMOG — is clearly frustrated with Michael’s answer and snaps: “OK, well, what if I don’t have anyone for the mascot?”

Her father assures Farrah that he will do it until she finds a full-time employee to wear the costume, which temporarily defuses the 16 and Pregnant alum’s flaring temper.

She then goes on to tell her parents that the trio needs to “clean and organize” the store before a health inspector comes the next morning. This prompts Danielsen to remind Farrah that they should increase the temperature on one of Froco’s refrigerators so that an undisclosed substance can be thawed.





While you’d think she’d appreciate a heads-up, Farrah is only infuriated by Danielsen’s suggestion. She storms off to check out the fridge and inexplicably launches into a verbal tirade against her father.
“Why is the freezer warmer than the refrigerator?” she shouts in Michael’s face, to which he replies: “Ask [Debra]! I didn’t touch these.”

Though he attempts to fix the problem, Farrah only yells louder at him. And Michael has had it. “You asked me to be here. Get off my ass,” he says as he walks away. “Get off my ass!”

To see how she responds, watch the video above. Teen Mom OG airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

That time we got rickrolled! Rick Astley recently stopped by Us Weekly’s New York City headquarters to teach a few lucky staff members how to sing his trademark 1987 hit “Never Gonna Give You Up."
In the video above, the 50-year-old '80s icon wows with an a cappella rendition of the chorus from his world-famous track. After Astley — whose eighth studio album, 50, is available Friday, October 7 — finishes, Us’ Entertainment Director Ian Drew takes a stab at making the tune his own. “I’m impressed, Ian!” the British hitmaker says.
Next up: Us Weekly Video correspondent Christina Garibaldi — who not only slays with pop star-worthy vocals, but busts out some pretty great dance moves as well.


Us video editor Courtney Keyes is last, but certainly not least. She hits every note perfectly — and even inspires Astley to break out into some original choreography!

“I’m impressed, to be honest,” he jokes in the video. “I thought you were all gonna be awful.”

Reflecting on the impact of “Never Gonna Give You Up” — which hit No. 1 in over 25 countries during the height of its popularity — Astley explains, “It [will be] 30 years next year that this song came out. I just remember hearing it and thinking, ‘This tune has really, really got something.’”

The song was given new life and introduced to a whole new generation in 2007 when it became the subject of a popular internet prank (labeled "rickrolling") that involved misleading links redirecting to the “Never Gonna Give You Up” music video.

Astley shares with Us: “And then when we put the vocals on it, I loved it. And I really felt it had something different and it had something a bit special.”

Watch Astley and the Us crew give it their all in the video above.

Too much to keep up with? Blac Chyna warns Rob Kardashian about spreading himself too thin on Rob & Chyna's Sunday, October 9, episode, as seen in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek.

The E! series' preview clip shows Kardashian, 29, telling his pregnant fiancée, 28, that he and a friend have finalized a deal to start a new business venture. However, Chyna — who is expecting the couple's first child, a baby girl, later this year — has her concerns.

"If you feel like you're being rushed into it, I feel like you should wait," she cautions. The Arthur George sock designer replies, "I mean, it's something that we've been planning to do for a long time."

The makeup maven is still unconvinced that her man's priorities are in order. "I just don't want you to put all this stuff on yourself, and then you just be over it," she tells him.
Chyna adds to the camera, "Rob needs to continue working on his health, his fitness, his sock business. And so for him to try to go get a big brand-new house and to start a new business is a little bit bizarre to me."
A previously released clip from the episode showed the pair's difference of opinion over whether the model should move out of the home she currently shares with roommate Paige, as Kardashian wants to buy them a new abode in which he feels more comfortable.

Watch the tense footage above. 
Rob & Chyna airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

He's back! Bruno Mars released "24K Magic," his first solo song in four years, on Thursday, October 6.

The song is the title track from the singer's upcoming third studio album, due out November 18. It's his first album since 2012's Unorthodox Jukebox.



Mars, 30, whose last music release was the megahit "Uptown Funk," which he collaborated on with Mark Ronson at the end of 2014, also dropped a music video for the new song on Thursday night. The colorful clip features a "what happens in Vegas ends up in this music video" theme.
A photo posted by Bruno Mars (@brunomars) on Oct 6, 2016 at 8:21pm PDT

On Monday, October 3, the singer tweeted that his album was done and teased the new song on Instagram writing, "You can call it my first single, but I call it the invitation to the party."




The "Grenade" singer tweeted out the video on Thursday night, writing, "Chapter 3 begins."
The music video kicks off with Mars landing in Sin City on a private jet with his crew, who are soon joined poolside by a group of bikini-clad women. "I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket," he warns before singing about "24 karat magic in the air." He is then shown cruising down the strip in a convertible, hitting a casino, dancing down a hotel hallway in a robe, and taking to the famous Bellagio hotel fountain on a jet ski.

The four-time Grammy winner — who memorably had a mini dance-off with Beyoncé while performing at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show — is set to appear on Saturday Night Live on October 15.

The doctors are breathing new life into Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital — no, really. On Grey’s Anatomy's Thursday, October 6, episode, as main characters struggled to work out their conflicts with lovers, friends and coworkers, one family resolved their deep-rooted problems by receiving the ultimate miracle.

Eternal Triangle
The episode began with Maggie (Kelly McCreary) complaining to Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) about Riggs (Martin Henderson) rejecting her. Meredith was quiet because she still hadn’t told her half-sister that she and Riggs had sex once — or four times in one night — but who’s counting? (Us. We are definitely counting.)

At the hospital, Riggs asked Meredith to tell Maggie the truth, so that they could be open about their sort-of-relationship. Meredith, however, came up with a far more mature and adult solution: Riggs should take Maggie out and treat her terribly, bad breath included, of course.




Fight Club
After being inexplicably absent from the season’s first two episodes, Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) returned from New York. Within minutes of her arrival, she scolded Alex (Justin Chambers) for beating up DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), who she currently lives with. Later, Arizona and Owen (Kevin McKidd) bickered about the fight because Arizona claimed that Alex beating up DeLuca over Jo (Camilla Luddington) was no different than Owen punching Riggs over his sister.

Miranda (Chandra Wilson) and Ben (Jason George) argued after she avoided yelling at Tuck when he bullied someone at school. Miranda admitted that she didn’t want to be a disciplinarian both at work and home, so Ben offered to be the bad cop. After a few minutes of indirect threatening (parenting perk of working in a hospital: You can basically show any X-ray and say it was a result of bullying. Well played, Warren), Tuck eventually apologized and made the ultimate atonement for a teenager living in 2016: He handed over his cell phone. For. Two. Weeks.




Life Alert
Aside from love triangles and arguments, there was actual medical work happening at the hospital, too! After a car hit a funeral procession, the doctors worked to heal a family as they mourned the loss of their father. While the man’s wife held his hand to say goodbye, she went into cardiac arrest and died — sort of. An hour later, as one of her daughters was sitting by her side, the woman squeezed her hand and sat up, 100 percent alive.
After the woman was stable, Riggs and Meredith had a rare personal moment where they discussed the dreams they have about their deceased exes. Later, as they went to leave the hospital, they continued to discuss the woman’s miracle, and Riggs flashed Meredith a smile, saying, "Anything can happen, Dr. Grey." We wouldn’t recommend using a false-alarm death in your Tinder bio, but for Nathan Riggs, the move seemed to work. He left Meredith grinning on a bench as he walked away.
Tell Us: Should Meredith come clean to Maggie about Riggs?
Grey's Anatomy airs on ABC Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.

Did someone just forget that he's about to become a daddy? Rob Kardashian gets caught up in the good news about his health on Rob & Chyna's Sunday, October 9, episode, as seen in a sneak peek.

The E! series' preview clip shows Kardashian, 29, telling pregnant fiancée Blac Chyna, 28, that he just got back from a checkup to get the latest on his battle with diabetes.

"I just met with Goglia, the nutritionist, and he just told me all of my numbers, and I'm completely free of diabetes," the Keeping Up With the Kardashians mainstay says. "That's the best news I've heard all year, literally."

However, a baffled Chyna replies, "What about us having a baby?" Oops! (The couple announced in April that they are expecting a little one later this year, and Us Weekly exclusively revealed that the pair are having a girl.)
Kardashian rethinks his superlative and backpedals a bit: "The baby's obviously the best news. That's of my life."
The Arthur George sock designer then points out that he'd like the makeup maven to move out of the home she shares with her roommate, Paige, and get a new pad with him. "I definitely think you and me are in a really good place right now, but I just don't see why we can't get on the same page," he says. "I'm trying to find us a house — a house [that] you and me both love and are comfortable in. I'm just not comfortable here."

Watch the awkward clip above. Rob & Chyna airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

A movie that rocks! Vanessa Ray, known for her mischievous role of Charlotte DiLaurentis on Pretty Little Liars, stars in the romantic dramedy film All in Time, available on Friday, October 7, in 15 theaters (check local listings) and on VOD nationwide. Ray plays Rachel, whose boyfriend Charlie (Sean Modica) quits his job to manage his favorite band.

"I love the film because it’s a film about using your imagination a little bit," the actress, 35, tells Us Weekly exclusively. "It’s about letting go of your expectations of what you think life is supposed to be. I loved playing a character that had this passion to do something with her life."

"What I found I loved so much about Rachel is that she gets in and out of all the situations with grace," Ray continues. She also points out that the film has a surprise twist. 
On PLL, Charlotte was revealed as "A" in season 6's summer finale, and the character died in the season 6 winter premiere. The Blue Bloods star tells Us that Charlotte might still have a few tricks up her sleeve on the Freeform drama's final 10 episodes that begin airing in April 2017.
All In Time from Chris Fetchko on Vimeo.
The actress teases, “I have been keeping up with the show, and you might see my face soon. I love getting to be around that crew and the lovely cast.” She also expresses her gratitude to PLL showrunner I. Marlene King: “I feel like she put me on the map single-handedly.”

Ray also shares some shocking speculations on who the "A" torch may finally be passed down to once and for all. “I think it’s going to be Aria," she says. "I think like early in the early days, she just kind of had the most to lose. She was hurt the most by the antics that 'A' put her through, so that’s why I think she might be the one that’s coming back to get them all.”

The actress has a few choice words about her hopes for the series finale — quite literally, she wants it to go out with a bang. She says, “I hope they burn Rosewood down. I hope they just take a match. I really hope there is a slo-mo montage of them walking away with sunglasses on or something.” Talk about epic!



While her possible PLL comeback is still a bit down the road, Ray is currently filming Blue Bloods, which premiered its seventh season on CBS September 23. Ray reveals to Us that fans can expect to see a different side of her character, Officer Eddie Janko: “You see her a bit more perhaps aggressive and passionate. You’re able to kind of see her open up a bit more.”
Of Eddie’s connection with Will Estes’ character, Jamie Reagan, son of police commissioner Frank Reagan (portrayed by Tom Selleck), Ray discloses, “I think fans are going to be pleasantly surprised to see the evolution of their relationship. I think [Eddie] trusts Jamie in a way that she didn’t in other ways on other seasons, so it’s great. I just love those two so much — I think Jamie and Eddie are the best!”
Ray adds that working with Selleck “makes you feel like you’re the best actor in the room, even though he clearly is.” Reflecting on the first time she saw the acting legend, Ray recalls, “He was smoking a cigar outside in a casual button-up, let’s just call it that, and I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, that is literally Magnum P.I.’ Like, literally everything I’ve ever wanted him to be.”
Tell Us: How do you think Charlotte will return to PLL?
Blue Bloods airs on CBS Fridays at 10 p.m. ET. Pretty Little Liars returns to Freeform for its final 10 episodes in April 2017. All in Time is available in limited theatrical release and on VOD nationwide on Friday, October 7.

She’s back. Empire viewers saw the return of Freda Gatz, played by Bre-Z, on the Fox drama's Wednesday, October 5, episode. The rapper had last appeared on the penultimate episode in season 2, where she accidentally shot Jamal Lyon (Jussie Smollett) after he jumped in front of a bullet meant for his father, Lucious (Terrence Howard).

Freda returned to the show this week in cuffs and an orange jumpsuit while meeting up in the visiting room of a prison with her former friend Jamal.

“It was highly anticipated. People want to know what’s going on between Freda and Jamal,” Bre-Z exclusively tells Us Weekly of her return. “It was very emotional, it was very serious, it was very real.”

During the reunion, Jamal continued experiencing flashbacks to the shooting that occurred at the ASA Awards. “I don’t think she really has a clue about the pain he’s in. She can obviously understand that someone gets shot, and it hurts, but I don’t think she understands how detrimental that was to him as a human being, period,” Bre-Z says. “I think she’s looking at it just like, ‘I didn’t mean to do it.’”

“She wants to be able to say sorry and hopefully things will be OK, but she’s got a little bit of growing up to do before she can acknowledge certain things,” Bre-Z explains. “That’s that level of maturity. When people suffer from traumatic experiences like that, there’s a healing process. It takes time, but she doesn’t really understand that yet.”





While Bre-Z stayed mum on when she will be returning to the show, she did hint that we may hear some new music from the talented rapper.

“I think we will, because she’s got to give her side of things, she’s got to say something, and I think when she’s going through things we all know that she portrays it best through her music, so I think we should in the near future,” she says.

As for recording with Lucious, Bre-Z doesn’t think it'll happen anytime soon.

“I’m not going to go as far as the music just yet, but I do believe that they will speak,” she says. “Freda is angry, but life has to keep going.”

Empire airs on Fox Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET. 
For more with Bre-Z, read her Q&A below:

US: The scene in Wednesday's episode was so dramatic, especially to see it with you and Jamal, contrasting from the fun you had last season. How was it shooting that scene?
BZ: It was very emotional, it was very serious, it was very real. We both just focused on getting through it because I feel like that moment needed to be portrayed in the best light we possibly could. There wasn’t no time to play around. The story is highly anticipated — people want to know what’s going on between Freda and Jamal.

US: Do you think Freda has any idea how much pain Jamal is in?
BZ: I think it’s something she may think about, but I don’t think she really has a clue. Someone gets shot, it hurts — but I don’t think she understands how detrimental that was to him as a human being period.

US: Do you think that’s a product of how differently they were raised?
BZ: I think it could be, slightly, it could be, it could have something to do with that, but I think that Freda is still trying to wrap her head around what went on for her as well. So I feel like her mind just isn’t there, it’s not in that space to really think as such.





US: We see it from Jamal’s perspective, but she’s hurting too because of her dad.
BZ: Absolutely. You’ve got to look at everything she’s been through as well. She’s not there yet — she’s got a little bit of growing up to do before she can acknowledge certain things.
US: And then what’s really missing from this season is Freda's music — all my favorites from last season. Do you think we’ll get to hear her rap in prison?
BZ: I think we will because she’s got to give her side of things, she’s got to say something, and I think when she’s going through things — we all know that she portrays it best through her music, so I think we should in the near future.

US: I’m hopeful! And then the dynamic between Freda and Lucious was interesting last season — do you think we might see them speak? Reconcile? Record together?
BZ: Hmm, I’m not going to go as far as the music just yet, but I do believe that they will speak, I do believe they will speak at some point.

US: Do you ever throw ideas to the writers?
BZ: Oh, yeah, we all do! You go into the writers room, and you just talk, and they listen, bounce ideas, they might even ask, like, "What do you want to do this season?" It’s pretty cool.

US: Can you say when we’ll see you next?
BZ: No! Absolutely not. [The October 5 episode] was a good one, though.

He’s had it. Tyler Baltierra tells his wife, Catelynn Lowell, that he is nearing his breaking point when it comes to dealing with her depression in a preview for the Monday, September 10, episode of Teen Mom OG.
In the clip above, Baltierra, 24, enters his living room to find Lowell, 24 — with whom he shares daughter Novalee, 21 months — lying on the couch looking dismally at her cellphone.

The young dad asks Lowell what she’d like to do that day, to which she somberly replies, “There’s nothing to do around here.”


Baltierra — who supported Lowell’s decision to enter a monthlong Arizona-based treatment facility for mental health issues and marijuana use, as documented on TMOG — bluntly responds, “You know what? I am sick of hearing that. Is that phone interesting?”

Clearly hurt, the 16 and Pregnant alum tells her man to “quit it with the cockiness.”


However, Baltierra isn’t done: “You know what, Cate? You better figure something out to do. What do you want to do?”


Lowell continues to scroll through her phone and quietly says, “I don’t know.”

After her hubby encourages her to “think hard” about an activity that would get her on her feet and out of the house, she remains silent. But Baltierra doesn’t.


“The facility told me not to say nothing, so I’m not saying anything,” he says, to which Lowell demands, “Just say it!”

With her permission, Baltierra goes all in. “Well, I mean, I hope you wouldn’t let yourself go back to the way you were — your old patterns, behavioral patterns or whatever. However you, like, say it.”

Lowell listens and responds, “Panic attacks are always gonna happen. I can’t control that part of it.”

According to Baltierra, she missed the point. “Well, no. I’m not talking about the panic attacks. I’m talking about the repetitive behavior, walking through life like a log,” he says. “It’s more like a fear of even saying it out loud. Like, I can’t do this forever. There’s no way. Not like this.”
Baltierra then suggests that he isn’t afraid to call it quits with her if she is unable to change her ways. “I guess that would be a way of losing you, like, I guess, you know, if that ever happened,” he says in the sneak peek. “Like, listen, if you go into this thing again, I have to check out because I’ll get hardened. I’ll close everybody off. It’s safe that way.”

To see Lowell’s tearful reaction, watch the video above. Teen Mom OG airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

Goodbye, Gibson. Thomas Gibson barely appeared in his final episode of Criminal Minds, which aired on Wednesday, October 5, nearly two months after he was fired from the series.
Oddly enough, Gibson's last words were about taking a break from work. "I want you to take some time off, at least a week," his character, FBI special agent Aaron Hotchner, tells Jennifer “J.J." Jareau (A.J. Cook). "It’s not a request."
As previously reported, the Dharma & Greg alum, 54, was let go from the CBS series in August following a heated altercation with show writer Virgil Williams. He reportedly kicked Williams in the leg on set while the two men were arguing about an episode that Gibson was directing.



"There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement," Gibson said in a statement on August 11. "I regret that it occurred. We all want to work together as a team to make the best show possible. We always have and always will."
The outpouring of love and support is amazing and much appreciated by my family & me. Thanks to all!#bestfansintheworld #ThankfulThursday
After his firing, he released a statement about the matter to Us Weekly. "I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years. I had hoped to see it through to the end, but that won't be possible now," he said on August 12. "I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have."
Still, Gibson appears to be fighting back. On August 14, Us confirmed that the actor hired litigator Skip Miller to evaluate if he should sue the show's producers over their decision.
Gibson starred on Criminal Minds for 12 seasons, and has appeared on the crime drama since its debut in 2005. On Thursday, he gave a shout-out to his fans via Twitter. "The outpouring of love and support is amazing and much appreciated by my family & me. Thanks to all!" he wrote. "#bestfansintheworld #ThankfulThursday."

It's babies as far as the eye can see! Danielle and Adam Busby and their six kids — including the country's only set of all-female quintuplets — are back for the second season of TLC's unscripted series OutDaughtered, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal. Watch the trailer above!

The new batch of episodes premieres Tuesday, November 15, and focuses on the family's evolving life, with the quints — Riley, Ava, Olivia, Hazel and Parker — now able to walk, crawl and climb.

Season 2's highlights include the proud parents celebrating their 10-year anniversary, 5-year-old daughter Blayke starting kindergarten and the family planning for its first big getaway.

An exclusive sneak peek at the premiere features the couple realizing that their brood requires quite a bit of food, not all of which ends up in the babies' mouths.






"Adam, he heads out the door, and then it's go time the rest of the day," Danielle says in the clip about being home with the little ones. "It's just nonstop quint!"
"Everywhere is food to wipe, to clean, to mop, to vacuum," the beleaguered mom continues. "It's not just even the food — now there's babies everywhere, so when we take them out of their high chair, it's like, 'What food got left in their clothes that now is in the living room?' So, more to clean up."
Watch the adorable footage above.

The tribe may have spoken, but Paul Wachter has a few more words left in him.
Blindsided by his fellow Gen X castaways, Wachter, 52 — the oldest contestant on season 33 — was sent packing on the Wednesday, October 5, episode of Survivor, despite belonging to what he thought was a solid alliance of six.
(Reminder: His pack consisted of Bret LaBelle, Chris Hammons, Jessica Lewis, Lucy Huang and Sunday Burquest.)
“It’s humbling. I got my feelings hurt, but you can’t help it,” the Florida-based boat mechanic tells Us Weekly. “You’re sleeping, working and strategizing side by side. So when one of your very good friends turns on you, it’s totally unnecessary. We could have voted somebody else out and just had a conversation. But that’s not what happens in Survivor. You don’t get a second chance. You get one chance to be a schmuck and that’s what I did.”


While on the island, he clashed with some of his tribemates, including Ken McNickle. The model, 33, often called Wachter out for saying he would do a task and then not following through with it.
“Ken was on the bottom and he knew it,” admits Wachter. “He was pretty much going to say anything he had to to stay. There’s a reason the six of us were together and he was on the outs with David [Wright] and CeCe [Taylor]. Ken had his opportunity to be in the alliance many times. For some reason, he didn’t want to get involved.”
When it came down to it, Wachter and McNickle just couldn’t relate to each other. “We come from different worlds. He’s in a zen world and I’m in a right now, today world. He’s a tough guy to figure out,” Wachter says. “I don’t stand on the edge of the rock with a sun beaming behind me. That’s Ken’s job. He models.”

The rock singer shares more with Us.
Us Weekly: As the oldest player in the game, did you feel pressure to be the tribe’s leader?
Paul Wachter: No, you see people calling me the alpha male, but we had six of us that were type-A personalities. My personality is large, so people construe that as being a boss, but sometimes it bites you in the butt.
Us: Did stepping up hurt your game?
PW: No question about it. One of the things you shouldn’t do in Survivor is be the candle. You don’t want to be the flame. I was the flamethrower. Coming in as a leader is something I can’t change. It’s who I am. Other than not knowing when to shut up, because sometimes I should shut up, I don’t know if I could have done it differently. It’s hard to change your personality.

Us: You sat down with some of the millennials over lunch. What was your impression of them after talking to them?
PW: They’re great! They were anxious to ask me a million questions. I’m the old guy and they haven’t talked to a parent in a long time. They were like, “How do we sharpen our machete?” They’ve also gone through the same things as us. They had to be evacuated. They told me, “Right before we were evacuated, we were having a beach party instead of building our shelter!” [Laughs] They’re just kids. One of my biggest regrets was that I didn’t make it to the merge where I could hang out with the kids. I thought I could have aligned with them.
Us: What was your reaction when Taylor [Stocker] and Figgy [Jessica Figueroa] told you about their relationship?
PW: First thing we were told about was the showmance. I’ve never heard it called a showmance! It just shows you how old I am. [Laughs.] Survivor is challenging, fun, intriguing, but bottom line, you’re playing for a million dollars. They could have waited 39 days.

Us: In the immunity challenge, CeCe insisted on crossing the beam herself because she wanted to get her own work done. Do you think that Gen X mentality lost you the challenge?
PW: Come hell or high water, she was going to finish the challenge. Unfortunately, that was an individual decision and not a tribe decision. And she was in a tribe.  She’s glad she did it even though it cost us the challenge.
Us: You told Jessica that, if it came up, you would form an all-boys alliance. Do you regret that move?
PW: Obviously it was a mistake because it cost me the game. It came across like I had said, "Hey, I’ll cut you girls out in a minute." It’s what I said but it’s not what I meant. I thought it was way too early to be playing that worry game. We had a great six-person alliance. It seemed very simple to me. But I was wrong.
Us: Did you have any inkling that you were on the chopping block?
PW: No, no clue at all, because the guys had assured me over and over, 'cause they were convinced that the six of us were staying together.

Us: You were also the first castaway that needed medical assistance. Walk us through what happened when you collapsed and Dr. Joe said you may have had symptoms of a heart attack.
PW: Everybody was feeling weak. We had been through a lot. We had been evacuated, been through a full day and night of torrential rain and had rebuilt our camp twice. I got really dehydrated. Everything happened very quickly. I knew they wouldn’t let me die out there, but I knew I was in trouble. They had the medical team there immediately. They gave me electrolytes and what I needed to get me back on my feet. The next day, I was like Superman.

Us: Who is the biggest threat in the game?
PW: I’ll give you two. I think the biggest sleeper is David, and I think the biggest threat is Chris. David comes across as, "Oh, poor me!" and Chris has a very quiet confidence about him. You feel very comfortable with that guy. He’s very calculated in what he says and he’s a smart guy. He’s a good friend of mine.
Us: In the end, do you think a millennial or a Gen Xer will win?
PW: Gen X is going to win it. I just don’t think a millennial has what it takes to go all the way to the end. If I had to put my money on it, I think Chris and David have it.
Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X airs on CBS Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

Pick him, pick him! Christian Slater revealed during a Thursday, October 6, appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that he loves the idea of taking a permanent seat next to Kelly Ripa on Live with Kelly after her cohost Michael Strahan exited the show in May.
"I love it. I live about, you know, six blocks away from [the Live with Kelly studio],” the Mr. Robot star, 47, said, as seen in the clip above. "It's one of the greatest jobs ever, so yeah, Kelly, I'm available! Let's do it!"

Aside from convenience, Slater told Ellen DeGeneres that he wishes he could have the gig because he is so fond of Ripa, 46. “I love her,” he raved of his close pal. “She’s amazing.”

Asked if he would be able to juggle his role on Mr. Robot along with his potential duties as the next Strahan, Slater assured the 58-year-old talk show host that he could “absolutely handle both jobs.”





Slater — who has guest-hosted Live! multiple times — said that while he hasn’t been approached to appear on the daytime program full-time, he is “putting [his] hat in the ring, why not?”

As Us Weekly exclusively reported back in April, Ripa’s good friend Anderson Cooper was among her top picks to replace Strahan, 44. However, he is unable to take the job.



According to The Hollywood Reporter, Cooper, 49, can’t join Live! because he signed a new deal to remain at CNN as the host of the network’s primetime series Anderson Cooper 360.

"Look, I'm very happy at CNN,” he said during an April 28 appearance on Watch What Happens Live. “It would be a dream to work with Kelly, but nobody's offering anything, so … "
As previously reported, Ripa felt hurt and “blindsided” by Strahan’s departure from Live! to join Good Morning America this September, which was announced — without producers giving her much of a heads-up — back in April. The former NFL player ended his contract early as a result of the behind-the-scenes drama, leaving four months ahead of schedule on May 13.

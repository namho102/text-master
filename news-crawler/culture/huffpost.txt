You can find Miley Cyrus in Malibu. 
The former Disney star finally premiered her new single, “Malibu,” with an accompanying music video on Thursday. The song is off her forthcoming untitled album, which will be released later this year.
The catchy, country-inspired track signals a new and somewhat controversial direction for Cyrus, who significantly toned down her image since her “Bangerz” era.
The music video finds Cyrus in nature more than living up to her happy hippie moniker, skipping through tall grass, reveling in the sand oceanside and overlooking the dramatic cliffs of what looks like Malibu, California. 
“Malibu” is clearly inspired by her relationship with her now-fiancé, “Hunger Games” star Liam Hemsworth. The two recommitted to each other in January 2016 after a two-year separation. 
“But here I am, next to you / The sky’s more blue in Malibu / Next to you in Malibu,” she sings in the song’s chorus. 
Cyrus wrote the single while in transit on the way to her coaching gig on “The Voice” and had to stop herself from singing out loud.
“They’re going to talk about me if I come out of a restaurant with Liam,” Cyrus told Billboard in a wide-ranging interview. “So why not put the power back in my relationship and say, ‘This is how I feel?’”
Cyrus will make her debut performance of “Malibu” at the Billboard Music Awards on May 21.

Actress Chloe Grace Moretz, who lent her voice to the animated “Snow White” parody, “Red Shoes and the 7 Dwarfs,” had plenty to say Wednesday about the movie’s controversial marketing.
Cries of body-shaming erupted after an ad for the movie appeared at the Cannes Film Festival, featuring a thin Snow White next to a heavier version of herself. “What if Snow White was no longer beautiful and the 7 Dwarfs not so short?” the tagline read.
How did this get approved by an entire marketing team? Why is it okay to tell young kids being fat = ugly? 🤔😏@ChloeGMoretz pic.twitter.com/PVhgwluGTM
Moretz, who voices the fairy tale princess, apologized in a series of tweets Wednesday, saying she did not approve the ad and was fuming over it.
I have now fully reviewed the mkting for Red Shoes, I am just as appalled and angry as everyone else, this wasn't approved by me or my team
Pls know I have let the producers of the film know. I lent my voice to a beautiful script that I hope you will all see in its entirety https://t.co/IOIXYZTc3g
The actual story is powerful for young women and resonated with me. I am sorry for the offense that was beyond my creative control https://t.co/HZP2ydPCAX
The South Korean producers of the movie, animation studio Locus, scrapped the campaign.
“Our film, a family comedy, carries a message designed to challenge social prejudices related to standards of physical beauty in society by emphasizing the importance of inner beauty,” producer Sujin Hwang said in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. “We appreciate and are grateful for the constructive criticism of those who brought this to our attention. We sincerely regret any embarrassment or dissatisfaction this mistaken advertising has caused.”
The studio described the plot of “Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs” thusly: “After seven handsome princes are magically transformed into seven ugly dwarfs, they set out on a quest to break the curse by getting a kiss from the most beautiful princess in all the land.”
No release date has been set.

Adam West was my first hero. As a child, I used to rush home from elementary school so that I could binge watch back-to-back syndicated episodes of Batman. Irrespective of what troubled me during the day, watching West’s Batman invariably transported me to my happy place.
Much has been said (and debated) about the campier aspects of the show. But as a ten-year-old, I was oblivious to much of the show’s wild and farcical humor. To me, Batman was a straightforward, exciting adventure series about a brave, uncynical and resilient superhero. West’s Batman was the “Bright Knight,” an unconflicted and eternally optimistic champion of justice, with an unwavering sense of right and wrong.
My experience is not unique. Due to the show’s immediate and ongoing popularity, -- both during its original run in the Sixties and in ubiquitous reruns in subsequent decades -- generations of children have grown up enthralled by West’s Batman.
As I grew older, my admiration for West deepened and, in part, inspired me to write How to Be a Superhero, a book about superheroes and the actors who play them. One of my goals was to examine the intersection between the performer and the character they played. I also wanted to investigate how playing a superhero shaped the actor’s offscreen life. for good or ill Because Adam West’s personal life and career were inextricably linked to his compelling performance as Batman, it was essential to speak to him.
In our interview (a portion of which is reprinted here), West was self-deprecating, funny and candid about his experience playing the Caped Crusader. Adam West was a superhero Founding Father who paved the way for all the caped crusaders who followed him.
Would you say your initial thoughts on playing Batman were a combination of reluctance and hope?
I’d say that’s a pretty accurate statement of the mix. But I felt that I might be able to do something fresh with the character. Something a little different. I refused to do what was normally expected [in playing a superhero].
Did you think of Bruce Wayne and Batman as two separate characters?
Yes.
Can you talk a little bit about developing those two distinct personalities?
I’ll be frank, it’s difficult for me to talk about acting. But let me relate back to your first question. When I decide I want to do a part and I get curious and I start cooking with it, I just go in and do it. I don’t even think about it. Seriously. I developed the character as best as I could and I tried to bring something unique and fun to the part, and then I didn’t think about it.
In the beginning, I got a lot of criticism from people associated with the show. “Oh, he’s not as serious as he should be. He’s not as wooden as we thought he should be. We don’t want to see the twinkle behind the mask.”
In other words, they thought it would be better if my interpretation was more mundane. It occurred to me, creatively, that if something is mundane and ordinary that it might not be as interesting. It might not have a lasting impact.
Batman has to be a little bit bigger than life to instill fear in the villains.
Batman was bigger than life. No one runs around like that 24/7. He’d be locked up somewhere. In my case, I reasoned that if I played Batman with utter sincerity (in that he doesn’t think he is funny) and, occasionally, with a little wink to the audience, then I could be absurdly big with the character. Those characters became almost Shakespearean.
Did you have to justify why a man would put on the cape to fight crime?
You know, not really so much. I think much of my interpretation came from sense memory of playing Batman as a kid. And what happens instantaneously when you put on the cape and cowl. Because I was able to conjure that up with a little bit of thinking and cooking with it, it became an easy way for me to get into that absurd characterization. I’d put on the cowl and say to Burt, or myself “Come on, let’s go play Batman and Robin in my yard. Come on, it’s neat.” I knew that if I had the enthusiasm and a kind of a quirkiness that you had as a kid playing him, then it might work.
You’re saying that the costume does a lot of the work for you.
Oh my God, yes. Good observation. It certainly does. Especially if you use the cape and the cowl and move in a certain way, you can appear dynamic. Batman hardly ever stops moving. Bruce Wayne does. But not Batman. Batman is always moving in some manner, even if he is merely gesturing with his hand or swinging his cape around.
When kids play Batman, they are pretending to be you. But what’s interesting is that you were pretending to be them playing you. Did you allow yourself to feel powerful (as a kid would) in the costume?
You are very perceptive about this stuff.
That first day walking out of my dressing room and walking on the stage was tough. I thought, “Are they going to accept me in this silly costume as the real Batman?” I had to take a deep breath. I walked across the stage towards the crew and everyone turned and there’s wasn’t a sound. They just accepted me totally.
John Wesley Shipp who played The Flash on CBS in the early Nineties told me that he felt powerful in the costume and somewhat diminished out of it. Do you relate to that?
That was not my feeling. My feeling was probably more [in character than personal] that I felt diminished when I wore the costume — at least from Bruce Wayne’s point of view. Because as Bruce Wayne, I was faking something… It’s hard to explain….
No, I understand. It speaks to the question of who is the true identity: Batman or Bruce Wayne?
It became Batman. And not Bruce Wayne. Batman was part of all the true activity that counted and propelled the story — that is, unless you include the [1966 feature length] movie. In our movie, I had more of a chance to play Bruce Wayne.
Did you try different registers to develop the voice of Bruce Wayne?
I don’t think so. But I did develop different rhythms. But that came easily. Because he was desperately involved in what he was doing, Batman would have a different rhythm to his speech. It was easier for me to play absurd lines of dialogue when I said them with [a distinct] rhythm.
Do you know what I mean?
I do.
[He chuckled.] Good. Because I don’t.
Some actors have told me that playing these heroes has rubbed off on them in some way. Did Batman make his way into your life and vice versa?
I think so a bit. But it evolved so slowly. And it took me years to “sober up.” I feel that is it unavoidable. At least in my case I’ve sensed and seen it. Batman was a show that was geared to entire families to enjoy on different levels. But you do have a responsibility that evolves over a few years when everyone you meet thanks you, and when the kids are starry-eyed and grateful as you said you were. It’s certainly gotten to me. And I’d hate to disappoint families.
You are expected to hold the mantle and be a spokesman for this character in some way. Is that exhausting?
Yes, it is. But it paid well. And it continues. Of course, I’m joking. But it is a bit of a responsibility. But there is something selfish about it too. I was being turned down for more adult fare in more interesting work. I felt that I better embrace the thing that I created. Otherwise, I would have never have become an icon.
In your autobiography, you said that you were “married to the cape.” In every marriage, in every relationship there are ups and downs. How did you make peace with the idea that your relationship with this character was going to be a very long one?
I think it was a very simple deduction. I think any intelligent person would come to the same conclusion. And that is if I am being turned down for other roles because of my association with Batman, then maybe what I should do is really embrace Batman. Pursue it and keep it alive. Which is what I’ve been trying to do for thirty years.
How has playing the part changed you?
It’s made me an extremely rich man. [Laughs] Personally, the rewards have come from the fans. Wherever I go I am met with such warmth and humor.
Favorite Bat-merchandise?
The condoms.
[Laughing] Are there really Batman condoms?
No. [Laughing]
But there should be. Who would win in a fight; Your Batman or George Clooney’s?
I think it depends on the circumstances. It probably depends on the kind of battle. If it were to be a battle of charm, of course, Clooney would win.
I’d like to reiterate how grateful I am that you took the time to talk with me. I grew up on your show so this is a thrill for me.
Oh, no problem. You’re a man of quality. I can tell. You’ve been great.
One brainy beauty with a thousand-watt smile. Thirty-one strong-jawed suitors. It’s the 13th season of “The Bachelorette,” featuring Dallas attorney Rachel Lindsay’s journey to love.
This week, Rachel takes some frontrunners to tape “Ellen,” rides horses into Beverly Hills boutiques with Anthony, and watches some men mud-wrestle for her entertainment along with her old “Bachelor” gal pals. On the podcast, Claire Fallon, Emma Gray, and guest Vella Lovell also discuss Demario’s brief return, Lee’s major bigotry problem, and how “The Bachelorette” is handling the race issue so far:
 
 
Do people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows? It’s unclear. But here at “Here to Make Friends,” we both love and love to hate them — and we love to snarkily dissect each episode in vivid detail. Podcast edited by Nick Offenberg.

Much of America watched former FBI Director James Comey testify in front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on Thursday. Nielsen Media reported around 19.5 million watched on television, but millions more streamed the testimony online since it took place during the typical work day.
President Donald Trump was among those watching ― and he soon publicly addressed the various accusations Comey leveled against him.
“Comey was pretty rough on the president,” Stephen Colbert said “The Late Show” Friday night. “But right after the testimony, Trump sent his longtime personal lawyer and devil who has a thing he wants you to sign, Marc Kasowitz to respond.”
The host played a clip of the lawyer claiming that Comey’s testimony vindicated Trump, because in Kasowitz’s words, the former FBI director confirmed publicly what he had told Trump privately. This referred to Trump’s insistence that Comey had told him that he was not under investigation by the FBI.
As a quick refresher into this confusing mess: It is true that when Trump asked Comey whether he was personally under investigation, he was not. But Trump associates were under investigation and Comey’s testimony on Thursday indicated that Trump may be facing an investigation into whether the president obstructed justice.
This is where Kasowitz began an extremely frustrating contradiction, as Colbert explained.
“But even though, everything Comey said proved Trump wasn’t guilty, he was also a liar?” Colbert said.
He then played another part of the Kasowitz clip where the lawyer detailed the various ways Comey had allegedly lied during the testimony. 
This bizarre argument tracked with what the president later tweeted.
Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication...and WOW, Comey is a leaker!
During his testimony, Comey also called Trump a liar on multiple occasions.
It’s a classic he said, he said (American politics still being dominated by men, of course).
Now you’ve got to choose whether to believe the “Twin Peaks” character Agent Dale Cooper incarnate in Comey or... well... the apparent “liar in chief.”
President Donald Trump had an awkward moment on Friday when he left his own big executive order-signing moment without, you know, signing the executive orders. 
While Trump tried to leave, the scene quickly took a turn for the chaotic. A reporter tried to ask Trump about one of his tweets from earlier in the day about his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Vice President Mike Pence rushed over to the commander in chief before grabbing the unsigned executive orders and whisking them away. In a video, people can be heard confirming what they just saw.

After a report alleged that Eric Trump’s charity foundation funneled donations from a benefit golf tournament for pediatric cancer to the Trump Organization, Trevor Noah on Wednesday analyzed this apparent act of greed.
Eric Trump denies the allegations, but where could the second son of President Donald Trump have learned such “heartless” behavior, “The Daily Show” host asked.
OK, it doesn’t take a genius to figure that out, but it takes a comedian to bring it home.
“This is the curse of being one of Donald Trump’s children,” Noah said. “You can try and be good but he’ll be like, ‘No, no, no, don’t do that. You’re a Trump.’ And now Eric might as well be one of Trump’s buildings. He’s not as popular as he once was and if you look deep, you’ll find that he’s also empty on the inside.”
Ouch. Watch the full analysis above.
Celine Dion gave the crowd at Las Vegas’ The Colosseum at Caesars Palace quite the magical gift on Wednesday night. 
Canada’s national treasure performed “How Does a Moment Last Forever,” one of the new songs from Disney’s live-action remake of “Beauty and the Beast.” The performance marked the first time Dion sang the song live, and it was worth the wait. The song played through the end credits in the remake, though Kevin Kline’s Maurice sings it in the film. 
The 49-year-old, who seems to be in the middle of a career renaissance of sorts, began by telling the crowd she was “very nervous and very excited at the same time” to sing the song.  
“I was very fortunate to be a part of that magical movie, ‘Beauty and the Beast.’ And it was one of the biggest moments of my show business career,” she said, adding that she was “so thankful” for the opportunity. 
Dion’s connection to the Disney classic goes back 26 years, when she sang the title track (with Peabo Bryson) for the 1991 animated movie’s soundtrack. The song, which the chanteuse credits with putting her “on the map,” won an Academy Award.  
Check out her entire performance of “How Does a Moment Last Forever” in the video above, and relive the magic of the original title track, below:

Forget what you know about Pamela Anderson the “Baywatch” star because it’s time to get acquainted with Pamela Anderson the political poet. 
The Canadian-American actress and model has done everything from Playboy to PETA to “V.I.P” and back again, so it was probably only a matter of time before she turned her attention to the White House. 
Amid rumors that she is dating Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, Anderson shared what can best be described as a slightly erotic and unintentionally hilarious poem about President Donald Trump and the state of the free world. 
Titled “I Like How You Resist Me,” the post touches on everything from Assange seeking asylum status to a “threesome” between the U.S., the U.K. and France. She also has a few tips for Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May.
“I may have some advice for Trump and May on special relationships ― based on my own special relationship with Julian Assange,” she wrote. “Regarding Free Speech and Democracy ... France can join in as a threesome.”
Her goal? To bring an end to war and human rights abuses, which in her own words is far from “strong or sexy.”
Amen, Pamela. 
Read the entire post below. 
I may have some advice for Trump and May on special relationships-
based on my own special relationship with Julian Assange
Regarding Free Speech and Democracy. 
France can join in as a threesome.
A fast approaching UK election, 
heated up US threats, 
and the French - makes this the opportune time to discuss politics romantically. 
It is a romantic struggle 
Things that the USA and UK bring to the relationship are Bad secrecy laws. Keeping Julian illegally detained. Hating transparency and Bombing countries.
It is dysfunctional and unequal, this relationship to date. 
I wish to help them to improve it,
and make it work. 
And, bring sexy back.
Just as a dysfunctional lover-
The USA has been spying on UK(reading emails and listening to calls).
All this, that the USA does is as a freakish lover or stalker would. 
My recommendations are;
Keep things separate as in a good relationship: 
The UK should have an independent foreign policy not based on a special relationship-
so, 
the UK and USA relationship would be based on a fundamental reconfiguration of domestic politics, and their relationship with the rest of the world.
They then should disarm and withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and other overseas military engagements, and pursue a peaceful and cooperative diplomatic relationship with other countries.
Create a bilateral extradition treaty between them, it should at least appear as if it is between two equal westphalian state entities, rather than between a lord and vassal (or dominant and submissive partner).
It is completely disproportionate and has asymmetrical evidentiary standards.
If disarming and withdrawing from Afghanistan seems too ‘out there’.
Another dynamic approach is to
encourage other countries to reduce their quantise of arms: “If you will, I will”. 
Or: 
Agree with other countries to stop arming and destabilising the Middle East. 
War is a racket. 
Subordinating safety and human rights to the profit motives of arms exporters is not strong, or sexy.
Other relationship issues to work on jointly: 
Openness and honesty are a must in any relationship. 
So, need to get rid of approaching everything with secrecy and cover up. 
Stop abusing espionage and secrecy laws. 
Can’t stop? 
Then get rid of them -
and replace them with laws 
that can’t be abused.
Stop shouting and punishing people who offer them help (as if a couple would turn against a relationship counsellor?) - Julian is trying to help. 
And, if their relationship is improved, they can expand it. Diplomatic relations with other countries should be in the spirit of mutual respect
Not haughty superiority. 
Such as we saw in the threats to invade the embassy in violation of the Vienna convention. Or the refusal to comply with the UN ruling.  A healthy relationship is reciprocal and has a single standard for behaviour.
Not a double standard, 
where Britain gets to call out other countries for defying UN findings- but blow them off when they are against the UK. 
I can’t help but think romantically. 
That is where my compass lays. In love and compassion. 
To apply common sense relationship advice might be the key. 
We must not forget how to make love... 
But, war.
No more war! 
And no walls! (around countries or embassies).
I will stay relentlessly engaged.
Like it or not

Country music legend Willie Nelson has some advice for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said marijuana is only “slightly less awful” than heroin.
Nelson, a longtime advocate for legal pot, told Rolling Stone: 
“I wonder if he’s tried both of them. I don’t think you can really make a statement like that unless you tried it all. So I’d like to suggest to Jeff to try it and then let me know later if he thinks he’s still telling the truth!”
The 84-year-old County Music Hall of Famer has his own brand of marijuana, Willie’s Reserve, for sale where it’s legal and often speaks highly of his own personal experiences with the drug.
Rolling Stone asked if there’s been a downside to his own habit. 
“I haven’t run into any yet,” he said. “I guess if you go somewhere where it’s illegal, that’s a pretty good downside.”
Police have arrested the singer several times for marijuana-related offenses.
Nelson also shared his thoughts on President Donald Trump.
“I knew him back when he owned some casinos, and I worked for him,” Nelson told the magazine. “He always paid me. I had no problems at all.”
However, Nelson said Trump has “stepped into a different world” from the one he’s used to. 
“Like he said this morning, ‘I had no idea this job was going to be this hard,’” Nelson said. “It’s easy when you can just go bankrupt anytime you want to and say, ‘I’ll check you later.’ But that’s hard to do when you’re president of the United States.”
Nelson said he’s come close to running for office himself, “and then I sobered up.”
Read the full interview here. 
Nelson’s 61st studio album, “God’s Problem Child,” was released last month to largely favorable reviews, with a 79 average on Metacritic. The album, which features the song “Still Not Dead,” topped the Billboard country music charts earlier this month.

Vanessa lived out your teenage dream by singing and dancing her way to Zac Efron’s heart in “High School Musical.” Now, she’s all grown up, with a new TV show to boot. We chatted with Vanessa about her style, her musical theater obsession, and her teenage crush. Hint: his name might sound familiar. 
What was your dream role growing up?
The first musical I ever saw was “West Side Story,” and I fell in love with Natalie Wood. I feel like that’s kind of what ignited the flame for musical theater love. I just fell in love with it and couldn’t get enough.
What was your favorite memory as a teenager?
Flying around with the cast of “High School Musical” in a private jet. We were doing a press tour and it was so much fun. Ashley [Tisdale] and I were such girls, giggling and dancing around this jet. We thought we were ballers!
Let’s talk about your TV show “Powerless.” What’s your favorite part about being on the show?
Just working with a bunch of comedians. They’re all very smart people, but they also keep me laughing all the time. I fell in love with my whole cast. We finished filming the show and I already miss them dearly.
What is one piece of advice you would give your younger fans?
Work hard. I think that it’s really easy nowadays to lose focus and have a short attention span. You have to stay really dedicated to your work and to growing and to learning. Stay committed!
What’s the best beauty advice you ever got?
Drink water. I feel like if you don’t have good skin, it’s really hard to make your makeup play well on top of it. Drinking a lot of water just keeps your skin clear and hydrated.
From “Gigi” to “Grease: Live,” you’ve been killing it with musicals. Do you have any upcoming Broadway projects?
For me it’s always about the project. So whenever the right project comes along, I’ll be there!
Your style is so fun and fresh, especially when you hit up Coachella. Who inspires you? 
Bianca Jagger. I love the ‘70s, and she did ‘70s chic better than anyone else.
What’s one song you can’t get enough of these days? 
“HUMBLE” by Kendrick Lamar.
Who was your celebrity crush you were a teenager? 
Probably my boyfriend at the time. So Zac Efron!
If you could have any superpower, what would it be? 
Teleportation. Then I would never have to deal with airports, and I could see the world.
What’s the last TV show you binge watched? 
The second season of “Love” on Netflix. It’s SO good!
What’s your guilty pleasure snack? 
Hot Cheetos. I love Hot Cheetos so much.
What was your favorite “High School Musical” moment?
It was from “High School Musical 3: Senior Year.” It was the last moment of the movie where we were all at graduation. We turn around and lift our hands up and the curtain closes. It was just so symbolic. We were all so emotional and we couldn’t stop hugging each other. It was just such a beautiful moment.
What’s your favorite “High School Musical” song?
“We’re All in This Together” or “Breaking Free.”
What’s one outside project that your passionate about right now?
One outside project that I’m really passionate about is my partnership with EcoTools. They’re launching this mobile tour, the #MyTrueBeatutyCampaign, and it’s all about taking the intimidation out of makeup and lifting each other up as women, which i think is so important. When you look good you feel good and there’s nothing more powerful or beautiful than a confident woman.
Have you ever met another celebrity and felt truly starstruck? 
Meryl Streep. I freaked out. We were both on “Ellen.” I went up to her and talked to her and she was so sweet ― exactly the woman I would want her to be. I love her.
If you could have dinner with any three celebrities, dead or alive, who would it be? 
Natalie Wood, Audrey Hepburn and James Dean.
What’s your favorite thing about your boyfriend Austin Butler? 
Everything.
Are you a morning person or a night person? 
I’m a morning person. I love being awake before everyone else so I can get a head start on my day.

As host of Spike TV’s “Lip Sync Battle,” LL Cool J has seen his fair share of celebrities duke it out on the show. Among his favorites have been Mike Tyson, Shaquille O’Neal and Channing Tatum. 
But there are still a couple of big names he’d love to see on the hit series ― and these ones may surprise you.
“For some reason, for me, my dream battle is all the politicians. Like John McCain versus George W. Bush or Bill Clinton versus George W. Bush,” LL Cool J told HuffPost on Build Series.
He also noted how he’d love to see former President Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, battle it out. 
“Obama versus Michelle would be amazing,” he said, before making a plea to the couple to join. After all, they have been spotted recently enjoying life outside the White House.
“Guys, you’re in private life now. Yachts. You’re having fun. Life is great. You’re watching this, you’re laughing. Come on and do the show! Can you imagine Obama doing Busta Rhymes?” LL Cool J said before breaking into Busta’s hit “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See.”  
He admits he’d feel too self-conscious if the Obamas took on one of his own hits. But when an audience member suggested the Obamas perform his 1996 hit “Doin’ It,” LL Cool J laughed just thinking about it, saying, “’Doin’ It’ would be crazy.” 
If the Obamas did end up gracing the “Lip Sync Battle” stage, they’d get the chance to pick their own songs to perform. 
“Most people assume they have to rehearse for weeks and weeks. But they don’t. We have a great choreographer. The celebrity would call up and say, ‘Hey, these are the songs I like.’ It’s up to them,” he said. “They choose their own songs. We can make suggestions to them if they want us to. But it’s up to them. Like, ‘I’d like to float on a chariot’ or ‘I’d like to ride a white horse.’ Whatever your idea is, we say, ‘OK.’ Then we tell the choreographer and she whips up a version of their idea. And they come and watch it. And they can jump in and learn the dance if they want, be a part of the dancing, or they can play the front and let the dancers do the back. So we make it easy … so they can have fun.”
Not only that, but LL Cool J says they have a great studio where the celebrities can hang out. Across three stages is an open bar, along with ice cream machines and expresso machines, and other fun treats. 
“It’s crazy,” he said. “It’s like a whole world out there.”
Not too shabby. Obamas, we hope you’re listening. 
“Lip Sync Battle,” now in its third season, airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on Spike. 
Actor Tom Cruise confirmed Tuesday that “Top Gun 2” is “definitely happening.”
“It’s true. It’s true,” he told Australian morning show “Sunrise.” “I’m going to start filming it probably in the next year. I know. It’s happening. It is definitely happening, you’re the first people that I’ve said this to.”
But with few details on what the sequel to the hit 1986 movie will be about, Twitter users have been busy imagining a whole host of possible plot lines.
Some have suggested that the follow-up film could focus on drone strikes, while others have mockinglyasked how it will deal with the ageing of its stars some 30 years on.
Here’s a sampling of the best plot ideas so far:
@nktpnd Top Gun 2 mainly just takes place in the Pentagon trying to figure out why the F-35 is so behind schedule
Top Gun 2 is officially happening.Premise: Tom Cruise battles rude United Airlines flight attendants on a cross country flight.
Top Gun 2 is officially in the works. Get ready for the sweatiest, sexiest game of shuffleboard EVER.

Top Gun 2: Bottom Gun
You do know Top Gun 2 is just a series of endless ready to fly program meetings in which cost overruns and delivery slips are reported.
Top Gun 2 will be about Pete Mitchell breaking all the rules and then waiting on paperwork to clear to get DoD travel reimbursements.
"Top Gun 2" is happening and I just have one request... pic.twitter.com/1345ICZduF
Top Gun 2 is just three hours of maverick sitting in a windowless room staring at a monitor showing the feed from a drone camera
Top Gun 2: Tom Cruise is now a teacher at Top Gun school and all the students are drones. he's the only actor in the movie
Top Gun 2 should essentially be Grumpy Old Men with drones.
I heard in Top Gun 2 they give that lady's breath back
Top Gun 2 is about Maverick returning to the Navy because he's the only one who can get an old version of powerpoint to work.
Top Gun 2 is going to be 180 minutes of Tom Cruise sitting on a runway while his F-35A's code debugs until a $1000 drone explodes on him.
I've said it before: Tom Cruise is the Tom Skerritt/mentor for Goose's kid. "I flew with your old man. Damn good pilot." Iceman is a slob

This is a super-powered relief.
Following the critical failures of “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Suicide Squad,” things weren’t looking good for the next installment in the DC Extended Universe, “Wonder Woman.”
Yeah, the trailers looked great, but remember how beloved the “Suicide Squad” trailer was? A lackluster movie can ruin a great trailer pretty fast. Claims from a supposed insider that the “Wonder Woman” movie was a “mess,” which director Patty Jenkins refuted, also didn’t help things.
But according to the initial social media reactions, Jenkins was right. 
(Brush those haters off.) 
“Wonder Woman” won’t be out for a couple more weeks, but critics’ first reactions to the movie are in, and they’re “fantastic.” They’ve called the movie “surprisingly good,” “absolutely empowering” and recounted stories of young girls at the screening emphatically saying, “YES!” (Aw!)
Wonder Woman herself, actress Gal Gadot, is also earning a lot of praise, being called a “legit movie star” and “perfect” in the role. 
These reactions are a big win for fans of the comic character, for Warner Bros. and for young kids who can soon see a female superhero do what the guys recently couldn’t: kick butt and make a great DC movie. 

Lawrence O’Donnell, host of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” has just four weeks left in his contract, and the cable network does not appear to be interested in renewing his deal. Four well-placed sources tell HuffPost that MSNBC has not been in contact with O’Donnell’s team of representatives to negotiate a new deal.
The absence of active negotiations weeks before a contract expires is highly unusual and often a sign that a contract won’t be renewed. News networks normally don’t risk letting the contract of a host who has a highly rated program expire or even come close to expiring before renegotiating. A short time-frame puts the network at a strategic disadvantage in talks, that’s why cable networks often start negotiating renewals six to nine months in advance of a contract ending. 
A spokesman for NBC News declined to comment on “ongoing negotiations.” Although, multiple sources from inside and outside the network have told HuffPost that no negotiations have taken place.  
O’Donnell, who has been appearing on the network since its inception, has hosted his highly rated program since the fall of 2010. “The Last Word” is the cable network’s second-highest rated program, according to Nielsen figures, behind only “The Rachel Maddow Show.”
O’Donnell has even been, on some nights, besting Sean Hannity’s program on Fox News among viewers ages 18 to 49, the demographic that television advertisers care about the most.
If O’Donnell’s contract is not renewed, that would not come as a surprise to many network insiders. Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News, is no fan of O’Donnell’s program, sources say. Some say it’s because he doesn’t appreciate the liberal nature of “The Last Word,” but others say it’s about the fact that O’Donnell rejected Lack’s request to move his program from 10 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time. This decision was O’Donnell’s prerogative, two sources said, because his contract stipulates that his program must air in prime time. 
O’Donnell’s refusal to move his program could have led Lack, who is known to bristle at dissent, to sour on O’Donnell, sources said. A senior NBC News executive disagreed with the idea that Lack isn’t a fan of O’Donnell’s show saying, “He is proud of and enthusiastic about all the work that’s being done across all of MSNBC’s primetime slate, including Lawrence’s program.”
There does appear to be some evidence of Lack’s distaste. O’Donnell has not had a face-to-face meeting with him since Lack returned to the network in 2015 after stints at Sony Music and Bloomberg Television, two sources said.
A senior NBC news executive said that Lack doesn’t take a heavy-handed approach with the cable network’s on-air talent and that frequent face-to-face meetings are often a sign that he isn’t satisfied. Sources familiar with the production of “The Last Word” say that Lack doesn’t interfere with the program’s editorial direction. And in Lack’s previous stint as NBC News president he was the one that pushed for O’Donnell to appear on the then nascent cable MSNBC network when it was founded in 1996. 
Lack’s programming decisions and leadership style have caused tension internally at MSNBC leading staff members and on-air talent to express their displeasure internally and externally. For this story, HuffPost spoke to more than 10 sources inside and outside the network who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak publicly about network business.
If O’Donnell’s contract is not renewed, the news would certainly be welcome to President Donald Trump, who has had a long-running feud with O’Donnell.
In 2011, O’Donnell called on NBC to fire Trump, then the host and executive producer of “The Celebrity Apprentice,” for pushing his racist and inaccurate “birther” conspiracy against President Barack Obama. In 2015, he also claimed that Trump was lying about his wealth. Trump threatened to sue O’Donnell for making false statements but never followed through on his threat (which O’Donnell had predicted). 
According to three sources, Trump has pressured MSNBC President Phil Griffin to fire O’Donnell on multiple occasions. Griffin alluded to Trump’s push for O’Donnell’s ouster in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter last month, saying, “[Trump] started calling me all the time in 2011 to say Lawrence O’Donnell was a ‘third-rate’ anchor.”  Griffin and O’Donnell enjoy a cordial relationship but Griffin’s power as the President of MSNBC has been diminished by Lack since he returned in 2015. As a result, Lack will be the one to decide whether O’Donnell stays and under what terms.  
There is a fear, among some at MSNBC, that Lack is making programming decisions in an effort to appease the Trump administration (an accusation that has been made of CNN and Fox News), which may lead to more access to the White House and in turn, conservative viewers. 
A senior NBC News executive pushed back on this claim. “Is he bringing in more voices from all over the political spectrum? Yes. But that’s to make better programming and more informed analysis. We don’t do things to appease people in power. We hold them accountable.”
It’s unclear who would replace O’Donnell if MSNBC declines to renew his contract. Multiple sources have told HuffPost that Brian Williams, whose program, “The 11th Hour,” is on MSNBC at 11 p.m. Eastern, has been eager to have an earlier start in the evening schedule. 
If MSNBC failed to renew O’Donnell’s contract, it would be unprecedented, given his high ratings, but multiple sources tell HuffPost that Lack attributes O’Donnell’s high-ratings to heightened interest in Trump and the fact that his program’s lead-in is the top-rated Rachel Maddow show, and doesn’t credit O’Donnell’s star power and fan base for the high-ratings. Despite this, Lack is said to dislike when people attribute his cable network’s blockbuster ratings to Trump: He believes, according to multiple sources, that the high ratings are largely a product of his programming decisions. 
A senior NBC News executive disputes both of these characterizations saying that Lack believes ratings success is more nuanced than attributing it to one or two factors. “He considers prime time to be the “op-ed section” of the cable news network, and believes MSNBC is on top right now because it has the smartest, most insightful and most dynamic opinion hosts in the business,” the executive said.
O’Donnell is not giving up on what appears to be his quest to stay at MSNBC. On May 3, he tweeted about “The Last Word” program beating Hannity in the ratings. “We need audience support now more than ever,” O’Donnell replied. “So thanks again.” 
Friday night, he sent another Twitter message about his rankings. “Last night @maddow was #1 rated show in all of cable tv, not just cable news. @TheLastWord was #2,” he wrote. “Thanks for your support. We need it.”
Last night @maddow was #1 rated show in all of cable tv, not just cable news. @TheLastWord was #2. Thanks for your support. We need it.
WATCH: @MatthewPerry talks about 'FRIENDS' and his all-time favorite Chandler Bing one-liner! pic.twitter.com/lEPqAbj1JE
Matthew Perry played Chandler Bing on “Friends” for 10 seasons. That works out to more than 200 episodes that he played the overly-sarcastic character, who regularly spit out zingy one-liners.
With so much material to choose from, if you thought narrowing down a favorite would prove to be an impossible feat for the actor, well, guess again. 
On Thursday, the 47-year-old actor appeared on “Good Morning America,” where he was promoting his new mini-series, “The Kennedys After Camelot,” and revealed his all-time favorite “Friends” one-liner to the show’s hosts.
It turns out, Perry’s fave comes from Season 2’s “The One with Ross’ New Girlfriend,” during which Chandler is talking to Joey (Matt LeBlanc) about his longtime tailor. 
“You should go see Frankie, my family’s been going to him forever,” Joey tells Chandler in the clip. “He did my first suit when I was 15... No, wait, 16. No, excuse me, 15. When was 1990?”
Chandler responds: “OK, you have to stop the Q-tip when there’s resistance!”
There might be some other one-liners that Perry actually likes better, though, because in January 2016 the actor revealed that due to his struggle with drug addiction while he was on the sitcom, he doesn’t remember filming about three seasons worth of the show.
“Oh, my goodness,” he said, when asked about his least favorite “Friends” episode. “I think the answer is, I don’t remember three years of it. So none of those ... somewhere between Season 3 and 6.”

Having just concluded a season that produced banner ratings, “Saturday Night Live” remains a political firebrand unlike any other institution. Forty-two years into its existence, the sketch-comedy staple has benefitted from the divisive election of Donald Trump, even after the show’s controversial choice to have him host an episode mid-campaign. 
Of course, current-events fodder has always been a key part of the “SNL” brand. What’s changed is the speed at which news travels and the country’s temperament toward establishments of power.
Two writers ―Tim Herlihy (1993-2000) and Bryan Tucker (2005-present) ― are scheduled to discuss the staff’s creative process during a panel at this week’s Greenwich International Film Festival. Ahead of the event, HuffPost hopped on the phone with each to reflect on their tenures at the show and what it was like to write during different presidential elections. Below are the highlights, edited for length and clarity.
Tim Herlihy, an “SNL” writer during the 1996 and 2000 presidential elections: There is no overarching planning. There were never any meetings like, “How are we going to tackle this?” Basically it was pretty simple. We had Phil Hartman playing Bill Clinton as an insincere philanderer. We didn’t get into the weeds on welfare reform or anything like that. It was a classic, great, Ted Baxter–level character. And then when Darrell Hammond took over the role, he did it a different way. He’s such a great mimic and works so hard and really wants to make it uncanny, but he does have that same go-for-the-gusto that Phil had. And then with Bob Dole, it was very much organic in terms of what Norm Macdonald came up with, and he basically did “cranky old man.” We found infinite entertaining varieties of the insincere philanderer versus the cranky old man, and people loved it.
Bryan Tucker, an “SNL” writer during the 2008, 2012 and 2016 presidential elections: There’s very little pre-planned strategy about the whole thing. There’s not necessarily a meeting where we say we need to tackle these kinds of subjects. I guess we all understand that each election year is going to be important for “SNL” because that’s one time where the whole country is watching the same thing, and if we can parody that thing, then we can gain an audience and gain a lot of traction from that. This election was just exceptional because so many people were paying attention to it, and because passions were so deep and there were just a lot of characters, specifically Donald Trump being the biggest character of them all. I think we got a taste of Trump last season in the primaries when we had Darrell Hammond and Taran Killam playing him. But over the summer, it was understood that this was going to be more watched and more people would care about it than in previous elections. I think that was Lorne Michaels’ motivation in asking Alec Baldwin to consider it. We wanted to open the season with a big splash, but there was an instinct, specifically by Lorne, that Alec had the right temperament and knew how to play that kind of character in a funny way.
TH: We’ve had presidential candidates on many times. Donald Trump hosted a year before the election. He was technically a candidate, but he was a joke candidate. I wasn’t there and I didn’t see the whole show, but I assume it was sort of like the times he hosted before. He’s a public figure, and nobody thought there was a prayer of him being elected at that point. If we had had somebody host the show after they’d already received the nomination, I would think that would be extraordinarily strange, more for the candidate than for us, because we’re going to try to get them to do crazy stuff, and normally a candidate doesn’t want to do anything that could potentially get them in trouble. I worked with politicians there, and the difference between the ones who were up for election and the ones who were either retired or in safe seats, in terms of their whole outlook, was tremendous.
BT: Oh, man. It’s so loaded. One thing that struck me was, when other candidates come to the show, like Hillary Clinton or John McCain or Al Gore or Mike Huckabee, they bring at least one — and sometimes two or three — other people to talk to us and vet the material that we give them. Trump came alone. He had a BlackBerry and he had his security guy outside the door, and that’s about all. When we would present him an idea, he would just go from his gut and say, “I like that” or “I don’t like that.” Sometimes we could persuade him. Sometimes he would lean out of the door and ask his security guy, “Do you think this is funny? Do you think this is a good idea?” But that was, to me, an insight into him that I hadn’t gotten before: He really makes decisions by himself, and although he had people he was talking to throughout the week, there was very little back-and-forth with other people.
BT: We did do a dress-rehearsal sketch where he was the Giving Tree, and the Giving Tree was giving fruit to a boy. And eventually the Giving Tree got completely chopped down and was a stump, and Trump was a neighboring tree saying, “You’re a sucker, you’re getting played, you should not be giving things to these people.” And Trump had to stand in a tree with his face looking out of the hole of this tree, and he did not like that. I don’t think he enjoyed looking like a tree. He was not into it and it showed, and it did not get a lot of laughs.
TH: I feel bad for the guys today because it felt like when we were doing it, the Dole-Clinton election seemed to be not terribly contentious. In retrospect, Bush-Gore ― before the ending, obviously ― was certainly not as crazy polarizing and contentious as this. But we never felt that we handled it a certain way. Lorne definitely wanted to do a political sketch every week during the season, or definitely felt like we should make a comment, but it didn’t have to dominate the show. And it wasn’t demanded — maybe a little during the Monica Lewinsky thing, but it didn’t feel like, “You better show us your stuff!” It felt like that started with Sarah Palin. Now, if they did a Trump-less show, people would go bananas. That’s a lot of pressure to have [political material]. I don’t know how this relates to “SNL,” but Jimmy Fallon seemed to get in trouble because he wasn’t mean enough to Trump. And the fact that you now have to worry about that, too — you have to make fun of with a certain viewpoint — it just seems like the fact that they pulled off a great, historically rated season is incredible.
BT: When someone’s a candidate, we try our best to parody both sides because we understand that both sides have a shot to win, especially this year. We spent a lot of time and effort trying to develop Hillary Clinton, and Kate McKinnon was a huge part of that. Looking at the polls, we assumed she was going to win, so we had planned for that character to be around for a while. But once the candidate is elected, in this case Trump, there’s very little attention paid to the opposition. You know, we don’t see Chuck Schumer in the news nearly as much. Once that person is in charge, and once that person is the voice of authority for our country, one of our jobs is to poke fun at authority. When he’s inaugurated, it opens up how much we might want to take shots at that person. Before, we’re trying to be a big tent. Our show is always trying to be a big tent, but before, we’re making a very concerned effort to parody both sides because America is paying attention so much to both sides. But afterwards, when one side has so much power and one side has so little, we go after the people who have that power. We punch up.
TH: I’ve always thought — and I learned this early on, not just with “SNL,” but with my film work — you gotta do your thing. You can’t chase an audience. You look at Colbert and Jimmy Fallon, and you see, well, Jimmy’s winning with the good demographics but Colbert has the overall rating and seems like he’s better approved of on Twitter. It’s just so complicated at this point, and there’s so many types of winning that even if you wanted to be someone who rode the trends and did all the right things and pushed all the right buttons, it’s too complicated. It forces you to be true to yourself.
BT: I think “SNL” is a little more attuned to racial and cultural issues, but that’s more of a reflection of the whole country. I just think America, and entertainment in general, is becoming more like that. I’m not sure we could have done it when I first started, but I wrote for Dave Chapelle and Chris Rock, and those are the kinds of things I gravitate to. In my first year, I would write Kenan-as-Al-Sharpton sketches. Those would get on here and there, and that was gratifying because I’m not sure a lot of white America knew Al Sharpton. But I do think, in general, the country ― and our show, as well ― has been a little bit cognizant of presenting those diverse viewpoints.
BT: It was super gratifying because I think the show came out really well. It was an incredibly hard week because that was the week of the election. Our normal writing night is Tuesday night — that’s when everything gets written for the show, and we pick things on Wednesday. So Tuesday night, everyone was looking at the election, and not only were we distracted — I think a lot of us were stunned with the result, and then Wednesday a lot of people weren’t feeling very funny. As a result, a lot of the things that were read were not very good, frankly. That was disappointing because Chapelle had made this huge risk and huge commitment. He hadn’t been on mainstream television in 10 years. On Wednesday, after all our sketches were read, we felt pretty bad. But we spent the next two or three days rewriting. That election-night sketch was rewritten several times to reflect people’s moods. And eventually we pulled out what I think is one of our better shows of the season. The dress rehearsal was not great. One of the great things about “SNL” is you can write and rewrite and rewrite up until the last minute, and luckily things all came together, which was really nice. Chapelle had come a few weeks prior, and I was one of the few friendly faces he knew because I had written for “Chapelle’s Show.” I told him personally, “We’ll do everything we can to make this show great, and I will work very hard to make sure we write things that are in your voice.” I was very gratified when he went out and did that killer monologue, which he wrote all himself. We had other pieces in the show that also felt like him, and also did really well, and reflected the mood of the country that week.  
For two consecutive weeks on “The Bachelorette,” audiences have suffered through a bewildering and deeply uninteresting feud between contestants Lucas and Blake E.
Coming on the show, it appeared Lucas planned to endear himself to Rachel Lindsay through yodels of “Whaboom!” and other rejected Jim Carrey bits, while Blake E. aimed to woo her with his aspirations of drumming and his sexual genius. As it transpired, the two had a troubled history that pre-dated the show, which Blake repeatedly and ineptly attempted to explain to Rachel and the other guys. (In summary, he and Lucas appeared together on a reality show called “Ex-Isle,” and then he was roommates with Lucas’s ex-girlfriend, because of course.)
Lucas attempted to save himself during the cocktail party that began this week’s episode, suggesting to Rachel that Blake had slandered him because he “has a crush” on him. As evidence, he presented the following ludicrous scenario:
Rachel took it to Blake, who had a calm and rational response: Do I look like a guy who’d eat a banana over a sleeping man’s bed? I’m on a carb-free diet. 
Fortunately for us all, Rachel’s patience finally ran out on this less-than-dynamic duo. Both contestants were eliminated during the ensuing rose ceremony ― teeing up the two gentlemen for their one moment of glory. Perhaps for the first time ever, two feuding suitors left the mansion together and treated us all to a massively douchey bro fight on the way out.
It began when Blake wandered over to Lucas’s exit interview taping to salute him with a hearty “fuck you,” but somehow the situation managed to devolve from that very low point. Accusing Lucas of dragging him down and ruining his chances with Rachel, Blake attempted to drop the mic with, “I’m going home. You win, Lucas.” 
“It’s not about winning,” Lucas shot back. “It’s about the world, brother. And you have no idea what the world needs.” Blake didn’t stand for that, rejoining,“You’re the ‘whaboom’ clown. I’m the nice gentleman.” (Note: That is a false binary, especially on “The Bachelorette.”)
Everyone in my life: Why are you still single??Watch this video of 2 single "men" and then we'll talk... #TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/GVc7YQqGkm
Perhaps because of their longer acquaintance, the barbs soon got uncomfortably real for “The Bachelorette,” as Blake taunted Lucas as a washed-up, failed comedian, and Lucas told Blake to “go back to his protein shakes.... Get back to your garbage, clown life.”

The motto for tonight is: Boy Bye #TheBachelorette
Before Tituss Burgess sang about Pinot Noir on Netflix’s “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” he was singing “Under the Sea” as Sebastian in Broadway’s “The Little Mermaid.”
And although his costume from the 2007 play looks like something his current character Titus Andromedon would wear to a casual Sunday brunch, he never felt like his role as a talking crab really suited him.
“And while I was playing Sebastian, I was like, ‘I’m playing the wrong role,’” he told an audience Saturday at New York Magazine’s Vulture Festival.  “I went to the producers when I was getting ready to leave the show to see if they would let me audition for this other role that I should have been playing. And they said no.”
That role? It was Ursula. And sea witch, please — he really should have played her.
Why?
Just watch his cover of “Poor Unfortunate Souls” in the clip below.
Here’s hoping he’ll be cast in the role he was meant to play in ABC’s “The Little Mermaid” live musical, which will air this fall.

Andrea Constand testified Tuesday about the night in 2004 she says actor Bill Cosby inappropriately touched her after giving her three pills. 
Cosby, 79, is on trial for aggravated indecent assault. He’s denied attacking the former Temple University employee in his home outside of Philadelphia, claiming they had a consensual sexual relationship. Constand said the actor served as her mentor and invited her to his home to discuss her career.
Constand, 44, had never spoken publicly about the incident before. She described being unable to resist Cosby that night after complaining to him that the unidentified pills had made her disoriented. 
‘I wanted him to stop,” Constand testified, according to Deadline. “In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move and my legs to move but I was frozen.”
“I wasn’t able to fight him away,” she added on the second day of Cosby’s trial. 
Sixty women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, including rape. Only Constand’s accusation has led to a criminal trial. 
The prosecution and defense questioned why Constand waited a year before reporting the alleged assault to police and met with lawyers before going to law enforcement. They also asked why she continued to speak with Cosby multiple times after the night in question. 
She testified that she did it to protect her job at the university where Cosby was an influential trustee. During one of those subsequent conversations, Constand said, Cosby was evasive when she asked him about the type of pills he’d given her. 
“Mr. Cosby looked at me and said, ‘I thought you had an orgasm, didn’t you?’ I said, ‘I did not. I just want to know what you gave me,” Constand testified, according to People magazine. 
Cosby apologized to Constand’s mother during a later phone call but again declined to say what medication he’d given her, Constand said. He later told authorities it was Benadryl.
Defense attorney Angela Agrusa suggested that Constand invited Cosby’s romantic overtures because she hoped it would help her professional development. 
“You were befriending him because he was going to be able to give you some resources to get into broadcasting,” Agrusa said, a charge that Constand denied. 
Cosby avoided looking directly at Constand while she was in court, though he appeared to be listening intently, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 
“We stand with Andrea Constand and are in awe of her courage,” said Lisa Bloom, an attorney for Janice Dickinson, another of Cosby’s accusers.  
A new “Harry Potter” theory is attempting to make us question everything we thought we knew about the movies and books. The only problem is it’s so controversial that it could sever us ... apart.
OK, this is riddikulus. Beyond riddikulus. Doesn’t anyone remember the scene where Voldemort has Nagini kill Snape in order to win the allegiance of the Elder wand? Only it turns out that Harry was secretly the owner of the Elder wand because he disarmed Malfoy, who had previously disarmed Dumbledore?
(It’s very confusing. More on that later.)
That totally happens. Snape says Harry has his mother’s eyes. It’s very emotional.
Now, one Reddit user is making us wonder if we’re sure of what we actually watched.
Redditor DER_GOTTKAISER first questions why Snape doesn’t appear when Harry uses the resurrection stone.
You’d think Snape was very important to Harry, he loved his mother, gave his life to save him, and shielded him all his life. Harry just found out how Snape had been protecting him the whole time and died to save him, so when he used the magic ring that brings the spirits of dead people, you’d think Snape would be there. He certainly knew Snape longer than Lupin, and you’d think Snape was far more important to him than Lupin, but Snape wasn’t around.
The Redditor speculates Snape didn’t appear because, “Perhaps he was not dead.”
(Oh, Snape!)
The second point asks why Snape’s corpse isn’t “found or mentioned”:
After the big battle, they lay out all the bodies, all the people who died, even the death eaters and Voldemort’s. Harry sees Lupin’s and Fred’s body, but Snape’s body isn’t there. You’d think Harry would have told everyone about Snape’s sacrifice so they can find his body too. But nope, Snape’s corpse isn’t found.
Because of this, the Redditor theorizes that Nagini’s snake venom “didn’t actually kill Snape.”
The theory states Snape was possibly paralyzed or put into a comatose state and that a Potions Master like Snape would’ve had anti-venom for such an occasion. 
He was playing a dangerous role as a spy, Voldemort could turn on him at any moment, I think Snape would have obviously taken some kind of prophylactic antidote beforehand.
If that’s true, then the Reddit user speculates this is the real reason “why the Elder wand didn’t belong to Voldemort.” (Forget about the confusing explanation where Harry was the wand’s master because he disarmed Malfoy, who had disarmed Dumbledore.) Snape survived, so Voldemort didn’t win the allegiance of the wand.
If that’s the case, you might wonder, “Where’s Snape then?”
That’s a great question. We were wondering the same thing. And apparently, there’s an answer.
According to the Reddit user, “He probably feels he fulfilled his promise to Dumbledore and Lilly and is out traveling the world and living his own adventures.” 
Yay! OK, now back to reality. 
Even if Snape was somewhere galavanting around, having his own adventures, he’d probably show up at some point before the whole “19 Years Later” part.
Plus, “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” a play “based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany,” references Snape’s death.
Snape is clearly dead. 
Or is he?
Many, including HuffPost’s Claire Fallon, have criticized “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” as “fan fiction,” so it’s not the best idea to lean on that for proof of anything, really. 
Is this theory a bunch of Hogwarts-inspired hogwash? Probably. Do we wish it were true ...

Donald J. Trump might say he loves to read, but what we know for sure is that the president loves to tweet. So, “The Daily Show” announced Tuesday that it has decided to open The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library to commemorate the many great tweets of our current commander in chief. 
Certainly, we should properly recognize great moments in American presidential history like this one:
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
The show said in a release that this is going to be an “actual library” located in New York City. It will be open to the public for free for a brief period starting in June. 
“It will be so tremendous that you’ll get tired of the tremendousness, so it will then close only a few days later,” the show said in the press release. “Sad!”
What, exactly, does any of this really mean? We can’t say for sure, but here is the most specific the release got: 
The exhibit will feature a fully interactive and hands-on experience for hands of all sizes, giving patrons the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to memorialize and celebrate the many “unpresidented” moments of President Trump’s Twitter history. More details to be announced later.
“The Daily Show” is currently in the midst of trying to figure out the greatest Trump tweet of all time in the bracketed styling of March Madness, so we’re just going to assume it’s related to that. 
6M votes have been cast to decide the greatest Trump tweet of all time. We’re down to the Insane Eight! Vote now: https://t.co/kcPi2Zlf8C pic.twitter.com/9gG9BYaAN3

Lena Dunham and Met Galas just don’t mix. 
One year after her cringeworthy encounter with football player Odell Beckham Jr. landed her in hot water, the “Girls” actress cut her evening short during fashion’s biggest night on Monday and wound up in the emergency room. 
Dunham left the festivities early, Page Six reported, and was rushed to a New York City hospital for an undisclosed medical issue that a representative suggested was related to a pre-existing condition.
“She’s at home resting and doing well,” a source told HuffPost. “As you know, she’s very public about her battles with endometriosis.”

Dunham has battled the chronic and painful disorder in the public eye for years, undergoing her fifth surgery in April, which left her with a clean bill of health.
In an essay for her weekly newsletter, Lenny Letter, Dunham opened up about her most recent operation, explaining that the surgery left her “disease-free.” But she noted the possibility that her endometriosis could return one day. 
“My surgery went off without a hitch,” she wrote at the time. “When I emerged, cotton-mouthed, [Doctor] Randy told me something I hadn’t expected to hear, maybe ever: there was no endometriosis left. Between my surgeries and hormonal intervention, I was disease-free. That doesn’t mean it can never return, but for now, once my sutures have been removed and my bruises have changed from blue to yellow to green to gone, I will be healthy.”
Earlier in the evening, Dunham shared updates from her Met Gala glam prep on social media. She attended the event with fellow “Girls” creator, Jenni Konner, wearing a one-shoulder checker-patterned Elizabeth Kennedy gown.
Thank you, Elizabeth Kennedy, for making me feel so embodied in this sensual tablecloth of a gown. Commes Des Garçons has always been for the creature who dares to be different, who needs clothing to be more than a way to telegraph wealth or culturally imposed super-sexuality. Now THAT is a theme I can get behind. Much love to @voguemagazine for bringing so much power and passion to the Met, which has always been church to me. It's easy to forget amidst the glitz just how much good this night does, raising millions to preserve essential artifacts and making sure style really is for everyone. ❤️ Can I get an amen?

And she wound up with the second-best photo of the night by photobombing Joe Jonas like a total pro.

Chris Pratt might have a new blockbuster movie on the horizon, a snack empire at his finger tips and the uncanny ability to out-charm himself on every subsequent press tour, but it’s his wife, Anna Faris, who stole the show this time.
The “Mom” actress has been an incredibly supportive partner to Pratt over the years, appearing on red carpets with her husband for films like “Jurassic World” and “Passengers” around the world. 
For the “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” press tour, however, she decided to switch things up and live-tweet the ordeal, whether Pratt liked it or not. 
As hilariously honest as ever, Faris gave her followers a peek into her world for 24 hours, sharing pics of everything from what looks like her son peeing in the backyard to a shirtless Pratt shaving in the mirror. Ah, life is good. 
So take a seat, grab your snack of choice and behold Faris’ Twitter adventures below, because we’re going to be here for a while. 

It only takes one look at the scorched Twitter accounts of Chloë Grace Moretz and Bette Midler to understand that Kim Kardashian is fully capable of defending herself against the haters. 
In fact, shutting down the BS is something of a sport for the famous family, whose every move seems to elicit controversial reactions on the daily. So it’s no surprise that Piers Morgan, of all people, is the next in line to try and take Kardashian down. 
After taking a swipe at the mother-of-two over unretouched bikini photos earlier this week, the British TV personality is at it again with a new article in the Daily Mail about how he’s reached his limit with all things Kardashian.
Are there valid criticisms to be had about the KarJenners regarding what they promote and represent in our culture? Sure. But Morgan’s article titled “Kim has hit rock bottom and I no longer wish to keep up” takes it to the extreme by painting Kardashian as a cultural mastermind bent on corrupting our children and capitalizing off a traumatic experience for her own benefit. 
Morgan says he is officially “done” with her after her appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” where she tearfully recounted her robbery in Paris last October. In the interview, Kardashian explained how her outlook on life and material things has changed post-Paris, as she’s taken time off to spend more time with her two children. 
“Kim Kardashian wants us to think she’s turned over a new leaf, that she’s renounced her old materialistic ways. That, as a mother of two young children herself, she has learned how to behave in a responsible fashion,” Morgan wrote. “But she hasn’t. The truth is that she’s now using her massive global platform to actively corrupt our kids.”
Morgan’s biggest gripe against her is that she is simultaneously going public with her recent distaste for hyper-materialism, while promoting her new KIMOJI line that, yes, features some racy content, like an ashtray marketed as an “asstray” and drug-related emojis. 
“Kim Kardashian’s now selling nudity, drugs, booze and high-risk sex to the youth of the world and making hundreds of millions of dollars in the process,” Morgan continued. “Do we really want someone like her to be the role model our young daughters look up to and want to emulate?”
He even knocks Kardashian for exploiting her children and “pretending to prioritise their safety and interests” as part of a money-making scheme. 
Morgan assumes that Kardashian is somehow unable to both be changed by an incredibly traumatic incident and continue to sell her products ― be it emojis or video games ― to the public. Kardashian is, after all, an incredibly successful businesswoman whose brand is about making money. To expect her to abandon all of her ventures is not only unrealistic, but unfair to a woman who’s worked hard to build an empire.
“I want them gone from public life, expunged from the airwaves, thrown off the newsstands, and extinguished from the celebrity ether,” Morgan added. “They’ve become a pitiful parody of stinking, sobbing hypocrisy that should no longer be encouraged or tolerated in civilized society.”
And we were thinking the same thing about you ... 

It was late one winter night in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, when everyone else in the house was asleep, that I first heard the otherworldly, almost superhuman voice of Chris Cornell.
It was 1989, and I was fourteen.
I was watching a VHS videotape that I’d asked a friend to record music videos on while he visited family in New York. Of course, this is before the Internet, before MP3s, and well before YouTube and online streaming. This was at a time when we had to wait weeks to get our hands and ears on the latest music coming out of America. And music videos were a different story altogether. There were only two local Saudi TV channels—one Arabic, one English—and access to satellite or foreign channels was restricted for most of us. So it was really rare and really exciting to actually be able to watch the artists—whose voices and words you lived and felt and laughed and cried to—perform their craft.
My friend managed to squeeze 6 hours of MTV’s Headbangers Ball into the two-hour videocassette I’d given him, using a VCR setting called extended play. I waited anxiously until my dad got home, and we went to his house to pick it up. I brought it back, popped it into the VCR, and devoured it all in one go, watching and listening, late into the night, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
At the end of the six-hour metal marathon was a song by a band I’d never heard of.
It started with a slow, dark, ear-piercing riff constructed entirely out of feedback. Then, it came. That unreal voice, rising from the din of feedback, beautiful, demonically hypnotic, shaking your bones. I haven’t heard anything like it to this day. The song was “Loud Love.” The band, Soundgarden.
And then, two minutes into the video, the tape ended. I rewound it just to make sure. I popped it out and checked again. And again. But that was it. It was the end of the tape. I was desperate to hear the rest of the song. There were no rock music magazines available anywhere near me, none of my friends had heard of the band, and there was no Google to Google anything with.
Years later, I would go to my cousin’s house, and he would show me this wonder called the Internet. He would load up Yahoo’s search engine and say, “Ali, what do you want to know about? Type anything, anything you want, and it’ll find it for you.” And I would type in Chris Cornell. My first ever Internet search.
But back then, I didn’t have Google or Yahoo. All I had were those two minutes at the end of the tape, which I watched over and over again. I also took a tape recorder, held it in front of the TV speaker, and recorded it so I could play it in my Walkman headphones before going to bed.
It was that year that I moved to Pakistan to continue high school while my family stayed in Riyadh. American music was easier to get in Pakistan than Saudi, and I did manage to find some magazines with short articles about Soundgarden. But apart from that, even there, no one had heard of band. The album wasn’t available anywhere. Again, all I had were those two minutes of “Loud Love.”
Finally, in the spring of 1990, I got some great news. Another cousin from England was coming to visit us in Pakistan that summer. I wrote to her, asking if she would please get me the Soundgarden album. I sealed the envelope, rode my bike to the post office, and mailed the letter. She replied quickly (which means I got her letter about three weeks later) and said she would. About a week before her visit, she went to both Tower Records and HMV in London. No one there had heard of Soundgarden, and neither store had Louder Than Love in stock. But she asked them to order it for her, and picked it up a few days later. When she finally arrived in Pakistan, she handed me the tape.
“Loud Love” was the first song on Side B. I had to fast-forward to the end of Side A to get to it. Finally, I listened to the song from beginning to end, savoring every note. It’s hard to explain to young people today who can access any band or album they want online how exhilarating and euphoric it is to finally get your hands on a record you’ve been waiting months and months for. I was in love. I locked myself in my room. I closed my eyes and listened to the entire album. Then, I opened up the cover and followed along with the lyrics. And I listened to it again. And again. I still listen to it today. I have every lyric on that album memorized.
Those who know me personally have heard me say repeatedly, for decades now, that Chris Cornell is the single best singer who ever lived. Chris’s voice and music has been an integral part of my life in a way I can’t explain. What his voice does to me is what a potent drug might do for someone else. It’s beyond just a melody or a song. It isn’t constrained by the dimensions of any familiar format. It’s unbridled abandon—it’s carefree, wild, raw, animalistic. Chris Cornell is the only man whose songs I’ve listened to or sung at least every week since I was a teenager. My own band does very few covers, but when we do, it’s often a Chris Cornell song. Just last week, I sang “When I’m Down” to my seven-month-old daughter at bedtime. His melodies seem to have the same effect on her.
Less than two years after I first got hooked on those magical two minutes at the end of that Headbangers Ball tape, Soundgarden exploded into the mainstream with their 1991 album, Badmotorfinger, alongside Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains as part of the Seattle grunge scene. Now, everyone knew them. Their albums were available at every record store. They transformed the music scene. They won Grammys. Johnny Cash covered “Rusty Cage.” Chris recorded the haunting, beautiful-beyond-words Euphoria Morning. And then, he did it all again with Audioslave.
I never met Chris Cornell, but like millions of his fans, I grew up with him and loved him deeply. There was something about his voice—it wasn’t just music to be listened to. It was helplessly, transcendently felt. It was intimate and transformative in a way that’s inexplicable. I don’t know what made him choose to end it all, but knowing what I knew of him through his art, I understand.
I wish I could have done for Chris what he did for me. Today, though, I’m that 14-year-old kid again. Desperate for more, but the song’s been cut too soon.
“And I’m lost
Behind
The words I’ll never find.”
— Chris Cornell, “Seasons”
Chip Gaines, star of the HGTV series “Fixer Upper,” is being sued for over a million dollars by his former partners in Magnolia Realty, KWTX reports. 
Lawyers John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark filed a lawsuit against Gaines for fraud, according to documents filed in state district court in Waco, Texas, obtained by KWTX. Aside from Gaines, Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks (which owns HGTV) and High Noon Productions (which produces “Fixer Upper”) are listed as defendants in the suit. 
Lewis and Clark are claiming Gaines bought them out of their shares in Magnolia Realty without telling them about HGTV’s decision to air “Fixer Upper.” The lawyers allege Gaines forced them to take cheap buyouts ― the reality star reportedly bought their shares for $2,500 a piece ― so he would remain sole owner of the company.
The two are seeking more than $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief, KWTX reports, and claim they were pressured to sell their shares before they were aware of how much “Fixer Upper” would increase Magnolia’s value. 
Gaines’ attorney Jordan Mayfield told KWTX, “We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.”
HuffPost has reached out to representatives for Gaines and Magnolia and will update this post accordingly. A representative for HGTV told HuffPost the network is aware of the lawsuit but did not comment further.

The year is 2017. Donald Trump is president of the United States of America, xenophobic nationalism has gone global and the National Review has coined the phrase “Conservatives for Chappelle.”
Scary as it might seem, this is not the plot for the latest B-rate dystopian novel available at a bookstore near you. This is your life. 
The conservative National Review published an article Thursday with the aforementioned title in which author Michael Taube explains how Dave Chappelle came to have “his share of conservative fans.”
It is just one article, but the piece feels like the climax of what has been an odd few days for Chappelle. Since Netflix released two of his specials last Tuesday ― his first since 2004’s “For What It’s Worth” ― the comedian has faced criticism for comments made in them about the LGBTQ community and sexual assault.
Of Bill Cosby, he joked, “He rapes, but he saves.” Of the “Q” in “LGBTQ,” he said, “It’s for gay dudes that don’t know they’re gay.” He laughed about missing Bruce Jenner and pronouns and transgender women “tricking” people into having sex with them.
The comments angered many left-leaning Americans, leading to headlines like “A Study on How Dave Chappelle Isn’t Nailing 2017,” “The World Changed, but Dave Chappelle Didn’t,” and “Dave Chappelle’s Disappointing Reliance on Easy Provocation.”
“Chappelle’s reputation rests heavily on the notion that he’s smarter and funnier than anyone else in the game. This … is not smart. It’s ignorant. It’s lazy. It’s cruel,” wrote Seth Simons in Paste. “If Chappelle indeed made $20 million for each of these specials, then he made $1.7 million to call someone a tranny.”
Meanwhile, conservative publications like the National Review have celebrated him. The website ChicksOnTheRight.com ran the headline, “Dave Chappelle Lays Down A Truth Bomb About Planned Parenthood.” Tweets like this happened:
Dave Chappelle’s politically incorrect specials on Netflix are freaking out the snowflakes https://t.co/zVRH3B97gH pic.twitter.com/eAHMI7GME9
The push on the right to claim Chappelle didn’t start last week. Before the election, the conservative New York Observer ran the headline “Dave Chappelle Defends Trump, Rips Clinton: ‘She’s Not Right and We All Know It.’” When TMZ later asked him about it, he angrily stated, “Jesus Christ, I’m not a Trump supporter!”
It’s an odd turn of events for man who was once something of a hero to the left, or at least one of its voices. As recently as last November, he arrived at “Saturday Night Live” just days removed from the election and gave a stirring monologue about the then-president-elect. In March, he showed up at his village council meeting in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and called for a more progressive police force. 
Yet here we are. It is 2017, and Dave Chappelle, due to his trouble keeping up with the world around him, has ostracized himself from his base, and started to gain a new one entirely on his right. What a world.

Katy Perry had a bad hair weekend after coming under fire for a reference to former President Barack Obama, E! reported.
During an Instagram Live exchange in which a fan commented on the singer turning her black hair blonde, the “Bon Appetit” performer replied: “Oh someone says, ‘I miss your old black hair.’ Oh, really? Do you miss Barack Obama as well? Oh, OK. Times change. Bye! See your guys later.”
I'm sure we can all do without @katyperry right ??? #Loser pic.twitter.com/r9bQcuaCBi
Harsh reaction to Perry somehow connecting her formerly dark locks to the former commander-in-chief continued on Twitter into late Sunday. Some also came to Perry’s defense, saying she had done nothing offensive.
Vibe wrote that Perry mentioned Obama because the username of the fan in the online exchange was “MsBarackObamaAsWell.”
People noted Perry’s support for Obama previously, but her hair comment had a part of the internet tressing-out.
HuffPost reached out early Monday to a Perry rep for comment.

Jay Z knows what looks good (hell, the man is married to Beyoncé) so it’s no surprise that he was caught directing a photographer at a basketball game on Thursday night.
The famed rapper and business mogul was at Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers and was spotted being friendly with comedian Kevin Hart. Their interaction ― obviously ― garnered the attention of the paparazzi. Um, hello, two big stars chatting it up? Yeah, that’s a photo op.
As Jay noticed the photographers snapping away, smiling ear-to-ear, he said, “Take the picture while we’re talking” to the person behind the camera. He then immediately resumed play-laughing/hand-shaking with Hart.
  

During an interview with “Entertainment Tonight,” Tom Cruise served up a major hint about the upcoming sequel to “Top Gun.”
“[There] may be a volleyball scene,” Cruise said to ET. “Maybe. I have not told anyone in the world as much as I’ve just told you right now.”
The volleyball scene in “Top Gun” is a bit odd in retrospect. Is there a big volleyball culture in the Navy? Maybe it’s just the ‘80s love of music-backed montages.
The original volleyball scene, where Goose and Maverick battle Slider and Ice Man, is a muscle-glistening collection of high-fiving and watch-checking-while-flexing.
It’s unclear if the scene will involve the original actors or some new, younger pilots, but we’ll have more around-the-clock “Top Gun”-volleyball coverage as it develops.
 
CORRECTION: This article incorrectly stated that the pilots in “Top Gun” are in the Air Force (because planes). They are Navy pilots. Which still doesn’t explain why, if they’re in planes, it’s the “highway to the Danger Zone,” but we digress.
As host of Spike TV’s “Lip Sync Battle,” LL Cool J has seen his fair share of celebrities duke it out on the show. Among his favorites have been Mike Tyson, Shaquille O’Neal and Channing Tatum. 
But there are still a couple of big names he’d love to see on the hit series ― and these ones may surprise you.
“For some reason, for me, my dream battle is all the politicians. Like John McCain versus George W. Bush or Bill Clinton versus George W. Bush,” LL Cool J told HuffPost on Build Series.
He also noted how he’d love to see former President Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, battle it out. 
“Obama versus Michelle would be amazing,” he said, before making a plea to the couple to join. After all, they have been spotted recently enjoying life outside the White House.
“Guys, you’re in private life now. Yachts. You’re having fun. Life is great. You’re watching this, you’re laughing. Come on and do the show! Can you imagine Obama doing Busta Rhymes?” LL Cool J said before breaking into Busta’s hit “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See.”  
He admits he’d feel too self-conscious if the Obamas took on one of his own hits. But when an audience member suggested the Obamas perform his 1996 hit “Doin’ It,” LL Cool J laughed just thinking about it, saying, “’Doin’ It’ would be crazy.” 
If the Obamas did end up gracing the “Lip Sync Battle” stage, they’d get the chance to pick their own songs to perform. 
“Most people assume they have to rehearse for weeks and weeks. But they don’t. We have a great choreographer. The celebrity would call up and say, ‘Hey, these are the songs I like.’ It’s up to them,” he said. “They choose their own songs. We can make suggestions to them if they want us to. But it’s up to them. Like, ‘I’d like to float on a chariot’ or ‘I’d like to ride a white horse.’ Whatever your idea is, we say, ‘OK.’ Then we tell the choreographer and she whips up a version of their idea. And they come and watch it. And they can jump in and learn the dance if they want, be a part of the dancing, or they can play the front and let the dancers do the back. So we make it easy … so they can have fun.”
Not only that, but LL Cool J says they have a great studio where the celebrities can hang out. Across three stages is an open bar, along with ice cream machines and expresso machines, and other fun treats. 
“It’s crazy,” he said. “It’s like a whole world out there.”
Not too shabby. Obamas, we hope you’re listening. 
“Lip Sync Battle,” now in its third season, airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on Spike.

She may not have won the competition on the eighth season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,“ but Naysha Lopez is no stranger to taking home the crown.
Long before her stint on the Emmy-award winning show, Lopez was a force to be reckoned with on the pageant scene and even won the title (and yes, the crown) of Miss Continental in 2013.
But Naysha’s journey in drag hasn’t always been pageant perfect. As a child, she describes herself as “thin” and “girly” and that she just didn’t fit in.
“Growing up was rather difficult,” she reveals to Hey Qween host Jonny mcGovern. “It really was. I was that feminine, old soul type. I didn’t really want to go outside and play with the other kids.”

“The first time I was caught in drag, I was like four or five, I was wearing my cousins bridesmaids dress,” she explains. “And mind you this was 1989, it was purple with these big ruffles and totally hideous, but I was living for it.”
As she grew up, Naysha found dance as a way to express herself, but it wasn’t until one fateful day that she embraced the expression of drag.
“At the time I was a backup dancer,” she says. “There was this amateur drag contest and I was convinced into doing it and I ended up winning.”
After winning the contest Naysha continued performing in drag, a decision that would soon consume and transform her life.
“I worked at a finance company, but I was doing so much drag that I started coming into work late all the time,” she reveals. “It was at that point that I decided that I wanted to pursue drag 100 percent.”
“I was doing bar gigs like seven nights a week and then I started doing the pageants. I saw that there was an opportunity where this could actually put food on the table and it’s something I loved to do so I just stuck with it.”
As Naysha’s drag persona began to form and her look became more refined, she found herself in the high stakes world of drag pageantry.

“Back in the day, pageants were very cut-throat. You had an assistant and his job was to watch your stuff. Back then the competition would spill stuff on your gowns, put glass your your powder, they’d spill water on your makeup, things would go missing... it was just really cut-throat.”
As for her experience in the pageant world, Naysha says things were a lot of more positive than the “cut-throat” environment of the past.
“It’s a great experience and now everyone wants to be Miss Congeniality,” Naysha says. “I really encourage girls to do pageants because before ‘Drag Race’ there were pageants and after ‘Drag Race’ there’ll still be pageants.”
She adds, “It really does help you polish your look from head to toe and really helps you find yourself as an entertainer.”
After a few year in the pageant scene Naysha would achieve her dreams of being crowned Miss Continental.
“Winning Continental was always a dream and goal for me and I achieved it. So after that, I was ready to move on and so I went for ‘Drag Race.’”
But as many queens know, getting on the Race isn’t as easy as one may think.
“I actually auditioned for season one and didn’t get it... then I auditioned for another season and some queen ruined that for me and I didn’t get on.”
As for who the mystery queen is, you might remember her from the very first season of RuPaul’s show. and as for what that certain queen did, Naysha’s keeping that sip of tea to herself.

“I don’t really want to talk about the queen... Jade Sotomayor,” Naysha says under her breathe. “I won’t go into what happened, but yeah she ruined it for me.“
Despite the set backs Naysha would soon be cast on the eighth season and would be eliminated and called back during that infamous call by none other than Mama Ru herself.
“I was heartbroken the first time I was sent home, I didn’t get to show anything that I brought and I didn’t get to really do anything! But when I came back I felt like I was able to redeem myself to a certain extent and I was able to come to terms with it.”

Disney Channel’s hit series “Liv and Maddie” aired its final episode Friday, and to be frank, we’re still in mourning. Luckily, we’re not alone: “Liv and Maddie” stars Dove Cameron and Ryan McCartan had plenty of feels about the series finale.
Cameron and McCartan played fan favorite couple Maddie and Diggie on the show. The pair also dated offscreen; McCartan and Cameron were actually engaged for a brief period before breaking things off last October. Though there has been some bad blood between the stars ― Cameron recently said McCartan was “terrible” to her ― their heartbreak hasn’t detracted from their love for the show.
Cameron shared a snap of her “Liv and Maddie” fam over the weekend, and her emotional caption will leave you gutted. 
“The finality of today is nothing short of overwhelming and extraordinary,” Cameron wrote. “The amount of gratitude, love and huge emotion that my heart carries and pumps through my entire body is not something I could have prepared for.”
“I don’t deserve the love, the acceptance and the support that have been given to me, and I will dedicate my life to giving that same sensation and freedom to others who[se] lives I am lucky enough to touch,” Cameron added.
A post shared by ♡DOVE♡ (@dovecameron) on Mar 24, 2017 at 7:15pm PDT
Cameron tagged several of her costars in the post, including Tenzing Norgay Trainor and Joey Bragg. McCartan was not among the costars tagged.
Nevertheless, McCartan had similarly kind words for the show. The actor shared a collage of shots of his character Diggie Smalls, writing, “RIP Diggie, end of such an amazing era.”
“Loved everything about everything that this show taught me,” McCartan added. 
A post shared by Ryan McCartan (@mccarya) on Mar 25, 2017 at 8:41pm PDT
McCartan also shared a farewell message on Twitter before the finale aired Friday.
Can't believe liv and maddie ends today... what a life changer in so many ways. I'll miss it dearly 💙 #GoodbyeLAM
We’re happy to see that despite any drama behind the scenes, Cameron and McCartan can still put their differences aside for the fans. We’ll miss you, Miggie!

Disney kids of the early 2000s have been eagerly awaiting the new “That’s So Raven” reboot and, finally, there’s some relief.
Disney Channel released a teaser on Friday for “Raven’s Home,” the spin-off which will follow Raven Baxter’s children as they deal with their own psychic visions. Based on the trailer, one of Raven’s twins will have her troublesome gift and will have to navigate their powers with the help of a few friends.
And of course, the cast would not be complete without our girls Raven and Chelsea! 
In true Raven style, fans on social media freaked out at the trailer.

Adam West’s “Batman” costar Burt Ward has joined some of Hollywood’s biggest stars in paying tribute to the legend, who died Friday night  at the age of 88.
Tributes flooded in for West, who also starred in “Family Guy,” after his representative confirmed his death Saturday morning. For Ward, the Robin to West’s Batman in the iconic 1960s show, the death was a devastating loss following more than 50 years of a special friendship.
“I will forever miss him,” Ward told Variety. “There are several fine actors who have portrayed Batman in films. In my eyes, there was only one real Batman that is and always will be Adam West. He was truly the Bright Knight.”
“Family Guy” creator Seth MacFarlane wrote a touching Twitter post about his dear friend, who died after being treated briefly for leukemia.
“Adam West was a joy to work with, and the kind of guy you always wanted to be around,” MacFarlane tweeted. “His positivity, good nature, and sense of fun were undeniable, and it was always a big jolt of the best energy when he walked in to record the show. He knew comedy, and he knew humanity.” 
Director Kevin Smith, known to be a massive comic enthusiast, remembered West as his first Batman. Smith was 4 years old when he first saw West, and he said the star inspired him to be a good person. The director said that West’s ability to bring light into a traditionally dark character was how “true heroes spoke.” 
“He was pure love and joy,” Smith said on his Instagram page. “He remained my hero, even in adulthood, as well as a real life role model for interacting with fans. Adam loved his fans - especially #ralphgarman, who worked tirelessly to get Adam a star on the @officialhollywoodwalkoffame. Farewell, Caped Crusader. Off to Superhero Heaven you go, where all your rascally rogues are ready to see you again!”
Smith and MacFarlane were only a few the dozens of actors, writers, and directors who shared a tribute on social media for the beloved Batman.

Holy heartbreak Batman. Adam West was a big part of my childhood. We were acquaintances in my adulthood. A wonderful man who will b missed.
A post shared by Kevin Smith (@thatkevinsmith) on Jun 10, 2017 at 9:13am PDT

Let’s agree that among all the film and TV versions of Batman, Adam West’s was the silliest.
It was also one of the most important – because West kept Batman alive at a time when the character could have faded into bat-obscurity.
In the ABC television series that ran from 1966 to 1968, West played Batman for laughs, parodying superhero situations and behavior while setting up jokes that could have been lifted from Hee-Haw.
West’s Batman did face off with The Joker, the Riddler and the other familiar villains. But where those showdowns in the movies and the comic books would often lead Batman into very dark places – a response the current TV prequel Gotham seems to suggest is unavoidable – they took West in far different directions.
They could just as easily, and randomly, end up with the Caped Crusader reminding teenage viewers that drinking plenty of milk builds strong and healthy bodies.
West may have taken that advice himself, since he was 88 when he died of leukemia on Friday, and he kept working pretty much until the end.
He appeared in hundreds of movies and TV shows, usually in guest roles and frequently as some incarnation of himself or Batman.
That may be the strongest clue to the impact of his TV portrayal, which endured long after logic says it should have become a footnote.
The TV series, to be honest, wasn’t that good. It was one joke, basically, that was recycled twice a week for the first two seasons and then once a week in the third and final season.
Once you’d seen a couple of episodes, you knew the joke, which probably explains why ratings fell in the second season and plummeted in the third.
No, it wasn’t script quality that kept West’s Batman in demand for the rest of West’s life.
It wasn’t the fact Batman was played as a kind of earnest clown.
No, the importance of West’s Batman is that it was a bridge, keeping Batman out there between the comic book years of the 1950s/early 1960s and his later explosion in the movies.
Deep Batman fans, of course, didn’t need a bridge. They stayed around for the whole run.
But Batman, like Superman and Spider-man, only reached the level he occupies today after he entered the wider realm of popular culture – when TV and movie viewers who knew nothing of his comic book universe found him entertaining and kind of cool.
West’s Batman certainly drew viewers from the baby-boom kids who devoured comic books. By reinventing him as a campy TV character, the TV show also attracted millions of random curious civilians.
Without the TV show, most of those civilians and even many of the comic-book fans would been moving on with their lives by, say, the 1970s. Life has a way of pushing pop culture aside.
Because we had West’s Batman, whatever we thought of him, that didn’t happen. Batman never fell from our line of sight. Years later his name still resonated, which wasn’t the only reason studios started making Batman movies, but certainly didn’t hurt.
By almost any conventional, logical assessment, West was the outlier in the Batman world, the odd duck that just didn’t belong at the party.
Instead, he ended up as one of the party’s most memorable and well-loved hosts.
Holy Go Figure, Batman.
In case you’re one of those Christmas in July people or have a child under the age of 7 at home, then behold the trailer for the upcoming “Frozen” animated short.
Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios have come together to deliver another “Frozen” treat before the official sequel hits theaters in 2019. This time, it’s Olaf who gets top billing in “Olaf’s Frozen Adventure,” as the lovable snowman embarks on a hunt for Arendelle’s best holiday tradition.
For a limited time, the 21-minute film will be shown before Disney/Pixar’s “Coco,” which hits theaters Nov. 22. 
The short film features four new songs in addition to bringing back original cast members, including Kristen Bell (Anna), Josh Gad (Olaf), Jonathan Groff (Kristoff) and Idina Menzel (Elsa) for a brand new adventure.

Former FBI Director James Comey is currently testifying in front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Given that the testimony is airing on major television networks, live-streaming on many websites and playing in various bars across the country ― there’s a good chance you’re watching.
Many celebrities are watching as well, and have a lot of opinions. Read some of the notable tweets below: 
 
Lorde knows you’re probably multi-tasking at work to watch this thing.
only in 2017 would one be launching a tour and watching comey testify at the same time

Is McCain OK?
Celebrity photographs are a key component of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, so here is one of Nicole Kidman hypnotized by the luckiest pie in the world. 
Kidman’s finger hovered over that dessert at the after-party for Monday’s Los Angeles premiere of “The Beguiled,” where she is seen surrounded by co-star Elle Fanning, chef Casey Thompson, director Sofia Coppola and co-star Kirsten Dunst. The women in Coppola’s new movie do serve pie to the wounded Civil War soldier (Colin Farrell) they take in at their isolated Louisiana boarding school.
Oscar winners, they’re just like us. The actress touched this fresh confection with abandon, and for that we salute her. It is, after all, the Year of Kidman. 
You might say the “Beguiled” premiere was to pie for. 
For years I’ve wondered what was going through Beethoven’s head when the last note of the ninth symphony had died off and he stood there onstage hearing nothing. No applause. No whistles or cheers. Just silence. As the story goes, only when his concertmaster turned him around did he realize that the audience was standing and clapping and roaring its approval.
Thankfully, Mandy Harvey was facing her audience on “America’s Got Talent” recently when she sang her song “Try” and brought down the house. The entire theater was on its feet, hands clapping and waving; there was hardly a dry eye to be seen.
Getting Life Back on Track
It seems extraordinary when someone who is a member of the deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHOH) community shows herself to be a singer and musician of singular talent. Ms. Harvey has been deaf for the past 10 years, having lost her hearing to a connective tissue disorder when she was 18. Yet that has not stopped her from pursuing her music. She stands in stocking feet onstage to feel the rhythm of the bass and piano; she eyes her ASL translator at the foot of the stage, who signs questions and answers to her from the judges. She strums a ukulele she cannot hear and sings with what can only be called an extraordinary voice. One can only hope that what she hears inside her head sounds as glorious to her as it did to everyone else in that theater.
Ms. Harvey would be an astonishing performer even if she were not deaf. But the fact remains that her deafness has forced her to overcome greater obstacles to succeed. She’d been singing since she was 4 but left music after she lost her hearing. “But then I figured out how to get back into singing,” she explained to the judges at “America’s Got Talent,” “with muscle memory, using visual tuners and trusting my pitch.”
This makes the song that Ms. Harvey sang, a composition of her own entitled “Try,” that much more moving:
“I don’t feel the way I used to/ The sky is gray much more than it is blue/ But I know one day I’ll get through/ And I will take my place again/ If I would try … If I would try …”
It’s in that spirit of trying, despite the obstacles, that we find what’s truly extraordinary. It’s the desire to succeed, the refusal to accept defeat when what you want to do seems so inaccessible, that not only shines in Ms. Harvey but also shines in so many members of the DHOH community.
Putting Deeds into Words
Ms. Harvey’s performance is also a reminder of what we in the broader community need to keep in mind. After she had finished singing, “America’s Got Talent” judge Simon Cowell said, “Mandy, I don’t think you’re going to need an interpreter for this” — and then he slammed his hand down on the show’s famous golden buzzer.
Mr. Cowell was right: There was no need for Ms. Harvey’s ASL interpreter to explain what that meant at all. She had just stolen the hearts of every member of that audience, and she was heading straight to the live show.
But that’s the thing: Some actions don’t need words, but most actions and most thoughts do. This is why live, interactive captioning systems are so important. Many members of the DHOH community don’t know ASL; they depend on the written word to know what questions are being asked, what opinions are being expressed. It’s insulting to suggest that the DHOH communities need to try harder to find ways to understand what’s going on; they try and try and try every day. The very least that the broader community can do is to make a complementary effort and try to make those questions, conversations and opinions accessible to all.
The DHOH are not The Other. They’re our friends and neighbors, our co-workers and relatives. I’d say, “they’re us,” but, in truth, I think they’re more than that. They try and try, and they get up and do it all over again the next day. In that way, they show us our better selves, and I draw inspiration from that on a daily basis.
There was barely a dry eye for anyone watching Ariana Grande sing “Somewhere Over The Rainbow” at the “One Love Manchester” concert in England Sunday.
And this baby girl was no different.
As Grande hit the song’s high notes while closing out the tribute to victims of the Manchester terror attack, the youngster couldn’t contain her emotions:
A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jun 6, 2017 at 10:43am PDT
Tears streamed down the unidentified girl’s face as she watched Grande’s heartfelt performance of the Judy Garland classic from “The Wizard Of Oz” on a television screen. The baby then tried to sing along with the pop star herself.
Grande shared the adorable clip to Instagram on Tuesday. It’s since garnered more than 4.9 million views. 
Singers including Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry joined Grande for the tribute event at the Emirates Old Trafford stadium in Greater Manchester.

It raised more than £10 million (about $12.9 million) for the “We Love Manchester Emergency Fund” fund, supporting families of the 22 people killed and dozens injured in the suicide bombing at Grande’s Manchester Arena concert on May 22.
Grande has now released her live version of “Somewhere Over The Rainbow” as a charity single, which will also benefit the fund.

Who’s gonna walk The Weeknd through the dark side of the morning? Selena Gomez, clearly — and now the pop power couple have taken their PDA to Instagram.
The “I Feel It Coming” singer, also known as Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, posted a dimly lit snap of his girlfriend giving him a smooch on the cheek early Saturday, much to the delight of Seleeknd (Abelena?) fans. They’ve endorsed it with more than 1.1 million likes thus far.
A post shared by The Weeknd (@theweeknd) on Apr 8, 2017 at 1:27am PDT
According to People, the two were attending a birthday party The Weeknd hosted for Canadian rapper Belly, and were apparently joined by fellow stars Drake, Ashlee Simpson and Amber Rose.
This isn’t the first time Gomez and The Weeknd have shown love for each other on social media. In February, fans noticed a special shoutout in Gomez’s Instagram story, where she drew a heart on a video of herself watching The Weeknd on TV. You can hear Gomez say, “Aww, baby.”
Love in the digital age, y’all.

On Tuesday, Netflix revealed the tantalizingly short minute of action directly after last season’s “Orange Is the New Black” wrap.
The upcoming Season 5, which debuts in June, also comes with a format change: The action will happen in real time over the course of three days. The riot and its aftermath will “[leave] the inmates’ lives forever changed as they are emboldened to fight for redemption, resolution and the respect they deserve,” per Netflix.
Last season, after an inexperienced young corrections officer kills eternal ray of sunshine Poussey (Samira Wiley), relations between Litchfield Penitentiary inmates and authority figures are more tense than ever. A prison riot boils to the surface in the Season 4 finale as Daya (Dascha Polanco) finds herself holding the gun of CO Humphrey (Michael Torpey), circled by inmates egging her on.
The finale cuts away ― to a lovely flashback eulogy for IRL newlywed Poussey ― before we find out whether Daya shoots. 
In the new clip, we learn more: There is a gunshot and a thud. But the shot cuts to black (again?!) before we can be sure it came from Daya ― after she pleads with the rowdy crowd to be quiet.
Humphrey made himself known as a psychopath, having previously forced Maritza (Diane Guerrero) to eat a live baby mouse, and Crazy Eyes (Uzo Aduba) and Kukudio (Emily Althaus) to engage in a bloody fight. Fans might not be terribly distraught to see his character make an exit, but the consequences for Daya ― who has a young child outside the prison ― and everyone around her would be dire. 
Polanco has said she “could see [Daya] pulling the trigger,” explaining to The Hollywood Reporter how her character’s postpartum depression has left her “fragile and very sensitive.”
In the face of that conflict, Piper (Taylor Schilling) and Alex (Laura Prepon), having recently decided to walk the straight-and-narrow, get the hell out of dodge. 
But not before Piper has the chance to ask an exceptionally poorly timed question: “If this is a real riot, do you think this a step forward or backward for equality?”
Now is not the time, Piper.
“Orange Is the New Black” returns to Netflix on June 9. 
Eminem’s “baby girl” is a baby no more. 
The rapper sang about his daughter, little Hailie Scott, on tracks like “Hailie’s Song” and “Mockingbird” 15 and 13 years ago, respectively.

Sarah Hyland took to Twitter Wednesday to push back against rumors among fans that she had been dealing with anorexia. 
The 26-year-old actress is fairly open about her health struggles and explained that her weight loss was a result of medical issues. Hyland has a condition called kidney dysplasia and underwent a kidney transplant surgery in 2012. Hyland said in her statement that she was responding to discussions about her body among fans that she said were happening on Twitter and in comments on her Instagram posts.
“Which made me laugh, but then it dawned on me that young girls are reading posts saying that I’m promoting anorexia due to my weight,” Hyland wrote. “While these comments don’t affect me, they may affect others. So I’m here to say that no one should aim to be the weight I am at right now.”

It’s been a rough year, but she isn’t ready to discuss her struggles just yet, Hyland said in her post. Back in January, Hyland skipped the SAG Awards due to undisclosed health issues. She informed fans in her statement that she’s been on bed rest for the last few months, resulting in a loss of muscle mass.
“My circumstances have put me in a place where I’m not in control of what my body looks like,” Hyland wrote.
The actress’ condition, kidney dysplasia, is a condition that occurs when cysts filled with fluid grow where normal tissue is supposed to develop. Hyland underwent a transplant after her father donated his kidney to her. According to the National Kidney Foundation, more than 100,000 individuals in America are on the waiting list for a transplant.
“I’m a 26-year-old woman who goes through more than you can even imagine on a daily basis,” Hyland wrote. “But I work hard. I love hard. And I got to where I am because I am STRONG and didn’t give up. “

One high school senior is ending his school year on a note that only T-Pain could hit, thanks to a memorable yearbook quote.
When Gabriel Silvan, a 17-year-old student at Kentwood High School in Covington, Washington, tweeted T-Pain last year for inspiration for his senior yearbook quote, he didn’t think the hip-hop artist would actually respond.
One day after tweeting his request ― “give me a senior quote please:)” ― T-Pain obliged. 
Silvan, surprised that T-Pain took the time to answer, sent the singer an excited shoutout ― “YOOOOOO TPAIN!!!!” ― then submitted the suggestion to his yearbook staff.
Six months later, Kentwood High School’s yearbooks came out.
“I’ve been a fan of T-Pain since I got my first MP3 player in 2007,” Silvan told HuffPost. “I never thought he would [respond] but when did I was ecstatic.”
@TPAIN give me a senior quote please:)
“people don't think it be like it be, but it do.”
YOOOOOO TPAIN!!!!! https://t.co/O3WIPE0I5t
While T-Pain’s suggested quote sounds like something he would croon in Auto-Tune, it’s not actually an original quote. Those words of wisdom were made famous by 1970s Major League Baseball star Oscar Gamble.
The quote was in reference to the “chaos within the New York Yankees clubhouse,” according to the book “Baseball in Montgomery” by Clarence Watkins.
Without context, many people were confused about what T-Pain’s message meant.
"It" do what?Think or concur that "it" be?Is think doing?What is something that be's?Is "it" then a being?Does "it" get a name?
Nevertheless, Silvan submitted T-Pain’s quote to the school’s yearbook staff.
This week, it made it to press.
Silvan tweeted T-Pain a picture of the finished product to let the singer know that he is immortalized in the 2016-17 edition of Kentwood High’s yearbook.
It's been done @TPAIN pic.twitter.com/h0ghKjyH1Q
In response, T-Pain honored Silvan with a laugh-cry emoji and a slow clap.
“This is the kind of shit I live for,” the singer tweeted to the 17-year-old. He also congratulated him for the major accomplishment ― the tweet, not the whole graduating high school thing.
Man. This. This is the kind of shit I live for 😂 you did it bro. Killed it. Good job man 👏🏿 ...............👏🏿 ...............👏🏿 .slow clap*
Still high off of the energy from T-Pain’s reaction, Silvan shared the precious moment on his secondary Twitter account and it quickly went viral.
He called his yearbook quote a product of “a series of very very very very fortunate events.”
A SERIES OF VERY VERY VERY VERY FORTUNATE EVENTS pic.twitter.com/vcQnjDplZB
While many people thought the T-Pain yearbook quote was great, a lot of Twitter users pointed out that T-Pain ripped off Gamble’s quote.
 “Give Oscar Gamble the respect he deserves,” one person wrote to Silvan. Another person defended T-Pain by saying that the singer should “sang it, so he can make it clear.”
Silvan doesn’t mind if T-Pain borrowed the quote from the former ballplayer. He’s just grateful that his favorite hip-hop star reached out to him.
“I don’t care [because] it’s a little unique and [T-Pain] gave it to me over Twitter,” he told HuffPost.
Now Silvan is learning to deal with his 15 minutes of viral fame before he graduates next week.
“It’s wild to go viral. I’m all over Instagram and stuff, but I’m trying to be humble,” he said. “But with all the fame and graduation so close, it’s hard not to show off.”
So far, his plan to stay humble seems to be working ― a little.
Let's just take the time to realize that me, Gabriel, am really out here
I went viral literally a week before I graduate, I have done it. I've peaked
I got a 50k tweet, hella other big tweets, hella followers, and I'm all over Instagram now too. And tpain.

When talking about Wonder Woman, the tendency is to focus on her sweet bullet-deflecting gauntlets or her truth-seeking lasso. But actually, her sword is potentially the coolest.
Based on some fascinating dialogue in the graphic novel Kingdom Come, Nerdist’s Kyle Hill explains (with science!) why Wonder Woman’s sword would be the sharpest object in the universe.

Former “Dance Moms” star Abby Lee Miller was sentenced to one year and one day in prison by a federal judge in Pittsburgh after she pled guilty to bankruptcy fraud, reports Deadline. 
According to the site, Miller blamed perils of fame and its harsh spotlight for the situation she found herself in. 
“’Dance Moms’ became a hit and I became the laughing stock of reality TV,” Miller told the judge before her sentencing, promising she would not find herself in a court room again if given leniency. 
In 2015, Miller was indicted on 20 counts of fraud for hiding $755,000 in earnings from the government. The 50-year-old dance teacher, who gained notoriety thanks to Lifetime’s reality series, left the show in March of this year. 
In an interview with People magazine in April, she blamed her lack of business acumen and ability to trust the wrong people for her predicament. 
“I went from being a dance teacher from Pittsburgh who never ran a family business, who never did the books, who never wrote the checks out [because] my dad was there, he had my back,” she told People. “When he died, I had these temporary people in there, now we’re finding out that money was going right and left — and I didn’t know that.”
She added, “I made mistakes and I trusted people, but ultimately I have to take responsibility.”
In addition to prison time, Miller was sentenced to two years of supervised release and will have to pay $160,000 in fines. 

John Legend sent some Mother’s Day love to wife Chrissy Teigen this weekend with an adorable post on Instagram.

We think we’ve seen celebrity look-alikes before, but Steve Irwin’s son is here to (croco)dial it up to 11.
While Robert Irwin appeared on “The Tonight Show” on Thursday, Jimmy Fallon broke out a side-by-side picture of him and his dad as a kid, and it’s enough to make you say, “Crikey!”
”I thought it was me,” said the young Irwin. Apparently he couldn’t even tell the difference before looking at his dad’s shirt in the picture. 
“You’re like, ‘I wouldn’t wear that,’” joked Fallon.
It’s been more than a decade now since Steve Irwin, known for his show “The Crocodile Hunter,” tragically lost his life. His daughter Bindi Irwin previously told HuffPost that in that time, the whole family has been working to keep his spirit of animal conservation alive.
“Well, for us as a family, it’s a team effort. I think we have tried so hard to make sure everything he lived and died for carries on. My dad always used to say, ‘I don’t care if anyone remembers me. I just want people to remember my message,’” she said.
Following in his dad’s footsteps, Robert brought some animals, too, and we just can’t bear it (because there are bears).
”The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. on NBC.

Someone please alert young Kylie Jenner that her reign as Snapchat King has come to an end. We’ll miss the lip kit swatches and endless “finger-mouthing,” but every good ruler needs to appoint a successor.
Enter Robert De Niro.
At the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival this week, Alex Berry, a finalist in the Tribeca Snapchat Shorts, gave the Oscar winner a quick tutorial in all things Snapchat, like sending photos to friends, distorting your face with a puppy tongue and, duh, working the Coachella flower crown.
De Niro seemed hesitant at first, as Berry explained how Snapchats eventually disappear. But even he couldn’t resist the appeal of the app as the duo tried out different filters. To borrow a word, it’s flawless. 
Watch, in a week or two De Niro will have turned into a full-blown millennial, delighting fans by saying, “You talkin’ to me?” as a baby bunny rabbit. 

This latest season of “Saturday Night Live” had great ratings. This was due in large part to very popular Donald Trump-related sketches, as the country tuned in to see how “SNL” would interpret the president’s various gaffes.
Although the focus on Trump gained the show a large audience, you can imagine this constant focus on such depressing source material would be taxing on a staff tasked to somehow make the subject of Trump seem fun.
With that in mind, Kate McKinnon was on “The Tonight Show” Friday night and explained that after this season, she and her writer friends needed to blow off quite a bit of steam.
A hammer was involved. 
Host Jimmy Fallon and McKinnon ― who famously portrayed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ― talked about how NBC is renovating the “SNL” offices.
“Before we left, the last week we were all blowing off a lot of steam because it’s been like a big season or whatever and we were told the walls are coming down,” said McKinnon. “The whole floor is being demolished.”
McKinnon explained how she was dancing to music with “SNL” writer friends and fellow cast member Aidy Bryant when they realized a hammer was in the room.
“I grabbed the hammer and one of my writer friends was like, ‘Put a hole in the wall. Put a hole in the wall!,’” said McKinnon. “So I did and I put a hole in the wall. And then they all put a hole in the wall.”
But apparently, McKinnon had misinterpreted the plans for renovation and took that “the whole floor is being demolished” too literally.
“Then Aidy came back from the bathroom,” McKinnon continued. “And she was like, ‘Guys, the walls aren’t coming down.’”
McKinnon told Fallon that after the hammer incident, she bought a “big bucket of spackle” and left it in the office. “I sincerely apologize to whoever I made trouble for,” McKinnon said while looking straight at the camera.
After the apology she also jokingly admitted, “But I did feel alive. Wow did I feel young and alive.” 
This DOES impress us much.
Shania Twain was the most iconic country star of the ‘90s, but she’s not done yet ― she just announced her first album in 15 years.
Twain appeared on “The Voice” on Monday night as the first-ever fifth judge on the show and told the world about her album.

Of the new album, entitled “Life’s About to Get Good,” Twain said in a statement:
I was at home looking out at the ocean and I said to myself, “Here I am stuck in this past of negativity, but it’s so beautiful out. I’m not in the mood to write a “feeling-sorry-for-myself” song ... You can’t have the good without the bad. And that’s what the song ended up being about.
Shania, you’re the best ― forever and for always. The new album drops in June 2017.

THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW SHANIA TWAIN ALBUM HAS ME SHOOKTH TO THE CORE
So cool to see @ShaniaTwain back again! First album in 15 years! And she is as hot as ever.
Holy shit, there's supposed to be a new Shania Twain album this year, I have only waited 15 years for this, somebody hold me please. 😯
We’ll be looking for a leopard-print outfit in the interim to wear when the new tunes arrive.

Kathy Griffin has slammed the Trump family for bullying her on social media after a controversial photo shoot, at times fighting back tears during a press conference alongside celebrity powerhouse lawyer Lisa Bloom in Los Angeles on Friday.
“I’m not afraid of Donald Trump,” Griffin said. “He’s a bully. I’ve dealt with older white guys trying to keep me down my whole career.”
In the emotional press conference, the nervous comic stated that the Trumps “are personally trying to ruin my life forever” after a series of social media posts. Griffin has faced a week of intense backlash, which cost her several jobs, after releasing a gory photo showing the comedian holding a prop designed to look like the bloodied, severed head of President Donald Trump. The president called the photo shoot “sick.” 
Bloom stressed that the severity of the backlash did not match that of similarly violent images created by men in the entertainment industry in the past. She named Marilyn Manson, who alluded to violence against Trump in a 2016 video, and Ted Nugent, whose past comment about killing then-President Barack Obama Trump supported. 
“They’re all just considered ‘bad boys,’” Bloom said.
Asked whether she thought the backlash against her was particularly harsh because she is a woman comedian, Griffin answered with certainty. 
“This is a woman thing. I’m sorry if you don’t agree with me, but I live it. I’m 56 years old. Everywhere I go, there’s a male promoter. The people who sign my checks are white guys, usually older white guys.”
Bloom stated the comedian has received death threats, which Griffin called “specific” and “detailed.”
“You shouldn’t have to die for this,” Griffin said. The comic stressed that she stands by the apology she issued earlier in the week for the photo, taken by Tyler Shields. 
“I went way too far,” the comedian said at the time, adding, “It wasn’t funny. I get it.”
Trump tweeted his response on Wednesday, stating that his 11-year-old son Barron was having a particularly “hard time with this.”
Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!
Melania Trump also added her voice to the controversy.
“As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,” she said in a statement. “When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.”
Donald Trump, Jr. tweeted several times about the controversy, writing, “This is the left today. They consider this acceptable.” He also criticized CNN for not immediately cutting ties with the comedian.
Disgusting but not surprising. This is the left today. They consider this acceptable. Imagine a conservative did this to Obama as POTUS? https://t.co/QdghcbIjS7
Thank you. Will you work with her again if @CNN has her back in air? Asking for a lot of people. #LMK https://t.co/nXPYveZgPg
The image has been denounced by many other public figures and prompted an investigation by the Secret Service; a lawyer stated she planned to “fully cooperate.”
Griffin lost her decade-old gig hosting CNN’s New Year’s Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper, who shared words of criticism that seemed particularly hurtful to the comedian. A toilet stool company called Squatty Potty also cut ties with the comic, and Griffin said five scheduled tour dates have been canceled.
The image was created in response to Trump’s comments about former Fox News host Megyn Kelly. During the 2016 presidential primaries, Trump said Kelly had “blood coming out of her wherever” during a 2015 debate. 
“I don’t think I’m going to have a career after this,” Griffin said Friday. “He broke me.”
But this won’t be the last we see of her, if she can help it.
“You know what, I’m going to make fun of him more now,” Griffin said. “More.”
The first trailer for the Lifetime Michael Jackson biopic no one really wanted is here.
“Searching for Neverland,” based on a 2014 book by the late King of Pop’s former bodyguards Bill Whitfield and Javon Beard, focuses on the final years of Jackson’s life.
In the trailer, we catch glimpses of the star ― played by the self-proclaimed “world’s greatest” MJ impersonator Navi ― balancing his home life, on the infamous Neverland Ranch, with his fame and celebrity. To be honest, Navi makes a pretty convincing Jackson in some moments. 
In the 45-second clip, things get a little intense when investigators question Whitfield and Beard about Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor who gave Jackson a lethal dose of propofol just hours before his death. 
Given Lifetime’s history with unauthorized biopics (see: “Britney Ever After,” “Aaliyah: Princess of R&B”), we don’t have high hopes for this one. But you can be the judge when it airs on May 29 on Lifetime.

Justin Bieber lauded the bravery of the crowd as he appeared at the One Love Manchester benefit concert on Sunday night. 
The singer, one of many who performed throughout the night, walked onstage with just his guitar to sing “Love Yourself” and “Cold Water” (his collaboration with Major Lazer and MØ). 
Before he began, the 23-year-old shared some touching words with the crowd.
“I just want to say thank you so much for having me. You guys are so brave,” he said. “What an amazing thing we’re doing tonight, would you not agree? Would you agree that love always wins?” 
Justin Bieber's beautiful speech tonight 🙏🏼💛 #OneLoveManchester pic.twitter.com/o0t8hM1KY2
Once he finished singing, Bieber encouraged the crowd to chant “Love” and then said a prayer for the victims and their families. At one point, he held back tears as he told the crowd, “I just want to honor those who were lost, those that were taken from us. We love you so much, to the families we love you so much. Put both hands up to honor those people right now.”
Proceeds from the One Love Manchester benefit will go toward the victims and families affected by the tragic attack that took place at Manchester Arena last month during an Ariana Grande concert. A suicide bomb was detonated at the arena, killing 22 people, including children, and injuring at least 59 others. 
The benefit concert also took place just one night after terror struck in the U.K. once again. A vehicle plowed into a crowd of pedestrians, killing seven and injuring 50 more. The benefit seemed to take on an even more powerful meaning following the London attack, with the stars sharing uplifting messages in solidarity with both Manchester and London. 

Just when we thought the recent “Once Upon a Time” news couldn’t get any worse, another shocker rolls on in.
During a Build Series interview with HuffPost on Wednesday, Jamie Chung, who plays recurring character Mulan on ABC’s “Once Upon a Time,” tripped us up when we asked her about that mass exodus of cast members. 
Chung, who will be appearing on Fox’s new “X-Men” show “The Gifted” this fall, sort of, kind of, might have revealed that Season 7 of “Once” will be the show’s final season.
“I actually just ran into one of the creators the other night,” she said, referring to either Edward Kitsis or Adam Horowitz. “They’ve gone seven years, that’s a long time. But there are a couple of cast members coming back for the final, final season. They keep calling it the final season, but it’s just going to keep on going.” 
Wait ... what the Chung? Is it the final season, or isn’t it?? 
Chung didn’t elaborate, but when asked if she’d be back for “the final, final season,” she said, “I don’t know, we’ll see.” 
ABC had no comment on the subject.
Last week, it was revealed that Jennifer Morrison (Emma Swan), along with Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White), Josh Dallas (Prince Charming), Rebecca Mader (Wicked Witch Zelena), Jared S. Gilmore (Henry Mills) and Emilie de Ravin (Belle) would all be leaving the show, even though ABC’s not canceling it. Instead, Season 7 will focus on a new storyline including current characters Lana Parrilla (Regina/Evil Queen), Robert Carlyle (Gold/Rumpelstiltskin) and Colin O’Donoghue (Killian/Hook).
Kitsis and Horowitz explained the reboot of sorts to Deadline, saying they “reached a point where we felt like it was time to close certain chapters in the book that we were telling and to take some risks and move forward.”
Obviously those three [Parrilla/Carlyle/O’Donoghue] are very important to the storytelling we have planned for next season, as is Andrew West as the adult version of Henry, so it’s really four returning characters. And then there’s Allison Fernandez as his daughter, so that becomes kind of the core we’re building around.
We’re not ready to make any formal announcements yet, but we’re planning that there will be more regulars added to the mix and probably more recurring characters as we build out the universe of this iteration of the show.
So will the show find a new stride with Season 7 or, as Chung put it, will it be “the final, final season”? Only time will tell. 
Watch the full Build interview with Jamie Chung below. 

Bill Maher will be back on the air Friday. 
HBO has no plans to fire Maher after he used a racial slur during Friday’s episode of “Real Time,” TMZ reports, noting that the commercial-free company is not tied to advertisers since it is a subscription service. 
Quentin Schaffer, a spokesperson for the network, confirmed that Maher would be on his show as scheduled this coming Friday.
Maher joked that he was a “house n****r” in response to a comment from Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) that Maher should “work in the fields.” The audience responded to the comment with a mix of claps and groans. The host later apologized, saying he regretted using the “offensive” term.
“Friday nights are always my worst night of sleep because I’m up reflecting on the things I should or shouldn’t have said on my live show,” he said in a statement. “Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment. The word was offensive and I regret saying it and am very sorry.” 
HBO plans to edit the episode. 
“Bill Maher’s comment last night was completely inexcusable and tasteless,” Schaffer said in a statement. “We are removing his deeply offensive comment from any subsequent airings of the show.”
However, some have been calling for his termination. 
Please @HBO Do Not Air Another Episode Of Real Time With Bill Maher.
But really, @BillMaher has got to go. There are no explanations that make this acceptable. pic.twitter.com/K5XlEjekQ9
Not to have a take about this, but the CNN firing was so swift for Kathy Griffin and no word yet from HBO on Bill Maher.
I'm sure @CNN's instantaneous firing of Kathy Griffin vs @HBO continuing to employ Bill Maher has NOTHING to do with their genders, right? pic.twitter.com/JYUzEXY14q

Actor Tom Cruise confirmed Tuesday that “Top Gun 2” is “definitely happening.”
“It’s true. It’s true,” he told Australian morning show “Sunrise.” “I’m going to start filming it probably in the next year. I know. It’s happening. It is definitely happening, you’re the first people that I’ve said this to.”
But with few details on what the sequel to the hit 1986 movie will be about, Twitter users have been busy imagining a whole host of possible plot lines.
Some have suggested that the follow-up film could focus on drone strikes, while others have mockinglyasked how it will deal with the ageing of its stars some 30 years on.
Here’s a sampling of the best plot ideas so far:
@nktpnd Top Gun 2 mainly just takes place in the Pentagon trying to figure out why the F-35 is so behind schedule
Top Gun 2 is officially happening.Premise: Tom Cruise battles rude United Airlines flight attendants on a cross country flight.
Top Gun 2 is officially in the works. Get ready for the sweatiest, sexiest game of shuffleboard EVER.
Top Gun 2: Highway to the Calzone Zone
@Hardywolf359 What is the cast gonna do for #topgun2 ? Chase each other with their scooters??  ♿♿♿♿
Top Gun 2: Bottom Gun
You do know Top Gun 2 is just a series of endless ready to fly program meetings in which cost overruns and delivery slips are reported.
Top Gun 2 will be about Pete Mitchell breaking all the rules and then waiting on paperwork to clear to get DoD travel reimbursements.
"Top Gun 2" is happening and I just have one request... pic.twitter.com/1345ICZduF
Top Gun 2 is just three hours of maverick sitting in a windowless room staring at a monitor showing the feed from a drone camera
Top Gun 2: Tom Cruise is now a teacher at Top Gun school and all the students are drones. he's the only actor in the movie
Top Gun 2 should essentially be Grumpy Old Men with drones.
I heard in Top Gun 2 they give that lady's breath back
Top Gun 2 is about Maverick returning to the Navy because he's the only one who can get an old version of powerpoint to work.
Top Gun 2 is going to be 180 minutes of Tom Cruise sitting on a runway while his F-35A's code debugs until a $1000 drone explodes on him.
I've said it before: Tom Cruise is the Tom Skerritt/mentor for Goose's kid. "I flew with your old man. Damn good pilot." Iceman is a slob

Television is like a time capsule. Inevitably an era’s anxieties and priorities are reflected through entertainment. If we want to pinpoint what was going on socially, culturally and politically at any given moment looking to the kinds of shows that appear on television isn’t the worst way to do it. 
That’s why the new series that networks announced earlier this month as part of their 2017–2018 schedules can offer some insight into how Donald Trump’s presidency is affecting both what viewers are watching and the kinds of shows networks are programming.
Back in December, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey told audiences at the Content London media summit that the network was questioning its programming philosophy in the aftermath of Trump’s victory.
“With our dramas, we have a lot of shows that feature very well-to-do, well-educated people, who are driving very nice cars and living in extremely nice places,” she said. “There is definitely still room for that, and we absolutely want to continue to tell those stories because wish-fulfillment is a critical part of what we do as entertainers. But in recent history we haven’t paid enough attention to some of the true realities of what life is like for everyday Americans in our dramas.”
Ratings might have prompted that kind of self-reflection as much as Trump’s win. Nearly every politically driven show on both network and cable TV ― “Scandal,” “The Americans,” “Homeland,” “Madam Secretary,” “Designated Survivor” and “Quantico” ― saw a decline in viewership numbers through the election season and dropped further after Trump won. 
Cable news networks enjoyed huge ratings increases ahead of the election and continue to see impressive numbers as news of White House scandals break nearly every week. But a network like ABC, which airs “Scandal,” “Quantico,” and “Designated Survivor,” is definitely feeling the effects of political fatigue.
“Scandal,” in particular, feels like victim of the Trump era. Though the show’s ratings had been declining since 2015, it wasn’t in danger of being canceled. After the election, creator Shonda Rhimes would often say in interviews that she no longer knew what to do with the series now that Trump was president — the on-screen scandals handled by Olivia Pope and her Gladiators were still far more dramatic than anything on the nightly news, but the latest season’s first few episodes, which aired right after Trump’s inauguration, forced viewers to endure yet another election narrative and relive the loss felt on election night all over again. 
Even after the runaway success of the show’s early seasons, the announcement that “Scandal” would end after its seventh season didn’t come as a surprise. 
“I used to know how it ended, and then Donald Trump was elected. We had a destination, and I don’t know if that’s our destination anymore,” Rhimes told The Hollywood Reporter in April.
Similarly, she told The New York Times, “Our show is basically a horror story. Really. We say the people in Washington are monsters and if anybody ever knew what was really going on under the covers they would freak out. So they can do anything, they can murder people, they kill people and they get away with everything all the time.”
She added, “But that was based on a world in which Obama was president and our audience was happy about what was going on in Washington and they felt optimistic. You can always tell any horror story you want to when the light is on. But now the lights are off, and now I think people don’t want to watch horror stories, they want you to light a candle somewhere.”  
As for “Designated Survivor,” ABC’s freshman drama starring Kiefer Sutherland, the series premiered to strong ratings in September and then began hemorrhaging millions of viewers each week as the election drew closer and Trump won. Though the network wouldn’t flat-out blame ratings on Trump, Dungey came as close as she could.
“I think some of that has to do with White House politics fatigue ... It’s challenging right now in terms of making political shows just in general because there are big changes afoot in the world we live in, ” she told Entertainment Weekly in January, adding that the network planned on delving into the characters and their relationships. Which is another way of saying, they’re going to focus less on hard political storylines and rev up the romantic ones. 
After all of this, it seems that ABC didn’t rethink its programing philosophy after all. Rather than focus on series that show the reality of life for “everyday Americans” ― code for Trump voters ― when the new crop of shows were announced, Vanity Fair wondered if the network, which canceled its conservative-leaning hit “Last Man Standing,” was actually “quietly trolling” Trump?  
Counted among ABC’s new shows is “The Crossing,” in which “refugees from a war-torn country seek asylum in a small American fishing town, only the country these people are from is America ― and the way they are fleeing hasn’t happened yet.” There’s also “The Mayor,” which follows a rapper who runs for mayor as a publicity stunt and ends up winning. Both shows feel pretty pointed ― Dungey even called “The Mayor” “a timely riff on current events” ― but what might be even more telling are the pilots that ABC passed on.
The network declined to pick up the comedy “Libby & Malcolm” from “Blackish” creator Kenya Barris. Felicity Huffman and Courtney B. Vance were set to star as “two polar opposite political pundits, who fall in love despite all odds and form an insta-family as well as a work partnership.” ABC also passed on “Red Blooded,” a new drama from showrunner Marc Cherry, which was set to star Reba McEntire as the sheriff of a small town in Kentucky, “who finds her red state outlook challenged when a young FBI agent of Middle Eastern descent is sent to help her solve a horrific crime.”
Not having seen either show, it’s hard to say anything about either one, but both shows sound a little too on the nose when it comes to the let’s-put-our-differences-behind-us rhetoric. Given that political dramas (and even political comedies, in the case of “Veep”) are faltering in the Trump era, it’s not shocking that ABC would pass on these series.
That’s not to say audiences aren’t still thrilled by politics ― they just made MSNBC No. 1 in weekly primtime viewers for the first time in history ― but viewers are understandably exhausted and want to keep politics out of their entertainment. Plus, if anyone wanted to watch “two polar opposite political pundits” fall in love, they could just watch recently engaged co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski  bicker on “Morning Joe.”
Dungey previously told reporters that the current political climate was something ABC took into consideration when they crafted the fall schedule.
“There’s a lot of news, and I think people are definitely looking to television as a place where they want to feel — they want to laugh, they want to cry, they want to enjoy,” Dungey said during the network’s conference call before their presentation to advertisers earlier this month. “What the mood of the country has told us is that television is a little bit of an escape … That did frame a lot of our development thinking this season.”
If people are looking for an escape, that helps to explain why there are no less than eight superhero shows scheduled to premiere in the 2017–2018 season. “The Big Bang Theory” currently reigns supreme as TV’s  No. 1 show, suggesting audiences want to laugh more than they want to see political intrigue. “This Is Us” topped the charts among dramas, suggesting a yearning for stories focused on interpersonal relationships. Networks are doing their best in this new TV season to literally recreate the kind of programing that seems to be working ― see “Young Sheldon.”
The desire for some TV catharsis in the current political climate also explains why “Saturday Night Live” just wrapped its highest-rated season in years and why Stephen Colbert was just officially crowned the king of late-night for the 2016–2017 season. Audiences might be tired of watching what they perceive as a heavy-handed lecture on current events disguised as a soapy drama, but they are hungry for satire.
“It’s been harder in the past couple of years at ‘SNL’ because the culture is so fragmented. If you do a parody even of a huge show like ‘Game of Thrones,’ it doesn’t have the full cultural resonance of a ‘Cheers’ or ‘Friends,’” “SNL” writer and “Weekend Update” co-anchor Colin Jost told The Hollywood Reporter of the show’s increased popularity. “Whereas politics right now is probably the closest we’ve come to a full-blown national phenomenon as anything in a long time, and anytime people are paying more attention to politics, it’s good for our show. But you almost feel like a war profiteer at times because we’ve benefited from a situation that’s so tough.”
If politics feels all-consuming, then what becomes of the political drama? Shows like “House of Cards,” whose fifth season premieres on Netflix on May 30, are routinely being written off as “irrelevant,” with critics claiming writers couldn’t possibly come up with anything more outlandish than what’s actually happening in the IRL White House. Even Robin Wright, who plays Claire Underwood, recently joked that Trump stole all the show’s ideas for Season 6. Trump has yet to actually match “House of Cards” in its full absurdity, but there’s still time. 
With themes of nepotism, populism, voter suppression, constitutional crises, the possibility of impeachment and a growing body count, the fifth season of “House of Cards” is by no means boring, but it’s just not as binge-able in this current administration.
Netflix doesn’t release viewership data, so it’s impossible to know how many people have ever watched “House of Cards,” but its subscribers are probably feeling the same political fatigue that network and cable the viewers are experiencing ― something showrunners Melissa Gibson and Frank Pugliese acknowledge.
“Politics surrounding the presidency, in particular, has become more like a TV show than our TV show has become like politics, in a way,” Pugliese told HuffPost in a recent phone interview.  “So yeah, sometimes I feel like we are competing with a show that is on every day ― it’s the Trump Show. It’s 24 hours a day. But there is nothing we can do about that.”
The plot of “House of Cards” Season 5 isn’t ripped from the headlines — the show was already filming some of its last episodes on election day. But many of the show’s themes and plot points again parallel what’s actually happening in our government today and it blurs the line between fantasy and reality. If anything, viewing the show in the wake of Trump’s seemingly numerous scandals adds a layer of realism. It’s increasingly difficult to convince yourself the entire show isn’t a commentary on the current president.
Of course, Francis Underwood wormed his way into the White House long before Trump did.
“I think we are uniquely positioned to be in dialogue with the real world,” Gibson told HuffPost when asked if she thought it was inevitable that viewers would try to connect the show to Trump. “But of course, our world is distinct and a really fundamental difference is that Francis Underwood came up through the system. He’s a through and through politician, who is of the system. He’s trying to explode it, but he’s trying to explode it from within. Whereas Donald Trump is a proud outsider trying to blow things up from the outside.”
There are many more differences between Francis Underwood and Trump ― one is one of the most articulate characters on TV, while the other has a vocabulary of about 67 words ― but this is part of Trump’s effect on TV. Suddenly everything is about him, even when it’s not.
“We’re just reacting to a moment in time both culturally and politically. The same moment in time that sort of created Trump and in a sense has created Francis,” Pugliese added. “So the similarities are there just because they came out of something that’s been going on for the last few years. In a way, Francis is talking about nationalism and populism seasons ago. So there has just been stuff in the air that we tapped into.”
Ariana Grande’s One Love Manchester benefit concert has already raised more than $3.5 million for the families of the victims of the May 22 terrorist attack, and that number is only get bigger as the week drags along. 
The British Red Cross told HuffPost on Monday that people around the world donated $2.7 million by texting the word “LOVE” to 70507 during the Sunday concert, which triggered a £5 ($6.50) donation.
Additionally, the organization raised $600,000 through other online donations. 
All donations go to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund, which was started by the Manchester City Council and the British Red Cross in the aftermath of the attack.
“Our appeal will help alleviate immediate suffering and ensure victims and their families do not face short-term financial difficulties,” the British Red Cross stated on Sunday.  
Including donations during the concert, the fund has now received more than $12 million since its creation. Later this week, the number will get bigger when the money from One Love Manchester ticket sales is added to the total, the British Red Cross said. 
About 450,000 people donated money during the concert, which took place at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground in Manchester and was streamed in 50 countries over YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. 
Artists at the benefit included Grande, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber and Coldplay, as well as a surprise appearance by Oasis singer Liam Gallagher, who grew up in the area. 

ICYMI, “Pretty Little Liars” is coming to an end and the secret identity of “A,” or “Uber A,” or “A.D.,” will finally be revealed in a matter of weeks. 
But will fans be happy with the outcome? Or will we feel like we’ve just been strung along for seven years?
Well, Ian Harding, who plays Ezra Fitz on the Freeform show, thinks the ending will leave viewers “satisfied.” 
“I think it will turn out well. I think people will be satisfied to a point, and right when it seems like it’s going to be really great, it might do a little [turn],” the actor, who recently released his memoir Odd Birds, told HuffPost during a Build Series interview Tuesday.
“With A.D., the one juicy tidbit I could give is I was happy that this person, place or thing ― that is the AD, as I like to call them ― is not just some complete random.”
Harding continued, “What I think is really great is that it’s somebody that we’ve seen before. I’m happy it’s not going to be like, ‘This is Amos from the country,’ or somebody that nobody cares about. It should be good. People will be happy.” 
Harding, however, knows that “PLL” fans are very devoted to the storyline and will look into every detail until the truth is uncovered.
“I’ll see things on Twitter where people are like, ‘How could you do this to us?!’ And I want to be like, ‘That’s the point of a television show, to switch things up!’” he told HuffPost, adding that it’s bittersweet to say goodbye to the series he’s called home all these years.
“It was such a wonderful experience and, at times, it was really horrible. It was just all of those things at once,” he said. “What I remember the most is the people I was working with and the cast and what we were doing at that time. I could not tell you the dialogue from any scene that Lucy [Hale] and I had ... but it’s because I was talking to her about life and what she was going through, and seeing her grow up and seeing [myself] grow up. So that’s what I’m going to miss the most, because we really do feel like family in some way ― they feel like siblings of mine.” 
To hear more of Harding’s thoughts on “Pretty Little Liars” and Odd Birds, watch the full Build Series interview below.  
Correction: A previous version of this article claimed that Ian Harding said A.D. “plays her thing,” when he actually said “person, place or thing.” Sorry, “PLL” fans, A.D. could still be anyone! Shoutout to Reddit detectives. 

The internet may have just figured out “Blue’s Clues.”
We’ve already learned the real reason Steve left “Blue’s Clues,” but for decades (actual decades, since the show is now more than 20 years old) another question has baffled fans.
Why is Steve such an idiot? 
Idiot is a strong word. Steve is our dude. But as an example, in one episode Steve is trying to figure out what Blue needs to do, and his clues are bubbles, a towel and soap.
You don’t need to be all Robert Downey Jr. from “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” to realize that Blue needs a bath.
Steve suggests putting the bubbles in between the other two items to make a bubble sandwich. 
That’s the situation we’re dealing with here.
There have already been theories online that Steve is actually in an asylum or has lost his mind in some way, but now a Reddit user has come up with a solution that makes perfect sense:
Redditor Chengweiyingji explains that if you put the clues together, it’s clear that “Steve isn’t an idiot.” He’s simply “playing dumb” because he’s babysitting kids:
First, if you’ve ever watched Blue’s Clues you’d know that children shout “A clue! A clue!”. So there are children in Steve’s house.
The clincher is that Steve eventually goes to college.
Where’d he get the money for that? And how could he get into college if he doesn’t realize that bubbles, a towel and soap mean Blue needs a bath?
Bubble sandwich? SMH, Steve.
Chengweiyingji explains:
Second, Steve leaves for college at the end of Season 4 — apologies for the video source. Now, he never said anything to said children until this point, but he has to have tuition money somewhere. And where would he get it? From the children’s parents (as well as that hopscotch scholarship). While this video shows Steve being the lovable idiot we all know, he did get into college.
The Redditor tells HuffPost that the theory came from watching the YouTube channel “SteveIsWrong,” which points out Steve isn’t “the sharpest tool in the shed,” but the pervading theories that he was insane were “horrible.”
“I started thinking about it though. I noted that if Steve was as dumb as that channel theorized, how did he get into college? I mean, you need to have some intelligence to get into college. Then I realized — he’s not dumb, he’s just entertaining the children with him (such as myself when I was little),” said our theorist.
Indeed, comments from Steve Burns himself, aka Steve from “Blue’s Clues,” may further support the idea. In an interview with HuffPost, Burns praised the show for the meticulous research that went into it, calling it an “educational endeavor, first and foremost.”
He has also said that his job was to speak through the camera and form a relationship with the individual kids through the TV.
You certainly don’t want your kids learning from someone who’s an actual nincompoop. And who hasn’t lost a babysitter to higher education?
We can’t officially call it confirmed, but even Steve could probably figure this one out.

Corinne Olympios is speaking out about an alleged sexual incident that is said to have taken place during the taping of reality show “Bachelor in Paradise” last week.
ABC halted production of the show on Sunday over “allegations of misconduct” apparently involving Olympios and fellow cast member DeMario Jackson. Olympios has now hired top Hollywood attorney Marty Singer to represent her throughout Warner Bros.’ investigation into the situation.
In a statement released by her rep, Stan Rosenfield, Olympios characterized the incident as a nightmare becoming reality:
I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened the June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production.
As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.
According to multiple reports, a highly intoxicated Olympios had a sexual encounter with Jackson in a swimming pool while crew members continued filming. Following that, a field producer reportedly filed a formal complaint and Warner Bros. suspended production of the show, sending the rest of the cast back to the U.S.
“Once the investigation is complete,” Warner Bros. said in a statement earlier this week, “we will take appropriate responsive action.”
Jackson, who reportedly claims that the sexual acts were consensual, also spoke out, telling Entertainment Tonight, “I have nothing to say. You know, Corinne’s an awesome girl and that’s all I have to say.” He added of his fans, “Love you all, thank you for the support.”
“Bachelor in Paradise” Season 4, which was set to debut Aug. 8, brings together former contestants from “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” for another shot at love.
At this point, it’s safe to say the show probably won’t go on. 

The motto for tonight is: Boy Bye #TheBachelorette
Thirteen years after “Friends” ended its 10-season run comes “Friends! The Musical!”
Yes, Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Pheobe will be there for you, singing their hearts out, as they “navigate the pitfalls of work, life and love in 1990s Manhattan.”
Written by pop culture parody masters Bob and Tobly McSmith ― the brains behind previous off-Broadway hits “90210! The Musical!,” “Katdashians! The Musical!” and the “Saved by the Bell” parody “Bayside! The Musical!” ― “Friends!” is sure to be just as wonderful, snarky and over-the-top as the duo’s past shows. 
Judging from the song titles, the musical promises to highlight the sitcom’s best, most memorable and most absurd moments: 
In some of their past productions, the McSmiths have convinced former cast members to guest star for a show or two. We don’t expect to see anyone making cameos this time around, but who knows?
Tickets for “Friends! The Musical!” go on sale in June. The show will open sometime in Fall 2017 at the Triad Theater in New York. 
 
Do people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows? It’s unclear. But here at “Here to Make Friends,” we both love and love to hate them — and we love to snarkily dissect each episode in vivid detail. Podcast edited by Nick Offenberg.

As a stand-up who has had tomatoes hurled at him by a displeased audience during his act ― and, in the interests of full disclosure, the tomatoes were followed by mixed salad greens and a lounge chair (no kidding) ― I can’t help but feel empathy for Kathy Griffin, or any comedian, who inadvertently pisses off their audience. 
There is a big difference, however, between how I bombed and how Kathy Griffin bombed with her ill-conceived severed Trump-head photo. Bombing before a live audience solely because you’re not funny, as I did, isn’t anywhere near as disturbing as bombing before a global audience because you’re not funny and socially tone deaf, and/or crassly insensitive to a marginalized or victimized group. 
At the risk of stating the obvious: A comedian who doesn’t transgress by “crossing the line” ― whatever and wherever that ever-shifting line may be ― isn’t a very good comedian. Great comic talents not only cross the line, they move well beyond it into new terrain. 
Think Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Louis CK and Jerrod Carmichael, to name a handful of superb comedy provocateurs. They have all been unapologetically outspoken, despite offending many people. Also, at one time or another, they have all made even their most ardent fans squirm with jokes that were off the mark. 
Offending people becomes a problem for comedians only when they can’t stand by their material. It is worth noting that Stephen Colbert did not apologize, nor should have, for his recent use of the term “cock holster” in a joke referring to what Donald Trump’s mouth is best suited for in relation to Vladimir Putin. Colbert’s language was crass, but his satiric point was spot on. Knowing that, he was able to firmly defend his comedy ground. 
Bill Maher was not able to do that in the tense aftermath of 9-11 when he observed, “Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, it’s not cowardly.”  However, in his Mea culpa he admitted no error in judgement: “I offer my apologies to anyone who took it (what he said) wrong.” In other words, “don’t blame me.” 
What makes Kathy Griffin’s situation substantively different is that, upon further review, she agrees with her critics that her joke was deeply offensive and without merit. That being the case, she felt compelled to post an on-camera apology, in which she admitted with much embarrassment, “I went way too far.” 
That doesn’t mean that Kathy Griffin is a bad person, a lousy comedian, or sick in the head; it just means that she made a made a terrible comedy decision, which is humbling, humiliating and potentially career-threatening. Just ask Michael Richards. 
 
 
Does anyone know what the former “Seinfeld” star is up to these days? Sadly, he is as much remembered for his memorable portrayal as “Kramer” as he is for his infamously awful stand-up rant at the Laugh Factory in 2006 that devolved into racist tirade. A shell-shocked Richards went on “The Late Show” to tell David Letterman that he was “deeply, deeply sorry,” and years later confessed that the incident had “broke him down.” 
Gilbert Gottfried’s career has recovered from his stupefying lapse of comedy judgement in 2011, when in the aftermath of a horrific tsunami in Japan, he posted a series of highly offensive tweets which cost him his gig as the voice of the Aflac Duck. When even Gilbert can’t defend a joke, you know it’s over the line. “I sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my attempt at humor regarding the tragedy in Japan,” he said in a statement.
In 2007, Don Imus lost his job at MSNBC after referring to the Rutgers women’s basketball team as “nappy-headed hos.” It took him a few days, but he finally came around to admitting, “Our characterization was thoughtless and stupid, and we are sorry.” 
Also very sorry that same year were Opie and Anthony for airing the crude comments of a homeless man who expressed interest in having sex with Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush and Queen Elizabeth: “We apologize to the public officials for the comments that were made on our show.” Yeah, right. 
Kathy Griffin is hardly the first comedian to totally misread the culture and lose her job, and she certainly won’t be the last. Insult comedians, edgy political satirists and shock jocks build careers on their outrageous fearlessness. They all want to “cross the line,” yet somehow remain within the bounds of cultural acceptability. The problem with that is it’s not always possible. 
As a comedy writer and performer, I frequently ask myself, have I pushed the proverbial envelope too far, or not far enough? I make my best guess, but ultimately it is the audience that decides. 
For what it’s worth, in my 40 years in comedy I have learned at least one thing: When being bombarded by tomatoes, leave the stage quickly, if for no other reason than to get a new shirt. And then, get back out there with new stuff, which is exactly what Kathy Griffin is going to do. 
Joe Raiola is Senior Editor of MAD Magazine and Producer of the Annual John Lennon Tribute in NYC. He has performed his solo show, “The Joy of Censorship” in over 40 states.
HBO has renewed “Veep” and “Silicon Valley,” but the latter will lose one of its key stars. T.J. Miller, who plays incubator chief Erlich Bachman, isn’t returning after the current season ends. 
HBO released the following statement on Thursday: “The producers of ‘Silicon Valley’ and T.J. Miller have mutually agreed that T.J. will not return for season 5. In Erlich Bachman, T.J. has brought to life an unforgettable character, and while his presence on the show will be missed, we appreciate his contribution and look forward to future collaborations.”
Without further explanation, it’s reasonable to assume that Miller’s burgeoning film career contributed to his decision to exit the show after four seasons. If so, he’ll find himself in mixed company: George Clooney (”ER”), Shelley Long (”Cheers”), Katherine Heigl (”Grey’s Anatomy”) and Dan Stevens (”Downton Abbey”) are among the actors who’ve abandoned series for big-screen pursuits. After Miller’s HBO stand-up special premieres June 17, he will voice the lead character in “The Emoji Movie.” Next year, he’ll appear in Steven Spielberg’s much-anticipated adaptation of “Ready Player One.” He’s also expected to have a bigger role in the “Deadpool” sequel. 
It’s unclear whether the “Silicon Valley” season finale, which airs June 25, will address Miller’s departure. (”This is all the info we have to share now,” an HBO rep told HuffPost when asked.) The rest of the cast is expected to return to the show, whose overnight ratings have dipped now that “Game of Thrones” isn’t airing as its lead-in.
There may never be peace in this prank war.
Ellen DeGeneres shocked “Today” host Matt Lauer ― and we mean SHOCKED ― when a man in a dress burst out of a box as they conversed on her show Thursday.
“No!” Lauer said as he tried to compose himself. “It’s so petty. It’s so childish.”
DeGeneres seemed pretty darn proud of herself. “That was my favorite so far,” she said.
In a 2015 prank, DeGeneres made Lauer appear as if he were shirtless in bondage gear during a “Fifty Shades Of Grey” interview. A vengeful Lauer later stuffed DeGeneres’ car with thousands of pingpong balls.
This time, DeGeneres had producer Corey Palent dress like Lauer’s “Today” colleague Savannah Guthrie, waiting to pop out. When the discussion turned to Guthrie and Lauer’s musical tastes, the jack-in-the-box moment happened.
You can watch it happen around the 3:25 mark.

If “Risky Business” is about a loss of innocence (sexual or otherwise) among a group of college-bound teenagers, then Tom Cruise apparently went full-tilt method behind the scenes, according to an excerpt from a new memoir by co-star Curtis Armstrong.
He wasn’t sending the cast condoms or a live rat (for the last time, Jared Leto needs to chill). But despite his reputation as a straight-laced, Bible-reading and generally upstanding guy on set, Cruise was allegedly engaging in some extracurricular activities with a host of young women.
Armstrong, who plays Cruise’s character’s poker buddy, Miles Dalby, kept detailed notes about his experience working with the rising star while filming the comedy during the summer of 1982. 
Apparently, one night Cruise declined to go out drinking with Armstrong and other co-stars in order to prepare for the next day and bone up on the Bible. Armstrong describes the actor as a self-identified born-again Christian who “made straight arrows look like corkscrews.” That is, until he discovered what Cruise was actually up to during his nights alone. 
“Returning late one night, I found three or four young girls — late teens, I suspect — lined up in the hall outside of Tom’s room,” Armstrong writes in his memoir, Revenge of the Nerd. “I remember thinking, ‘Tom’s going to be really upset if these hot girls interfere with his Bible reading.’ So I asked them, with all the stern gravitas of my 28 years, if there was something I could do to help them.”
“They just stared at me, and at that moment, Tom’s door opened and another girl came out, adjusting her hair and taking off down the hall, while the first girl in line slipped into Tom’s room,” he continued. “This was a young man who knew something about time management and understood how to successfully juggle Bible study and blow jobs. I went to bed alone that night thinking it served me right for not being religious.”
Instead of the “Risky Business” reboot Hollywood is sure to screw up any day now, let’s just adapt this memoir for the screen right now, because nothing in the film could ever be, well, so risky. 
To read the full excerpt from Armstrong’s memoir, head over to The Hollywood Reporter. 
HuffPost has reached out to Cruise’s representatives and will update this post accordingly. 

The most endearing yet frustrating thing about Jessica Simpson is the “dumb blonde” persona she cooked up somewhere in the early 2000s, when “Irresistible” was still a bop and her father wasn’t dressing like a misguided teenage fashionista. Just kidding, “Irresistible” will always be a bop. 
It was, however, a bit more charming back when Nick Lachey was there to remind her that, yes, what she was eating was fish, not chicken, and she wasn’t making things uncomfortable for everybody on a daytime talk show. 
Fast-forward to Monday’s episode of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” with peak Simpson on full display, as she kicked off the interview by informing the public about her childbearing future literally three seconds after sitting down. 
“I’m not pregnant on your show!” Simpson exclaimed. 
“Are you sure that you’re not pregnant?” Ellen DeGeneres asked. “I heard that you were.”
“Oh, gosh!” the singer replied. “We had an IUD. Nothing’s gonna get in that uterus!”
Refusing to swing at softballs, DeGeneres laughed and said, “I’m not touching that.”
What followed was a stop-start exchange between the two, with DeGeneres trying to keep Simpson on track as she subjected everyone to a painfully off-topic story about mermaids for hire and fumbled over basic math when asked how long she’s been with husband Eric Johnson. 
“That’s a long time. I don’t know if I’ve ever had a seven-year relationship, other than with a woman,” Simpson said.
“No, not that!” she added after DeGeneres essentially pulled a Jim from “The Office” and looked at the camera. “No! I mean, my besties that understand me.” 
Ellen breaking the fourth wall is all of us. 
Watch a clip from the interview above. 

Jenna Maroney — uh, we mean Jane Krakowski — came out to talk about “boating lights” during “Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU” Friday night.
“It’s a matter of safety!” Krakowski exclaimed. She implores viewers boating in the dark to “just use a light.”
“Boats just speeding around in the dark, not a care. I mean, you could end up driving your boat right into the mouth of a whale! And don’t believe the propaganda. I looked it up and I couldn’t find one confirmed instance of boater fraud. Remember: Boat at night, use a light.”
Very cheeky, Jane.

Soundgarden rocker Chris Cornell was laid to rest on Friday in a funeral and memorial service at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery attended by celebrities Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Courtney Love and the singer’s family.
Cornell, 52, was found dead in his hotel in Detroit last week hours after his band played a concert in the city. The Detroit Medical Examiners Office determined he had committed suicide by hanging himself.
Outside the cemetery, dozens of fans gathered to pay tribute to the grunge rocker. 
“Honestly, it feels like I’ve had a death in my family,” said Regina Padilla, 42, who took the day off of work and drove 40 miles (60 km) to attend the service.
“I just feel like his life was cut short,” she added.
Cornell had spoken openly of his drug and alcohol addiction in the past, as well as periods of depression and agoraphobia.
But his wife, Vicky, said last week she did not believe the singer intended to kill himself, suggesting that an anxiety drug he was taking may have played a role in impairing his judgment.
In an emotional open letter published by Billboard this week, she said she was sorry she was not with her husband the night he died.
“I’m sorry, my sweet love, that I did not see what happened to you that night,” she wrote. “I’m sorry you were alone, and I know that was not you, my sweet Christopher.”
After Soundgarden broke up in 1997, Cornell in 2001 joined members of Rage Against The Machine to form Audioslave, which released an acclaimed self-titled album. Soundgarden reunited in 2010 and the band embarked on its latest tour in April.
A lot of his lyrics could be sad, but his music was so beautiful,” said fan Chris Heathcoat, 46, who brought white roses to the cemetery.
“Chris was also like that second brother I never had that can sing my pain away or sing me to sleep or wake me up and give me the determination to move on,” he said.
Seattle-born Cornell was the latest member of the elite 1990s grunge rock movement to die from either a drug overdose or suicide. Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, who was married to Courtney Love, killed himself in 1994. Layne Staley of Alice in Chains and Scott Weiland of the Stone Temple Pilots both died of drug overdoses. 

It’s been a busy – and controversial – year for Wonder Woman.

In October 2016, the United Nations made a curious appointment: Wonder Woman would be the global organisation’s new Ambassador for Women’s Empowerment, aligned with the launch of a new campaign to fuel Sustainable Development Goal number five, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030.

The announcement, which coincided with Wonder Woman’s 75th birthday and a new Hollywood super-production about the comic book character, was met with a great deal of criticism.

While the fictional feminist icon has long been a representative of strong, liberated women, her Western appearance, sexualised image and unrealistic beauty don’t resonate with millions of young women around the world. They’re actually alienating.

Feminists skewered the decision. Was the UN implying that no flesh-and-blood woman was up to the task?

Over 44,000 people signed a petition resulting in “one less woman in politics”. Just as quickly as she’d got it, Wonder Woman lost her job.


She’s still winning at the box office though. The film, released on June 2, has already brought in US$571 million worldwide.

Director Patty Jenkin’s Wonder Woman is being hailed as a “masterpiece of subversive feminism”. It is the first time since 1984’s Supergirl that a female superhero has anchored a film.

This woman-directed, woman-led film tells a story of justice, of a character who fights evil forces for the greater good. As Wonder Woman, Gal Godot overcomes the trite “damsel in distress” narrative and rescues her own damn self. But are we being overly generous with the feminist label here?

In a recent article, the Hollywood Reporter said that Warner Bros had created “what one might describe as a postfeminist Wonder Woman”, with Jenkins “temper[ing] the character’s traditional strength with vulnerability.”

Even Gadot, the film’s Israeli star, is quoted as saying, “Credit Patty for not turning [Wonder Woman] into a ballbuster” – not the most feminist of concepts.

Rather than represent real women, Wonder Woman satisfies the societal image of the ideal woman. Inhumanly strong, super sexy and bolstered by her exceptionalism, Wonder Woman is a “walking contradiction of the competing demands placed on women’s shoulders today”.

How many actual women or girls around the world can live up to Wonder Woman as a role model? Would we even want them to?

Also lacking in laudatory reviews of Wonder Woman is the idea of intersectionality – the acknowledgement that women’s multiple identities (not just sex but also gender identity, race, class, sexual orientation, religion and others) expose them to numerous forms of oppression.

Why haven’t feminists noted that the film is, quite simply, too Western and too white?


In Lebanon, where I currently live and work, Wonder Woman was banned nationwide, upsetting fans, shocking civil liberties groups and raising concerns about government censorship.

The decision is based on the Israel Boycott Law of 1955, which prohibits economic relations with Israel, “an enemy state”, including with any “institutions or persons having residence in Israel”. Actress Gal Godot is clearly among them.

Lebanon and Israel have a long history of conflict (the most recent flare-up occurred in 2006), and Lebanon forbids its citizens from travelling to Israel. It also prohibits entry to anyone with an Israeli passport stamp and forbids the purchase of Israeli products.

More than a political disagreement, the Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel-Lebanon explains, this is “resistance against occupation”, which is to say that the ban isn’t about Israelis or Judaism but rather about the government-supported Zionist project that has resulted in human rights violations against Palestine and the Palestinian people.

But enforcement of the law is uneven. Hewlett-Packard and Coca-Cola, supposedly banned, are actively operating here, and Lebanon has previously screened films featuring Israeli actors, including Star Wars (with Natalie Portman) and the Fast and Furious series (with Gal Gadot).

Nor is the Lebanese government consistent in supporting the Palestinian people. Palestinians here are routinely denied access to jobs, healthcare and citizenship. In Lebanon, popular sentiment on Palestine ranges from indifference and resentment to outright discrimination.

As the Lebanese researcher Halim Shebaya noted in a June 2 opinion piece, it would have been a much more powerful statement if the Lebanese people had refused to see Wonder Woman because it symbolised oppression than for politicians to make that decision for them.

If this ban was an act of solidarity, it’s unlikely that Palestinians here or elsewhere saw it that way. Letting the film run and then donating the proceeds to support Palestinians living in Lebanon – perhaps to Palestinian women’s organisations – would have been read more clearly as solidarity.


Lebanon’s dubious ban and Wonder Woman’s dubious feminism may seem poles apart but the two are, in fact, related – because of intersectionality, of course.

In both the Arab region and the United States, there is a growing debate about whether feminism and Zionism are compatible.

One camp claims that they are, a position that the Sarah Lawrence College student Andrea Cantor laid out for the Huffington Post earlier this year.

“Israel is more than a government” she wrote. “It is a country that allows trans people into the army,” and has “progressive stances on women’s and LGBTQIA’s rights”.

The other side questions that notion. Linda Sarsour, a prominent Palestian-American activist, has been an outspoken proponent of the view that you can’t be a Zionist feminist.

As an Arab woman raised in America, I don’t so much question the choice of Gal Gadot to play Wonder Woman – because, in point of fact, Hollywood rarely denies actors roles because of their beliefs and moviegoers hardly care – but her elevation as a global feminist icon. Is it appropriate that an outspoken Zionist – a woman who supports the idea of a national identity rooted in another’s national erasure – should become the emblem of powerful Western womanhood?

In the end, despite its efforts, Wonder Woman merely exposes the dominant narrative of white women’s feminism and the global indifference to Palestine’s plight. Its failures to challenge the status quo are too important to ignore, because a feminism rooted in oppression is no feminism at all.

And that’s a wrap.
After six years, Aisha Tyler will say goodbye to “The Talk.” On Thursday, the co-host fought back tears while announcing her upcoming departure from the CBS daytime talk show.
“I have had an amazing six years with you guys,” Tyler said. “We’ve had babies and weddings, and you know good things have happened, and you know I went through the biggest breakup of my life with you. I could not have done with this without you. I’ll never be able to thank you guys enough for your friendship.” 
Tyler, 46, said a busy work schedule led to the decision to part ways with the show. It’s no wonder. Tyler appears in the CBS series “Criminal Minds,” hosts The CW’s “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” and lends her voice to the FX animated show “Archer.” Going forward, Tyler’s plate will get a bit fuller. She recently directed her first feature film and hopes to sit in the director’s chair more often down the line.
“I’m very lucky to be this busy,” she said, adding, “Coming here is such a joy that it never feels like work to me.”
Tyler will exit the show after the current season, leaving current co-hosts Julie Chen, Sharon Osbourne, Sara Gilbert and Sheryl Underwood. But she promises to come back to guest-host. 

Selena Gomez may be a bad liar, but there doesn’t appear to be any bad blood between her and Taylor Swift.
If you haven’t seen Gomez’s music video for “Bad Liar,” allow us to break it down for you. In the clip, Gomez stars as all four main characters: an awkward teen girl, her high school principal father, the pretty gym coach she and her dad are both obsessed with, and her mother. But there does appear to be a face that’s not Gomez’s in the mix, and it looks an awful lot like Swift.
Did you catch it?
How about now?
We have to admit, we didn’t notice this possible cameo on the first, second, or 53rd viewings of “Bad Liar.” But an eagle-eyed Buzzfeed writer pointed out that a woman who looks like Swift is pictured on a “Charlie’s Angels”-esque poster on the back wall of Gomez’s bedroom.
No confirmation yet from Gomez’s camp on whether it’s for sure the “Shake It Off” singer, or the identity of the other two ladies on the poster.
But if it is indeed the pop star, it sounds like Gomez and Swift’s friendship is as strong as ever. And who knows? Maybe Swift will appear for real in Gomez’s next video, “Fetish.” As we all know, there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other, and a special place in heaven for women who feature each other in their music videos.

Patton Oswalt is beginning to move forward.
The comedian joined actress Meredith Salenger on the red carpet Wednesday night in Los Angeles for the premiere of “Baby Driver.”
He and the actress held hands and posed for photos outside the Ace Hotel.  
Salenger, who is a Harvard grad, starred in 1985’s “The Journey of Natty Gann,” with other credits including “Lake Placid” and “Hollywood Heights.”
She shared a sweet photo on social media earlier this week about being “super in love.”

The comedian’s wife, crime writer Michelle McNamera, died suddenly in April 2016 from a combination of prescription medications and an undiagnosed heart problem. He has been candid about the difficulty of coping with her death. 
“I’ll never be at 100 percent again, but that won’t stop me from living this,” the comedian shared late last year.

In the span of approximately two years, Colton Haynes ditched his MTV and CW roots, came out, fired his management and took some time off. Now, he’s returning from his hiatus wearing nothing but a glittering thong. The rowdy new comedy “Rough Night,” about a Miami bachelorette weekend gone wrong, features Haynes as a stripper who plays a pivotal role in the movie’s third-act twist.
When I sat down with the 28-year-old actor, who found fame on the television series “Teen Wolf” and “Arrow,” he was candid about the highs and lows of publicly declaring his sexuality. Newly engaged and freed from the leash of career advisers who wanted to market him as straight, Haynes has processed the anxiety that accompanied his private life being laid bare. It’s as good an excuse as any to expose himself to the world, thong and all.
When offered a movie like “Rough Night,” is the fact that you’re wearing only a thong in most of your scenes part of the pitch?
I have no idea. I literally quit acting for over a year and then I re-signed with a new agency, and then they called me. They were like, “Hey, you just got offered this role.” I said, “I got offered … why? What? With Scarlett Johansson? What? Can you call them back and make sure they’re not looking for Jesse McCartney or someone else?” They weren’t, so I was excited.
Is Jesse McCartney really where your mind went as the alternate Colton Haynes?
I love Jesse McCartney, but I am always mistaken for him. I don’t know why. It’s just a funny thing — people will have conversations with me as if I’m Jesse McCartney. I’ve never met him; he seems like the coolest person ever, but I’m not him.
You took a year off after leaving “Arrow.”
Yeah, I took a year off after “Arrow” and dealt with some personal issues. Then, I came back with a really positive mindset and this came along.
Was that during the coming-out?
The coming-out thing was a year ago in May, so yeah, it was basically that whole process. When that happened, it was me figuring out, “OK, is this a good move?” I parted ways with my team, and it was a really tricky year for me. My anxiety was terrible, and eventually I was like, “I’m not going to literally waste the last 10 years of my life.” So I started back and it’s going well.
Did you anticipate a moment where you’d need to make a public declaration about your sexuality and then ride out the attention it would receive?
No, I never thought — I’ve been told by so many people that you cannot be out and have a career. Literally people would set me up with girls for press. The craziest thing was my career actually became the best it’s ever been once I actually was true to myself. That happened, and it was the most amazing experience. I was in Paris the day that the EW article dropped, and I cried for three days straight.
Good cry?
It was amazing. Good cry, yeah. I was happy at the outpouring. Marc Snetiker wrote the best article, and then eventually I did the Out cover, which also was a good article. Now I live a more free and open life. It’s nice ― people have now started giving me work because of it, and it’s been really awesome.
Every gay person seems to have an opinion about how every other gay person should behave, especially when it involves celebrities.
Oh, 100 percent.
Did you get a sense of some people saying you’d done it the wrong way?
Oh, there was a very public thing, without naming names. I think people are not very well-informed, so if someone didn’t know that I literally did a three-page article coming out, then they could say some things. I think that whole situation was just not being informed. But the outpouring of people being like, “Oh, we knew the whole time,” that’s cool, but so did I. It’s this whole juxtaposition of “I also knew I was gay, as well.” I know you knew, and so did I, and I struggled with it for so long. Then, when it happened, I just started working nonstop on stuff I can’t talk about yet.
In what context were you set up with women?
I would be at a party. There was this whole story that ran with Lauren Conrad, who I love — she’s the best. Basically my old manager at the time was like, “Oh, take a picture with her.” He just basically ran this story trying to say that I was dating Lauren Conrad. It was there for about six months. I was like, “Oh, great, I have to do this.” That’s how it is in Hollywood. But not anymore. You have all these amazing showrunners who actually embrace people’s personal lives and embrace people’s truth. I think that’s really pivotal.
I’m surprised you were dealing with that even a few years ago. I figured we’d moved past that.
Yeah, I did that for seven or eight years. I was told by my first manager, like 10 years ago, “You will never work in this town if people know [you’re gay].”
I assume that’s what led to your management changes.
Oh God, yeah. That was like, “Bye! You gotta get out.” God. I wish I could say more.
You can!
[Laughs] Yeah. It was a compete team change.
So you’re just hanging out, and then you’re called upon for this “Rough Night” role with Kate McKinnon and these other funny women, where you’ll appear in only a thong.
Literally naked and I had no time to prepare. It was really fun when we were doing the movie. Especially Scarlett, she couldn’t stop laughing during the scene where my suit gets ripped off. In only one take she didn’t laugh. I wouldn’t say I’m a nudist, but I don’t care about that kind of stuff. It was super easy. I didn’t really have time to work out, but I don’t really care about that stuff. It was fun, but the thong was really uncomfortable.
Did your comfort level come from your experience modeling?
Yeah, I wanted to act because I did theater as a kid, but when I started modeling, it just got me so comfortable in front of the camera. I’m a nervous type of person all the time, but when you’re growing up in New York starting being a model, you really have no inhibitions. It was really easy and fun. It was funny because it wasn’t like I was playing some sexy guy — I was this really scared, quirky, weird, funny guy. And they kept giving me more. It was supposed to just be one scene and they kept giving me more.
After leaving “Arrow,” were you worried about being branded a CW star?
Yeah, you do come across that. I wasn’t worried because I don’t put too much thought into it, but at the time, when I started “Teen Wolf,” I was 21 years old. When I left “Arrow,” I was still 26 or something. I just wanted to take some time off to try to figure out if I can do anything beyond that. Not that it was bad — it was so fun, all those experiences. But I just mentally broke. My brain broke.
Because the production schedule was grueling?
Realistically, it was my personal life. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t even go to work. It really was so debilitating that I would faint at work. I would literally not be able to speak because I was so nervous. I had to get ahold of that before I could come back and do stuff. They were all so, so amazing and saw me crumbling. I was able to get out that. But with things like that, people are branded as CW or MTV stars, but it’s a really great platform. It’s a good start. A lot of people that have started doing that have gone on to do a lot of things. I definitely came out on the other side, but I don’t think I was worried.
What did you do to get a handle on that anxiety?
I have no idea. I don’t think I still am ahold of it. I was joking with my friend and publicist, Chase, yesterday. We were just getting on a plane and I saw a photographer outside the airport. Luckily, he didn’t know who I was and didn’t take a picture of me, but I literally panic sometimes. It’s that thing of your privacy being taken away. People think you are your character. And I’m so down and cool and chill with people, but when there’s a lot of my privacy being taken away, it makes me feel in a box.
Do you feel similarly when you sense someone with an iPhone snapping a photo in your periphery?
I can always sense it, yeah. I don’t care at all. I’m the first person to say “fuck” and grab their phone and say, “Let’s do a Snapchat.” I don’t care about that — it’s certain situations. I had a bad break-in at my house, and also with photographers and people knowing where you are, it’s tricky. Like, how the fuck did you know I was here?
You’re at a comfortable level of fame for managing that. Are you prepared for what might happen as your profile continues to grow?
It’s funny because I was having the same conversation with someone last week. They were like, “You’re here, but what’s going to happen if you’re there?” I’ll be fine. I’ll think about that if that happens. If I’m lucky enough to do that and have that steady work and that kind of recognition, that would be great. Then, I’ll cross that path and get a bunch of Xanax.
You auditioned for “Twilight.” Given the level of intense fame those stars encountered, and how much they’ve had to distance themselves from the images that movie gave them, are you glad you didn’t get the role?
Oh my God. I talk about this all the time. I actually came across that script — I still have it; it’s in mint condition. I love Taylor Lautner — he’s the sweetest guy in the world, and he came out of it incredibly. He’s such a good guy, but I don’t know if, at that young age, I would have been able to do that. But if you watch Kristen Stewart’s interviews, she’s like, “We were the best family, it was amazing.” That young, I don’t know if I could have done it.
And even though she, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner made off OK, you know the frenzy of that fame will always haunt them, to a degree.
Oh yeah, I mean, that was an explosion. It was crazy. That would have been crazy. And then me coming out after “Twilight”? That would have been too much.
Your coming-out experience would have been so much more magnified than it already was.
“You’re not our Edward!”
Oh, I didn’t even think about it from that perspective. That’s a whole other rabbit hole.
“We’re Team Jacob.” That would have been hilarious.
“Rough Night” opens June 16. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.
“Gossip Girl” epitomized the dramatic and decadent lifestyles of privileged Upper East Side teens against a New York City backdrop, but that all might’ve been lost had the show filmed in ― gasp! ― Canada. 
“Josh [Schwartz] and Stephanie [Savage] refused to do the show in Toronto,” Blake Lively revealed to Variety about the proposed film location. “They said, ‘No, New York City is the star of the show.’ And so they fought for it to be made in New York. If we would have been in Toronto, I don’t know if we would have made it past our first episode ... We were always in the coolest new spots. It was almost like a city guide as well as a fun show to watch. We were one of the first people to be at ‘Sleep No More.’” 
A fake Manhattan set?! Perish the thought. 
“Gossip Girl” creator Schwartz discussed how important Manhattan was for the storyline in a 2007 interview with The New York Times, explaining how he pushed for the location despite the additional costs shooting there would entail.
“I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York because we want New York to be a character in the show,” he said. “In my mind, there really hasn’t been a show that has that opulence and that wealth and that setting since the days of ‘Dynasty’ and ‘Dallas.’” 
When asked about the possibility of a reboot, Lively told Variety she’s on the fence about resuming her role as Serena van der Woodsen. 
“It sort of all depends,” she told Variety. “Would I do seven years of the show? No, because it’s hard work and I’ve got my babies, and I don’t want to be away from them that much. But I’ve just learned in life you never say never. I’m looking to do something that I haven’t done yet, not something that I did. But would I do that? Who knows — if it was good, if it made sense. We had so much fun shooting and living and working in New York City.” 
But you’re saying there’s a chance? 

.@BarackObama shouted out Jay Z for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame; says Beyonce & M.O. are more popular than him & Jay pic.twitter.com/QTWL80hMQw
Jay Z became the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on Thursday night ― and he got one heck of an introduction. 
Former President Barack Obama delivered a videotaped message heaping praise on the music mogul, whose real name is Shawn Carter. 
Obama first congratulated many of the other inductees, including Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, Berry Gordy, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Robert Lamm and James Pankow and Max Martin. 
Then he got to Jay Z.
“I like to think Mr. Carter and I understand each other. Nobody who met us as younger men would have expected us to be where we are today. We know what it’s like not to have a father around, we know what it’s like not to come from much, and to know people who didn’t get the same breaks that we did. And so we try to prop open those doors of opportunity so that it’s a little easier for those who come up behind us to succeed as well.”
The former commander in chief also made a crack referencing to their powerful partners, former first lady Michelle Obama and megastar singer Beyoncé. 
“And let’s face it,” he said. “We both have wives who are significantly more popular than we are.” 
Obama also spoke of listening to Jay Z’s music throughout his career, from his early days as a state senator to preparing his final State of the Union address.
“I’m pretty sure I’m still the only president to listen to Jay Z’s music in the Oval Office,” he said. “That may change at some point, but I’m pretty sure that’s true now.”
Check out the full message above. 
Jay Z proved he could give as well as he receives. While he wasn’t at the ceremony ― Beyoncé is expected to give birth to their twins any day now ― he tweeted his thanks to “all the people that have inspired me.”
The rap star wasn’t sparing with the praise, either: He thanked some 90 other artists including The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Andre 3000, Nas, Lil Wayne, Queen Latifah and, of course, Queen Bey.
“B a rapper too!” he wrote. 
But Jay Z saved his best praise for a man he called “the greatest rapper of all time.” 
“Thank you 44,” he wrote to Obama.  

One of the most powerful talent agencies in Hollywood has put out a report that pushes back against many preconceived notions about the way movies with diverse casts perform at the box office.
Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which lays claim to many of Hollywood’s most famous actors and actresses, was inspired to look into film diversity after discovering that non-white Americans purchased a disproportionate number of movie tickets last year.
To be specific, non-white Americans scooped up 49 percent of all tickets sold in the U.S. last year, even though they make up a smaller percentage of the U.S. population ― somewhere around 38 percent.
So researchers sifted through 413 films released between the beginning of 2014 and the end of 2016, documenting the ethnicity of the top 10 billed actors for each of them. They wanted to find out how films with a significant non-white presence ― which they defined as 30 percent and up ― performed at the U.S. box office. 
Lo and behold, they did well. Really well. As CAA put it in an email to HuffPost: 
At every budget level, a cast that is at least 30% non-white outperforms a release that is not, in opening weekend box office.
The audience side of things tells a similar story. Films that had what CAA called a “truly diverse” audience ― meaning the audience was between 38 percent and 70 percent non-white ― pulled in around $31 million on opening weekend on average, versus $12 million for overwhelmingly white films. 
The findings are significant. Despite increased interest in Hollywood representation due to #OscarsSoWhite and other moments, people of color have continued to struggle to convince studio executives to green-light their ideas. Last year, Angela Robinson, a black woman who directed “Herbie: Fully Loaded,” described it as a “my kind of people” problem.
“If I were to give someone $50-100 million dollars ... I’d really, really want to feel super comfortable with that person,” she told HuffPost at the time. “Racism and sexism kind of go into it, but it’s more just a comfort thing. Like, you are my kind of person. I grew up with people like you. Or I went to college with people like you.”
Christy Haubegger, leader of CAA’s multicultural development group, told the Los Angeles Times that she hopes the company’s research shows that “people [actually] want to see a world that looks like theirs,” and that movie executives are hindering themselves if they only rely on white friends and try to appeal to white audiences.
“One of the interesting things that the most successful movies share is that they’re broadly appealing to diverse audiences,” Haubegger added. 
Richard Lovett, CAA’s president, told the Times he would like the hard data in the report to help studios confront some of their longstanding assumptions. 
“The hope is that seeing real numbers attached to the success of the inclusion of more voices and diverse casts will be further motivation for studios, networks and others to be really conscious of the opportunity,” Lovett told the outlet.
In recent years, CAA has made a point to promote a culture of inclusion. The agency has emphasized minority recruitment, especially at historically black colleges and women’s colleges, and used its internship program to help people of color get a foot in the door. (In the last half decade, a majority of the company’s interns worldwide have been people of color.)
Things are changing at the higher ranks of the company, too. Between 2016 and 2017, so far, the revenues of CAA’s multicultural clients have risen by 14 percent. 
“The issue of diversity and inclusion is a very important one for us,” CAA executive Ryan Tarpley said last year. “We believe more diverse voices from diverse backgrounds make our company stronger, with a better quality experience for everyone — our company and clients. It’s good business.”
CLARIFICATION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that CAA’s multicultural clients have risen by 14 percent between 2016 and 2017. The revenues of CAA’s multicultural clients have risen by 14 percent. 
It’s pretty obvious that female hosts aren’t a top priority when it comes to late night. Actually, Samantha Bee is the only woman featured in the lineup of men, which includes Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden, Seth Meyers, Conan O’Brien, Trevor Noah and John Oliver. 
“I’m lonely here,” Bee put it simply in an interview with the “Today Show.” 
Well, as it turns out, Bee could have had some company with actress and comedian Jane Lynch, who revealed to HuffPost that she pitched her own program to CBS when they were looking to hire for “The Late Late Show.” (The job obviously went to James Corden, whom Lynch is a big fan of, FYI.) 
During a Build Series interview, Lynch told us that she’d “love” to host a late-night show, it’s just that women aren’t chosen for the positions.
“I’m a little long in the tooth, I think, in the wrong sex right now, but that’s OK. If it were offered and it looked like it was going to be fun [I’d do it],” Lynch said of the possibility. “I will say that CBS did ask me to come in and pitch them something for late night, before they got James Corden, and I went in with a dumb idea and I kind of regret it. I said, ‘You know, it’s late night, let’s just have a five-piece band, no studio audience and maybe one or two guests. Maybe even people [who are] not celebrities. Maybe somebody who’s just interesting.’ And their eyes were glossing over as I was telling them and I wish I said, ’I have an idea! We’ll do like “The Graham Norton Show.”′ And I would be working at CBS late night right now!” 
Still, Lynch is very impressed with the hosts currently airing in the evening, expressing her particular interest in “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” Although she gets a little wary of sharing her political ideals, she respects those who have the guts to take down the current administration.  
“I’ll tweet politically every once and a while ― you just got to be careful, for me anyway. I’d rather sit around and talk to people without a microphone about what I think is going on and what I’m afraid of. In a way, I don’t want to get involved in that in a public way,” she said. “But I’m really grateful ... I think Seth Meyers is just killing it. He just stepped up, if you get a chance to see, his ‘Closer Look’ [segment], which he’s doing more of. It used to be once every couple of weeks and now almost every night he’s doing a ‘Closer Look.’”
For now, Lynch is happy to represent women hosts in the current game show revival. Believe it or not, she is, in fact, the only woman hosting one of these shows on network television: NBC’s “Hollywood Game Night.” (Good news: “So You Think You Can Dance” host Cat Deeley does front “Big Star Little Star,” on cable network USA.)
″‘Hollywood Game Night’ might have started this revival, but there’s still no more female hosts, I’m the only one. There’s just kind of an inability to open up the mind, I think, to females hosting things and I think the same thing with late night,” the Emmy-winning host said. “Samantha Bee is in there and she’s doing such a great job, but I love what the guys are doing so I have a hard time saying, ‘Why did we have to go across the pond to get James Corden?’ Because he’s awesome. He’s really good. Trevor Noah, too. He’s wonderful.”
Let’s get Lynch on late night, shall we? 
For more with Jane Lynch, watch her full Build interview below: 

This week was too much. But if you’ve had a recent feeling that reality no longer makes sense, this isn’t going to help.
Amid everything else that happened over the last few days, Seth Meyers devoted a long segment of “Late Night” to a sketch that involved the green ogre Shrek. More specifically, the segment was an ode to the seven-year anniversary of “Shrek Forever After: The Final Chapter 3D,” the fourth “Shrek” movie.
Although not mentioned in the sketch, it should be pointed out that the tagline for that movie was, “It ain’t ogre... til it’s ogre.”
This wasn’t entirely a random choice by Meyers, as the show has a recurring sketch featuring writer Conner O’Malley as “Anniversary Guy.” This character heckles Meyers from the crowd to insist mentioning obscure anniversaries. In the past, O’Malley has dressed as The Mask and Darth Maul, but his Shrek is a whole new level of commitment.
After Meyers feigned annoyance that this Shrek was interrupting his show, O’Malley started bantering back and forth with the host, expressing immense enthusiasm for Shrek with lines like, “I don’t understand why Congress can’t get off of their asses and get some more Shrek movies out there!”
To close out the sketch, O’Malley stood up to twinkling music and delivered an impassioned speech about the profound merits of Shrek. Somehow, Paul Ryan was involved. 
Meyers eventually asked him how much longer this speech would last, to which O’Malley responded, “Uhh... I haven’t even gotten to the part about Shrek’s penis.” With that, the skit ended. 
 
What you don't UNDERSTAND is that I am the SHREK. SHREK IS IMPORTANT https://t.co/COcJ1y3jXu pic.twitter.com/skCpS5dtkj
Although Meyers has been doing a great job focusing on the politics of the day on “Late Night,” it’s welcome to see that a sketch that doesn’t reference Donald Trump or involve a huge celebrity can still be successful.
And if you’re not going to talk about Trump, might as well spend that airtime doing something really, really bizarre, right?
Of course, as readers who recognize the reference in this headline already know, this is far from the strangest Shrek-related joke that’s ever been made. Still, this Meyers and O’Malley sketch was a respite in a week that never seemed like it was going to end. And now it’s finally ogre.
Imagine you are a relatively unknown and unsigned musical artist living in Vancouver, British Columbia, who recorded and posted online a song you wrote when you were 17-years-old. And then about five years later, that six-minute introspective and dramatic song gets randomly spotted on YouTube by a member of a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band who then later contacts you about wanting to record that song for that band's upcoming album. Now two years later, your song ends up being on that band's recently-released new record that also includes tracks written by Sia, Johnny Marr, Blood Orange's Dev Hynes, Charli XCX, TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, and the Strokes' Nick Valensi.
That is exactly what happened to musician and movie blogger Adam Johnston of the group An Unkindness, whose song “Fragments,” which first appeared on Bandcamp and YouTube, was recorded by Blondie for their newly-released album Pollinator. For an artist who hasn't yet released a full-length album or a label deal at the time, having a song recorded by a legendary group known for its out-of-the-box collaborations is quite a feat.
“I couldn't be happier with their interpretation,” Johnston says about Blondie's version of “Fragments.” “I'm glad they made it their own and infused their style with it. I think they did a great job with it and I'm proud to have writing credits on the track.”
At over six minutes long, An Unkindness' version of  “Fragments” recalls elements of progressive rock and the epic grandeur of a Jim Steinman composition, with its powerful lyrical refrain of “Do you love me now?” Johnston penned “Fragments” when he was a teenager and says it has a meaning for him.
“When I wrote the song,” he explains, “it was basically to come to terms with a kind of transformation I had been going through growing up. It was about addressing where I was in my life and where I planned on being, and what would need to happen to get there. It's also about rejection and how I'm unable to fake things for my own happiness. It's about the song itself being the purest form of sincerity and honesty that I can communicate.
“It's about taking a long, hard look at yourself, and getting rid of the parts of yourself that are holding you down,” Johnston continues. “It's about chipping away pieces of yourself with the intent of achieving comfort, only to find out that there are parts of yourself that you can't escape from and you have to learn to accept. To me, "Do you love me now?" is a question directed at myself. It's from a point in my life where I was essentially saying "Okay, you've been chipping away pieces of yourself trying to become a person you're happy with, but at what point will you ever say it's finished?" It's about me getting to a place where I thought I'd be happy with myself, but finding out that it wasn't the case.”
The song was posted on Bandcamp as part of a four-song EP in 2010; it was later uploaded on YouTube a year later. Then in 2015, Blondie co-founder and guitarist Chris Stein reached out to Johnston after discovering his music on the latter's YouTube channel.
“I was very excited,” Johnston recalls, “although understandably skeptical. Mostly because I've had a lot of hopeful possibilities fall through for a variety of reasons in the past and I've learned over time not to get your hopes up until you're certain it's actually happening.”
For a while, Johnston says, he kept the news about the Blondie collaboration a secret and was pleased when “Fragments” did end up on the official track list for Pollinator. “It's a very humbling and validating gesture for such talented and iconic musicians to take interest in my own work,” he says. “It's special that they were able to see through the demo recording quality and understand the full potential of the song. It's important to have your work appreciated by other artists.”
Adding to that stroke of good fortune for Johnston is An Unkindness' upcoming record, scheduled for release next year. “I'm currently working on my first album recorded at an actual studio and I can't wait for that to be out,” says Johnston, “but I'm genuinely surprised that I'm getting legitimate recognition for my material before I've even released my first actual album.”
UPDATE (5:40 p.m. ET): “Bachelor in Paradise” contestant Corinne Olympios released the following statement (obtained by Just Jared) Tuesday afternoon addressing the findings of the investigation of alleged misconduct on set of the reality dating show. 
It needs to be made crystal clear that production of “Bachelor in Paradise” was shut down because of multiple complaints received from “BIP” producers and crew members on the set. It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone,” her lawyer wrote. “It comes as no surprise that Warner Bros., as a result of its own internal [i]nvestigation, would state that no wrong doing had occurred. Our own investigation will continue based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.
PREVIOUSLY:
The investigation into the “allegations of misconduct” on the set of “Bachelor in Paradise” has concluded that no sexual assault took place. 
On Tuesday, a week after news of the situation hit headlines, Warner Bros. released the following statement: 
As we previously stated, we recently became aware of allegations regarding an incident on the set of “Bachelor in Paradise” in Mexico. We take all such allegations seriously. The safety, security and well-being of the cast and crew is our number one concern, and we suspended filming so that the allegations could be investigated immediately and thoroughly. Our internal investigation, conducted with the assistance of an outside law firm, has now been completed. Out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved, we do not intend to release the videotape of the incident. We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy. Production of this season of “Bachelor in Paradise” will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show’s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.
“We appreciate the swift and complete investigation by Warner Bros. into allegations of misconduct on the set of ‘Bachelor in Paradise.’ Given their results, the series will resume production, and will air this summer on ABC,” a spokesperson for ABC told HuffPost in a statement.
The incident in question was said to involve contestants Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, both well-known personalities from their previous appearances in the “Bachelor” franchise. The two were reportedly involved in inappropriate sexual activities in a swimming pool while the cast was in Mexico, according to sources who spoke to TMZ and Jackson.
However, there were varying accounts of what actually happened, which is what led Warner Bros. to investigate the encounter. One producer filed a complaint claiming Olympios was too drunk to consent to Jackson’s actions, which were allegedly sexual in nature, while one cast member reportedly said Olympios was “fully engaged.” 
Host Chris Harrison and members of “Bachelor Nation” reacted to the news on Twitter:
Thank you for your patience, trust and loyalty #BachelorNation and to our entire Bachelor family

He’ll always be her ... backup dancer? Mariah Carey and boyfriend Bryan Tanaka have reportedly split after five months of dating, according to TMZ. 
The couple, who found love amidst Carey’s crumbling engagement to billionaire James Packer, documented their relationship on the singer’s reality TV series “Mariah’s World” this past year. The two reportedly haven’t seen or spoken to each other since their vacation to Cabo at the end of March. 
Apparently, it was Carey’s ex-husband Nick Cannon, not Packer, who had a role to play in the couple’s demise. According to TMZ, Tanaka was jealous over the pair’s more-than-cordial relationship, which made the dancer feel “disrespected.”
Things reportedly reached a boiling point when Carey showed up to the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards last month with Cannon and their children, 5-year-old twins Morocco and Monroe.
In retaliation, Tanaka would reportedly “lash back” at the “I Don’t” singer by flirting with other women in front of her. 
The outlet also notes that finances put a strain on their relationship, as Tanaka reportedly developed expensive tastes during his time with Carey. She eventually put her foot down, however, after paying for his designer shoes, watches and chains. 
His spending habits and mistrust of Cannon apparently confirmed Carey’s suspicions that Tanaka stuck around for the fame after her split with Packer. 
No matter what happens, they’ll always have New Year’s Eve. 
The Huffington Post has reached out to Carey’s representatives and will update this post accordingly.

In January 1999, the girl group TLC dropped a hit to end all hits: “No Scrubs.” The song became an anthem against men who don’t treat women well, aka “scrubs,” who can most closely be compared to present-day “fuccbois.”
On Monday night, comedian and actor Paul F. Tompkins tweeted an inquiry into TLC’s current anti-scrubs sentiment:
Does anyone know if TLC has relaxed its policy on scrubs?
A response from the official TLC Twitter account appeared mid-afternoon on Tuesday:
hell no!
So, to clarify, no, these ladies still don’t want no scrubs, and there are still guys who can’t get no love from them.
A rep for TLC also emphasized that the lyrics’ definition of “scrubs,” referring to them as “busters,” still stands:
Thank you for the clarification. Are we still keeping terminology/status of them being busters, always talking about what they want, etc
absolutely....thinks he's fly, sits on his broke ass, etc.
In case you need a full refresher, please enjoy below:
In the years since the song exploded onto the scene, the trio has become a duo. Lisa “Left-Eye” Lopes was killed in a car accident in 2002, leaving Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas to continue the TLC legacy together. Watkins and Thomas recently released their first music video in 14 years, titled “Way Back.”
Oh, and if you were wondering whether the group still does not endorse “chasing waterfalls,” a rep for the group clarified their current stance on that, too:
Can we at least chase waterfalls?
we prefer rivers and lakes honestly...
Bless you, TLC. 

The New York Public Theater’s presentation of William Shakespeare’s 400-year-old play, “Julius Caesar” was embroiled in controversy this month, with protests over a choice to costume the titular character as President Donald Trump. This wardrobe decision was controversial because senators plot to stab Caesar to death in the play. 
Now that this run of “Julius Caesar” has come to an end, actor Corey Stoll has written a piece for Vulture about what it was like to star in the play. Stoll had the role of Marcus Brutus, a reluctant assassin of Caesar.
Although the play is explicitly about the pitfalls of assassination, Stoll wrote that following through with the play amid the protest eventually felt like a contribution to the “resistance.” These days, that term is loaded to evoke the phrase ”#resist” which refers to a rallying cry against Trump.
“The protesters never shut us down, but we had to fight each night to make sure they did not distort the story we were telling,” wrote Stoll in the piece that was published Friday. “At that moment, watching my castmates hold their performances together, it occurred to me that this is resistance.”
Watch video of two protestors disrupting a performance:
BREAKING: Julius Ceasar Gets SHUTDOWN pic.twitter.com/ITgfMR0tHE
Stoll, who memorably played an eventually murdered politician in the first season of “House of Cards,” said that he had no idea this production would portray Trump so explicitly before signing on to the role.
Stoll was frustrated by the choice at first, as he feared involving Trump would overshadow the rest of the performance. 
A passage from Stoll’s piece:
When I signed on to play the reluctant assassin Marcus Brutus in this production, I didn’t know Caesar would be an explicit avatar for President Trump. I suspected that an American audience in 2017 might see aspects of him in the character, a democratically elected leader with autocratic tendencies. I did not think anyone would see it as an endorsement of violence against him. The play makes it clear that Caesar’s murder, which occurs midway through the play, is ruinous for Brutus and his co-conspirators, and for democracy itself ...
After four weeks in the rehearsal room, we moved to the theater and I saw Caesar’s Trump-like costume and wig for the first time. I was disappointed by the literal design choice. I had little fear of offending people, but I worried that the nuanced character work we had done in the rehearsal room would get lost in what could seem like a “Saturday Night Live” skit. I was right and wrong.
After the president’s eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., blamed this production for the actions of the gunman who fired on a baseball team made up of Republican congressmen, Stoll began to fear for his own life.
“Like most Americans, I was saddened and horrified, but when the president’s son and others blamed us for the violence, I became scared,” wrote Stoll.
The production was plagued with disruptions from protestors, but fortunately had none that caused physically critical harm.

Troll! There’s a troll in the dungeon! And his name is Matt Lauer.
Back in 2005, Lauer sat down with Tom Cruise for an interview about “War of the Worlds,” and things quickly took a turn for the worse.
In the interview, Cruise criticized Brooke Shields for treating her postpartum depression with drugs and went on a rant about drug abuse, infamously calling Lauer “glib.”
“You’re glib. You don’t even know what Ritalin is,” said Cruise.
This was during the Cruise and Katie Holmes years, so all the while Holmes was looking on. Thinking back on it, it’s very weird, but somehow it makes sense.
Now, more than a decade later, Andy Cohen somehow convinced Lauer to reenact the interview with the latter playing the part of Cruise. Despite Lauer saying that Cruise was later apologetic and they now have a good relationship, the dude went for it. 
You can watch the original interview, including all the shots of Holmes looking on, in the “Today Show” video below, unless, of course, you’re glib.
Why you gotta be so glib? Do you even know what Ritalin is?

There’s a reason networks often save their weakest fare for the time of year when more people are less likely to spend their evenings indoors.
Of course, that’s not always the case, since “Game of Thrones” is scheduled to make its much-awaited return this July. 
But when it comes to new shows, you can bet networks generally save the worst for last. In the coming months, viewers can look forward to some stellar series this spring (including ”The Handmaid’s Tale,” “American Gods,” “GLOW”), while they’re more or less better off embracing the warm weather and misplacing their remotes by the time summer hits. 
With allegations that former Nasty Gal CEO Sophia Amoruso was accused of creating a “toxic” workplace, it’s easy to see why the lead character of Netflix’s “Girlboss” is so incredibly unlikable. The question, however, is why would anyone want to spend a significant amount of time watching her?
“Girlboss” is loosely based on Amoruso’s memoir of the same name and tells the story of how she began her vintage clothing eBay shop, before it became what we now know as Nasty Gal.
The show stars Britt Robertson as 23-year-old Sophia, a college dropout who works menial jobs and yet can somehow afford a studio apartment in San Francisco circa 2006 ― and, damn, is it ever hard to watch. Sophia is petulant, whiny and often just flat-out mean. What’s worse is that the series rarely gives you a reason to root for her. Characters don’t always have to be likable, but there has to be at least some reason to follow a person through their journey. With “Girlboss,” there’s nothing here.  
”Great News,” the new workplace comedy from executive producer Tina Fey, can’t be described as great, or even good.
The show follows Katie (Briga Heelan), a wallflower of a producer at a cable news program called “The Breakdown,” and her overbearing mother (Andrea Martin), who manages to land a job as as the show’s intern. Hilarity ensues, right? Not so much.
The show’s jokes just repeatedly fall flat, though surprisingly it’s Nicole Richie as a super-hip if slightly vapid co-anchor who actually shines brightest.  
What do you really know about Albert Einstein, aside from the fact that he developed the theory of relativity? National Geographic is willing to wager that answer is very little.
“Genius” is an anthology series from executive producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer about the lives of those deserving enough to be deemed as such, and Season 1 kicks off with none other than Mr. E = mc2 himself.  
Based on Walter Isaacson’s book Einstein: His Life and Universe, the show stars Johnny Flynn when Einstein was a student in Zurich the 1890s, and Geoffrey Rush, as his older counterpart against a backdrop of the rising anti-semitism in 1922 Berlin, Germany.
Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” is by far the best new show debuting in the spring and summer season, and is based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 dystopian novel. If you don’t already have a Hulu account, you’re going to want to sign up for one today.
Set in the not-too distant future where a fundamentalist Christian regime rules over the former United States, now known as the Republic of Gilead, women have been stripped of their rights and any sense of life as they once knew it. Elisabeth Moss stars as Offred, a woman who is forced to bear children for high-ranking men and their wives, after environmental problems cause widespread infertility issues. 
The series is a chilling reminder of how quickly the Republic of Gilead could become a reality. 
If you liked “Dear White People,” the movie, then you should probably watch it again, because the 2014 film from writer/director Justin Simien is far better than Netflix’s 10-episode series.  
That’s not to say the series adaptation is a failure by any means. The show is still a smart and sharp take on the complex issue of race relations, and is definitely worth checking out. 
The series picks up where the film left off in the aftermath of a racist blackface party, which has left a campus divided. Episodes are told and then retold through different student’s perspectives, which requires some commitment by the viewers since that format can feel awfully repetitive. 
“American Gods” is absolutely the weirdest and most mind-bending new offering this season. Starz’s visually stunning new drama is based on British author Neil Gaiman’s 2001 fantasy novel of the same name and requires total suspension of disbelief. 
In this America, gods live among us mere mortals. There are two types of gods ― old and new. The old are the ones you’ve read about in myths and were brought to America by faithful immigrants centuries ago, while the new gods have gradually replaced the old ones and were born out of our modern obsession with media and technology.
As war brews between the gods, an ex-con named Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle) finds himself caught between the two sides.  
Netflix’s “Anne with an E” is easily one of the most charming new shows. Yes, this is yet another adaptation of Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery’s beloved children’s novel Anne of Green Gables, but it’s by far the best. 
Amybeth McNulty stars as Anne Shirley, the young orphan who never stops talking, who comes to live on Prince Edward Island with elderly siblings Marilla (Geraldine James) and Matthew Cuthbert (R.H. Thomson).
While you may have read the book 100 times as a child, Netflix has managed to reenergize the story for modern audiences without betraying its source material. If anything, “Anne” digs deeper at some of the darker elements that Montgomery glossed over in the novel, and is a thoroughly binge-able experience for all ages. 
You may have already watched the pilot episode of Amazon’s new series “I Love Dick,” based on Chris Kraus’ 1997 novel.
The show stars Kathryn Hahn as a filmmaker in an unhappy marriage who follows her husband (Griffin Dunne) to his writing residency in Marfa, Texas, and becomes completely infatuated with a professor named Dick (Kevin Bacon).
“I Love Dick” is the latest show from “Transparent” creator Jill Soloway and is an intentionally uncomfortable yet humorous examination of human sexuality and the female gaze. 
From ABC comes “Downward Dog,” a sitcom about a dog named Martin and his owner, Nan, (Allison Tolman), a woman struggling to get ahead at work and make sense of her personal life. 
The show is told from Martin’s perspective’s via his internal monologue, voiced by Samm Hodges. The series is inoffensive enough, if you can stand to listen to Martin, who is the male incarnation of a droning Valley girl in canine form. 
Showtime didn’t provide any screeners for “Twin Peaks,” which is returning as a limited series 24 years after David Lynch’s original version ended.
Because of this, we can only tell you what you probably already know: Lynch will direct the entire series and you can expect to see many familiar faces, including Kyle MacLachlan, who returns as FBI Agent Dale Cooper. 
Showtime’s new drama “I’m Dying Up Here” is a look at the lives of stand-up comics trying to make it in Los Angeles in the 1970s ―  and you’ll be tempted to heckle if you can muster the strength to make it through a full episode. 
Yet another show based on a book, the series is inspired by William Knoedelseder‘s 2009 nonfiction work I’m Dying Up Here: Heartbreak and High Times in Stand-up Comedy’s Golden Era and features an ensemble cast including Ari Graynor, Melissa Leo, Clark Duke, Michael Angarano and RJ Cyler.
Even if you’d rather do just about anything else than watch professional wrestling, you really shouldn’t discount Netflix’s new original series “GLOW.”
Inspired by the real story of the 1980s women’s wrestling league “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling,” “GLOW” is one of the most enjoyable shows to debut this season. 
Alison Brie stars as a struggling actress desperate to make it in Hollywood, giving one last shot at her dreams when she auditions for a series about female wrestlers. Featuring an outstanding and diverse cast, the series hilariously tackles issues of racism, stereotyping, sexism and sisterhood in the world of women’s wrestling. 
Freeform’s “The Bold Type” is inspired by Cosmopolitan and its editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, and it’s the perfect show for summertime viewing. 
Starring Katie Stevens, Aisha Dee and Meghann Fahy as three friends working at Scarlet Magazine, the show follows the young women as they navigate their careers and personal lives in New York City.
This show is exactly what you would expect from reading Cosmo ― not a bad way to curl up on the couch with a glass of wine. 
The remote town of “Midnight, Texas” seems to be the supernatural center of the United States with witches, ghosts, assassins, angels, psychics and other creatures calling it home. But there is entirely too much going on. 
Based on the trilogy series of the same name by author Charlaine Harris, “Midnight Texas” follows Manfred (François Arnaud), a psychic who can communicate with the dead, as he arrives in Midnight and befriends fellow outsiders like himself. 
USA’s “The Sinner” is a different kind of thrilling mystery that finds Jessica Biel starring in a TV series for the first time since her days playing Mary Camden on “7th Heaven.”
Biel plays Cora, a young mother who commits an unspeakable act of violence against a stranger at the beach. There’s no question that she did it. The only question is why. Bill Pullman also stars as a detective obsessed with uncovering Cora’s motives.
As the series delves into Cora’s past and pieces together what happened that day at the beach, chances are you’ll be just as obsessed. 
“Saturday Night Live” is on hiatus this summer, but Colin Jost and Michael Che will fill the void with “Weekend Update” ― a 30-minute primetime version of the long-running segment. With “SNL” seeing some of its highest ratings in years, Jost and Che will keep things going in August and make sure you’re on top of all the news that can be satirized. So, basically everything.
Marlon Wayans stars in what’s supposed to be an update on the classic family sitcom, but this isn’t anything we haven’t seen before. 
“Marlon” is loosely based on Wayans’ real life as he plays a wise-cracking, over- protective yet immature father to two precocious kids (Amir O’Neil and Notlim Taylor). He also appears to share a too-close relationship with his ex-wife (Essence Atkins). 
Monday night, Trevor Noah dug into last week’s not-guilty verdict on the Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile as he sat in his car. The “Daily Show” host slammed the NRA in a segment for failing to defend Castile, a legal gun owner who happened to be black.
Noah had more to say Tuesday night, after disturbing dashcam footage from the incident became public. Between segments, the host offered his own experience with American police, explaining how he exercises extreme caution.
“Whenever I get pulled over, the first thing I do is throw my arms out the window. And it looks so stupid when you see me,” he said, demonstrating the move. “Just because I would rather have the cop go, ‘You’re weird.’”
The host also explained how he came to realize his experience with police in the U.S. was different from that of his white friends. When he learned Castile had been stopped by police 49 times in 13 years, Noah’s initial reaction was to compare that statistic with his own ― less than a dozen stops in six years. That number still seemed shockingly high to his friends.
“I’ve been stopped by police maybe, I would say going on at least 8 to 10 times, which always blows white people’s minds, which I didn’t know was a thing,” said Noah, who grew up in South Africa.
“I’ve been stopped in rental cars, I’ve been stopped in my car, I’ve been stopped in a car with tinted windows, a car with rims, a car with no rims. I’ve been stopped in a Tesla!” he continued, joking, “I don’t know what silent crime you think I’m on my way to commit.”
Catch all of Noah’s commentary above.

O Daughter, Who Art Thou?#TrumpFathersDayFilms pic.twitter.com/wgUeDNu2pV
Chris Pratt’s political affiliations have been up for debate ever since he opened up about not feeling represented by either political party. But it’s time to add a point in the resistance column after the actor fired off a tweet seemingly poking fun at President Donald Trump’s latest political scandal. 
On Tuesday, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was heading an investigation into possible ties between the Russian government and the Trump 2016 presidential campaign. 
Enter Pratt sharing the tweet to end all tweets by roasting Trump’s decision with a perfectly suited GIF of his FBI agent alter-ego, Burt “Tyrannosaurus” Macklin. 
See, for seven seasons Pratt starred on the NBC sitcom “Parks and Recreation,” playing the lovable goof Andy Dwyer, who had a tendency to transform into the crime-solving hero when the opportunity arose — like that time someone threw a pie at Leslie Knope during a campaign rally. 
“Just lemme know,” Pratt wrote on Wednesday alongside a GIF of Macklin diving in front of Mount Rushmore.

Message received, Pratt. 

Lisa Spoonauer, the New Jersey–born actress known for her role as Caitlin Bree in “Clerks,” died Saturday. She was 44. 
A cause of death was not released, but TMZ reports police responded to a 911 call to her house around 11:05 p.m. Saturday night, but she wasn’t breathing when EMTs arrived. 
Kevin Smith, who directed Spoonauer in “Clerks,” shared the sad news on Instagram Tuesday, with a photo collage and touching caption. 
“Devastated to report that [Lisa Spoonauer], who played Caitlin in [’Clerks’], has passed away,” he wrote. “In 1992, I went looking for Lisa without knowing either who she was or the integral role she’d play in my life.” 
Smith continued, telling the story of how he discovered Spoonauer in an acting class at Brookdale Community College.
“Lisa was easily the most natural and authentic voice in the room. She didn’t sound like she was acting at all; she delivered scripted dialogue as if she was inventing her conversation in the moment, like people do in real life,” he added. 
You can read his entire tribute below: 
Devastated to report that #LisaSpoonauer, who played Caitlin in #clerks, has passed away. In 1992, I went looking for Lisa without knowing either who she was or the integral role she'd play in my life. I'd held a night of open auditions at the #firstavenueplayhouse (where we found @briancohalloran and @marilynghigliotti) but the perfect Caitlin Bree never walked through the door. So I popped into an acting class at Brookdale Community College and watched the students from the back. Lisa was easily the most natural and authentic voice in the room. She didn't sound like she was acting at all; she delivered scripted dialogue as if she was inventing her conversation in the moment, like people do in real life. Captivated, I approached Lisa cold in the parking lot after the class and said "This is gonna sound creepy but... Do you wanna be in a movie?" Fearlessly, she replied "Not if it's porn." I told her a bit about Clerks and gave her a copy of the script and my phone number. She called me a few days later and said "Well it's not porn, but everybody talks like it is. It's funny. I'll do it." A complete stranger at first, Lisa quickly became one of the most important people I'd ever meet when she joined Brian, #JeffAnderson, Marilyn, @jaymewes, @samosier, @davidkleinasc and me as one of the chief architects of my first film. We rehearsed for a month straight in the store after hours, where Lisa perfected Caitlin (and fell in love with Jeff). The first night of the shoot, Lisa had to maneuver her way through a seven minute scene with Brian in the video store, when Caitlin finally shows up in the movie. Lisa and Brian CRUSHED it in one long take that still remains one of my favorite scenes I've ever shot - not because it shows off any directorial flare (it doesn't) but because it exemplified how great the performers were since we never had to cut away from their 2-shot. But as strong an actress as she was, Lisa was an even more excellent Mother to her daughter Mia. Whenever we'd Facebook later in life, she'd gush about her baby girl proudly. My heart goes out to Tom, Mia and Lisa's family. Thank you for dreaming my dream with me. You changed my life, Lisa.
A post shared by Kevin Smith (@thatkevinsmith) on May 23, 2017 at 2:32pm PDT
Spoonauer only appeared in one other film during her acting career: 1997’s “Bartender.” However, she did reprise the role of Caitlin Bree for an episode of the 2001 animated “Clerks” series.  
An obituary posted by a New Jersey funeral home describes Spoonauer as “a devoted mother and loving wife ... known for her strength, selflessness and faith.” 
It continues, “Lisa loved spending time with family and friends, helping anyone she could and laughing as much as she made other people laugh.”
The obituary also notes Spoonauer went on to become a restaurant manager and event planner following her acting career. 
Spoonauer is survived by her husband, daughter, stepson, mother, twin brothers and her grandfather. 

On Wednesday, People magazine announced its pick for “World’s Most Beautiful Woman” of 2017 and ― drumroll please ― it’s Julia Roberts, who’s now earned the title a record five times. 
That’s right, Roberts has been named “Most Beautiful” more times than anyone else, surpassing Jennifer Aniston and Michelle Pfeiffer. She first appeared on the issue in 1991 at the age of 23, fresh from her role in “Pretty Woman.” 
“I am very flattered,” the Oscar-winning actress said of the recent accolade, later adding, “I think I’m currently peaking.”
Now, yes, Roberts is beautiful, but if we’re being honest, so is everyone else in Hollywood. We can’t help but think of a slew of other stars who could have earned the title for the first time, let alone a fifth. (Taraji P. Henson, anyone?) 
People’s Editorial Director Jess Cagle explained the magazine’s choice in his editor’s letter: 
When it came time to choose a cover for the 2017 World’s Most Beautiful issue, it seemed that the time was right for Julia Roberts. At 49, Julia has never looked better. Her beauty also lies in her self-assurance and smarts and good humor. It lies in her ability to evolve while retaining the best parts of herself. It lies in her talent for creating characters and telling stories that take us to new places. And it lies in her family-first ethos: Despite all the delights, distractions and temptations of an impossibly privileged existence, nothing ignites her famous smile more than game nights with her kids.
It will be interesting to see who else People decided to include in the issue. As we know, the list tends to favor conventionally beautiful, straight, white women ― so we’re hoping this year there’s some diversity in the mix. Since 1990, there have only been four women of color to receive the title ― Halle Berry, Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé and Lupita Nyong’o.
We do know, however, that Henson, Viola Davis and Alicia Keys are also featured in the current issue, which is a step in the right direction.
People’s “Most Beautiful” issue hits newsstands Friday.

An autopsy report released Monday shows that Carrie Fisher had cocaine in her system just before her death, The Associated Press reports.
Investigators were unable to determine how much of an impact the cocaine and other drugs found in her system had on the actress’ death. A previous coroner’s report, released Friday, said Fisher died from a combination of factors, including sleep apnea; she also had fatty buildup in the walls of her arteries.
Fisher suffered a cardiac medical emergency during a flight from London to Los Angeles last December. According to the most recent autopsy report, Fisher may have taken cocaine three days before she became ill on that flight, which was on Dec. 23. She died Dec. 27. 
The report also stated Fisher had traces of heroin and MDMA in her system, but investigators could not confirm when they were taken. 
Following the release of the initial report, Fisher’s daughter, actress Billie Lourd responded with a heartfelt statement. 
“My mom battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life. She ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases,” she told People. 
She continued: 
She talked about the shame that torments people and their families confronted by these diseases. I know my Mom, she’d want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles. Seek help, fight for government funding for mental health programs. Shame and those social stigmas are the enemies of progress to solutions and ultimately a cure. Love you Momby.
Throughout her life, Fisher was refreshingly honest about her past with bipolar disorder and drug use. She wrote about her experiences in her memoir Wishful Drinking, which she later adapted into a one-woman show. 
The actress — along with her mother, Debbie Reynolds, who died one day after Fisher — was remembered at a public memorial service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles in March of this year. 
This post has been updated to include Billie Lourd’s statement addressing the coroner’s report released last week. 

Rihanna put in work during Game 1 of the NBA Finals in Oakland, California, on Thursday.
Let’s face it: The Warriors’ 113-91 victory over the visiting Cavaliers wasn’t all that exciting. So thankfully RiRi was there courtside to amp up the drama.
She certainly scored points with former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, an ESPN analyst. Even a LeBron James dunk couldn’t sway his attention from the “Only Girl (In The World)” singer.
Give it a listen: 
"Rihanna just walked in front of me." Jeff Van Gundy, the realest, out here willing to risk it all. pic.twitter.com/z2jTfiBYrh
And there was Rihanna’s dab in the fourth quarter, when a fan reportedly asked her to sit down. Stay defiant, RiRi!
Rihanna's Dab >>> Cleveland's Game 1 peformance #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/CvjYJtGq9y
Rihanna, a huge LeBron James fan, also heckled Warriors star Kevin Durant, even yelling “brick” on a free throw. She apparently earned a glare for that and on other occasions, too.
Listen: Rihanna yells "BRIIIIIICK!!!" at Durant during free throw, he stares her down twice 😂 (h/t @tshent) pic.twitter.com/XYdFOv9mc3
Looks like Kevin Durant may have stared down Rihanna after that 3-pointer pic.twitter.com/Lkf3SEQ14Z
Asked about reportedly staring back at the pop star, Durant said he didn’t remember doing it.
“I’m cool,” he said. “Have fun with that.”

 Good game, RiRi!

We’re down to the final nine episodes of “Pretty Little Liars,” meaning we’re that much closer to the big reveal: Who is Uber “A” and what is their damage, Heather? Well, a major clue hidden in this week’s premiere might just answer that question.
One intrepid “Pretty Little Liars” viewer, Annie, unearthed a tiny detail in Tuesday night’s episode that may shed light on “A.D.’s” identity. 
At the end of the episode, an anonymous figure hands Jenna a binder. We can’t see their face, but we can see a small piece of their hair ― a reddish brown lob that’s about the same length and color as Paige McCullers’ new ‘do.
Ginger hair piece? AD is possibly Paige? Took me ages to get this paused at the right minute! #PLLEndGame #pll #PrettyLittleLiars #PLL 🤔🤔 pic.twitter.com/yzfHsf0oj1
Could Emily’s ex-girlfriend be “A.D.”?
For what it’s worth, the men behind the “Bros Watch PLL Too!” podcast are fully behind Annie’s theory. They shared a screen grab of Paige’s haircut from earlier in the episode, and dang it if they don’t match up. The “Bros” added that Paige’s position at Rosewood High is “Athletic Department Supervisor,” which has two very important letters in it: “A.D.” 
Athletic Department Supervisor… A.D. Supervisor?#pAige pic.twitter.com/hei7e8ajTz
Has Twitter solved the Uber “A” mystery at last?
“Pretty Little Liars” showrunner I. Marlene King has revealed that the A.D. reveal will be heartbreakingly sad. There’s no doubt that it would be awful for Emily to find out that her former flame had been stalking and terrorizing her all along. But we’re still not 100 percent convinced.
We’ll just have to continue watching the final season to find out! If we got a clue this big right off the bat, there’s no telling what the PLL Twitter sleuths will dig up next.

UPDATE (2:13 p.m. ET): Johnny Depp apologized Friday in a statement provided to People for joking about assassinating President Donald Trump.
“I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,” he said. “It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone.”
Previously:
The White House has strongly condemned Johnny Depp’s remarks on Thursday in which the actor joked about assassinating the President Donald Trump.
“President Trump has condemned violence in all forms and it’s sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead,” deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.
“I hope that some of Mr. Depp’s colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a Democrat elected official,” she added. 
White House response to #JohnnyDepp Comments. Per White House Official: pic.twitter.com/y9X22Da2pl
On Thursday, while introducing the 2004 film “The Libertine” at the Glastonbury arts festival in England, Depp playfully asked, “When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?” The question was in clear reference to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865 by John Wilkes Booth.
He continued, “I want to clarify: I’m not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it’s been a while, and maybe it’s time.”
Johnny Depp joins the list of idiot celebrities to glorify violence & threaten to kill the man we elected President. pic.twitter.com/k9xJe8JKby
The comment is the latest in what has become something of a trend in the entertainment industry. At the Women’s March in January, Madonna said she had “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.” At the Public Theater in New York, a recent rendition of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” included the assassination of a Caesar who resembled Trump. 
And perhaps most famously, comedian Kathy Griffin participated in a photo shoot in which she held a prop that resembled the bloodied head of Trump. 
Concern about violent rhetoric has increased even more since a shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, earlier this month, when a gunman injured six people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who were participating in a Congressional baseball practice.
﻿This post has been updated to include Johnny Depp's apology. 

Legendary actress Diane Keaton has been entertaining the masses for almost 50 years. Her appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Monday was no exception.
First off, girlfriend came equipped with her own bottle of wine, from which she took random swigs throughout her interview.
Then when host Jimmy Kimmel mentioned Keaton being honored with the American Film Institute’s 45th Life Achievement Award, Keaton really pumped up the volume.
The 71-year-old actress decided to name the celebrities who are, and those who are not, her friends among those in attendance at the award ceremony.
It’s extremely amusing.
Even though Keaton told Kimmel, “I don’t really have any friends,” when pressed, she did admit that Martin Short and Steve Martin are her actual, real-life buddies.
But when asked about Meryl Streep, who showed up to the ceremony dressed like Keaton’s iconic character Annie Hall, Keaton had an interesting answer.
“I love her! But I don’t see her very often,” Keaton said. “She doesn’t call.”
Then she moved on to Reese Witherspoon, and when Kimmel asked if she was a friend, Keaton responded with:
I met Reese when she was 14 and I directed her in a TV movie. Yeah, I did. She was just a kid, a kid!
“Did you know then that she was going to be a star?” Kimmel asked.
“There was no question, great-looking, great talent.”
“Yet still not a friend?” Kimmel asked.
“No, not a friend,” Keaton said.
There was also a very intentionally funny bit about a “very funny, and very attractive” Sarah Silverman who also spoke at Keaton’s ceremony. “She’s a woman, by the way,” Keaton said to Kimmel, who dated Silverman twice between 2002 and 2009.
“I know that, I know that quite well,” Kimmel said in response to a very confused Keaton.
Aw, Diane, keep doing you, girl!

Jessica Simpson shared a handful of photos showing her daughter posing in a children’s bikini on Tuesday over Instagram, and you already know how this ends. Yep, it’s a total mom-shaming internet meltdown. 
The singer and down-low boss of a $1 billion retail empire posted three photos of her 5-year-old daughter Maxwell living her life, wearing a bathing suit and a helmet. The adorable girl posed on a hot pink scooter. 
“SAFETY FIRST,” Simpson captioned the photos with a laughing emoji.
A post shared by Jessica Simpson (@jessicasimpson) on Jun 5, 2017 at 1:39pm PDT
Cue internet mom-shamers coming out of the woodwork to slam Simpson for sexualizing her daughter online, describing the photos as “inappropriate” and “disturbing.” 
“Protect your children. This is not for social media,” one person wrote. 
“Jessica, shame on you for exposing your daughter instead of protecting her!” another tweeted. “This woman needs to grow some brains and discernment. You don’t exploit young children in bathing suits all over social media.”
But there were just as many followers coming to Simpson’s defense. Her supporters handily shut down the idea that sharing a photo of her daughter in a swimsuit is wrong, given that nobody would bat an eye over a photo of a boy in the same situation.
“Any adult who looks at this LITTLE girl as something other then playing outside and having fun has issues,” one fan commented. “Anyone who doesn’t like what this baby is wearing should unfollow.”
Another added: “Enough with the self-righteousness, stop being misogynistic, realize you’re allowing males a free pass and shaming women.” 
Simpson has yet to respond, but we look forward to her confusingly recounting the experience on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” a couple years down the line.

We are nearing the end of “Pretty Little Liars,” and we still have so many questions. Who is A.D.? Whose side is Mona really on? And what in God’s name was Aria wearing all these years?
Well, it’s time to add another question to your ever-expanding list: Will “Pretty Little Liars” get a spinoff series after its seven-year run?
Showrunner I. Marlene King certainly isn’t ruling it out. When asked if a “PLL” spinoff could be a possibility, King replied, “Definitely.”
“It’s not a for sure thing, but there’s some ideas swirling around out there,” King told Entertainment Tonight. “Everybody knows I love this world, I love to play in this world and I love these characters, so it would be fun to keep a few of them moving forward in their lives.” 
No word yet on which characters King would like to focus on, but Vulture pointed out that the “Pretty Little Liars” cast unanimously agrees that Alison deserves her own spinoff.
“I love her character!” Lucy Hale told Vulture earlier this year. “I love all of [the Liars], I even love Aria, but I think you have so many places [Alison] could go because [she has] such a messed up past.” 
Amen to that.
“Pretty Little Liars” airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on Freeform. The series finale will air on June 27. 
Actor Adam West, who famously played the title role in the 1960s television series “Batman,” died Friday at the age of 88. 
A rep confirmed to Variety that the actor died after being treated briefly for leukemia.
“Our dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight, and aspired to make a positive impact on his fans’ lives. He was and always will be our hero,” said his family in a statement.
The West family also tweeted from his account:
Our beloved AW passed away last night. He was the greatest. We'll miss him like crazy. We know you'll miss him too - West Family pic.twitter.com/8bkEq1C2ao
West remained a working actor until his death, notably with recurring voice work for animated projects such as “Family Guy” and “Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders.”
On “Family Guy,” the actor voiced a character with his own name. “Adam West” seemed to be immortal no matter what medical catastrophe came his way. A memorable moment from the show involved a doctor telling West he had lymphoma ― “Probably from rolling around in that toxic waste.” The doctor goes on to ask, “What in God’s name were you trying to prove?”
West’s response, “I was trying to gain super powers.”
The actor also made cameos as himself on shows like “30 Rock” and “The Big Bang Theory.”
Over the past 50 years, he never fully retired his role as Batman, voicing the character as late as 2017 in the upcoming video “Batman vs. Two-Face.” Since the original show, West also appeared in various non-lead roles in the “Batman” series.
West’s “Batman” is now remembered as being comically over-the-top, as he was in relatively low-budget action sequences and often uttered cringe-inducing dialogue. Perhaps the most famous line from the series was when West yelled, “Quick! To the Batmobile!”
The actor embraced the humor of his take on the Dark Knight throughout the rest of his life. In 2006, West appeared on the game show “I’ve Got A Secret” and revealed that he even got a “tattoo” of the Batman logo on one of his teeth.
West graduated from Whitman College as a literature major. After being drafted into the United States Army, he got a gig as the announcer for an internal television service for the military called the American Forces Network. It wasn’t until 1959 ― when West moved his then wife and two children to Hollywood, California ― that he took the stage name Adam West, adapted from his given name, William West Anderson.
After moving to Hollywood, West secured small roles in numerous shows and movies, many of which were Westerns. But when he landed the role as Batman about a decade into his career, West became extremely famous.
Once the original run of “Batman” ended in 1968, West had a bit of a lull in his career, with serious work being hard to come by. To support his family, he had to do “things that I wasn’t very comfortable doing,” the actor explained in the 2013 documentary “Starring Adam West.” He had exploit his fame for money with celebrity event appearances and risky ventures, such as a daredevil stunt where he drove a car through a truck.
West’s persistence eventually started earning him more comedic roles, though, as he embraced the love fans had for his zany Batman.
In April 2012, West was finally awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. To begin his acceptance speech, West addressed the crowd as “citizens of Gotham.”
The actor is survived by his wife, Marcelle Tagand Lear, whom he married 1970. West has four children over three marriages ― Hunter Anderson and Jonelle S. Anderson with his second wife, Nga Frisbie Dawson, and Nina West and Perrin West with Lear. West also has two stepchildren from the Lear marriage, Moya and Jill.
The Robin to his original Batman, Burt Ward, is now 71.

Move aside, Taylor Swift: There’s a new squad in town.
Brie Larson and Emma Stone made headlines when they sobbed in each other’s arms at the 2017 Oscars. As it turns out, Stone means quite a lot to Larson. Larson credits Stone (and a host of other female starlets) with saving her life.
In an interview with Vanity Fair, Larson opened up about the friends who have gotten her through her most challenging times. Larson says she struggled during the press tour for her 2015 film “Room,” admitting that she felt “lonely and bad sometimes.” 
“I was embarrassed to keep talking about myself,” Larson told Vanity Fair.
Luckily, Larson found fast friends in her fellow young actors.
“Emma wrote this beautiful e-mail out of nowhere, and then one day Jen [Lawrence] sent me a text message after she saw ‘Room,’ and we started talking,” Larson said. 
That conversation soon became a group chat with Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham.
“That [group of friends] saved my life,” Larson said. “I was able to talk with them about everything that was going on in my life, and it was with people who had been through it before and are also hilarious. That support and acceptance was everything. I was home-schooled, so I didn’t have friends that had the same interests as me, and I found it to be absolutely incredible.”
Oh, to be a fly on the wall of that group text. Just add Jacob Tremblay to the mix and you’ve got one squad to rule them all.
Alec Baldwin is no stranger to controversy. 
With a career spanning decades, the “Saturday Night Live” guest star has battled many demons in the public eye. Baldwin’s new memoir, Nevertheless, details his struggle with drugs and alcohol in his early days ― but there’s one scandal that still haunts him to this day.
In 2007, an angry voicemail Baldwin left for this then 11-year-old daughter, Ireland, leaked online amid the actor’s contentious divorce from ex-wife Kim Basinger. In the message Baldwin calls his daughter a “rude little pig” and threatens to “straighten [her] ass out” after she “humiliated [him] for the last time.”
Speaking with “Good Morning America” on Monday ahead of the release of his new book, Baldwin revealed that the voicemail caused “permanent” damage to his relationship with Ireland nearly a decade after the incident.

“It’s thrown in your face every day,” Baldwin explained to “GMA” anchor George Stephanopoulos. “There are people who admonish me, or attack me, and use that as a constant spearhead to do that.”
The relationship between Baldwin and his daughter has been on the mend in recent years, as the two regularly attend red carpets and award shows together. However, at the time, the voicemail sent Baldwin spiraling and at one point led him to contemplate suicide. 
“It’s a scab that never heals cause it’s being picked at all the time by other people,” he added. “My daughter, that’s hurt her in a permanent way.”

Despite all this drama, ICYMI, Ireland grew up to be a world-famous supermodel, and judging from her social media accounts, she’s made amends with her famous father.
Every now and then, Baldwin shares shoutouts and throwback photos featuring dear old dad, posting an Instagram of her half-brother at the movie premiere of “Boss Baby” just last week.
the real Boss baby!!!!! 😍 @hilariabaldwin @iamabfalecbaldwin

Last September ― when the now president of the United States was still just the Republican nominee no one thought could actually win the election ― Jimmy Fallon welcomed Donald Trump on “The Tonight Show.” 
Instead of grilling him about his campaign or xenophobic stances, Fallon decided to rub Trump’s head and ruffle his hair. It didn’t go over well. 
The late-night host, who never spoke about the interview in the months following, has finally decided to share his side of the story. In a New York Times profile published Wednesday morning, Fallon admits that he should have addressed the criticism following Trump’s appearance right away, but he just wanted to keep a low profile. 
“I didn’t talk about it, and I should have talked about it,” he told the Times. “I regret that.”
Fallon said the hate online was deafening, and that it affected him much more than people thought.
“I didn’t do it to humanize him,” Fallon said of the Trump moment. “I almost did it to minimize him. I didn’t think that would be a compliment: ‘He did the thing that we all wanted to do.’”
“I’m a people pleaser,” he added, later in the piece. “If there’s one bad thing on Twitter about me, it will make me upset. So, after this happened, I was devastated. I didn’t mean anything by it. I was just trying to have fun.”
Fun is Fallon’s game. He’s never been the political type, nor is that where his strengths lie. His goal, says the 42-year-old, is to entertain, and he tries to do that in the best way he knows how: with “SNL”-like bits, sketches and celebrity drinking games.
“Jimmy is not a political comedian, so it would be very phony of him to go out and do long political joke rants just because that’s what some people want,” Tina Fey told the Times of her former colleague. “‘The Tonight Show’ has historically been a friendly, light show.”
Fallon said he feels like his Trump controversy has “sailed,” and that maybe he missed the boat on making an impact on his viewers’ takes on it. But, ultimately, he will continue to do the show he’s always been producing.
“I tossed and turned for a couple of weeks, but I have to make people laugh,” he said. “People that voted for Trump watch my show as well.”
As of now, Fallon is trailing Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” in viewership. (In the week ending May 12, Colbert had a little over 3 million nightly viewers while Fallon had just under 2.7 million.) But Fallon is still leading in the coveted 18-to-49-year-old demographic, which makes him want to work to maintain at least this stride. 
“We’re winning in something. People in the height requirement between 5-7 and 5-11, we’re No. 1, from 11:50 to 11:55,” he joked before sincerely adding, “I never, ever care. I’ll know when someone fires me.”

Whether you binge-watched the Netflix series produced by Selena Gomez or read the book by Jay Asher, “13 Reasons Why” is one of the most gripping tales of teenage suicide. 
If you haven’t watched the show or read the book, be warned there are spoilers below.
“13 Reasons Why” follows the story of a high school student, Hannah Baker, who kills herself and leaves behind cassette tapes for her classmates that chronicle her life leading up to her death. 
The ending that’s familiar to fans of the show and book concludes with Hannah’s death, but it turns out there was an alternate version of her story. Originally, Asher had Hannah survive her attempted suicide, largely because a family member of his own had experienced a similar scenario. However, Asher ultimately decided that having Hannah survive would detract from the seriousness of the subject matter. 
Watch the video above to learn more about the alternate ending.

An alternate juror in Bill Cosby’s sexual assault trial said Monday he “probably” would have voted guilty if given the chance.
Mike McCloskey, one of six alternate jurors chosen for the nearly two-week trial, discussed his experience in an interview with Pittsburgh radio station WDVE.
“I would have probably convicted, based on the evidence that I heard,” said McCloskey.
A Common Pleas judge in Norristown, Pennsylvania, on Saturday declared a mistrial in the sexual assault case against the 79-year-old entertainer after jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. As an alternate juror, McCoskey listened to the six days of testimony with regular members of the panel, but was dismissed prior to deliberations. 
Cosby is accused of drugging and molesting Andrea Constand, former director of operations for Temple University’s women’s basketball team, in his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. 
McCoskey said the mistrial declaration was “really sad” for Constand.
“If you were to have seen Andrea Constand’s mom on the stand, she would have blown you away,” McCoskey told the WDVE hosts. “She would have made you almost cry. ... I wanted to get up and clap for this lady. That’s how good she was.”
The mistrial followed nearly 52 hours of jury deliberation. The jury included seven men and five women. All members of the panel, including the alternates, were chosen in Allegheny County ― the opposite side of Pennsylvania ― to avoid pretrial publicity.
After declaring a mistrial, the judge thanked jurors for their service and told them not to talk publicly about their deliberations, according to The New York Times.
McCoskey said he was “ridiculously sick” when he found out the jury was deadlocked. He said he had hoped to learn more about the deliberations on Saturday, when all of the jurors, including the alternates, left Norristown together for the ride back to western Pennsylvania.
“I thought there would be a lot of chatter on the bus ride home,” said McCloskey. “Nobody wanted to talk about it. It was complete silence. It was the craziest, eeriest bus ride I’ve ever taken.”
Prosecutors said they intend to retry the case.
“She has to go through it all over again,” McCloskey said of Constand. “She has nothing really financially to gain from this. She’s just looking for justice I believe.”

The untitled Han Solo film has a new director.
Ron Howard is officially signed on to finish off the “Star Wars” spinoff film, which canned its previous directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, earlier this week over their creative differences with writer Lawrence Kasdan, who also helped write “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return Of The Jedi.”
Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, made the decision official in a statement on the “Star Wars” website on Thursday. 
“At Lucasfilm, we believe the highest goal of each film is to delight, carrying forward the spirit of the saga that George Lucas began forty years ago,” Kennedy said. “With that in mind, we’re thrilled to announce that Ron Howard will step in to direct the untitled Han Solo film. We have a wonderful script, an incredible cast and crew, and the absolute commitment to make a great movie. Filming will resume the 10th of July.”
Later on Thursday, Ron Howard released a statement of his own over Twitter.
I'm beyond grateful to add my voice to the Star Wars Universe after being a fan since 5/25/77.
I hope to honor the great work already done & help deliver on the promise of a Han Solo film.
LucasFilm is still planning to release the film on May 25, 2018. The movie is set to star Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo and Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian.
Howard is a safe choice considering his longstanding ties with George Lucas. He starred in 1973′s “American Graffiti,” which Lucas directed. Howard also disclosed in 2015 that Lucas had asked him to direct 1999′s “The Phantom Menace.”
Lord and Miller, the film’s previous directors, who had directed films like “21 Jump Street” and “The Lego Movie,” said they wanted to “take risks to give the audience a fresh experience” when they first signed on to the project.
They had already been directing the project for more than four months when the studio apparently decided they had taken one too many risks. 
This post has been updated to include a statement posted to Ron Howard’s Twitter account. 

Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan clearly have a funny little girl on their hands. 
During an interview with HuffPost on Build Series Friday, Dewan told a funny story about the first time the couple’s almost 4-year-old daughter, Everly, watched “Step Up.” It was accidental, and it didn’t go over too well. 
As the “World of Dance” host and mentor explains it, the family was vacationing in Mexico when they turned on the TV and “Step Up” came on. 
“It was so funny, we were like, ‘Everly, Everly, look! It’s mommy and daddy!’ At first she didn’t think it was us,” Dewan said. “She’s like, ‘That’s not you guys.’ And I’m like, ‘No, it’s us, Evie, it’s me!’ And then she goes, ‘Can we watch something good?’ Just like that, and we were humbled. One day she’ll maybe appreciate it on a different level, but yeah, she’s not so into it.”
We had to. #stepup10years
A post shared by Jenna Dewan Tatum (@jennadewan) on Aug 11, 2016 at 4:03pm PDT
To be honest, both Channing and Jenna are a little iffy about watching their on-screen performances in the 2006 film, which launched their careers and their relationship. 
“We both cringe because ... we’re just so baby new ― our acting, we’re like, ‘What are we doing there?!’ Dewan joked. “It’s so sweet. We were talking about it the other day, like, ‘Do we remember that routine at the end?’ I think when it was the 10-year anniversary we did the lift outside in our yard just to prove that we could still do it!” (They can still do it — watch the video above.) 
As for that other dance movie her dad’s in, Everly will “have a lot of questions” when she finally gets to see it, Dewan says. 
“We got to show [’Magic Mike’] to her before one of her friends at school is like, ‘I saw this movie your dad’s in...’ She’s been at rehearsals so there’s a part of her that probably gets it.”

Kim Kardashian gave up some juicy gossip during her appearance on “Watch What Happens Live” on Sunday night. 
The reality star opened up on what really sparked the split between her and her former stylist, Monica Rose. Their split happened years ago but made headlines in April after Khloe Kardashian reportedly threatened a lawsuit against the stylist. Rose has been styling the entire Kardashian clan since 2007 and, until recently, the family publicly praised her for her work. 
Fans are dying to know what happened and Kardashian teased a little of why she walked away from Rose.  
“So my reason is not connected with this, but I will say that I read that it was said that she was the reason behind my makeover,” Kardashian said. “My makeover when I met Kanye.” 
But that’s not the case, the 36-year-old reality star says. 
Kardashian said the reason behind her new look was her husband, Kanye West, who got her a new team of stylists. 
“So she publicly said, ‘I gave her a makeover’ and it was actually Kanye that gave you the makeover?” host Andy Cohen asked. 
“But that’s not the reason for my family, that was me years ago,” Kardashian said.
Kardashian wouldn’t say why the family split with the stylist, which only piques the interest of her fans. We’re just hoping Khloe takes her big sister’s lead and opens up about her part of the feud soon. 

UPDATE ― April 5: Pepsi announced Wednesday that the company has decided to pull the ad. In a statement, the company said:
Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize. We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.
Previously:
You know how teachers in well-intentioned, but unavoidably cringey ‘90s movies starring some nice white lady tried to appeal to the youth by having her rap Shakespeare?
Well, a new Pepsi ad featuring Kendall Jenner is kind of like that, but somehow even more terrible. This two-and-a-half-minute disaster co-opts imagery of the various protests that have taken place before and after Donald Trump’s election, as well as the anger felt by many people, especially millennials, for the brand’s benefit. 
The ad follows the reality TV star as she joins a crowd of young people marching by her totally casual street-side photoshoot. Whipping off her blond wig and smearing her lipstick, young Jenner picks up a Pepsi as her contemporaries of all races and orientations smile at her and fist bump along. Seriously. Someone actually fist bumps her. 
That’s when the supermodel approaches a line of policemen monitoring the protest and hands a particularly attractive officer a Pepsi. Of course, he takes a sip, prompting the crowd to erupt in cheers. Duh, all we need to solve policing issues in this country is a refreshing beverage. 
The image of Jenner approaching the police line is all too similar to the widely shared photo of Black Lives Matter protester Ieshia Evans in Baton Rouge in 2016, as Elle notes. Unlike Jenner, however, Evans was arrested. If only she had a Pepsi in hand. 
Despite considerable backlash to the ad on social media, Pepsi is standing by the commercial. 
“This is a global ad that reflects people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony, and we think that’s an important message to convey,” the company said in a statement to Adweek on Tuesday. 

Looks like Leonardo DiCaprio is doing just fine after that breakup. 
The newly single actor, who split with his model girlfriend Nina Agdal earlier this month, was spotted in Cannes on Thursday at the amfAR Gala, surrounded by a bevy of beautiful women including Bella Hadid and Rita Ora. DiCaprio is known for his penchant for models, having previously dated Gisele Bundchen, Bar Refaeli, Erin Heatherton, Toni Garrn and Kelly Rohrbach, so these photos are, shall we say, priceless. 
Leonardo DiCaprio in his element and he mingles with a whole host of models at the amfAR Gala in Cannes https://t.co/jDjV3k3fvu pic.twitter.com/Zq9AVp60uT
DiCaprio and Agdal dated for over a year before their split was announced last week. Shortly after the reveal, the actor was spotted with friend and fellow bachelor Tobey Maguire at LA hotspots The Peppermint Club and Avenue LA. Maguire was also in attendance at the amfAR event in France’s Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc. He was photographed onstage with Chris Tucker, Uma Thurman, Will Smith and Jessica Chastain during the soiree. 
We can imagine Tobey sending Leo a text about letting loose in Cannes, to which Leo responds: “You mean tonight, Boo Boo? Club-wise?”
Head over to the Daily Mail to see more photos of DiCaprio in his element. 

I think we ALL know about the Victoria Justice/Ariana Grande meme, but just in case you don’t, here’s a refresher.
Last week, an intrepid Twitter user unearthed an old video of Victoria Justice and Ariana Grande from their time on the Nickelodeon show “Victorious.” In the clip, actress Elizabeth Gillies heaps praise upon Grande for her “beautiful” singing voice, at which point Justice adds, “I think we ALL sing.” 
The video became an instant sensation, sparking a viral meme in honor of Justice’s comment.

You may have thought the meme was just a bit of lighthearted fun, but Justice feels differently. The actress addressed the hubbub on Twitter Friday, saying the meme was “dredging up” old rumors.
“I think we ALL have better things 2 do than dredging up 7 yr old non-existent drama,” Justice wrote. “That said, I’m kind of excited to finally be a meme.”
I think we ALL have better things 2 do than dredging up 7 yr old non-existent drama. That said, Im kind of excited to finally be a meme 😂 pic.twitter.com/PclDihQYtz
We’re glad to see Justice has a sense of humor about the whole thing, especially since her response seems to have only added fuel to the fire. Fans replied to her tweet with their own hilarious versions of the meme:

No word yet from Grande about the controversy, but we can wager a guess as to how she’s feeling about all this.
Maybe if Oliver Stone had interviewed Vladimir Putin the same way Stephen Colbert grilled Stone Monday on “The Late Show,” the director wouldn’t be criticized for “fawning” over the Russian president in his new Showtime documentary “The Putin Interviews.”
After watching a clip of Stone appearing to not follow up on Putin’s assertion that Russia “never interferes with the domestic affairs of other countries,” Colbert reminded Stone that some reviews describe the “Platoon” and “JFK” filmmaker as getting “too cozy” with Putin.
Stone said he had to be polite, but Colbert wasn’t having it.
“That doesn’t seem like an interview, that seems like an opportunity for him to merely propagandize,” the host said.
The somewhat awkward back-and-forth continued with Stone noting that he pressed Putin on a number of issues, including hacking and cyber warfare. But when Stone mentioned Putin’s “calmness” and “courtesy” in the face of being “insulted and abused,” Colbert asked if Stone found anything negative about the Russian leader. “Or does he have your dog in a cage someplace?”
Watch the exchange above.
Despite a difficult past year marked with extensive online harassment and cyberattacks, comedian Leslie Jones of “SNL” and “Ghostbusters” manages to stay hilarious and positive through it all — and now she’ll get to bring those good vibes to an award show stage.
On Wednesday night, BET announced that the comedian would be hosting its annual awards this June. The hosting gig is Jones’ first time helming a major award show.
Per NBC, Jones said of the news, “I am so excited to be hosting The BET Awards this year. BET was the first network and place where I was on TV — I am looking to turn this whole experience into a joyful homecoming.”
This years #BETAwards is about to be AGGRESSIVE with our host Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg)! Get ready for Leslie MUTHA F***'IN Jones! pic.twitter.com/drMd79ieZ2
She’ll be following in the footsteps of Tracee Ellis Ross and Anthony Anderson, who hosted the BET Awards in 2016. This year, big names like Beyoncé, Bruno Mars and Chance the Rapper top the nominations list. 
Will Jones delve into politics as part of her hosting gig? While her day job at “SNL” involves regular political parody, and award shows certainly haven’t been safe from the ever-reaching hand of Donald Trump, Jones told People she’s not planning to focus on that.
“I am tired of everybody being sad and angry,” Jones said. “I want people to just downright laugh. You can’t do the event without touching on certain things, but I’m trying to make it all funny. It’s really just about pulling the elephants out of the room and, actually, I’ll make the elephant in the room laugh about it. So my goal for this show is to have a big ol’ nice barbecue, family reunion feel. I just want everyone cracking up.”
Sounds perfect to us.
The BET Awards air June 25 at 8 p.m. ET.

The couple that rocks black together stays together. 
Jennifer Aniston looked lovely at the Season 3 premiere of “The Leftovers” on Tuesday night as she rocked a one-sleeved leather dress by Brandon Maxwell.
Aniston was there to support her husband, Justin Theroux, who stars in the HBO show, which is closing out its three-year run following the upcoming season. He looked handsome in a black suit as he posed alongside his glowing wife. 
Aniston recently celebrated her 48th birthday in Los Cabos, Mexico, with Theroux, former “Friends” star Courteney Cox and her beau, Johnny McDaid.
Theroux made sure to do something special for Aniston, so he planned a dinner and got her a, well, empty piñata.
“We had a piñata and didn’t end up smashing it. What are you going to put in it? Kale? She doesn’t eat candy!” he joked to E!. 
Kale is Jen’s secret, y’all! 
“The Leftovers” Season 3 premieres April 16 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO. 

This week, CBS announced it’d be adding eight new shows to its fall TV slate that include not one leading lady. As CBS Corp. CEO Leslie Moonves explained to a skeptical reporter, “the best pilots win at the end of the day.”
Apparently, executives at the network were having trouble finding quality shows that spotlight characters who aren’t majority white men. If that’s the case, some state legislators might soon be able to lend them a hand.
Lawmakers in New York are moving forward with a bill that would encourage TV production in the state to hire women and minority writers and directors in order to “enhance the diversity of stories and casts.” Behind-the-scenes hires can have a big effect: Research has shown that hiring more women and minorities in such roles affects diversity in the end product on screens everywhere. And on-screen representation is good for everyone.
Many states, including California, Illinois and Georgia, have tax credit programs aimed to encourage film industry production for jobs and tourism. Most of “The Walking Dead,” for example, is shot in Georgia. “The Americans,” despite being set in Washington, D.C., shoots in New York City. 
Hundreds of writers, including Tina Fey and members of the Writers Guild of America, have written in support of the New York bill, Deadline reported earlier this month. (HuffPost is unionized under the auspices of the WGA-East, a sister organization of the WGA-West.) Sponsored by Sen. Marisol Alcantara and assembly member Marcos Crespo, the measure would earmark $5 million of its $420 million program to pay the salaries of women and minority writers and directors on TV shows. The hope is that by targeting TV shows, produced more quickly and in greater number, the bill will have a larger impact.
“As an Afro-Latina immigrant, I knew what it felt like to grow up feeling invisible in American culture,” Alcantara told HuffPost. “It was so rare to see a character of color on television, and when you did see one, it felt like they were tokenized, stereotyped or killed off quickly. I think the overall quality of television, the different kinds of stories that can be told, the overall landscape of the art form will benefit greatly from having opportunities for diverse people to tell their stories, which I believe this legislation will provide.” 
If passed, effectiveness of the diversity provisions would remain to be seen. To professor Darnell Hunt, director of the UCLA’s Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, legal measures are “an important tool in the toolbox” to increase on-screen diversity. But they may not go far enough.
“It strikes me as maybe a bit too little. I think maybe they could set aside a little more, when it’s such a huge problem in the industry,” Hunt said about the lack of on-screen representation, adding, “given how these tax credit programs are proven to work.”
Despite the uncertain impact, other legislators are also thinking about what they can do to help.
Some lawmakers in California, where a $330 million tax credit program aims to keep production in the film industry’s homeland, are mulling additions similar to the ones gaining steam on the opposite coast. Back in February, state assembly members Sebastian Ridley-Thomas and Kensan Chu held a hearing aimed to determine whether adding diversity provisions to the program would actually affect diversity ― both behind the camera and in front of it. Such measures are still under consideration. 
Other states are focused on diversity in film crews and other non-creator roles, although the influence of those guidelines on what we see on screen would be much smaller. In Georgia, once likened to the Hollywood of the South, a state representative held a hearing last November to consider adding provisions aimed at diversity, while Illinois already holds a diversity requirement in its state film tax credit program. Applicants there must submit paperwork proving diversity in production crews and production office hires. 
New York’s bill has a long road ahead of it: After its introduced in the state’s senate and assembly, it needs to pass there before finally landing on the desk of Gov. Andrew Cuomo. 
But with a record number of shows filmed there, nudging studios toward greater inclusion could give CBS ― and others ― more top-notch options next time around.
Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet.
“Hey,” Ben said. “Let’s all promise that in 10 years from today, we’ll meet again, and we’ll see what kind of people we blossomed into.” 
The line, delivered by Bradley Cooper in the 2001 cult hit “Wet Hot American Summer,” set the stage for a sequel that is finally almost here.
On Thursday, Netflix gave us a peek at how the gang has and hasn’t changed in the 10 years since 1981, releasing a trailer for “Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,” an eight-part limited series that will premiere Aug. 4. and take place in 1991. 
So far, it looks so good. Victor (Ken Marino) appears to be a male stripper. Lindsay (Elizabeth Banks) is hosting some sort of news show. Gene (Christopher Meloni) seems to have a kid he didn’t know about.
Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler just look kind of hilarious as well.
Almost all of the original cast will return for the new season, Netflix says, while some new faces will pop up too, like Dax Shepard and Adam Scott.
But unfortunately, it sounds like Cooper, who set up the premise for the sequel 16 years ago, wasn’t able to involved due to scheduling conflicts, which is lame.
Anyway, Aug. 4. 

Before Thurgood Marshall became the Supreme Court’s first African-American justice and won the landmark case that ended segregation in public schools, he was a lawyer for the NAACP. In 1941, more than a decade before the civil rights movement peaked, Marshall defended a black chauffeur whose white socialite employer accused him of sexual assault.
“Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman, who played Jackie Robinson in “42” and James Brown in “Get On Up,” will portray Marshall in the biopic titled, well, “Marshall.” He’s joined by Sterling K. Brown and Kate Hudson as the chauffeur and socialite, respectively, while Josh Gad plays a Jewish attorney who aided in the defense. 
Directed by Reginald Hudlin (“House Party,” “Boomerang”), “Marshall” opens Oct. 13. Watch the first trailer above.
The collective sorrow from “Star Wars” fans over Carrie Fisher’s death continues to be as vast as space.
Lucasfilm produced a Star Wars Celebration event that is currently taking place in Orlando through Sunday. The gathering has already featured appearances by “Star Wars” actors, such as Mark Hamill and Felicity Jones, and also debuted a new video tribute to Fisher, who died on Dec. 27, 2016.
Above, you can watch the nearly five-minute segment.
Composer John Williams also conducted a musical tribute to Fisher, which seemingly received a standing ovation.

Fisher’s daughter, Billie Lourd, spoke about her mother at the event on Thursday, wearing a Tom Ford dress modeled to look like Princess Leia’s iconic outfit.
“She was imperfect in many ways, but her imperfections and willingness to speak about them are what made her more than perfect,” Lourd told the crowd. “My mom, like Leia, wasn’t ever afraid to speak her mind and say things that might have made most people uncomfortable, but not me and not you. That was why she loved you, because you accepted and embraced all of her.”

The late actress’ brother, Todd Fisher, revealed last week that he and Lourd gave permission to Disney to use previously shot footage of Carrie in the next two “Star Wars” movies. 
“I think the legacy should continue,” Fisher told New York Daily News.
On Monday, Jimmy Kimmel, host of the late-night ABC talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” delivered a stirring monologue to open his show. With tears in his eyes, the host revealed that his wife had recently given birth to a beautiful baby boy.
But soon after, a nurse realized there was something wrong. 
“Billy was born with heart disease,” Kimmel said. “At just three days old, he would need open heart surgery.”
The surgery was successful, though horrifying. “It was the longest three hours of my life,” Kimmel said. The child will require multiple other procedures in his early life, as well.
But this was more than a personal moment for Kimmel, who took the time to defend other parents who might find themselves in a familiar situation someday, without the cushion of TV money. 
“Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition,” he said. “And if your parents didn’t have medical insurance, you might not even live long [enough] to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition.”
Choking back tears, he continued, “If your baby is going to die, and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make. I think that’s something that, whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?”
Sadly, the answer is no. 
Just hours before the monologue aired, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told CNN’s Jake Tapper that sick people should pay more for health insurance ― an opinion reflected in the newest proposed version of a Republican health care bill. 
Brooks, who is one of the more than 30 congresspeople who make up the so-called Freedom Caucus, a far-right contingent within the House of Representatives, made his comments in response to a claim by President Donald Trump. Trump stated Monday that he wanted to carry over Obamacare policies that protect people with pre-existing conditions. 
But the newest version of the bill wouldn’t do that, a fact Brooks emphasized.
“My understanding is that it will allow insurance companies to require people who have higher health care costs to contribute more to the insurance pool,” he said, “thereby reducing the cost to those people who lead good lives.”
Of these people who live “good lives,” he then added, “They’re healthy, they have done the things to keep their bodies healthy, and right now those are the people who have done things the right way and are seeing their costs skyrocket.”
The comments led to an anger as intense as it was predictable. After all, a recent poll found that 70 percent of Americans believe people with pre-existing conditions ― or, as Brooks calls them, “people who have higher health care costs” ― should not have to pay higher premiums, as Brooks wants them to.
Brooks added that Americans should “help” people who have pre-existing conditions “through no fault of their own,” the kind of of vague line that has become commonplace in various corners of the Republican establishment ― and that has been etched into the party’s newest health care proposal ― allowing for the facade of sympathy without the policy minutia to back it up.
HuffPost’s Jonathan Cohn explained as much late last month:
The measure’s supporters insist that their proposal would not harm people with serious medical problems. In fact, a clause states explicitly: “Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.”
But that is exactly what it would do.
[...]
Under the new proposal, insurers still couldn’t reject people who have pre-existing conditions. But states could allow insurers to charge those people higher premiums ― and to sell policies without Obamacare’s essential benefits.
Insurance markets are traditionally supposed to spread costs across large groups of people, so vulnerable people can receive help when they need it without the burden of financially devastating medical bills.
But before Obamacare, the U.S. health care system didn’t do that for people who couldn’t get coverage through a large employer. People buying on their own were at the mercy of insurers, who could charge them more, withhold benefits, or deny them coverage outright due to pre-existing conditions. And that could happen once again if the Republican bill were to become law.
Under that proposal, people without pre-existing conditions buying coverage on their own would end up paying less, on the whole. But people with asthma or diabetes could see their premiums double, according to an analysis out of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.
Someone with, say, metastatic cancer could end up paying more than $100,000 in premiums every year ― prices that could easily cripple almost any family’s finances.
On Monday night, Kimmel ended his monologue with a plea to consider the impossible choices many American families have faced. 
“No parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child’s life,” he said. “It just shouldn’t happen. Not here.” 
Whether or not it should happen, it has in the past ― and it could once again. 

It’s been roughly an eternity since the last season of “Rick and Morty” (or more accurately, roughly under two years).
The delay for the third season has gone on so long that co-creator Dan Harmon is now worried that fans are speculating the Adult Swim’s animated show won’t be coming back at all. “Rick and Morty” debuted the season three premiere on April Fool’s, but since then there’s essentially been radio silence on the subsequent episodes.
So to quell online rumors that he’s been fighting with co-creator Justin Roiland or that the show is doomed, Harmon wrote a statement truncated into tweets this morning. This apparently isn’t like the 2012 situation with Harmon’s former show, “Community,” when the NBC network and Sony ousted him, leaving a carcass of the television program to decay through a horrid Harmon-less season. 
Harmon and Roiland are just taking forever to perfect this thing. 
“But the truth in this case is so very boring,” wrote Harmon. “I will put it to you as objectively as I can ... The reason S3 took long is because it took long to write, because it was S3 of a show that we were scared to make worse than S2 or S1.”
Fair enough. It’s still entirely unclear when this wonderful show is coming back though.
A hungover thread where I address Rick and Morty devotees because I feel bad for any fan worrying about any show-threatening issue:
Justin and I are very regretful about the season taking way too long. I want to explain "what happened" because it's way less dramatic
Than you might ever imagine. Post internet TV audiences are so used to finding out there's an intriguing/confusing/intense reason 4 delays
And Christ knows if you've ever seen MY name on the internet I've only got myself to blame for an association with intrigue/confusion/drama
But the truth in this case is so very boring. I will put it to you as objectively as I can, though we aren't talking about an auto plant
The reason S3 took long is because it took long to write, because it was S3 of a show that we were scared to make worse than S2 or S1.
It's a common yet odd phenomenon. Tail-chasing, perfectionism, overthinking? One prob is that any description you pick for it
Is going to have a falseness. If I say "we overthought" someone else could say "well, no, we thought the right amount," it's like talking
About religion or something. It feels I think, to writers, sacreligious and ineffective to open the creative process and poke and label.
But don't worry about the content, because, the reason overthought slows you down is, you just do way more versions of stuff than needed.
You usually end up back where you started. So as far as I can tell, although I'm too close to it, it's just another good season of RAM
That took way too fucking long to write because it just seems like the same stuff that took way less time to write. That's it. Boring answer
As I speak, more articles are coming out about me and Justin fighting. Because it's a less boring reason for a season to take long,
And because I'm Dan Harmon, so it's a smart fucking first guess, it just happens to be hilariously not true even in the slightest.
If you do know of me at all you know that if Justin and I HAD ever fought, not only wouldn't we be able to keep it secret,
We'd be all too eager to share it with you.
Also, that's not what would make the show slow down! Fighting probably would have been a good idea, it might have sped us up.
So that's it. I shouldn't have started a thread when i need to pack for airport, but that's it. We took too long writing. Totes regrets.
And we look back and we talk to each other about how we can avoid it happening again and I'm pretty sure the reason it won't is cuz
It happened. That's how it works. You do something you don't know you're doing and then you're like oh I did that and then you do otherwise
I don't know if any danger to the show itself that comes from you believing justin and I are fighting and the show is gone forever, BUT
Like I said it breaks my heart to think of some kid reading one of these clickbait pieces after all the energy that kid has put into fandom.
The show by my metric, which is people seeing my tee shirts and saying "I love that show" has like the craziest reach of anything I've been
A part of. So..it makes sense that when you take something that loved and delay it this long and let the internet simmer, you get this stuff
And we're flattered by it and thankful to you and can't wait for you to see S3 and also JUSTIN IS A PIECE OF SHIT I'M GOING TO FIST FIGHT
End of threaddddddd so hungover
It’s a sibling’s duty to document one another’s embarrassing moments for posterity, so it’s with open arms that we receive the gift of Kendall Jenner wiping out from her sister Khloe Kardashian. 
The reality TV star shared a video of her supermodel younger sister wearing a totally weather-inappropriate furry pink coat while riding a bicycle on Instagram Tuesday. Jenner proceeds to fall on her face as the bike hits the gravel, but she doesn’t seem too fazed, laughing on her way down. 
“My work here is done,” Kardashian captioned the video. 
My work here is done..... @kendalljenner
A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on May 15, 2017 at 7:08pm PDT
If Khloe really wanted to drive her point home, she should’ve handed Kendall a Pepsi after her fall to make it all better. 

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released its list of new members for 2017 on Wednesday, among the names a mix of up-and-coming starlets and more seasoned players whose dedication has finally been recognized. 
Also, Betty White.
Yes, the household name whose acting career spans about seven decades; the icon who starred in a classic network sitcom for seven seasons and dozens of successful television and film projects besides; the beloved nonagenarian who still chooses to grace our screens through guest spots and talk-show appearances.
That Betty White. 
Aside from acting as a badge of honor for top figures in Hollywood, Academy members are given the esteemed privilege of choosing Oscar recipients. White has never been nominated for that award, but she has been nominated for four Golden Globes for her performance in “The Golden Girls” and 21 Emmy awards for various roles, five of which she won for her roles on shows including “The Golden Girls,” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” and others. She’s also got a Grammy. All of that, coupled with her standing as the legendary Betty White, makes her absence from the Academy membership until now a bit of a head-scratcher.
In recent years, as Oscar winners have continued to look a bit too white and male for many tastes, the Academy has been under pressure to diversify its voting ranks. In 2016, the organization revamped its rules to welcome a younger and more diverse array of talent into the fold, using its 2017 invitations to add many more women and people of color than years past.
Apparently, the Academy has also used the opportunity to correct the decadeslong oversight that was not inviting Betty White to join its exclusive club. Be better, guys.
The news about the remake of “It,” Stephen King’s terrifying book and miniseries, was bad enough. Then, the teaser trailer came out to haunt our dreams. Now, some brave souls have noticed a strange coincidence between the original version and the reboot, and “it” will blow your mind.
We are not clowning around here. If you don’t want to be freaked out, you should stop reading now.
Redditors recently noted the “coincidence,” and it just might chill you to the bone. Are you ready for this? 
O.M.G.
Twitter was all over it:
The last IT movie came out in 1990. Pennywise comes out and terrorises Derry every 27 years. 1990 + 27 = 2017 pic.twitter.com/gO7PTDriUw
The It mini series was in 1990. The movie is 2017. Pennywise's cycle is every 27 years. Coincidence?
In @StephenKing's #IT, Pennywise the Clown resurfaces every 27 years. It's been 27 years since the mini-series. Well played. pic.twitter.com/wo0Cjt91UZ
In the book "IT", Pennywise came back 27 years after he first attacked Derry. The TV miniseries aired in 1990. it's 2017. We get a new movie
It(Pennywise) sleeps for 27-30 years and awakens to feed on fears.Original: 1990Remake :2017I am so screwed.
Pennywise wakes up every 27 years... the original Stephen King's IT movie came out 27 years ago in 1990. pic.twitter.com/WyYJnvOiWf
In “It,” we learn that monster-clown Pennywise wakes up to terrorize Derry, Maine, roughly every 27 to 30 years. As Twitter and Reddit note, the new movie will be out 27 years after the original miniseries was released in 1990. The book was released in 1986, so the remake is around 30 years after that, too.
Is this some clever marketing scheme? Did it just happen by chance? Or is it something more sinister? Is Pennywise ... real? 
The Huffington Post reached out to Warner Bros. to find out the answer.
Until then ... hold me ... so I don’t float away. 
The “It” remake is out in September.

In honor of Mother’s Day, Melissa McCarthy paid tribute to moms during her monologue on “Saturday Night Live” last night. 
After giving a little shout out to her daughters and her own mother, the actress told all the moms in the crowd to stand up. 
“Let’s give these ladies a hand!” she said, before joking, “Every single one of these ladies who stood up have not been to the bathroom alone since they gave birth, they haven’t had a hot meal in years, all of our purses are filled with old cracker crumbs and dirty Purell bottles, and that’s OK.” 
Then, the actress pulled one lucky mom from the crowd ― who, it turns out, is mother to the show’s co-head writer Sarah Schneider ― for a special backstage tour. Chris Kelly, the show’s other co-head writer shared a photo of McCarthy and Schneider’s mom, Joan, on Instagram, writing “she had no idea this was going to happen” in his caption. 
LOOK AT THIS!! It's @sarahdschneider's mom in the monologue! And she had no idea this was going to happen. ❤️❤️❤️

During Joan Schneider’s special tour of Studio 8H, she and McCarthy picked up some props (ketchup and foot cream) and pet the hallway llama (an “SNL” legend, apparently) before they were met by Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.
“Oh my god! Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively! What are you guys doing here?” McCarthy asked, to which Reynolds deadpanned, “You invited us.” 
“Are you going to get us seats?” said Lively, as McCarthy tried to cover up the fact she didn’t remember telling them to stop by.
McCarthy nodded along, telling “The Livelys” their backstage spot was the best, before admitting to Joan Schneider she “may have been drinking when she invited them.” 
The “Spy” actress and Joan Schneider then each took a shot before McCarthy sent Joan onto the stage to “host” the show. It was all pretty adorable.

The Duggar sisters’ breach-of-privacy suit has taken an even stranger turn now that Josh Duggar ― who admitted to molesting some of his sisters as a teen ― is seeking to join those same siblings in legal action over his molestation scandal. 
Last month, Jill, Jessa, Jinger and Joy Duggar filed a federal lawsuit seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against In Touch magazine and Arkansas law enforcement over police documents released to the tabloid through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015. 
On Friday, Josh filed a motion asking to join the case, claiming that he has “suffered severe emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation and economic harm both to his personal and professional reputations” as result of In Touch’s bombshell report that alleged he molested underage girls.
In their original lawsuit, the four Duggar sisters claim they were “revictimized” by the release of the documents that contained “cosmetic redactions,” which allowed them to be identified as their brother’s victims.
Their lawsuit hinges on the assertion that, according to Arkansas law, information collected involving minors is not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The sisters claim that when they spoke to investigators as minors in 2006, they were told their statements would not be made public. Josh makes the same claims in his motion to intervene and cites the same law, however, he was actually 18 at the time he spoke to investigators. 
The City of Springdale, which the sisters are also suing, previously dismissed the allegations in the lawsuit as “without merit” and “false” in a statement to the press. In Touch has yet to respond to the lawsuit, but it’s important to recognize that Josh’s name was, in fact, redacted from the police report. In Touch even noted in the story: 
“(Note: Josh’s name is redacted from the police report but In Touch has confirmed the passages that refer to him.)” 
Similarly, the police report appears to comply with state law by redacting the names of Josh’s victims. In Touch did not identify the victims by name in its reports, and it was Jessa and Jill who identified themselves as two of Josh’s five underage victims when they participated in an interview with Megyn Kelly on “The Kelly File.” With the filing of their lawsuit, Jinger and Joy confirmed they were victims, as well. The identity of the fifth victim remains unknown. 
The sisters claim that by not redacting their parents’ names, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, In Touch clearly identified the sisters as victims. However, the Duggar parents’ names did not need to be redacted as they were not minors. 
In his motion to join the suit, Josh also states that while his sisters have been “forced to confront traumatic experiences” and had the “most private and painful aspects of their lived [sic] exposed,” they received “sympathy worldwide.”
But, Josh goes on to say that there’s just no sympathy for him ― whose youngest victim was just 5 years old:
Not so with Movant, however, for which the confidential, highly sensitive, intensely personal and humiliating nature of the information contained in the released reports has subjected him to exposure only in an intensely negative light for actions he engaged in as an indiscrete youth and that will continue to haunt him and cause him financial and emotional injury for the rest of his life.
The fall out from In Touch’s May 2015 report was swift. Josh admitted to molesting underage girls ― who were later confirmed to be his sisters. He subsequently resigned from his job as executive director of Tony Perkins’ conservative and anti-gay group, Family Research Council Action, and TLC canceled “19 Kids and Counting.” (Josh was back in the headlines over a cheating scandal involving an Ashley Madison account and claims of sex addiction later on.) 
The idea that an admitted child molester could complain about lack of sympathy is inherently ridiculous and a closer look at Josh’s motion reveals his claims to be completely contradictory.
In one breath, without actually mentioning the assaults, he refers to his abuse of his sisters as “traumatic experiences” and the “most private and painful aspects” of their lives. He then turns around and attempts to brush off repeated acts of sexual abuse as “actions he engaged in as an indiscrete [sic] youth.” In fact, the words “molestation” and “sexual assault” do not appear in Josh’s motion at all. There is not even a hint of personal responsibility for his actions in the entire motion. 
Meanwhile, his sisters Jessa and Jill previously said they had “forgiven” Josh, but the language in their lawsuit says otherwise. In the suit, the sisters state they were “sexually assaulted on several occasions by [their] brother, Josh Duggar.” The words “sexual abuse” and “sexual assault” and “molestation” are free flowing throughout the suit. It’s a far cry from how they previously characterized the incidents as “mild, inappropriate touching” when they were interviewed by Kelly. 
Via the police report: [Jim Bob Duggar] said that [Josh] had told him that [he] had been touching [redacted] on the breast and vaginal areas while [they] were sleeping.” Later in the report [Jim Bob] said there was another incident in March 2003. [Jim Bob] said that [Josh] was reading to [redacted] and [she] was sitting on [his] lap, [Josh] had touched [redacted’s] breasts and vaginal area...sometime during this timeframe [Josh] had been standing in the laundry room and [Josh] had put [his] hand under [redacted’s] dress.”
Josh is not represented by the same attorneys as his four sisters and it is unclear how they feel about him seeking to join the suit. A rep for the law firm representing the Duggar sisters told HuffPost the family is not releasing a statement on Josh’s motion at this time. 
This post has been updated to include Josh Duggar’s age at the time he spoke to investigators in 2006. It was also updated to include a response from the law firm representing the Duggar sisters.

Gregg Allman, one of the two brothers from legendary rock band the Allman Brothers Band, has died. He was 69.
He “passed away peacefully at his home in Savannah, Georgia,” according to a statement on Allman’s official website. “Gregg struggled with many health issues over the past several years. During that time, Gregg considered being on the road playing music with his brothers and solo band for his beloved fans, essential medicine for his soul. Playing music lifted him up and kept him going during the toughest of times.”
Allman was born on Dec. 8, 1947, in Nashville. He, along with his brother Duane, helped to create one of the most successful classic rock bands of all time. With that came not just music, but drugs, women and ― at times ― tragedy, including the early death of Duane.
In his later years, Allman developed hepatitis C, and suffered from an irregular heartbeat and a respiratory infection and had to have a liver transplant. In 2017, he canceled a planned summer tour, sparking worries about his health. 
Allman was born to Willis Allman, a WWII veteran who stormed Normandy Beach, came back to his bride after the war, and had two sons. His father’s life was cut short when Gregg was just 2 years old. After Willis Allman offered a stranger a ride home from a bar one night, the man fatally shot him in the back.
Neither Gregg nor Duane showed any interest in emulating their father’s military career. The boys hated the military school their mother sent them to, but found their footing in music while there, according to Rolling Stone.
“I learned to play mostly from black people,” Allman told The Guardian in 2015. “We used to listen to a station that called itself ‘The black spot on your dial.’ It played Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, and it hit Duane and me like spaghetti hitting a wall.”
By the time the Allman Brothers Band was formed in 1969, Gregg and Duane were legitimate country hippies ― long-haired, drug-smoking free-loving spirits. Duane played guitar, with Gregg on vocals. Other founding members of the band included drummers “Butch” Trucks and Jai “Jaimoe” Johnny Johnson, along with “Dickey” Betts on guitar and Berry Oakley on bass.
The Allman Brothers Band blended country, jazz, blues and Southern rock in such seamless riffs, pounding drums and twangy vocals that it earned them a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and a Lifetime Achievement award at the Grammys in 2012. The movie “Almost Famous” was also, in part, inspired by the band.
The Allman Brothers Band produced their biggest hits in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, including “Ramblin’ Man,” “Midnight Rider” and “Whipping Post.” During this time, the band experimented heavily with drugs and attracted many groupies on tour.
“Gregg was just a pretty boy,” drummer Butch Trucks told Rolling Stone in 1999. “He had blond hair, and the girls were hanging all over him.”
In his book My Cross To Bear, Gregg bragged about his sexual exploits.
“I would have women in four or five different rooms,” Allman wrote about staying in hotels while on tour. “Mind you, I wouldn’t lie to anybody; I’d just say, ‘I’ll be right back.’”
During those earlier years, he and his bandmates were also experimenting with drugs, including (but not limited to) PCP, cocaine and speed. The band loved psychedelic mushrooms so much, they made them their unofficial logo and tattooed a mushroom on each of their calves, according to Rolling Stone.
In 1971, just as the band found itself being propelled into stardom, Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident. He was  24.
“Duane was the king of laughter, always making jokes,” Gregg Allman told The Guardian in 2015. “You’ve got to keep laughing. It was what Duane would have done, and wanted us to do.”
At Duane’s funeral, Gregg played songs on his older brother’s antique guitar.
“This is a very old guitar, a very beautiful piece,” he said to a crowd of 300. “It was made in 1920 and I’m very proud to have it. And I’m very proud that you all came.”
In 1975, Allman married singer Cher in Las Vegas. The marriage lasted nine days, ending after Allman allegedly pulled a knife on her while trying to score heroin. They reconciled after learning Cher was pregnant with their son, Elijah Blue.
In 1977, Cher divorced Allman for good. The final straw was reportedly at an awards show, when Allman passed out face-first in a plate of spaghetti.
“Every now and then,” Allman wrote in his 2012 memoir, “I’ll think of all the hell I caused other people over the years.” 
Allman eventually embraced sobriety. 
“I’m doing great,” Allman told the Savannah Morning News in 2013. “I’ve been clean and sober for 19 years.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story gave the wrong year of Allman’s birth. Language has also been changed regarding Allman’s role in “Ramblin’ Man.”

On Saturday, Jessica Chastain tied the knot with fashion executive (and down-low member of Italian royalty) Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo in a private ceremony at the groom’s family estate in northern Italy. The bride wore white; attendees included fellow actors Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Edgar Ramirez.
That’s about all the Oscar nominee wanted the public to know. But during the wedding, paparazzi photos were taken from helicopters without the actress’ consent, making the internet rounds and turning an intimate moment into gossip fodder. 
In response to this invasion of privacy, the “Zero Dark Thirty” star confirmed her marriage and slammed the paparazzi in a note shared on social media Tuesday night that included a special request to her followers. 
Did you hear? Im off the market 😉Gianluca & I got married! We wanted privacy & aren't selling photos but Ill post something in the future ❤ pic.twitter.com/5VnM9qHaMX
“Did you hear? I’m off the market,” Chastain wrote, alongside a longer statement. “Gianluca & I got married! We wanted privacy & aren’t selling photos but I’ll post something in the future.”
She continued:
Thank you for all the sweet comments about my wedding. I love you and it was a beautiful day. I am going to ask you to please stop sharing the photos. Helicopters disregarded a no-fly zone & took those pics during the ceremony. Every time I see them I’m reminded of the insensitivity of that moment. I promise that I will share pics with you in the future, but I would prefer to share photos that celebrate love, not intrusion. I’m off social media for a few weeks. Much love and happiness to all of you.
Chastain’s stance makes sense given that she’s remained incredibly private about her relationship with Passi de Preposulo up until this point. The two have dated for nearly five years, but the actress has only given snippets of information to media outlets here and there.
Aside from revealing that she’s “very, very happy” with Passi de Preposulo, she told Extra in 2013 that it’s “a wonderful thing when a career does so well and your personal life goes so well.”
So, to make a long story short, stop, drop and scrap that wedding photo collage you already made until official photos are released. If watching half of “Miss Sloane” before falling asleep on a transatlantic flight taught us anything, it is that you do not, under any circumstances, mess with Jessica Chastain. 

Just when you thought you knew everything about a classic movie, someone comes along and opens you up to a world of pure imagination.
A new fan theory about “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” suggests that the golden tickets in the movie weren’t handed out at random, as we thought. The theory suggests Charlie was given the fifth golden ticket on purpose, and a few small details from the film may prove it.
The theory comes from Reddit user paulvs88, who posits Wonka “intentionally fabricated the report” that a fifth golden ticket had been found in Paraguay:
Why? He wanted somebody to find the last ticket the pure way, not just as part of the contest to win the lifetime supply of chocolate. He also wanted somebody local for many reasons. It would be much more likely for a child to be able to stay and move his entire family into the factory if he/she was local. Also if the last kid was local there would be no logistics of getting him/her to the factory because the event was just a day away.
But here’s the crazy part. The Redditor surmises that to pull this off, Wonka secretly had someone working for him: Bill, the guy running the candy shop.
Remember, Willy Wonka did already have one person working for him as a double agent. The guy we thought was Slugworth is revealed to be Wonka’s employee at the end. The Redditor says Bill, whose name is oddly another version of William or Willy, is a one of Wonka’s employees, too. 
Prepare to have your childhood rocked:
We know [Wonka] employs humans as double agents. Bill gives the kids candy and sells it as well. He reports to Wonka about everything. Wonka instructs Bill to give the last ticket to a local kid, a poor kid, an unselfish kid. Bill probably already knows these things about Charlie but just need to confirm them. When Charlie comes in with his found money Bill offers him a Slugworth or a Wonka. Charlie says “whichever is biggest”. So he gets the Wonka. Then as Charlie is walking out he says to Bill “I also want to get one for my Grandpa Joe”...that is the clincher. Bill HAS to give the ticket today because the event is tomorrow. Charlie NEVER gets to choose what candy to buy grandpa Joe. Bill says ‘here, try a traditional Wonka bar this time’ and grabs one. He doesn’t grab one from the stack as an owner would, he takes the display one and hands it to Charlie. He knew exactly which one had the ticket. It was displayed right out front but behind the counter so it could only be retrieved by him. 
Whoa. Plot twist.
The Redditor is correct about events in the film. The candy is not chosen by Charlie. Bill picks it out from the display behind him and hands it over. 
As the Redditor told HuffPost, “I saw the movie a few times recently and realized that Wonka employs Slugworth, and if Wonka did have another agent, he probably would be the candy shop owner in town. I just started thinking about it and it seemed to all fall into place.”
As further evidence, thrown in by us, Bill opens the movie by singing a song about Willy Wonka ― so he does really like that guy.
Not everything about the idea is perfect. The original post starts out by stating that the reporter in Paraguay who read the false report about a fifth ticket being found was secretly Wonka himself. But unless there was some serious makeup involved, it doesn’t seem that role was played by Wonka actor Gene Wilder.
Excluding that detail, though, the overall theory is pretty sweet. Just like all that candy. 
It also works with another “Chocolate Factory” theory that suggests Wonka had Bill and four other candy shop owners pick who got the tickets. After all, the guy we think is Slugworth (who, again, secretly works for Wonka) does seem to magically show up wherever a ticket is found. This suggests Wonka knows where they’re going to be discovered. 
That does seem to defy explanation ...

Bill Murray hasn’t “given up on movies,” as he assured a crowd about to watch his new band perform at TheTimesCenter in New York City on Thursday night. The longtime comedian, actor, party crasher and man-about-town simply wanted the opportunity to try being a musician as well.
“It’s just, this was so appealing.”
In this new group, Murray is the singer and reader of poems. He’s accompanied by the cellist Jan Vogler, violinist Mira Wang and pianist Vanessa Perez. It’s a bit of an unconventional setup, but with Murray projects that’s par for the course.
“You feel pretty much like the Rolling Stones or something like that,” Murray said when talking about being surrounded by the other talented musicians on this project.
The group will release an album in September called, “New Worlds.”
According to Murray’s retelling in a pre-performance panel moderated by The New York Times, he met Vogler in the security line for a flight to Newark, New Jersey. The intro happened when Murray jokingly expressed concern that Vogler’s cello wouldn’t be able to make it onto the plane given its shape and size. As Vogler is a renowned musician, the cello actually had its own first class ticket that got the window seat, to Murray’s mock chagrin.
Then on the flight, a passenger began to panic, which caused Murray and Vogler to join in trying to calm her down. Murray claimed Vogler had every drug and vitamin “known to man on his body, so he was able to sedate this woman.” Perhaps not the same kind of friend with a bag of drugs as Murray’s late companion Hunter S. Thompson, but the comedian is older now, and this new duo were now a team.
The New York Times moderator expressed disbelief at all this and asked if the story was real. Vogler insisted it was. As with many Murray stories though, the truth is probably beside the point.
Murray was repeatedly self-deprecating when discussing his role among these world class musicians. At one point, the moderator questioned his work ethic and whether a famous improvisor could keep up with talent who had trained to be precise. “In a group like this, you need a squeaky wheel,” Murray joked, after taking fake offense at the question.
When talking about a mini tour the group did, Murray said, “They do all the work. I’m in charge of getting us across the streets at the lights. That’s it.”
And as with any cultural event these days, the presidency of Donald Trump came up.
Murray commented on how Vogler is German, Perez is Venezuelan and Wang is Chinese. “We’re trying to make America an immigrant country again,” Murray said, a play on Trump’s “MAGA” slogan. After Murray dominated much of the conversation in the initial panel, he remarked that his bandmates have learned to refuse answering questions.
“They’ve been interrogated at the borders.” 
This isn’t Murray’s first band. When he was still a teenager, he was the lead singer for a group called the Dutch Masters. He explained to the crowd that he and his bandmates named themselves after a commercial for the cigar brand.
As you could expect, his voice has changed since then. Murray isn’t necessarily a great singer now, but he’s certainly a charismatic and charming one. At least in a live setting, the ensemble works. Murray’s plan to go on some semblance of a United States tour with the group closer to the album release is welcome news.
If nothing else, Murray sure seemed to be having fun, which as always with his work, is intoxicating to see.
“When you sing, you are expressing yourself,” said Murray during the panel. “It is a representation of yourself. So I guess that’s what I like about it.”
Watch the panel and performance below:
Things got real during this weekend’s episode of “Saturday Night Live,” thanks to one “Handmaid’s Tale-”themed sketch. 
In the skit, four women of the Republic of Gilead gather to discuss how they can resist the extremely oppressive regime controlling their lives and bodies. Then, they run into a couple of oblivious men, er, bros (Chris Pine and Mikey Day), whom they apparently used to be friends with.
The men, who clearly care more about their parties than the well-being of their former friends, can’t seem to wrap their heads around why the “girl squad” hasn’t been around as much. 
After the women inform the guys that the government took their money, jobs and children, they just stand there, confused as to why the women don’t just leave their unfortunate situations behind. 
“You guys should, like, fight back,” Day’s character suggests, as if it were no big deal.
In today’s political climate, it’s hard to turn Margaret Atwood’s dystopian fiction into a joke. This sketch presents a classic example of how those who are unaffected by oppressive laws and societal standards don’t always pay as much attention to those who are affected. 

One free item means one.
To celebrate her show’s 14th season, Ellen DeGeneres decided to give audience members some items from “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” gift shop. The instructions were clear and courteous: “Please pick 1 item to commemorate your visit. Only 1 per person please.” 
DeGeneres also set up a hidden camera by the giveaway table to see just how honest her audience was. (Trust, after all, is the most important factor in a relationship.) In a video posted to YouTube last week, we see that most turned out to be “very” honest, but one guest named Nancy had some sticky fingers. 
The host called out Nancy for grabbing too many goods. 
“You’re the kind of person that, when you go trick-or-treating and nobody’s home, you don’t just take one piece of candy, you take the bowl,” she joked, and then made it a teaching moment. 
“Let that be a lesson to you. You think nobody’s watching you, and you just need to be a good person ... You go sit in that Ellen chair right now.”
Pro tip for future guests: Ellen is always watching. 
CORRECTION: This article has been changed to reflect that video of the thievery was shared last week, but the giveaway was staged to celebrate Season 14, which kicked off last year.

It’s hard to believe that Real Housewives of Orange County (RHOC), the oldest in Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise, has been on the air for over a decade. Although Tamra Judge joined the show during its third season in 2007, it feels like she was part of the introductory ensemble which included Vicki Gunvalson, often referred to as “The OG of the OC.” Vicki is still a part of the cast and has been integral to the show’s many and varied story lines from Seasons 1 through 11. Unsurprisingly, she rejoins the cast again in the upcoming Season 12. Back in Season 3, she bonded with then-newcomer Tamra and the two have been through the highest of ups and the lowest of downs. Tamra, like Vicki, has proven she too can maintain a committed relationship with a network and franchise through reality TV’s tests, tricks, twists, trials and tribulations. The show has seen Tamra through a bitter marital demise (she’s now remarried), being screamed at by all her cast mates to the point of having to flee a room, and the turbulent on-again off-again (currently off) dysfunctional relationship with Vicki.
Somehow, Tamra and Vicki always seemed to find their way back to being close friends and partying together despite swearing they would never speak again. Last season however, it seemed that things were truly final, that there was no love left between the two ladies and there would be no reconciliation this time. Vicki had been spreading salacious rumors about Tamra’s husband Eddie, an understandable “last straw” for someone who cherishes her “third time’s a charm” marriage. What made matters worse was that Season 11 newcomer Kelly Dodd, outspoken to the point of verbal diarrhea, was Vicki’s partner in shit-talking crime.
The Housewives were divided as things became contentious. After filming for Season 11 wrapped, rumors began to fly about Kelly’s marriage and an alleged adulterous paramour. The blogs had a field day. Watch What Happens Live had to screen out callers after a few went rogue dropping bombshells live on air. Luckily for Bravo and its leading ladies, the cast would soon stop doing any press interviews because the season was over. The ensuing hiatus would give everyone a chance to catch their breaths. We, the viewers, collectively held ours, unsure of who would return the following season to pick up the pieces, clean up the mess and attempt to (as Dorinda Medley of RHONY says) “make it nice.”
I had the opportunity to speak with Tamra Judge to get a sense of how she feels going in to her tenth season, Season 12 of The Real Housewives of Orange County:
There was a ton of drama at the end of last season with Kelly Dodd and Vicki Gunvalson. However, you all have to hang out together regardless when you start filming. What was it like going into this season when you hadn’t spoken to these ladies in months?
It was scary!
I had this uncomfortable feeling going into it and I didn’t know what to expect. The girls, Vicki and Kelly, had a lot to say about David Beador (cast mate Shannon’s husband) and Eddie (Tamra’s husband). It ended in a really ugly way last season and I was a little bit nervous because I didn’t want to rehash that stuff. Also, even though you’re on a show together with these people, you just don’t want these people in your life.
That brings me to a question that my friend Megan T. has: If you weren’t filming RHOC, would you have anything to do with Vicki?
NO. There’s no need for me to.
Amy C. asks: Are there any particular Housewives that viewers will turn against this season?
You know…I don’t know…I was actually just saying that it’s such a different season this year. The cast was a little bit split almost three quarters of the way through filming .
I don’t know what Kelly and Vicki did most of the time because I was filming much more with Meghan and Shannon. Peggy is the new girl and I didn’t film with her all that much either. This season, there was lots of filming done individually and a focus on family stuff, whereas in the past there was lots of group stuff. I could be wrong but that’s how it felt. You’ll see that I am participating in a documentary about parents who have been unfairly estranged or separated from their kids called Erasing Family. (This is something that Tamra is personally passionate about – she has recently reconnected with her daughter and their relationship is a work in progress. In the first episode, she briefly mentions that she would regularly text her daughter and one day her daughter finally responded. Tamra says this relationship is on the mend with her ex-husband Simon’s cooperation).
Shannon is struggling with her weight and that’s something that lots of people connect to. She’s in her 50s, there are all sorts of hormones and it’s not as easy to lose weight as it is to gain it. Shannon is very open and candid, which makes her the perfect housewife. She really lays it all out there and that takes balls. People will really just want to hug her.
What did you think of Kelly Dodd’s return to the show after last season?
I was a little surprised, however I think she’s good TV. There’s a fine line and Andy Cohen talks about this. When people love to hate you, it still makes for good TV, but when people hate to hate you, it’s uncomfortable to watch. Kelly was really close to that line and I didn’t know if she could redeem herself, but she really does this season. I mean, she’s still Kelly, but you see a softer side of Kelly. She said outrageous things last season and I honestly didn’t know if she was capable of changing but she did. She must have internalized: “I was a bit of a jerk” and reflected. She knew what she had to work on, and she is less abrasive this season. Last season she got in trouble for things that she said, but this season she really controlled her mouth. She is a great example of someone who learned from seeing her mistakes play back on TV and I was impressed by this softer side of Kelly Dodd.
You are friends with both Lydia and Shannon and we see in the trailer that the two of them clash. How was it navigating things between these ladies who are both your friends?
Actually, it was very stressful for me. You see that I try to be a peacemaker and I explain to Lydia that “Shannon is expressive, she’s not yelling at you” and I’m trying to tell Shannon that Lydia’s really sweet which Shannon wasn’t buying. The thing is, Shannon is intense and people take something she says in a way that she really doesn’t mean. You have to get to know Shannon and once you do, it’s easy. Shannon and I are extremely close and we didn’t start out that way when we first met.
In the first episode, there’s a quick scene with you and your granddaughter. How does it feel to be a grandma?
I haven’t gotten to use the word “grandma.” Someone brought me a baseball cap that says “Glamma “and even with that, I just can’t bring myself to wear it. I had Ryan when I was really young and my mom said at the time “I’m too young to be a grandma.” Now I know how she feels! Eddie sure gets a kick out of it and constantly says “Hi Grandma!”
Jim Edmonds, the former professional baseball player and husband to Real Housewife Meghan King Edmonds, has gotten a really rough edit in prior seasons. He has seemed grumpy and not so interested in his wife, but in the first episode of Season 12 we see how amazing he is with their adorable newborn. Having met him in person, what do you think of him?
Jim IS a really nice guy and I think he might be a little uncomfortable in front of the cameras. He’s very loving to Meghan and very supportive.. but he does travel a lot so that’s gotta be stressful. He is a great dad, a really great dad.
Vicki’s new guy Steve seems to have it all together and he’s a former homicide detective!! Have you met him and what are your thoughts on this relationship?
Even though Vicki and I are not the friends we once were, I have met him a couple of times. I don’t know him really well but he seems like a nice guy, also a very handsome one.
Didn’t he do his detective work to find out more about Vicki?
I didn’t say that! (laughs) You did. I was being nice, but seriously he is a good guy. Sometimes you’ll look for things…like ‘hmm what could possibly be wrong with this guy?’ when you’re in this situation and it’s very hurtful that people were talking about Eddie and spreading malicious lies…Steve was a police officer who seems to have it all together. He appears to be a solid guy.
Amanda D. wants to know which Housewives you are closest with outside of the OC franchise.
The ladies that you see me hang out with the most this season are the ones I am also closest with: Shannon is my girl. I had kept in touch with Lydia and you’ll see us together. I’m also close with Meghan.
Why has Vicki’s daughter Briana never become a Housewife? We do see so much of her and what it’s like for her to be a mother now. Are you still close with Briana?
I don’t know why she’s not a Housewife. I actually just got together with Briana’s designer and had a full conversation about her. I like Briana but have had to pull back because I don’t have a relationship with her mother. So, out of respect to Vicki, I don’t initiate conversations or really see her. Of course, if she writes me, I’ll write back but Vicki did say to me at one point that she would not like me to talk to her daughter. I don’t necessarily agree with it, but I try to put myself in her shoes.
Erica R. asks: Are there any surprising new friendships or friendships that fall apart in Season 12?
There are some friendships that get strained, but that will occur towards the end of the season so I’m not going to spoil it for you. You will have to stay tuned. Me and Shannon and Meghan are all good friends and Shannon, Kelly and I have moved forward from where we were last season. As you know, Lydia who was on the show a few seasons ago returned for this season and we always maintained a friendship. It was nice to have Lydia back. It’s definitely a lot different this season. Lydia really has a voice this season and comparatively, she was quiet the last time she was on. Now she really stands up for what she believes in.
Real Housewives of Orange County premieres July 10 at 9/8c on Bravo.
Harry Potter is headed back into the Forbidden Forest.
To date, Daniel Radcliffe has taken a number of roles that have distanced himself from the blockbuster “Harry Potter” franchise, including playing a farting corpse in “Swiss Army Man.” The actor’s new trailer for “Jungle” seems to be doing the same — at first.
The movie, based on author Yossi Ghinsberg’s book Jungle: A Harrowing True Story of Survival in the Amazon, tells a tale of hikers struggling to survive after getting stranded in the jungle. Radcliffe plays Ghinsberg, who survived for three weeks alone in the Amazon.
It’s powerful stuff.
But if you thought this would distance Radcliffe from “Potter,” you can kiss that idea goodbye.
In between intense scenes of the hikers facing threats from humans and nature, we get a moment where Radcliffe appears to be shirtless and locked in a kiss. 
It’s hard to miss the similarities between that and another infamous kiss scene from Radcliffe’s career:
Look, Radcliffe is allowed to be shirtless and kiss anyone he wants, but did no one notice how similar the “Jungle” scene is to Harry and Hermione’s kiss in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows”? 
In both scenes, the characters are shirtless and snogging each other’s faces off in what appear to be dreamy visions. In “Harry Potter,” the vision was caused by the locket Horcrux. “Jungle” gives us a lot quick scenes which appear to be hallucinations, and from the way the background is blurred in the kissing scene, it seem like that could be one as well. Ghinsberg has said he hallucinated a woman while stranded in the Amazon in real life.
Plus, “Harry Potter” had the actors surrounded by a silvery mist, and the “Jungle” scene at least looks like the actors are surrounded by fire.
Radcliffe can have confidence that the rest of the movie looks incredibly different than “Harry Potter,” but for this scene it’s “mischief managed.” 

Fans may have spotted another error on “The Walking Dead,” and all we can say is “eye” yai yai ...
In the latest episode of the show, “Something They Need,” Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his group invade the Oceanside community, planning to take their guns and possibly getting them to fight the Saviors, too. Things get tense when the group’s leader, Natania (Deborah May), takes Tara (Alanna Masterson) hostage and threatens to kill her. But then walkers attack, and everyone basically bonds over it.
Yay.
But wait. “Walking Dead” fans think they’ve spotted an error in the scene, and it’s pretty eye-opening ...

Get ready to spend more time with the Crawleys, because a “Downton Abbey” movie is officially happening.
“It’s been in the works for some time,” Michael Edelstein, president at NBCUniversal International Studios, said Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.
Edelstein confirmed what we’ve been hearing for months while in Singapore at a red-carpet event for “Downton Abbey: The Exhibition.”
“We are working on getting the script right and then we’ve got to figure out how to get the (cast) together. Because as you know, people go on and do other things. But we’re hopeful to make a movie sometime next year,” Edelstein said.
There’s no word on which cast members will appear in the movie version, but Edelstein said he hopes to bring back 20 actors from the series. 
Production is expected to begin in 2018.
“Downton Abbey,” which follows the Crawley family in England during the early 1900s, ran from 2010–15. It was was broadcast in some 150 countries.

With last week’s release of her single “Malibu,” we’ve entered the era of Mellow Miley Cyrus.
Mellow Miley is older, wiser and has a few regrets ― namely the 2013 video for “Wrecking Ball.”
On Monday, the 24-year-old stopped by “The Zach Sang Show” and played a game of “Marry, Eff, Kill” with a twist. Using the traditional rules of the game, Cyrus was forced to reveal her true feeling about her hit songs on the radio show.
“Marry would probably be ‘The Climb’ because it still has a message I’m down with,” Cyrus said, adding she would “eff” her 2008 song “7 Things,” which is believed to be about her relationship with Nick Jonas.
“Kill would be ‘Wrecking Ball.’ That’s something you can’t take away ― swinging around naked on a wrecking ball lives forever,” she explained. “Once you do that in the mass that I did, it’s forever. I’m never living that down. I will always be the naked girl on a wrecking ball. No matter how much I just frolic with emus, I’m always the naked girl.”
Cyrus added, “I should have thought how long that was going to follow me around. That’s my worst nightmare ― that being played at my funeral.”
“Wrecking Ball” was the second single off the singer’s 2013 album “Bangerz,” which, at the time, was part of a campaign to introduce the world to the New Miley, who smoked weed, popped molly, twerked and was accused of “degrading” a foam finger while she rubbed up against Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV VMAs. 
At the time, Cyrus appeared to be trying to break free of what she perceived as family-friendly shackles imposed on her during her contract with Disney while starring on “Hannah Montana.” 
This New Miley was supposed be the real one ― or so she thought.  
“I feel like I can really be myself,” Cyrus told Billboard of “Bangerz” in 2013. “I really have more of a connection of who I am, and I feel like I can maybe express that more in my music now.”
That was early on in terms of New Miley, though. Her 2015 album “Dead Petz” ushered in an era that pushed boundaries even further, making the “Wrecking Ball” video look G-rated in comparison. During the tour, she performed wearing prothetic breasts and a strap-on dildo, while her videos became, well, just weird.
Cyrus didn’t get to pick which three songs to play “Marry, Eff, Kill” with, but her reaction to “Wrecking Ball” seems to indicate a new, more mature public face.
“I love talking to people, and I approach them in a normal, ‘Don’t treat me different, ’cause I’m not’ way. That’s what started this evolution for me, getting out of my ‘Dead Petz’ phase,” she told Billboard for a recent cover story. “People stare at me anyway, but people stare at me a lot when I’m dressed as a ­fucking cat.”

The Season 7 debut of “Game of Thrones” is still weeks away, but fans have something to look forward to: the longest episode ever. 
The upcoming season of the hit HBO series will feature multiple episodes over 60 minutes, including a series record-breaker. 
That episode is “coming in around 90 minutes,” showrunner David Benioff told Entertainment Weekly in an interview published Thursday. The season also includes the series’ shortest episode, which clocks in at 50 minutes, according to Benioff.
Previously, Season 6’s finale, “The Winds of Winter,” stood as the series’ the longest episode at 69 minutes. 
Fan blog Watchers on the Wall shared a list of Season 7 episode run times Thursday. While there are only seven installments, they total about 7 hours and 20 minutes of viewing time. 
As for what’s to come, viewers have a Stark reunion to look forward to, Cersei’s possible demise and lots of people on fire. Season 8 will be the show’s final season ― and Jon Snow actor Kit Harington is not ready to leave behind his sword. 
“It’s a huge thing and it’s been very close to my heart,” Harington told the Belfast Telegraph. “I’ll miss the family and coming back here, and even this costume and the fight scenes. The costumes and weaponry are incredible. I said from the start that I wanted the Long Claw sword but as the (show’s) momentum’s grown, it’s become very expensive and will probably end up in a HBO museum. Hopefully they’ll make me a replica.”

Sofia Coppola movies can be measured in flashy soundtrack choices. Since her 1999 debut, “The Virgin Suicides,” and through the anachronistic anthems of “Marie Antoinette” and the hip-hop excess of “The Bling Ring,” Coppola has become known for the evocative songs accentuating her characters’ sun-kissed reveries. 
Music has always been integral to Coppola’s life. She grew up worshiping Elvis Costello, The Clash, New Order and Generation X ― and later directed music videos for their heirs (The Flaming Lips, Kevin Shields, The White Stripes, Phoenix). As a teenager, she thought Madonna’s style was the essence of cool ― and later starred in the “Deeper in Deeper” video. (“She’s smart and funny, as you would imagine,” Coppola said of Madonna.) Coppola’s commercials, including a Dior ad starring Natalie Portman that’s scored by a remixed “La Vie en Rose,” are as much fashion advertisements as they are melodic escapades. 
Coppola’s affinity for stirring soundtracks is partly what makes her latest movie, “The Beguiled,” so jarring: It’s the first time she hasn’t incorporated any pop numbers. Her husband’s band, Phoenix, provided ambient notes that emphasize the Southern Gothic tone here and there, but most of the score comes from chirping crickets and distant cannon booms surrounding the central Civil War-era plantation. 
Ahead of the release of “The Beguiled,” I sat down with Coppola in New York to discuss her career. During our final few minutes together, I asked the director to reflect on a handful of musical highlights from her catalog.
“The Beguiled” is now open in limited release. It expands nationwide June 30.
Blockbusters, once associated only with the dog days of summer, are now year-round events. But as long as studios keep packing the hottest months with one big-budget spectacle after the next, we’ll offer some recommendations on which ones look the most promising. (Sorry, “Transformers.”) 
In between all that computer-generated action, you’ll also find indie charmers, thoughtful documentaries and a few intimate genre pieces likely to generate buzz. (Enough with you, “Transformers.”)
Here are 23 options fulfilling all sides of the moviegoing spectrum. (Bye, “Transformers.”)
All release dates are subject to change.

The typical pop star reinvention cycle is something we’ve seen many times before. Madonna’s done it, Lady Gaga’s done it, Britney Spears has done it — the list goes on. It’s a pattern that’s existed for years: A performer, often a woman, sheds the persona that launched her career in favor of something totally different. Usually it’s a little sexier, more mature, maybe even raunchier. 
Male pop stars go through these reinventions, too, but when their female counterparts do it, it seems the whole world is standing by, ready to criticize their every performance or clothing choice or paparazzi photo.
It’s no secret society loves tearing women down. As Sady Doyle, author of Trainwreck, said in a 2016 interview with Heleo, “I think that as long as women have been in public, there have been people very invested in policing the way they’re allowed to engage with the world.” 
In the case of pop music, that’s no different. Let’s look at Miley Cyrus. The former “Hannah Montana” star is going through a reinvention of her own right now, but instead of shedding the good-girl image she was known for at the beginning of her career for something more risqué ― she’s been there, done that ― she’s moving in the other direction. 
The woman who once danced on Robin Thicke while violating a foam finger, gloated about smoking weed and swung naked on a wrecking ball, is once again embodying a wholesome persona. Cyrus, much like her hair, has seemingly grown out of the wild child phase. She’s gone back to her roots, literally and figuratively, and the only remnants of her short-lived past are her bleached-out ends. You might even say she’s attempting to come full circle. However, much like the first time Cyrus tried her hand at a reinvention, she’s not having an easy go at it. We, as part of a society interested in the rise and fall of our public figures, aren’t letting her live down her past shortcomings. 
Cyrus is a highly public figure, and has been since she was just a preteen cog in the Disney star machine. From the get-go, the now-24-year-old was positioned to be a role model for young girls ― whether or not she actually wanted that role didn’t seem to matter ― and any time she strayed from her squeaky clean mold, people made sure to point it out.
There was the Vanity Fair photo shoot she did with Annie Leibovitz at age 15, in which she posed topless, save for a large, billowing sheet covering her chest. Cyrus stood by the image at first, but after the public outcry, said she was embarrassed by it. Then there was her performance at the Teen Choice Awards in 2008, during which she rode an ice cream cart and held a pole for balance. That sparked controversy too, and she was called out for pole dancing. It didn’t matter that what she did barely constituted as pole dancing. She was 15, and the simple act of holding a pole was enough to cause outrage. 
Fast forward a few years to the “Bangerz” era. There was her now-infamous MTV VMAs performance with Robin Thicke, during which she wagged her tongue around and grinded on him, all while dressed in a flesh-toned latex two-piece, because it was the closest to naked she could be ― and she really loved being naked. The backlash came in hard and fast.
Plenty of the response had to do with Cyrus’ clear-cut cultural appropriation, which shouldn’t be ignored. Some critics called her past VMAs act a “minstrel show,” pointing out how she reduced her black backup dancers to “exaggerated sex objects.”
Others, however, took issue with her in-your-face sexuality. One mother wrote an open letter slamming Cyrus, calling her “a desperate girl screaming for attention: Notice me. Tell me I’m pretty. See how hot I am. I know all the guys want me. All the girls want to be me.” Other folks online called the performer “trashy” or “wild and just out of control.” “Morning Joe” anchor Mika Brzezinski concluded Cyrus must be “deeply troubled, deeply disturbed” and suffering from “confidence issues.” There was even a meme floating around in which Billy Ray Cyrus’ face was superimposed into a photo from the performance, as though he were pensively watching over his daughter. 
In the months following that performance, Cyrus did anything and everything to make us forget about her PG past. (And you can bet she didn’t apologize for her “raunchy sex show.”) Given the scrutiny she’d endured in her Disney era, you could look at Cyrus’ X-rated transformation as an attempt at taking some control over her image, holding up a huge middle finger to the people who’d watched her rise and falter before. Cyrus could be seen as what Doyle calls a “trainwreck,” that is, “a woman who has her narrative stolen.” In Doyle’s words, this woman “becomes a public spectacle and a sort of culture villain, either for being sexually too much or emotionally too much, often both.” 
The more Cyrus performed her new sexualized persona (see: the videos for “Wrecking Ball” and “Adore You” and her eventual penchant for wearing strap-on dildos in concert), the more members of the public ― fans and critics alike ― were able to contort the way they viewed her. It was a game of pop cultural tug of war. 
 Cyrus didn’t let that stop her from pushing the boundaries. By the time she released her psychedelic, acid trip of a record “Miley Cyrus and her Dead Petz,” there was nothing she could do to shock us.
“There’s now nothing [she] has to hide from us. There’s nothing more we can take from her,” Doyle told Heleo of Cyrus. “We can’t steal images of her naked body, because she’s giving them away. That’s what I see her doing, leaning into the trainwreck so as not to be swallowed alive by it.”
Now, as Cyrus tries to shed her “Bangerz” persona for something a little more toned-down and less about the spectacle, we have, once again, continued to find fault with her latest reinvention.
Some criticisms against Cyrus and her old persona, like those taking issue with her exploitation of black culture and how easily she discarded it for her benefit, are certainly valid. In a May 2017 Billboard interview, the once-again wholesome Cyrus addressed the cultural appropriation (but denied her guilt), adding that she can longer listen to most rap music: “It was too much ‘Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock’ ― I am so not that.”
HuffPost’s own Zeba Blay summed it up in response, “How convenient it is for her to call out hip-hop’s misogyny (a reality that black feminist hip-hop fans have to grapple with in a real way) after she exploited black female bodies in her own music videos and stage performances.”
But other criticisms ― primarily those lobbed at her sexed-up persona ― are harder to digest. In that same Billboard interview, Cyrus offered a brief explanation of her much criticized, overly sexual past. “All the ­nipple pastie shit, that’s what I did because I felt it was part of my political movement, and that got me to where I am now,” she said. But did she need to?
In terms of the way Cyrus chooses to present herself ― sexual, wholesome or otherwise ― where should critics draw the line? We get mad at her for being too sexual, too vulgar, but when she goes on to embody the subtler norms our society promotes, we also find it “creepy,” as Amanda Petrusich wrote in The New Yorker, “inauthentic” as Anne Donahue wrote in an article published by Flare, or as Lucy Watson at Junkee wrote, “boring as hell.”  
This love-hate narrative is nothing new. One minute we love Taylor Swift for promoting girl power, the next we’re calling her fake, accusing her of using feminism as a marketing tool. Same goes for Selena Gomez ― we praise her when she brings awareness to mental health, and when she poses with a “fall risk” bracelet on, straight from the hospital where she was being treated for lupus, we accuse her of sending the wrong message to her fans. 
It’s hard not to think that if Cyrus, or any of her fellow female pop artists, were a male pop star ― say, Justin Bieber, for example ― the reactions to her reinventions wouldn’t have been so harsh. 
Like Cyrus, Bieber began his career with a pretty wholesome image, but somehow managed to skip the role-model requirement that seems compulsory for young female pop stars. The singer has had his fair share of public mishaps over the years — peeing in a bucket at a restaurant, getting arrested for driving under the influence — but instead of being raked over the coals for his indiscretions, Bieber seemed to emerge from each one unscathed. Take his recent, shoddy rendition of the Spanish lyrics of “Despacito,” which led even one of the song’s original writers to defend him on NBC News.
Did he get a free pass? (Well, not everyone let him off that easy.)
Bieber’s narrative has become one of redemption, about finding purpose (that’s even the name of his latest album), and we ― this writer admittedly included ― are eating it up. We want Bieber to succeed. We don’t care about all the stupid things he does (especially when he’s pumping out jams like “Sorry” and “What Do You Mean?”) because we expect him to continue making dumb mistakes. We don’t afford someone like Cyrus that same allowance to fail. 
Alternatively, there’s Justin Timberlake, whose career arc embodies aspects of both Cyrus’ and Bieber’s, but has been relatively tame as far as controversies go. 
Like both Cyrus and Bieber, he embodied a family-friendly persona for much of his early career. Since he was part of the Disney machine, it’s fair to assume he was expected to keep his clean image intact. It wasn’t until Timberlake’s messy public split from Britney Spears that he really began his transformation from teen heartthrob to bona fide sex symbol.
Timberlake adopted a smooth R&B sound, and worked with producers like Pharrell Williams (much like Cyrus) and Timbaland. As Cosmopolitan pointed out, the singer has gotten away with cultural appropriation for years, and only now are people taking note. (Remember that tone-deaf tweet about Jesse Williams’ BET Awards acceptance speech?) He’s sold millions of records and won Grammys.
One reason that could explain the ease with which both Bieber and Timberlake have continued to rise is the simple idea that, as Constance Grady wrote at Vox, our culture has a “general willingness to grant good-looking young white boys more leniency than we grant to young women (or most other people).” Of course they’re both flawed-yet-talented people, but so is Cyrus. 
For the former tween star, a true “redemption” in the eyes of the media may not be possible. Not only does she now have to prove herself as a serious artist, she has to reconcile her past with her present and do so in a way that seems honest and authentic. Transcending her “Bangerz” era, especially without acknowledging the mistakes she made along the way, was never going to be easy. Things like her Happy Hippie Foundation and her recent performance at the One Love Manchester show might prove beneficial in appeasing opponents, but at this point, it’s not clear whether she’ll be able to truly move on ― she herself has noted she’ll probably never be able to live down her “Wrecking Ball” music video. 
And maybe we’re the ones to blame. After all, we’re the ones who perpetuate this cycle of love and hate.

The Roloff family in “Little People Big World” has just welcomed the first member of the reality TV program’s third generation: Jackson Kyle, born to Zach and Tori Roloff.
“Baby and mother are doing great and Jackson has already mastered holding Daddy’s fingers and snuggling with Mom,” Zach said in a statement. “He is adorable and Tori and I are loving being parents.”
On Instagram, Tori posted: 
Jackson Kyle Roloff Born May 12th at 8:00am 9 LBS 1 OZ  20 1/2 inches long Mom and Dad are so in love with you already 💙👶🏻 #ZandTpartyofthree
A post shared by Tori Roloff (@toriroloff) on May 14, 2017 at 4:24pm PDT
Jackson was born on Friday, weighing in at just over 9 pounds and measuring 20.5 inches long. The baby arrived two days after Zach’s 27th birthday. (Tori is 25).
The couple married in 2015, almost a year after the wedding of Zach’s twin, Jeremy Roloff. Jeremy and his wife, Audrey, are expecting a baby girl in the coming months. 
Tori’s pregnancy was a key theme of the TLC program this season. Zach, who is a little person with achondroplasia, and Tori, who is normal size, discussed whether their baby might have dwarfism.
Zach was torn. Part of him wanted a son like him, but worried about the potential health problems linked to dwarfism. Zach was also concerned about the issues his son could face with peers.
“What am I going to say? ‘Oh yeah, I want a dwarf baby? I can’t wait for that kid to be bullied?’” Zach told his twin in one episode.
“Everything’s going to be fine with the baby,” said Jeremy. 
“I hope so,” Zach said.
Brand new grandparents Matt and Amy Roloff were over the moon.
“Little People Big World” airs on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. 

Sean “Diddy” Combs is too pure for this world and we must protect him at all costs. 
The rapper and business mogul premiered his new documentary “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop,” which traces the legacy of his Bad Boy Records label, in Los Angeles Thursday night. The event boasted an impressive celebrity guest list, including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Madonna, and, yes, Kendall Jenner.
Diddy shared a slew of photos from the night, but one in particular caught the internet’s attention, a short video of him posing with the 21-year-old supermodel. 
“Last night @kyliejenner #cantstopwontstop #aboutlastnight,” he wrote in the caption, accidentally tagging Jenner’s sister, Kylie Jenner, instead of her.

He quickly corrected his mistake and apologized for the mixup in the comments after the internet was done thoroughly high-fiving and roasting him. 
“I’m human people. I make mistakes Sorry,” he wrote.
A post shared by Diddy (@diddy) on Jun 22, 2017 at 1:01pm PDT
Last month, Diddy brutally cropped the Jenner sisters out of a photo at the Met Gala, sparking the glorious hashtag #DiddyCrop.

He can’t be stopped now, ’cause he’s bad boy for life.

“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” ratings might be in free fall, but everyone from Kim to Kourtney has been seriously delivering in the drama department lately.
Over the last couple of episodes, Kim chased a “tramp” groupie out of a bathroom, Scott Disick is spiraling out of control like self-destructive human metronome and Kourtney, well — after 13 seasons, she’s finally become the protagonist of the show. 
In a sneak peek at next week’s episode, which finds the famous family vacationing in Costa Rica for the umpteenth time, Kourtney goes full birthday suit for a poolside photo shoot directed by photographer Mike Rosenthal.
”I honestly was worried about you after Penelope,” Khloe tells her sister in the confessional about stripping down. “I did think, like, she’s gone. Now, she’s YOLO-ing it up, f**king bomb ass body, naked in the pool and your sisters should be afraid of you.”
The 38-year-old mother of three apparently has no qualms about going nude in front of her sisters (along with an entire camera crew and an army of assistants) and takes it all off like it’s no big deal. 
Kourt looks so good that even Kylie, who’s no stranger to a risqué photoshoot, admits she’s “jealous,” after, of course, she wrestles her older sister to the ground. We’re thankful for the Kardashians for so many reasons, but maybe most of all for blessing us with this GIF.
The Clooney twins have arrived! 
George and Amal Clooney welcomed twins Ella and Alexander on Tuesday, a rep for the couple told the Associated Press. The couple released a statement about the birth of their children, telling People:
“This morning Amal and George welcomed Ella and Alexander Clooney into their lives. Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine.  George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”
News of Amal’s pregnancy was first confirmed in February, but George ― as well as his famous friends ― has been open about his and Amal’s journey to parenthood since then. 
“She is doing really great,” George told Extra of Amal in March. “She is amazing. I don’t have anything to do. There is nothing I can do to help, but make tea and stuff.”
“I know swaddling,” he added. “I know what I’m in for.”
George’s close pal Matt Damon joked to Ellen DeGeneres, “I don’t know how anybody does twins. Those sleepless nights … and then there’s two of them? There’s just no way. But we’ll see what happens.” He later told Us Weekly, “I’ve never had twins, so he’s totally on his own! He’ll be great!”
Julia Roberts, who has twins herself, also offered up some words of wisdom. “Nobody is there with you at 3 o’clock in the morning when you’re just going, ‘What do we do now? Where did they come from? And when are they going?!’ You get through it and you figure it out,” she told Ellen of her parenting advice for the actor, “everybody does, and it’s a trial and error and a whole lot of tears.”
George and Amal, who’ve been together since 2013, tied the knot in September 2014 in Venice, Italy. The twins are the first children for the pair. 
There’s no denying Kylie Jenner is one business-savvy teenager. 
The 19-year-old starlet has the honor of being the youngest person on Forbes’ 2017 list of The World’s Highest-Paid Celebrities, in which the outlet calculates celebrities’ earnings from the last 12 months.
Jenner’s reality show deals, cosmetic company, endorsement deals and clothing lines earned her $41 million. That places her at No. 59, beating out older stars such as Jennifer Lopez (No. 65), Rihanna (No. 77) and Britney Spears (No. 89). 
Plus, she’s only a dozen spots below her 36-year-old sister, Kim Kardashian, whose earnings of $45.5 million placed her at No. 47. Kardashian was the only Kardashian-Jenner family member who made the 2016 list, having earned $51 million. 
wow woke up the youngest entry on the @Forbes 100 list .. 🙏
But that kind of success does come with some drawbacks. In the last year, Jenner lost a legal battle with Kylie Minogue to trademark the name “Kylie” and settled a lawsuit filed by a makeup artist for stealing her work. The teen has also been accused multiple times of cultural appropriation. And Jenner’s newest “Kylie Shop” merchandise release is plagued with claims that she stole the work of another designer.
Even with all that, though, it looks as if 2017 will be the year of Kylie Jenner. (After all, 2016 was the year of, like, realizing stuff.)
What were you doing at 19?

These days Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are far more “By the Sea” than “Mr. and Mrs. Smith.” By that we mean, they’re no longer waging an all-out media war against each other, and seem to have settled into a semi-melancholic, but peaceful existence.
Months after reaching an agreement that grants Jolie full custody and Pitt “therapeutic visitation,” Hollywood’s fallen golden couple are trying out this whole “co-parenting” thing. Pitt enjoyed Saturday with several of his children for an early Father’s Day get-together, according to People.
The kids were dropped off at Pitt’s home in Los Angeles in the morning before rejoining Jolie for a flight to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the birthplace of the couple’s 12-year-old daughter, Zahara, later in the day. 
Spending a couple hours with his kids might not seem like much, but considering Pitt’s contentious relationship with Jolie since the couple separated last September, it’s something worth noting. 
Since announcing their divorce, the pair have been locked in a custody battle over their six children ― Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8 ― amid allegations of child abuse. Pitt was later cleared of all charges. 
They reached a turning point late last year, agreeing to settle their differences out of court and committing to prioritizing the best interests of their children. 
“I was really on my back and chained to a system when Child Services was called. And you know, after that, we’ve been able to work together to sort this out. We’re both doing our best,” Pitt explained to GQ Style about the custody battle.  
“I heard one lawyer say, ‘No one wins in court ― it’s just a matter of who gets hurt worse.’ And it seems to be true, you spend a year just focused on building a case to prove your point and why you’re right and why they’re wrong, and it’s just an investment in vitriolic hatred. I just refuse. And fortunately my partner in this agrees.”

No matter who snags the crown Saturday, Dannielynn Birkhead and father LarryBirkhead have won for the sweetest dad-and-daughter appearance.
The 10-year-old daughter of the late model Anna Nicole Smith continued her annual tradition of hitting the Kentucky Derby red carpet with her father this weekend. Both were decked out in cream and pink outfits Saturday, with Dannielynn topping her outfit off with a headpiece perfectly suited for the festivities. 
The pair also made an appearance the night before, all dolled up in formal attire for the 29th Barnstable Brown Kentucky Derby Eve gala.
In an interview with the “Today” show last year, Larry explained that he’s not interested in pushing his daughter into the spotlight.
“People call me all the time and say can she be in a movie, can she model?” Birkhead said at the time. “I didn’t care about it, so I’d say no, she’s not interested. She’s just a regular kid.”
Dannielynn has been making the Kentucky Derby rounds with her dad since 2010, when she was 3 years old. Clearly, her love of pink hasn’t changed a bit. And neither has her close bond with her dad.

The last few years have been a strange era for television as Netflix and Amazon Prime invest millions and millions of dollars on new shows to try to establish dominance over your streaming time. Unlike the movie and music industries where only the biggest stars seem to get large payouts, your favorite niche comedians can auteur their own series for multiple seasons in this “golden age.”
Streaming companies often seem to be a patron for the arts, rather than a straightforward cash-grab of combining A-listers with flashy special effects. Or rather, it has made little sense that while the traditional broadcasters only break the bank for lowest-common-denominator-treading sitcoms, the rules don’t apply for Netflix. The streaming service takes on a wide range of projects and rarely cancels its original programming.
But that might be coming to an end.
Netflix, which recently canceled the very expensive “The Get Down” as well as “Sense8,” may have more cancellations on the way if founder and CEO Reed Hastings’ recent comments are true. 
Hastings told CNBC in an interview that he’s trying to steer the company in the direction of axing more projects.
“Our hit ratio is way too high right now,” Hastings said, as Vulture transcribed. “So, we’ve canceled very few shows ... I’m always pushing the content team: We have to take more risk; you have to try more crazy things. Because we should have a higher cancel rate overall.”
Still, it’s unclear from this one interview if pre-existing shows on Netflix are more in trouble than before; maybe it’s just that Netflix won’t approve some truly ridiculous new shows? 
But with the recent cancellations, it does seem as if the company is making a ― to quote one of the most popular shows on the service ― “pivot.”
Hastings continued to talk about Netflix’s decisions in the interview and gave some insight into how they’re made.
“It’s a mix [of viewing and subscriber growth],” said Hastings of cancellations. “Mostly, it is how many people watch. But those are very connected.”
Although Netflix doesn’t release traditional viewership numbers, this quote from Hastings revealed that the metric of sheer popularity is ― at least now ― their “most” important measure for success. This seems to suggest that the more niche projects could be in trouble.
In the interview, Hastings reiterated that Netflix still plans to keep increasing its spending budget for content. The company is investing $6 billion this year and, according to the CEO, will continue to increase the spending by “a lot.”
Sean “Diddy” Combs is too pure for this world and we must protect him at all costs. 

Just when you thought you knew everything about a classic movie, someone comes along and opens you up to a world of pure imagination.
A new fan theory about “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” suggests that the golden tickets in the movie weren’t handed out at random, as we thought. The theory suggests Charlie was given the fifth golden ticket on purpose, and a few small details from the film may prove it.
The theory comes from Reddit user paulvs88, who posits Wonka “intentionally fabricated the report” that a fifth golden ticket had been found in Paraguay:
Why? He wanted somebody to find the last ticket the pure way, not just as part of the contest to win the lifetime supply of chocolate. He also wanted somebody local for many reasons. It would be much more likely for a child to be able to stay and move his entire family into the factory if he/she was local. Also if the last kid was local there would be no logistics of getting him/her to the factory because the event was just a day away.
But here’s the crazy part. The Redditor surmises that to pull this off, Wonka secretly had someone working for him: Bill, the guy running the candy shop.
Remember, Willy Wonka did already have one person working for him as a double agent. The guy we thought was Slugworth is revealed to be Wonka’s employee at the end. The Redditor says Bill, whose name is oddly another version of William or Willy, is a one of Wonka’s employees, too. 
Prepare to have your childhood rocked:
We know [Wonka] employs humans as double agents. Bill gives the kids candy and sells it as well. He reports to Wonka about everything. Wonka instructs Bill to give the last ticket to a local kid, a poor kid, an unselfish kid. Bill probably already knows these things about Charlie but just need to confirm them. When Charlie comes in with his found money Bill offers him a Slugworth or a Wonka. Charlie says “whichever is biggest”. So he gets the Wonka. Then as Charlie is walking out he says to Bill “I also want to get one for my Grandpa Joe”...that is the clincher. Bill HAS to give the ticket today because the event is tomorrow. Charlie NEVER gets to choose what candy to buy grandpa Joe. Bill says ‘here, try a traditional Wonka bar this time’ and grabs one. He doesn’t grab one from the stack as an owner would, he takes the display one and hands it to Charlie. He knew exactly which one had the ticket. It was displayed right out front but behind the counter so it could only be retrieved by him. 
Whoa. Plot twist.
The Redditor is correct about events in the film. The candy is not chosen by Charlie. Bill picks it out from the display behind him and hands it over. 
As the Redditor told HuffPost, “I saw the movie a few times recently and realized that Wonka employs Slugworth, and if Wonka did have another agent, he probably would be the candy shop owner in town. I just started thinking about it and it seemed to all fall into place.”
As further evidence, thrown in by us, Bill opens the movie by singing a song about Willy Wonka ― so he does really like that guy.
Not everything about the idea is perfect. The original post starts out by stating that the reporter in Paraguay who read the false report about a fifth ticket being found was secretly Wonka himself. But unless there was some serious makeup involved, it doesn’t seem that role was played by Wonka actor Gene Wilder.
Excluding that detail, though, the overall theory is pretty sweet. Just like all that candy. 
It also works with another “Chocolate Factory” theory that suggests Wonka had Bill and four other candy shop owners pick who got the tickets. After all, the guy we think is Slugworth (who, again, secretly works for Wonka) does seem to magically show up wherever a ticket is found. This suggests Wonka knows where they’re going to be discovered. 
That does seem to defy explanation ...

Two days after the friend of a late “Toy Story” writer revealed a previously untold and devastating story about Andy’s dad, a Pixar writer lashed out on Twitter calling it “utterly” false.
Let’s back up. This week, Jonathan Carlin of Super Carlin Brothers published his YouTube video interview with Mike Mozart, a toy designer who was friends with Joe Ranft, the Pixar head writer who co-wrote “Toy Story.” 
According to Carlin’s interview, which went viral this week, Mozart said Ranft had revealed to him over lunch why the dad of main character Andy was suspiciously absent from the film. Mozart told HuffPost he had met Ranft through his work in toy design. Their conversation about Andy’s backstory took place over a decade ago, he said, before Ranft died in 2005.
The video of Mozart and Carlin eventually caught the attention of Andrew Stanton, who was on the writing staff with Ranft for the first two “Toy Story” films. 
Stanton on Saturday rebutted Mozart’s claim that Ranft had a secret backstory by tweeting a link to a news article about Mozart’s interview and calling it, “Complete and utter fake news.” He included the hashtag #Iwasthere.
Complete and utter fake news. Everyone go back to your homes. Nothing to see here, folks. #Iwasthere https://t.co/06j37YKKt2
However, Stanton’s tweet did not specify what was fake about the interview and representatives for Stanton and Pixar did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for clarification. 
Ranft’s story, as Mozart recalled to Carlin, goes like this: Andy’s father is also named Andy. He was the original owner of the Woody doll. As a kid, Andy Sr. was poor, bullied and a huge fan of the TV show “Woody’s Roundup.” He was also the only kid in the world who had Woody, which he received after writing a letter to a cereal company, because the doll was the sole prototype of a marketing gimmick that had been cut short after Woody’s TV show was canceled. (This theory would explain why Woody was considered so rare in the sequel.)
Then, Andy Sr. contracted polio and nearly all of his toys ― except for Woody, Slinky and Mr. Potato Head ― were burned as a result. He eventually recovered from the disease, grew up, got married and had a son whom he named after himself. Later in life, Andy Sr. was diagnosed with a fatal case of post-polio syndrome. On his deathbed, Andy Sr. asked his son to retrieve a chest from the attic. By the time Andy Jr. returned with the chest, his father had already died.
Andy Jr. opened the chest with a key left to him by his father after the funeral. Inside was Mr. Potato Head, Slinky and, of course, Woody.
My Toy Story Interview is the Top Trending on Twitter!! From an interview I gave a few days ago pic.twitter.com/qp2oWekUTx
Despite Stanton’s denial, Mozart stands by the retelling of his conversation with Ranft.
“It’s not a theory,” Mozart told HuffPost. “The story was told to me by Joe Ranft about 12 to 14 years ago over lunch.” 
Mozart said Ranft was so animated and passionate when detailing Andy’s dad’s life that he believed the Pixar writer had created the storyline, at least in his head, for a good deal of time.
When asked if he was upset by Stanton’s tweet, Mozart said no, adding that Stanton “never said [Ranft’s story for Andy’s dad] was a lie.”
And while Ranft is unfortunately unable to back up Mozart’s claim, one thing is certain: That backstory for Andy is truly heartbreaking.
Watch Carlin’s full video with Mozart below.

A gorilla is riding a unicycle while playing a bagpipe that shoots fire, and he’s far from the most absurd performer on stage at the moment.
Because just a few feet away from the grown man in the gorilla costume is Mike Myers in a game show host costume, performing the character of Tommy Maitland ― the new host of ABC’s “The Gong Show.” This is Myers’ first major acting role since the 2008 movie “The Love Guru.”
“Cheeky monkeys!” is Maitland’s catchphrase, even when there isn’t a gorilla onstage with him. In between introducing the oddball performers competing for a $2,000.17 check and golden gong trophy, Maitland makes penis jokes. So many penis jokes. He occasionally swears and refers to being high. “The Gong Show” isn’t quite the clean Disney fun for the whole network-cable-watching family that could have been expected.  
If you’re confused ... well, that might be the point. Myers as Maitland begins the premiere episode with a thesis statement of sorts: “Turn off your brain. We’re just here for funsies.”
Safety in pure nonsense may be a winning formula in these “dark times” ― a term that is referenced throughout the premiere, as when one judge jokingly remarked that certain performances are an antidote to this era. The Donald Trump presidency isn’t explicitly mentioned, but it inherently causes a show so clearly escapist and nonsensical to make more sense.
“Saturday Night Live” struggled to be funnier than the real news they tried to parody last season. On an inspired wavelength, “The Gong Show” is going for true, 100 percent absurdism. In a way, if you squint, it’s 2017′s Dadaist masterpiece.
Confusion ― total and pure confusion ― is an admirable trait for a show to aim for, especially a network show meant for a large audience.
Mike Myers mysteriously left his lucrative Hollywood career for nearly a decade. He has now returned to host a revival of a gong-based game show while playing a character that looks nothing like him. When HuffPost emailed an ABC representative to inquire whether Myers would be doing any press, the reply kept up the charade.
The response: “The Host is Tommy Maitland, and he’s currently unavailable.”
A less generous take could be that “The Gong Show” has no idea what it wants to be. Zach Galifianakis is a guest judge in the pilot, which seems to be a nod to his satirical talk show, “Between Two Ferns.” But “The Gong Show” isn’t purely a satire of gameshows, it’s just, well ... ZANY!, fully earning those capital letters and exclamation point.
Yet, the insanity is endearing and makes sense in the totality. Everyone involved just went for it, which makes the whole thing hard to look away from. There’s an underlying message to this chaos — ABC IS SO CRAZY! — and maybe in 2017 that’s the kind of programming ethos we need.
In the words of Myers as Maitland while introducing guest judge Ken Jeong, “How many gongs would a Ken Jeong gong if Ken Jeong could gong gongs?” Or in other words, “Turn off your brain. We’re just here for funsies.”
“The Gong Show” airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. on ABC.
Things got real during this weekend’s episode of “Saturday Night Live,” thanks to one “Handmaid’s Tale-”themed sketch. 
In the skit, four women of the Republic of Gilead gather to discuss how they can resist the extremely oppressive regime controlling their lives and bodies. Then, they run into a couple of oblivious men, er, bros (Chris Pine and Mikey Day), whom they apparently used to be friends with.
The men, who clearly care more about their parties than the well-being of their former friends, can’t seem to wrap their heads around why the “girl squad” hasn’t been around as much. 
After the women inform the guys that the government took their money, jobs and children, they just stand there, confused as to why the women don’t just leave their unfortunate situations behind. 
“You guys should, like, fight back,” Day’s character suggests, as if it were no big deal.
In today’s political climate, it’s hard to turn Margaret Atwood’s dystopian fiction into a joke. This sketch presents a classic example of how those who are unaffected by oppressive laws and societal standards don’t always pay as much attention to those who are affected. 

One free item means one.
To celebrate her show’s 14th season, Ellen DeGeneres decided to give audience members some items from “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” gift shop. The instructions were clear and courteous: “Please pick 1 item to commemorate your visit. Only 1 per person please.” 
DeGeneres also set up a hidden camera by the giveaway table to see just how honest her audience was. (Trust, after all, is the most important factor in a relationship.) In a video posted to YouTube last week, we see that most turned out to be “very” honest, but one guest named Nancy had some sticky fingers. 
The host called out Nancy for grabbing too many goods. 
“You’re the kind of person that, when you go trick-or-treating and nobody’s home, you don’t just take one piece of candy, you take the bowl,” she joked, and then made it a teaching moment. 
“Let that be a lesson to you. You think nobody’s watching you, and you just need to be a good person ... You go sit in that Ellen chair right now.”
Pro tip for future guests: Ellen is always watching. 
CORRECTION: This article has been changed to reflect that video of the thievery was shared last week, but the giveaway was staged to celebrate Season 14, which kicked off last year.

It’s hard to believe that Real Housewives of Orange County (RHOC), the oldest in Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise, has been on the air for over a decade. Although Tamra Judge joined the show during its third season in 2007, it feels like she was part of the introductory ensemble which included Vicki Gunvalson, often referred to as “The OG of the OC.” Vicki is still a part of the cast and has been integral to the show’s many and varied story lines from Seasons 1 through 11. Unsurprisingly, she rejoins the cast again in the upcoming Season 12. Back in Season 3, she bonded with then-newcomer Tamra and the two have been through the highest of ups and the lowest of downs. Tamra, like Vicki, has proven she too can maintain a committed relationship with a network and franchise through reality TV’s tests, tricks, twists, trials and tribulations. The show has seen Tamra through a bitter marital demise (she’s now remarried), being screamed at by all her cast mates to the point of having to flee a room, and the turbulent on-again off-again (currently off) dysfunctional relationship with Vicki.
Somehow, Tamra and Vicki always seemed to find their way back to being close friends and partying together despite swearing they would never speak again. Last season however, it seemed that things were truly final, that there was no love left between the two ladies and there would be no reconciliation this time. Vicki had been spreading salacious rumors about Tamra’s husband Eddie, an understandable “last straw” for someone who cherishes her “third time’s a charm” marriage. What made matters worse was that Season 11 newcomer Kelly Dodd, outspoken to the point of verbal diarrhea, was Vicki’s partner in shit-talking crime.
The Housewives were divided as things became contentious. After filming for Season 11 wrapped, rumors began to fly about Kelly’s marriage and an alleged adulterous paramour. The blogs had a field day. Watch What Happens Live had to screen out callers after a few went rogue dropping bombshells live on air. Luckily for Bravo and its leading ladies, the cast would soon stop doing any press interviews because the season was over. The ensuing hiatus would give everyone a chance to catch their breaths. We, the viewers, collectively held ours, unsure of who would return the following season to pick up the pieces, clean up the mess and attempt to (as Dorinda Medley of RHONY says) “make it nice.”
I had the opportunity to speak with Tamra Judge to get a sense of how she feels going in to her tenth season, Season 12 of The Real Housewives of Orange County:
There was a ton of drama at the end of last season with Kelly Dodd and Vicki Gunvalson. However, you all have to hang out together regardless when you start filming. What was it like going into this season when you hadn’t spoken to these ladies in months?
It was scary!
I had this uncomfortable feeling going into it and I didn’t know what to expect. The girls, Vicki and Kelly, had a lot to say about David Beador (cast mate Shannon’s husband) and Eddie (Tamra’s husband). It ended in a really ugly way last season and I was a little bit nervous because I didn’t want to rehash that stuff. Also, even though you’re on a show together with these people, you just don’t want these people in your life.
That brings me to a question that my friend Megan T. has: If you weren’t filming RHOC, would you have anything to do with Vicki?
NO. There’s no need for me to.
Amy C. asks: Are there any particular Housewives that viewers will turn against this season?
You know…I don’t know…I was actually just saying that it’s such a different season this year. The cast was a little bit split almost three quarters of the way through filming .
I don’t know what Kelly and Vicki did most of the time because I was filming much more with Meghan and Shannon. Peggy is the new girl and I didn’t film with her all that much either. This season, there was lots of filming done individually and a focus on family stuff, whereas in the past there was lots of group stuff. I could be wrong but that’s how it felt. You’ll see that I am participating in a documentary about parents who have been unfairly estranged or separated from their kids called Erasing Family. (This is something that Tamra is personally passionate about – she has recently reconnected with her daughter and their relationship is a work in progress. In the first episode, she briefly mentions that she would regularly text her daughter and one day her daughter finally responded. Tamra says this relationship is on the mend with her ex-husband Simon’s cooperation).
Shannon is struggling with her weight and that’s something that lots of people connect to. She’s in her 50s, there are all sorts of hormones and it’s not as easy to lose weight as it is to gain it. Shannon is very open and candid, which makes her the perfect housewife. She really lays it all out there and that takes balls. People will really just want to hug her.
What did you think of Kelly Dodd’s return to the show after last season?
I was a little surprised, however I think she’s good TV. There’s a fine line and Andy Cohen talks about this. When people love to hate you, it still makes for good TV, but when people hate to hate you, it’s uncomfortable to watch. Kelly was really close to that line and I didn’t know if she could redeem herself, but she really does this season. I mean, she’s still Kelly, but you see a softer side of Kelly. She said outrageous things last season and I honestly didn’t know if she was capable of changing but she did. She must have internalized: “I was a bit of a jerk” and reflected. She knew what she had to work on, and she is less abrasive this season. Last season she got in trouble for things that she said, but this season she really controlled her mouth. She is a great example of someone who learned from seeing her mistakes play back on TV and I was impressed by this softer side of Kelly Dodd.
You are friends with both Lydia and Shannon and we see in the trailer that the two of them clash. How was it navigating things between these ladies who are both your friends?
Actually, it was very stressful for me. You see that I try to be a peacemaker and I explain to Lydia that “Shannon is expressive, she’s not yelling at you” and I’m trying to tell Shannon that Lydia’s really sweet which Shannon wasn’t buying. The thing is, Shannon is intense and people take something she says in a way that she really doesn’t mean. You have to get to know Shannon and once you do, it’s easy. Shannon and I are extremely close and we didn’t start out that way when we first met.
In the first episode, there’s a quick scene with you and your granddaughter. How does it feel to be a grandma?
I haven’t gotten to use the word “grandma.” Someone brought me a baseball cap that says “Glamma “and even with that, I just can’t bring myself to wear it. I had Ryan when I was really young and my mom said at the time “I’m too young to be a grandma.” Now I know how she feels! Eddie sure gets a kick out of it and constantly says “Hi Grandma!”
Jim Edmonds, the former professional baseball player and husband to Real Housewife Meghan King Edmonds, has gotten a really rough edit in prior seasons. He has seemed grumpy and not so interested in his wife, but in the first episode of Season 12 we see how amazing he is with their adorable newborn. Having met him in person, what do you think of him?
Jim IS a really nice guy and I think he might be a little uncomfortable in front of the cameras. He’s very loving to Meghan and very supportive.. but he does travel a lot so that’s gotta be stressful. He is a great dad, a really great dad.
Vicki’s new guy Steve seems to have it all together and he’s a former homicide detective!! Have you met him and what are your thoughts on this relationship?
Even though Vicki and I are not the friends we once were, I have met him a couple of times. I don’t know him really well but he seems like a nice guy, also a very handsome one.
Didn’t he do his detective work to find out more about Vicki?
I didn’t say that! (laughs) You did. I was being nice, but seriously he is a good guy. Sometimes you’ll look for things…like ‘hmm what could possibly be wrong with this guy?’ when you’re in this situation and it’s very hurtful that people were talking about Eddie and spreading malicious lies…Steve was a police officer who seems to have it all together. He appears to be a solid guy.
Amanda D. wants to know which Housewives you are closest with outside of the OC franchise.
The ladies that you see me hang out with the most this season are the ones I am also closest with: Shannon is my girl. I had kept in touch with Lydia and you’ll see us together. I’m also close with Meghan.
Why has Vicki’s daughter Briana never become a Housewife? We do see so much of her and what it’s like for her to be a mother now. Are you still close with Briana?
I don’t know why she’s not a Housewife. I actually just got together with Briana’s designer and had a full conversation about her. I like Briana but have had to pull back because I don’t have a relationship with her mother. So, out of respect to Vicki, I don’t initiate conversations or really see her. Of course, if she writes me, I’ll write back but Vicki did say to me at one point that she would not like me to talk to her daughter. I don’t necessarily agree with it, but I try to put myself in her shoes.
Erica R. asks: Are there any surprising new friendships or friendships that fall apart in Season 12?
There are some friendships that get strained, but that will occur towards the end of the season so I’m not going to spoil it for you. You will have to stay tuned. Me and Shannon and Meghan are all good friends and Shannon, Kelly and I have moved forward from where we were last season. As you know, Lydia who was on the show a few seasons ago returned for this season and we always maintained a friendship. It was nice to have Lydia back. It’s definitely a lot different this season. Lydia really has a voice this season and comparatively, she was quiet the last time she was on. Now she really stands up for what she believes in.
Real Housewives of Orange County premieres July 10 at 9/8c on Bravo.
Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso’s 2014 autobiography #Girlboss was a huge success, so much so that “Pitch Perfect” writer Kay Cannon created a Netflix series “loosely” based on Amoruso’s story. But despite the book’s appeal, after the show’s April premiere, TV critics weren’t jazzed about the “unlikable” fictional Sophia (Britt Robertson), and wondered why the character wasn’t given more to work with. 
According to many outlets, including The New York Times and The Guardian, the on-screen Sophia “isn’t particularly interesting” and “a walking selfie, whining about having to work for a living.”
“’Girlboss’ aggressively wants you to like it,” Vulture’s Jen Chaney wrote. “Actually, to be more accurate, this Netflix series aggressively wants you to like its main character, precisely because she’s the kind of rebel who does not care if you like her.”
The show’s supporting star Ellie Reed ― who pretty much steals every scene she’s in as Sophia’s best friend, Annie ― doesn’t understand the criticism, considering it basically implies that a flawed woman can’t entertain as much as, say, a flawed man. 
“I was a little surprised when people reacted as harshly as they did just because, in my experience, there have been so many unlikable male characters on tons of TV shows,” Reed told HuffPost during a Build Series interview. “So, perhaps naively, I never thought it would be such a big deal to watch a woman ― a girl ― come up and make mistakes, and treat people like crap, and do all the things these male characters do ― these adult male characters. I just never thought it would be that big of a deal. I thought, ‘Oh, yeah, I know girls like this. Everybody does. Everybody’s behaved like that at some point.’”
Reed believes the reviews say a little bit more about the culture we live in rather than “Girlboss” itself. Can audiences not handle watching a woman who has “some issues,” as Reed explains it?
“If they can’t handle that then that’s pretty sad,” she asserted, “and it doesn’t leave a lot of room for girls who are trying to do something like Sophia ― trying to make their mark on the world and be really original. It doesn’t feel like they get any room to make mistakes, and I think that’s sad.” 
To see more of what Ellie Reed had to say about “Girlboss,” watch the full Build Series interview below. The show is now streaming on Netflix. 

The last few years have been a strange era for television as Netflix and Amazon Prime invest millions and millions of dollars on new shows to try to establish dominance over your streaming time. Unlike the movie and music industries where only the biggest stars seem to get large payouts, your favorite niche comedians can auteur their own series for multiple seasons in this “golden age.”
Streaming companies often seem to be a patron for the arts, rather than a straightforward cash-grab of combining A-listers with flashy special effects. Or rather, it has made little sense that while the traditional broadcasters only break the bank for lowest-common-denominator-treading sitcoms, the rules don’t apply for Netflix. The streaming service takes on a wide range of projects and rarely cancels its original programming.
But that might be coming to an end.
Netflix, which recently canceled the very expensive “The Get Down” as well as “Sense8,” may have more cancellations on the way if founder and CEO Reed Hastings’ recent comments are true. 
Hastings told CNBC in an interview that he’s trying to steer the company in the direction of axing more projects.
“Our hit ratio is way too high right now,” Hastings said, as Vulture transcribed. “So, we’ve canceled very few shows ... I’m always pushing the content team: We have to take more risk; you have to try more crazy things. Because we should have a higher cancel rate overall.”
Still, it’s unclear from this one interview if pre-existing shows on Netflix are more in trouble than before; maybe it’s just that Netflix won’t approve some truly ridiculous new shows? 
But with the recent cancellations, it does seem as if the company is making a ― to quote one of the most popular shows on the service ― “pivot.”
Hastings continued to talk about Netflix’s decisions in the interview and gave some insight into how they’re made.
“It’s a mix [of viewing and subscriber growth],” said Hastings of cancellations. “Mostly, it is how many people watch. But those are very connected.”
Although Netflix doesn’t release traditional viewership numbers, this quote from Hastings revealed that the metric of sheer popularity is ― at least now ― their “most” important measure for success. This seems to suggest that the more niche projects could be in trouble.
In the interview, Hastings reiterated that Netflix still plans to keep increasing its spending budget for content. The company is investing $6 billion this year and, according to the CEO, will continue to increase the spending by “a lot.”
That didn’t take long. 
A $100 million proposed class-action lawsuit was filed Sunday in California against the organizers of the now infamous Fyre Festival on the grounds of fraud, claiming a “lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees — suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions ― that was closer to ‘The Hunger Games’ or ‘Lord of the Flies’ than Coachella,” ABC News reported.
The lawsuit was filed by concertgoer Daniel Jung and his attorney, Mark Geragos, who says the whole debacle “was nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam from the very beginning” and that they “intended to fleece attendees for hundreds of millions of dollars by inducing them to fly to a remote island without food, shelter or water — and without regard to what might happen to them after that.” 
The festival, organized by entrepreneur Billy McFarland and Ja Rule, was promoted (with the help of supermodels like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid) as a luxury music experience on a “remote and private” island in the Bahamas with the promise of posh accommodations and adventure for a cost between $5,000 and $250,000.
Alas, when attendees arrived, they realized the reality of #DumpsterFyre was a stark contrast from the advertisements.

Hell hath no self-pity like a filmmaker with poor reviews. 
See, for example: Alex Kurtzman, who responded to negative reception of “The Mummy” by saying, “We made a film for audiences, not critics.” Or David Ayer, the “Suicide Squad” maestro who expressed his disregard in a tweet: “Made it for the fans.” And while “Batman v Superman” director Zack Snyder reacted to pans with an even-keeled “it is what it is,” his cast went further. “None of us are making the movies for the critics,” Amy Adams said. “What is really going to matter, I believe, is what the audience says,” Henry Cavill retorted.
Artists spurning those who critique their work is an age-old battle. But with public reactions a mere Google search or Twitter scroll away, this erroneous divide between “fans” and “critics” has become magnified within American movie culture. 
Making a movie ― or any type of commercial art ― can be thankless. You spend years with a project, breathing life into ideas that once existed only on pages and in Hollywood boardrooms. You find the right collaborators, spend laborious months shooting it and supervising its editing, and sometimes just as long enduring the grueling media cycle that accompanies its release. Then the reviews hit, adjudicating whether all that grind was worth it. 
It’s a vulnerable thing, making something for mainstream consumption. To see your name next to a pitiful Rotten Tomatoes score must be heartbreaking. There go years of your life, forever emblazoned with a “nice try” sticker. But bitter directors treating critics ― that is, those paid to comment on culture for credible outlets ― like enemies occupying holier-than-thou ivory towers undercuts their own work. 
The “this is for fans, not critics” reasoning is a fatuous reduction. Critics are fans. More precisely, we are disciples. We want nothing more than to see accomplished films, hear fantastic albums, read articulate books, binge interesting shows. Writing a bad review can be fun in practice, sure, but never do we say, “I take pleasure in this failure.” Especially when films boast hundreds of million of dollars’ worth of resources, we want you to succeed and create something worthwhile, just as much as you want the glory that comes with widespread praise. 
Still, we get it: Harsh reviews sting harshly, and what’s “bad” to one person is heaven to another. More than anything, it is perfectly fine to disagree with the critical consensus ― many bona fide classics (and cult favorites) weren’t appreciated upon debut. What these directors and actors don’t realize is that they’re not actually uplifting the fans. Really, they’re insulting them. They’re saying fans are endlessly forgiving, that they’re not capable of discerning quality, that storytellers can do whatever they want as long as the result is full of spectacle and good intent.
These comments also risk implying that appreciation must be calculated in metrics. Discounting reviews as a marker of success leaves, first and foremost, box office receipts. But “people liked it ― look at how much money it made” would be a brainless conclusion. Hollywood’s current franchise market exists because devotees are expected to show up, no questions asked. That doesn’t guarantee they’ll appreciate what they see. Only skill and merit ― or, at least, an attempt at something inventive ― can invite admiration. And that makes Kurtzman’s sentiments about “The Mummy” especially foolish, given the movie’s piss-poor performance in North America. What do you do when critics are revolted and audiences are disinterested?
Part of this conversation stems from the commercialization of movie reviews, perpetuated by letter grades, star ratings and “two thumbs up” pull-quotes. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel breathed a lot of life into film criticism with their weekly TV show, which debuted in 1975 and ran for more than three decades. But turning criticism into digestible tidbits exchanges thoughtful commentary for Consumer Reports. The see-this-but-skip-that mentality now exists primarily on Rotten Tomatoes, where movies are scored according to “fresh” or “rotten” aggregates. While entertaining and effective, this practice loses the nuance that comes with a finely sculpted review, meant to unpack a piece in terms of broader artistic, technical and sociopolitical contexts. 
Nowadays, Rotten Tomatoes is a marketing tool. “Get Out” and “Wonder Woman,” for example, ran ads touting their near-perfect scores. Filmmakers who can’t claim such a victory are left out of the party, and some place blame anywhere but themselves or the studios that intercepted their work. 
Here’s an especially embarrassing example: Responding to disdain about last month’s “Baywatch” reboot, which has suffered mediocre box office returns, Dwayne Johnson implied that critics aren’t people.
Oh boy, critics had their venom & knives ready 😂. Fans LOVE the movie. Huge positive scores. Big disconnect w/ critics & people. #Baywatch🔥 https://t.co/K0AQPf6F0S
This, in turn, implies that everyday moviegoers who disliked “Baywatch,” or who were’t interested in seeing “Baywatch” in the first place, aren’t people either. You’re only a person if you like the product Johnson created.
A further irony underlies the entire phenomenon. One can assume that Kurtzman or Ayer or Cavill or Johnson will frolic through whatever future adulation they receive from professional critics. Who wouldn’t? But if you lash out at the bad, you don’t get to revel in the good. No one is guaranteed a lifetime of triumph, just as one misfire needn’t define an artist’s entire résumé.
Of course, there’s a lot to be said about the state of arts criticism in general. (This column also assumes the aforementioned artists expected to make something of quality, which may not be the case. In Hollywood, sometimes you just need a paycheck.) It’s not the norm, but reviews can be unfair hit jobs, filtered through the lens of one individual. Most critics probably wish they could go back and tame or reframe some of their more biting world choices, like former Entertainment Weekly writer Owen Gleiberman, who later retracted some of the venom he unleashed upon “Pretty Woman” at the time of its release. And if public figures do a quick scroll through social media or comment boards, they’ll find more vitriol than any human should ever consume. 
Putting one’s guards up, even being ready to defend oneself, is necessary in our contemporary internet climate, especially for passionate artists whose work could be misinterpreted or undervalued. But dismissing negative reception by saying “well, I didn’t make this for you anyway” is misguided. Critics are on your team ― we want you to succeed; in many cases, we’re your biggest fans. It’s why we sought to do this for a living. But we’re also hyper-conscious of the corporatization of Hollywood and the many hands that go into making a movie. Just look at the reports surrounding Tom Cruise’s interference on “The Mummy” or Warner Bros.′ hefty control on “Suicide Squad.” Critics consider all of those factors, and more.
Reviews implicate more than a director’s fragile ego. And if nothing else, filmmakers opted to work in a system that invites scrutiny and exegesis. Don’t court critics’ affection and then rebuff their appraisals. You insult your entire audience when you do.

According to NYPD Officer Tim Broadus, criminals — and drug dealers in particular — keep their business practices “in the family — or at least amongst close friends, lovers and significant others.” After all, one would hope that someone you love would be less likely to screw you over, right? But these special business dynamics are fraught with tension. Nothing like a cocktail of illegal activity, money, violence, and emotional baggage to create a stressful situation. Talk about the perfect storm for drama! That’s why we’ve partnered with Starz’ original series Power―in preparation for the upcoming premiere of season 4―to bring you a special written series about women in drug trafficking. We begin with one of history’s most notable drug lords and follow all of the dramatic twists that brought about the end her reign. 
 
Medellín, the second largest city in Colombia, surrounded by the jagged peaks of the Andes Mountains, gained notoriety in the 1980s and 1990s as the largest cocaine producing city in the world. In the grisly underworld of this city, a young girl by the name of Griselda Blanco came of age in the 1950s. Rumors of pickpocketing, prostitution and kidnapping pervade the story of her youth but, indeed, Blanco grew up to become a notorious drug lord so iconic that she was also known by many nicknames, including La Madrina, the Godmother of Cocaine and the Black Widow. A short woman with a round face and cleft chin, Blanco did not look the part of a ruthless crime boss. But the Black Widow earned all of her titles by forging a life that was riddled with narcotics, bloodshed and sex―a story that begins and ends in Medellín.
The South American hotbed of murder and misdeeds set the stage for Blanco’s bloody rise to power alongside her string of paramours. Medellín was where she joined a gang at age 10 and allegedly shot a child of a wealthy local family being held for ransom, according to Oscar Lopez in his Latin Times story. It’s also where fourteen-year-old Blanco first joined the Medellín Cartel, selling marijuana to survive in the slums next to the airport—not coincidentally full of smugglers.
It was sometime in the 1950s when the teenaged Blanco met a handsome street hustler, José Darío Trujillo, whom she would later marry. “Her first husband was a small-time smuggler and trafficker with a long established chain into New York,” Jennie Erin Smith, author of Cocaine Cowgirl: The Outrageous Life and Mysterious Death of Griselda Blanco, the Godmother of Medellín, told HuffPost.
Trujillo, nicknamed Pestañas or “eyelashes,” was a good-looking car washer well known for his charm and his passport forgery business. Blanco had three sons with Pestañas and Smith speculates that he may have been the love of her life. Smith notes in Cocaine Cowgirl that Blanco never spoke badly about Pestañas publicly. She actually lived with Pestañas’s mother until her arrest fifteen years later and kept his surname for the rest of her life.
Yet rumors of murder swirl around each of Blanco’s lovers—Lopez’s Latin Times story suggests that Blanco may have killed lovers and husbands in cold blood over betrayals and business disputes. Smith, however, says Pestañas died of complications related to hepatitis in 1970. The ambiguity surrounding all three of her husbands’ suspicious deaths―and the many myths that each inspired―spawned Blanco’s most provocative nickname: the Black Widow.

Players In A Dangerous Game
That same year, Blanco joined the big leagues of cocaine trafficking into the U.S. thanks to Pestañas’s friend, Alberto Bravo―a cocaine dealer who converted garment factories into drug labs in Medellín. With Bravo, Blanco birthed a prolific drug ring between New York and Columbia, and he soon became Blanco’s second husband (although Smith claims Blanco later referred to him only as a business partner) a year after her first husband’s death.
Her couriers carried cocaine in suitcases, wigs and lingerie that Blanco had specially designed in a Medellín lingerie shop to hold and conceal the contraband, according to David Ovalle in his Miami Herald story. Ovalle reports that Blanco’s empire at its peak shipped about 3,400 pounds of cocaine per month―worth millions of dollars―via boat and plane between Medellín, Miami and New York.
The couple’s illicit network caught the attention of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency - with agents naming the investigation “Operation Banshee” due to the extraordinary number of female smugglers involved. At the time, it was the largest-ever cocaine-trafficking case, but Blanco escaped indictments in 1975 by fleeing to Medellín.
Back in her hometown, her reputation for violence escalated—as did her influence. She took control of the local airport, Smith writes, bribing police and pilots to monopolize the drug game and forming a gang that would exact her violent demands.
She was known for her nasty temper and, while hosting one of her notoriously debaucherous parties in the mid-‘70s, Blanco allegedly ordered her guards to shoot and kill four men she accused of disloyalty. Ovalle reports that it was during this bloody period when Blanco is credited with devising the first use of motorcycle executions, where one or two riders on motorcycles would drive-by and shower their victim with bullets - a practice that became widely used by drug traffickers. Blanco herself carried a pistol and wielded a reputation for stacking bodies to her advantage.
Another Medellín drug lord who would eclipse Blanco in fame and fortune, narco-terrorist Pablo Escobar, is said to have ordered his men to kill Blanco’s second husband in retaliation for a failed assassination attempt. Bravo was, in fact, killed in a Bogotá shootout, which could have been Escobar― but Richard Luscombe suggests another version of events as reported in The Guardian. Luscombe writes that it was actually Blanco who killed Bravo in a gunfight after suspecting he had been stealing millions of dollars worth of her profits. While Smith argues: “It’s not 100 percent certain that she had Alberto [Bravo] killed. They had a number of enemies by then.” Other myths claim that Bravo had left Blanco to the DEA in New York to save himself and that the Black Widow exacted her revenge.
In the years following Bravo’s death, La Madrina married her third husband, bank robber Darío Sepúlveda, her gunman’s attractive brother. She was likely a few years his senior and Smith describes her love for Sepúlveda as “an infatuation.” She moved to Miami with him under a new name to restart a bigger, deadlier drug ring—an enterprise that would soon bring her tens of millions of dollars per month, Luscombe reports, leaving the bodies of her rivals and debtors in her wake. 
“In the Miami years she was using a ton of cocaine herself,” Smith says. “She had this grandiose personality and her acts of violence, and how flagrant they were, made her feel sort of omnipotent.”
Tales of torture, orgies, wars, shootings and even murders by bayonet and bomb consume this period in Blanco’s life. In 1984, Florida officials attributed more than 40 murders to Blanco, although the real number is rumored to be in the hundreds, according to Luscombe. She was also linked to the 1979 submachine gun attack at a Miami mall, Ovalle reports, but was only convicted of three murders: the deaths of two drug dealers and the two-year-old son of the intended target, a former enforcer for Blanco. Yet adhering to her nickname, the Black Widow’s unofficial death toll is widely assumed to include the murder of her third husband―who ended up on her hit list when he kidnapped their son and left her in Miami.

Yet Blanco’s penchant for avoiding the law soon ended when she moved to California. Her sons had expanded the drug game to Orange County, and it was there that police arrested her. But even jail time could not stop the La Madrina and reports from prison whisper of more lovers and failed assassination attempts. “She liked to be a big fish in a little pond and the most glamorous person in the room,” Smith says.
After her sentence, Blanco was deported in 2004 back to Medellín where she would spend the last eight years of her life. By this point, the Black Widow had sworn off men and was living with a woman in a comfortable house in her hometown. Her habitual drug use combined with aging and the death of her sons took a toll, causing her rapid decline into bouts of hypochondria and obsessive vanity.
On September 3, 2012, authorities in Medellín reported that a mysterious assassin on a motorcycle shot 69-year-old Blanco once in the forehead and once in the shoulder while she walked out of a butcher shop. The method of her demise seems to be the last tragic irony: ending the legacy of the Cocaine Godmother of Medellín in the backdrop of the very town that had made her legendary, by her own invention.

Jennifer Lopez clapped back at the haters who accused her of Photoshopping one of her most recent Instagram photos. 
On Thursday, the performer shared the photo below: 
A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Jun 22, 2017 at 10:01am PDT
If you weren’t distracted by how amazing J.Lo looks, you may have noticed what appears to be a smudge just under her sweatshirt on the right. Plenty of people in the comments claimed the mark was a result of an unsuccessful attempt at altering the pic, but Lopez wasn’t having any of it. 
The “Shades of Blue” star replied to the comments and then shared a screenshot of her response in her Instagram story. 
“Omg…Just a smudge on the mirror…lol…not photoshop. #lordblessthehaters #gymrat #youshouldtryit #wishtherewasphotoshopforhaters,” the 47-year-old star wrote.  
Is it really so hard to believe that Jenny from the Block, a celebrity who no doubt has a trainer, a chef and a very specific diet, looks so good? No. It’s not. 

In honor of Mother’s Day, Melissa McCarthy paid tribute to moms during her monologue on “Saturday Night Live” last night. 
After giving a little shout out to her daughters and her own mother, the actress told all the moms in the crowd to stand up. 
“Let’s give these ladies a hand!” she said, before joking, “Every single one of these ladies who stood up have not been to the bathroom alone since they gave birth, they haven’t had a hot meal in years, all of our purses are filled with old cracker crumbs and dirty Purell bottles, and that’s OK.” 
Then, the actress pulled one lucky mom from the crowd ― who, it turns out, is mother to the show’s co-head writer Sarah Schneider ― for a special backstage tour. Chris Kelly, the show’s other co-head writer shared a photo of McCarthy and Schneider’s mom, Joan, on Instagram, writing “she had no idea this was going to happen” in his caption. 
LOOK AT THIS!! It's @sarahdschneider's mom in the monologue! And she had no idea this was going to happen. ❤️❤️❤️

During Joan Schneider’s special tour of Studio 8H, she and McCarthy picked up some props (ketchup and foot cream) and pet the hallway llama (an “SNL” legend, apparently) before they were met by Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.
“Oh my god! Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively! What are you guys doing here?” McCarthy asked, to which Reynolds deadpanned, “You invited us.” 
“Are you going to get us seats?” said Lively, as McCarthy tried to cover up the fact she didn’t remember telling them to stop by.
McCarthy nodded along, telling “The Livelys” their backstage spot was the best, before admitting to Joan Schneider she “may have been drinking when she invited them.” 
The “Spy” actress and Joan Schneider then each took a shot before McCarthy sent Joan onto the stage to “host” the show. It was all pretty adorable.

The Duggar sisters’ breach-of-privacy suit has taken an even stranger turn now that Josh Duggar ― who admitted to molesting some of his sisters as a teen ― is seeking to join those same siblings in legal action over his molestation scandal. 
Last month, Jill, Jessa, Jinger and Joy Duggar filed a federal lawsuit seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against In Touch magazine and Arkansas law enforcement over police documents released to the tabloid through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015. 
On Friday, Josh filed a motion asking to join the case, claiming that he has “suffered severe emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation and economic harm both to his personal and professional reputations” as result of In Touch’s bombshell report that alleged he molested underage girls.
In their original lawsuit, the four Duggar sisters claim they were “revictimized” by the release of the documents that contained “cosmetic redactions,” which allowed them to be identified as their brother’s victims.
Their lawsuit hinges on the assertion that, according to Arkansas law, information collected involving minors is not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The sisters claim that when they spoke to investigators as minors in 2006, they were told their statements would not be made public. Josh makes the same claims in his motion to intervene and cites the same law, however, he was actually 18 at the time he spoke to investigators. 
The City of Springdale, which the sisters are also suing, previously dismissed the allegations in the lawsuit as “without merit” and “false” in a statement to the press. In Touch has yet to respond to the lawsuit, but it’s important to recognize that Josh’s name was, in fact, redacted from the police report. In Touch even noted in the story: 
“(Note: Josh’s name is redacted from the police report but In Touch has confirmed the passages that refer to him.)” 
Similarly, the police report appears to comply with state law by redacting the names of Josh’s victims. In Touch did not identify the victims by name in its reports, and it was Jessa and Jill who identified themselves as two of Josh’s five underage victims when they participated in an interview with Megyn Kelly on “The Kelly File.” With the filing of their lawsuit, Jinger and Joy confirmed they were victims, as well. The identity of the fifth victim remains unknown. 
The sisters claim that by not redacting their parents’ names, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, In Touch clearly identified the sisters as victims. However, the Duggar parents’ names did not need to be redacted as they were not minors. 
In his motion to join the suit, Josh also states that while his sisters have been “forced to confront traumatic experiences” and had the “most private and painful aspects of their lived [sic] exposed,” they received “sympathy worldwide.”
But, Josh goes on to say that there’s just no sympathy for him ― whose youngest victim was just 5 years old:
Not so with Movant, however, for which the confidential, highly sensitive, intensely personal and humiliating nature of the information contained in the released reports has subjected him to exposure only in an intensely negative light for actions he engaged in as an indiscrete youth and that will continue to haunt him and cause him financial and emotional injury for the rest of his life.
The fall out from In Touch’s May 2015 report was swift. Josh admitted to molesting underage girls ― who were later confirmed to be his sisters. He subsequently resigned from his job as executive director of Tony Perkins’ conservative and anti-gay group, Family Research Council Action, and TLC canceled “19 Kids and Counting.” (Josh was back in the headlines over a cheating scandal involving an Ashley Madison account and claims of sex addiction later on.) 
The idea that an admitted child molester could complain about lack of sympathy is inherently ridiculous and a closer look at Josh’s motion reveals his claims to be completely contradictory.
In one breath, without actually mentioning the assaults, he refers to his abuse of his sisters as “traumatic experiences” and the “most private and painful aspects” of their lives. He then turns around and attempts to brush off repeated acts of sexual abuse as “actions he engaged in as an indiscrete [sic] youth.” In fact, the words “molestation” and “sexual assault” do not appear in Josh’s motion at all. There is not even a hint of personal responsibility for his actions in the entire motion. 
Meanwhile, his sisters Jessa and Jill previously said they had “forgiven” Josh, but the language in their lawsuit says otherwise. In the suit, the sisters state they were “sexually assaulted on several occasions by [their] brother, Josh Duggar.” The words “sexual abuse” and “sexual assault” and “molestation” are free flowing throughout the suit. It’s a far cry from how they previously characterized the incidents as “mild, inappropriate touching” when they were interviewed by Kelly. 
Via the police report: [Jim Bob Duggar] said that [Josh] had told him that [he] had been touching [redacted] on the breast and vaginal areas while [they] were sleeping.” Later in the report [Jim Bob] said there was another incident in March 2003. [Jim Bob] said that [Josh] was reading to [redacted] and [she] was sitting on [his] lap, [Josh] had touched [redacted’s] breasts and vaginal area...sometime during this timeframe [Josh] had been standing in the laundry room and [Josh] had put [his] hand under [redacted’s] dress.”
Josh is not represented by the same attorneys as his four sisters and it is unclear how they feel about him seeking to join the suit. A rep for the law firm representing the Duggar sisters told HuffPost the family is not releasing a statement on Josh’s motion at this time. 
This post has been updated to include Josh Duggar’s age at the time he spoke to investigators in 2006. It was also updated to include a response from the law firm representing the Duggar sisters.

Kirsten Dunst has only been on Instagram for about a year, but she already knows how to werk it like a pro.
But what truly makes her Instagram account all that and a bag of chips are the fab throwback photos she posts of herself from the 1990s.
Dunst, who has been in the public eye since she co-starred in the 1994 film “Interview with the Vampire” at the age of 12, was also in other notable ’90s movies such as “Little Women” in 1994, “Jumanji” in 1995 and 1999’s “The Virgin Suicides,” “Drop Dead Gorgeous” and “Dick.”
She’s got some photographic nods from many of those films on her page. We have to tell you: It’s the bomb.

Comedian Jim Gaffigan has revealed that his wife and collaborator Jeannie recently underwent surgery to have a “life-threatening” brain tumor removed.
Gaffigan made the announcement Monday over Facebook, writing that his wife was recovering at home.
The Gaffigans have been married since 2003 and have five children. The two created “The Jim Gaffigan Show” on TV Land, and Jeannie has also served as a co-writer and producer on her husband’s comedy specials.
Jeannie chimed in on her recovery with an Instagram post.
I'm coming back!  Thanks for your prayers.  I'm alive!

The Season 7 debut of “Game of Thrones” is still weeks away, but fans have something to look forward to: the longest episode ever. 
The upcoming season of the hit HBO series will feature multiple episodes over 60 minutes, including a series record-breaker. 
That episode is “coming in around 90 minutes,” showrunner David Benioff told Entertainment Weekly in an interview published Thursday. The season also includes the series’ shortest episode, which clocks in at 50 minutes, according to Benioff.
Previously, Season 6’s finale, “The Winds of Winter,” stood as the series’ the longest episode at 69 minutes. 
Fan blog Watchers on the Wall shared a list of Season 7 episode run times Thursday. While there are only seven installments, they total about 7 hours and 20 minutes of viewing time. 
As for what’s to come, viewers have a Stark reunion to look forward to, Cersei’s possible demise and lots of people on fire. Season 8 will be the show’s final season ― and Jon Snow actor Kit Harington is not ready to leave behind his sword. 
“It’s a huge thing and it’s been very close to my heart,” Harington told the Belfast Telegraph. “I’ll miss the family and coming back here, and even this costume and the fight scenes. The costumes and weaponry are incredible. I said from the start that I wanted the Long Claw sword but as the (show’s) momentum’s grown, it’s become very expensive and will probably end up in a HBO museum. Hopefully they’ll make me a replica.”

Sofia Coppola movies can be measured in flashy soundtrack choices. Since her 1999 debut, “The Virgin Suicides,” and through the anachronistic anthems of “Marie Antoinette” and the hip-hop excess of “The Bling Ring,” Coppola has become known for the evocative songs accentuating her characters’ sun-kissed reveries. 
Music has always been integral to Coppola’s life. She grew up worshiping Elvis Costello, The Clash, New Order and Generation X ― and later directed music videos for their heirs (The Flaming Lips, Kevin Shields, The White Stripes, Phoenix). As a teenager, she thought Madonna’s style was the essence of cool ― and later starred in the “Deeper in Deeper” video. (“She’s smart and funny, as you would imagine,” Coppola said of Madonna.) Coppola’s commercials, including a Dior ad starring Natalie Portman that’s scored by a remixed “La Vie en Rose,” are as much fashion advertisements as they are melodic escapades. 
Coppola’s affinity for stirring soundtracks is partly what makes her latest movie, “The Beguiled,” so jarring: It’s the first time she hasn’t incorporated any pop numbers. Her husband’s band, Phoenix, provided ambient notes that emphasize the Southern Gothic tone here and there, but most of the score comes from chirping crickets and distant cannon booms surrounding the central Civil War-era plantation. 
Ahead of the release of “The Beguiled,” I sat down with Coppola in New York to discuss her career. During our final few minutes together, I asked the director to reflect on a handful of musical highlights from her catalog.
“The Beguiled” is now open in limited release. It expands nationwide June 30.
Blockbusters, once associated only with the dog days of summer, are now year-round events. But as long as studios keep packing the hottest months with one big-budget spectacle after the next, we’ll offer some recommendations on which ones look the most promising. (Sorry, “Transformers.”) 
In between all that computer-generated action, you’ll also find indie charmers, thoughtful documentaries and a few intimate genre pieces likely to generate buzz. (Enough with you, “Transformers.”)
Here are 23 options fulfilling all sides of the moviegoing spectrum. (Bye, “Transformers.”)

The typical pop star reinvention cycle is something we’ve seen many times before. Madonna’s done it, Lady Gaga’s done it, Britney Spears has done it — the list goes on. It’s a pattern that’s existed for years: A performer, often a woman, sheds the persona that launched her career in favor of something totally different. Usually it’s a little sexier, more mature, maybe even raunchier. 
Male pop stars go through these reinventions, too, but when their female counterparts do it, it seems the whole world is standing by, ready to criticize their every performance or clothing choice or paparazzi photo.
It’s no secret society loves tearing women down. As Sady Doyle, author of Trainwreck, said in a 2016 interview with Heleo, “I think that as long as women have been in public, there have been people very invested in policing the way they’re allowed to engage with the world.” 
In the case of pop music, that’s no different. Let’s look at Miley Cyrus. The former “Hannah Montana” star is going through a reinvention of her own right now, but instead of shedding the good-girl image she was known for at the beginning of her career for something more risqué ― she’s been there, done that ― she’s moving in the other direction. 
The woman who once danced on Robin Thicke while violating a foam finger, gloated about smoking weed and swung naked on a wrecking ball, is once again embodying a wholesome persona. Cyrus, much like her hair, has seemingly grown out of the wild child phase. She’s gone back to her roots, literally and figuratively, and the only remnants of her short-lived past are her bleached-out ends. You might even say she’s attempting to come full circle. However, much like the first time Cyrus tried her hand at a reinvention, she’s not having an easy go at it. We, as part of a society interested in the rise and fall of our public figures, aren’t letting her live down her past shortcomings. 
Cyrus is a highly public figure, and has been since she was just a preteen cog in the Disney star machine. From the get-go, the now-24-year-old was positioned to be a role model for young girls ― whether or not she actually wanted that role didn’t seem to matter ― and any time she strayed from her squeaky clean mold, people made sure to point it out.
There was the Vanity Fair photo shoot she did with Annie Leibovitz at age 15, in which she posed topless, save for a large, billowing sheet covering her chest. Cyrus stood by the image at first, but after the public outcry, said she was embarrassed by it. Then there was her performance at the Teen Choice Awards in 2008, during which she rode an ice cream cart and held a pole for balance. That sparked controversy too, and she was called out for pole dancing. It didn’t matter that what she did barely constituted as pole dancing. She was 15, and the simple act of holding a pole was enough to cause outrage. 
Fast forward a few years to the “Bangerz” era. There was her now-infamous MTV VMAs performance with Robin Thicke, during which she wagged her tongue around and grinded on him, all while dressed in a flesh-toned latex two-piece, because it was the closest to naked she could be ― and she really loved being naked. The backlash came in hard and fast.
Plenty of the response had to do with Cyrus’ clear-cut cultural appropriation, which shouldn’t be ignored. Some critics called her past VMAs act a “minstrel show,” pointing out how she reduced her black backup dancers to “exaggerated sex objects.”
Others, however, took issue with her in-your-face sexuality. One mother wrote an open letter slamming Cyrus, calling her “a desperate girl screaming for attention: Notice me. Tell me I’m pretty. See how hot I am. I know all the guys want me. All the girls want to be me.” Other folks online called the performer “trashy” or “wild and just out of control.” “Morning Joe” anchor Mika Brzezinski concluded Cyrus must be “deeply troubled, deeply disturbed” and suffering from “confidence issues.” There was even a meme floating around in which Billy Ray Cyrus’ face was superimposed into a photo from the performance, as though he were pensively watching over his daughter. 
In the months following that performance, Cyrus did anything and everything to make us forget about her PG past. (And you can bet she didn’t apologize for her “raunchy sex show.”) Given the scrutiny she’d endured in her Disney era, you could look at Cyrus’ X-rated transformation as an attempt at taking some control over her image, holding up a huge middle finger to the people who’d watched her rise and falter before. Cyrus could be seen as what Doyle calls a “trainwreck,” that is, “a woman who has her narrative stolen.” In Doyle’s words, this woman “becomes a public spectacle and a sort of culture villain, either for being sexually too much or emotionally too much, often both.” 
The more Cyrus performed her new sexualized persona (see: the videos for “Wrecking Ball” and “Adore You” and her eventual penchant for wearing strap-on dildos in concert), the more members of the public ― fans and critics alike ― were able to contort the way they viewed her. It was a game of pop cultural tug of war. 
 Cyrus didn’t let that stop her from pushing the boundaries. By the time she released her psychedelic, acid trip of a record “Miley Cyrus and her Dead Petz,” there was nothing she could do to shock us.
“There’s now nothing [she] has to hide from us. There’s nothing more we can take from her,” Doyle told Heleo of Cyrus. “We can’t steal images of her naked body, because she’s giving them away. That’s what I see her doing, leaning into the trainwreck so as not to be swallowed alive by it.”
Now, as Cyrus tries to shed her “Bangerz” persona for something a little more toned-down and less about the spectacle, we have, once again, continued to find fault with her latest reinvention.
Some criticisms against Cyrus and her old persona, like those taking issue with her exploitation of black culture and how easily she discarded it for her benefit, are certainly valid. In a May 2017 Billboard interview, the once-again wholesome Cyrus addressed the cultural appropriation (but denied her guilt), adding that she can longer listen to most rap music: “It was too much ‘Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock’ ― I am so not that.”
HuffPost’s own Zeba Blay summed it up in response, “How convenient it is for her to call out hip-hop’s misogyny (a reality that black feminist hip-hop fans have to grapple with in a real way) after she exploited black female bodies in her own music videos and stage performances.”
But other criticisms ― primarily those lobbed at her sexed-up persona ― are harder to digest. In that same Billboard interview, Cyrus offered a brief explanation of her much criticized, overly sexual past. “All the ­nipple pastie shit, that’s what I did because I felt it was part of my political movement, and that got me to where I am now,” she said. But did she need to?
In terms of the way Cyrus chooses to present herself ― sexual, wholesome or otherwise ― where should critics draw the line? We get mad at her for being too sexual, too vulgar, but when she goes on to embody the subtler norms our society promotes, we also find it “creepy,” as Amanda Petrusich wrote in The New Yorker, “inauthentic” as Anne Donahue wrote in an article published by Flare, or as Lucy Watson at Junkee wrote, “boring as hell.”  
This love-hate narrative is nothing new. One minute we love Taylor Swift for promoting girl power, the next we’re calling her fake, accusing her of using feminism as a marketing tool. Same goes for Selena Gomez ― we praise her when she brings awareness to mental health, and when she poses with a “fall risk” bracelet on, straight from the hospital where she was being treated for lupus, we accuse her of sending the wrong message to her fans. 
It’s hard not to think that if Cyrus, or any of her fellow female pop artists, were a male pop star ― say, Justin Bieber, for example ― the reactions to her reinventions wouldn’t have been so harsh. 
Like Cyrus, Bieber began his career with a pretty wholesome image, but somehow managed to skip the role-model requirement that seems compulsory for young female pop stars. The singer has had his fair share of public mishaps over the years — peeing in a bucket at a restaurant, getting arrested for driving under the influence — but instead of being raked over the coals for his indiscretions, Bieber seemed to emerge from each one unscathed. Take his recent, shoddy rendition of the Spanish lyrics of “Despacito,” which led even one of the song’s original writers to defend him on NBC News.
Did he get a free pass? (Well, not everyone let him off that easy.)
Bieber’s narrative has become one of redemption, about finding purpose (that’s even the name of his latest album), and we ― this writer admittedly included ― are eating it up. We want Bieber to succeed. We don’t care about all the stupid things he does (especially when he’s pumping out jams like “Sorry” and “What Do You Mean?”) because we expect him to continue making dumb mistakes. We don’t afford someone like Cyrus that same allowance to fail. 
Alternatively, there’s Justin Timberlake, whose career arc embodies aspects of both Cyrus’ and Bieber’s, but has been relatively tame as far as controversies go. 
Like both Cyrus and Bieber, he embodied a family-friendly persona for much of his early career. Since he was part of the Disney machine, it’s fair to assume he was expected to keep his clean image intact. It wasn’t until Timberlake’s messy public split from Britney Spears that he really began his transformation from teen heartthrob to bona fide sex symbol.
Timberlake adopted a smooth R&B sound, and worked with producers like Pharrell Williams (much like Cyrus) and Timbaland. As Cosmopolitan pointed out, the singer has gotten away with cultural appropriation for years, and only now are people taking note. (Remember that tone-deaf tweet about Jesse Williams’ BET Awards acceptance speech?) He’s sold millions of records and won Grammys.
One reason that could explain the ease with which both Bieber and Timberlake have continued to rise is the simple idea that, as Constance Grady wrote at Vox, our culture has a “general willingness to grant good-looking young white boys more leniency than we grant to young women (or most other people).” Of course they’re both flawed-yet-talented people, but so is Cyrus. 
For the former tween star, a true “redemption” in the eyes of the media may not be possible. Not only does she now have to prove herself as a serious artist, she has to reconcile her past with her present and do so in a way that seems honest and authentic. Transcending her “Bangerz” era, especially without acknowledging the mistakes she made along the way, was never going to be easy. Things like her Happy Hippie Foundation and her recent performance at the One Love Manchester show might prove beneficial in appeasing opponents, but at this point, it’s not clear whether she’ll be able to truly move on ― she herself has noted she’ll probably never be able to live down her “Wrecking Ball” music video. 
And maybe we’re the ones to blame. After all, we’re the ones who perpetuate this cycle of love and hate.

Gregg Allman, one of the two brothers from legendary rock band the Allman Brothers Band, has died. He was 69.
He “passed away peacefully at his home in Savannah, Georgia,” according to a statement on Allman’s official website. “Gregg struggled with many health issues over the past several years. During that time, Gregg considered being on the road playing music with his brothers and solo band for his beloved fans, essential medicine for his soul. Playing music lifted him up and kept him going during the toughest of times.”
Allman was born on Dec. 8, 1947, in Nashville. He, along with his brother Duane, helped to create one of the most successful classic rock bands of all time. With that came not just music, but drugs, women and ― at times ― tragedy, including the early death of Duane.
In his later years, Allman developed hepatitis C, and suffered from an irregular heartbeat and a respiratory infection and had to have a liver transplant. In 2017, he canceled a planned summer tour, sparking worries about his health. 
Allman was born to Willis Allman, a WWII veteran who stormed Normandy Beach, came back to his bride after the war, and had two sons. His father’s life was cut short when Gregg was just 2 years old. After Willis Allman offered a stranger a ride home from a bar one night, the man fatally shot him in the back.
Neither Gregg nor Duane showed any interest in emulating their father’s military career. The boys hated the military school their mother sent them to, but found their footing in music while there, according to Rolling Stone.
“I learned to play mostly from black people,” Allman told The Guardian in 2015. “We used to listen to a station that called itself ‘The black spot on your dial.’ It played Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, and it hit Duane and me like spaghetti hitting a wall.”
By the time the Allman Brothers Band was formed in 1969, Gregg and Duane were legitimate country hippies ― long-haired, drug-smoking free-loving spirits. Duane played guitar, with Gregg on vocals. Other founding members of the band included drummers “Butch” Trucks and Jai “Jaimoe” Johnny Johnson, along with “Dickey” Betts on guitar and Berry Oakley on bass.
The Allman Brothers Band blended country, jazz, blues and Southern rock in such seamless riffs, pounding drums and twangy vocals that it earned them a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and a Lifetime Achievement award at the Grammys in 2012. The movie “Almost Famous” was also, in part, inspired by the band.
The Allman Brothers Band produced their biggest hits in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, including “Ramblin’ Man,” “Midnight Rider” and “Whipping Post.” During this time, the band experimented heavily with drugs and attracted many groupies on tour.
“Gregg was just a pretty boy,” drummer Butch Trucks told Rolling Stone in 1999. “He had blond hair, and the girls were hanging all over him.”
In his book My Cross To Bear, Gregg bragged about his sexual exploits.
“I would have women in four or five different rooms,” Allman wrote about staying in hotels while on tour. “Mind you, I wouldn’t lie to anybody; I’d just say, ‘I’ll be right back.’”
During those earlier years, he and his bandmates were also experimenting with drugs, including (but not limited to) PCP, cocaine and speed. The band loved psychedelic mushrooms so much, they made them their unofficial logo and tattooed a mushroom on each of their calves, according to Rolling Stone.
In 1971, just as the band found itself being propelled into stardom, Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident. He was  24.
“Duane was the king of laughter, always making jokes,” Gregg Allman told The Guardian in 2015. “You’ve got to keep laughing. It was what Duane would have done, and wanted us to do.”
At Duane’s funeral, Gregg played songs on his older brother’s antique guitar.
“This is a very old guitar, a very beautiful piece,” he said to a crowd of 300. “It was made in 1920 and I’m very proud to have it. And I’m very proud that you all came.”
In 1975, Allman married singer Cher in Las Vegas. The marriage lasted nine days, ending after Allman allegedly pulled a knife on her while trying to score heroin. They reconciled after learning Cher was pregnant with their son, Elijah Blue.
In 1977, Cher divorced Allman for good. The final straw was reportedly at an awards show, when Allman passed out face-first in a plate of spaghetti.
“Every now and then,” Allman wrote in his 2012 memoir, “I’ll think of all the hell I caused other people over the years.” 
Allman eventually embraced sobriety. 
“I’m doing great,” Allman told the Savannah Morning News in 2013. “I’ve been clean and sober for 19 years.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story gave the wrong year of Allman’s birth. Language has also been changed regarding Allman’s role in “Ramblin’ Man.”

On Saturday, Jessica Chastain tied the knot with fashion executive (and down-low member of Italian royalty) Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo in a private ceremony at the groom’s family estate in northern Italy. The bride wore white; attendees included fellow actors Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Edgar Ramirez.
That’s about all the Oscar nominee wanted the public to know. But during the wedding, paparazzi photos were taken from helicopters without the actress’ consent, making the internet rounds and turning an intimate moment into gossip fodder. 
In response to this invasion of privacy, the “Zero Dark Thirty” star confirmed her marriage and slammed the paparazzi in a note shared on social media Tuesday night that included a special request to her followers. 
Did you hear? Im off the market 😉Gianluca & I got married! We wanted privacy & aren't selling photos but Ill post something in the future ❤ pic.twitter.com/5VnM9qHaMX
“Did you hear? I’m off the market,” Chastain wrote, alongside a longer statement. “Gianluca & I got married! We wanted privacy & aren’t selling photos but I’ll post something in the future.”
She continued:
Thank you for all the sweet comments about my wedding. I love you and it was a beautiful day. I am going to ask you to please stop sharing the photos. Helicopters disregarded a no-fly zone & took those pics during the ceremony. Every time I see them I’m reminded of the insensitivity of that moment. I promise that I will share pics with you in the future, but I would prefer to share photos that celebrate love, not intrusion. I’m off social media for a few weeks. Much love and happiness to all of you.
Chastain’s stance makes sense given that she’s remained incredibly private about her relationship with Passi de Preposulo up until this point. The two have dated for nearly five years, but the actress has only given snippets of information to media outlets here and there.
Aside from revealing that she’s “very, very happy” with Passi de Preposulo, she told Extra in 2013 that it’s “a wonderful thing when a career does so well and your personal life goes so well.”
So, to make a long story short, stop, drop and scrap that wedding photo collage you already made until official photos are released. If watching half of “Miss Sloane” before falling asleep on a transatlantic flight taught us anything, it is that you do not, under any circumstances, mess with Jessica Chastain. 

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is basically headed on an express train to overexposure city (population: Jennifer Lawrence). So before he winds up in the White House, it’s time to answer the biggest question on everyone’s minds: how did he lose his virginity? 
Actually, that’s something we’ve never needed to know, but during Johnson’s sit down with Elle Magazine, the interviewer super subtly transitioned into a question about his first time after inquiring about his particular scent. 
“Um … I wouldn’t have been so good at it? I mean, where do you go after that,” Johnson said about his first sexual experience. “That’s the A side to the answer. Now the B side to that is — I would not have been in a park. I would have preferred not to have been caught by the cops.”
Johnson and his lady love at the time apparently got down in a park before some friendly law enforcement officials intervened on his girlfriend’s behalf. 
“Yes, my friend. We shouldn’t have been in the park in the first place. All of a sudden, a big spotlight came on us. Bang. You hear the cop roll down the window and say, ‘Ma’am, are you OK? Will you come to the car?’” he recalled. “She gets dressed, comes to the car. They say, ‘Are you being attacked?’ She says, ‘No, that’s my boyfriend.’ It was a complete nightmare. [Laughs] Some stories are beautiful, but mine was not.”
Coincidentally, that’s also a pretty good tagline for “Baywatch.” 
To read the full interview with Johnson, head over to Elle.

William Shakespeare is, unexpectedly, at the center of a bizarre political controversy this week, after a newly staged production of “Julius Caesar” angered conservative media with its conspicuously Trump-like interpretation of the Roman ruler. 
But a little digging by intrepid journalists has laid bare the hypocrisy of such ire: Not only has Delta previously sponsored a version of “Julius Caesar” in which an Obama-esque character suffers the same fate as the current Trumped-up Caesar, but President Donald Trump himself has reportedly donated to the storied company behind the production.
On Monday, a Washington Post reporter discovered that the President’s very first donation from the Trump Foundation fund went toward none other than The Public Theater.
Oskar Eustis’ interpretation of the 1599 play “Julius Caesar,” now running as part of New York’s iconic Shakespeare in the Park festival, stars actor Gregg Henry as Julius Caesar, donning a flaming blonde coif and a dangling red tie to boot. Some people are angry about the depiction because, in the play’s most iconic scene, Caesar’s senators brutally stab him to death. The visceral power of seeing a Trump-like figure on stage, covered in blood, has led incensed critics on the right to ignore the play’s 400 year history as well as its message ― which, for those who slept through 11th grade English, is basically don’t kill your local despotic ruler. 
The play made headlines earlier this week when corporate backers Delta Airlines and Bank of America pulled their sponsorship of the production following a surge of backlash, topped off with a tweet from Donald Trump Jr. Delta released a statement condemning the “graphic” nature of the production, which they said “crossed the line on the standards of good taste.”
Except Delta didn’t seem to have the same hostility toward a 2012 staging of “Julius Caesar” which starred a Caesar with a curious likeness to then President Barack Obama. As reported by The Washington Post, Delta was happy to back the collaboration between the Acting Company and the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Spoiler: It did not feature an alternate ending. Caesar still died. 
Previous stagings of the play have featured other American leaders in the lead role, including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Abraham Lincoln. Somehow, these interpretations received little concern or pushback.

Artists have spoken out against the threat of censorship looming over the “Julius Caesar” conversation, advocating for the importance of free speech and political theater. The Public Theater, meanwhile, issued a statement that suggests it won’t be apologizing for its play anytime soon: “We stand completely behind our production.”
Artistic director Eustis expressed his opinion on Tuesday in an interview with The New York Times. When asked “Is Trump Caesar?” he responded: “Of course not. Julius Caesar is Julius Caesar. What we are doing is what we try and do in every production, which is make the dramatic stakes as real and powerful for contemporary people as we can, in our time and our place.”
Eustis went on to call out the thousands of people who rang corporate sponsors with heated complaints without ever seeing it or even knowing what it was about. “This is not about my play or my production of a play,” he said. “This is really an example of what this kind of demagoguery does.”
And yet, even President Donald Trump himself, at some point, might have supported a show like Eustis’. As Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold tweeted on Monday, Trump’s very first donation from his Trump Foundation fund reportedly went toward none other than The Public Theater in 1987.
As the debate over “Julius Caesar” rages on, confused parties can look to the past for guidance and context. Try, for example, looking back on your old “Julius Caesar” notes from high school, which will no doubt reveal that the play does not in any way advocate for violence, but in fact actively warns against it. Or glance over the history of the play itself, which has featured the stabbing of the previous three U.S. presidents with little fanfare or outrage.
Or, consider the history of Delta’s own support for similar works ― and President Trump’s. 
This piece has been updated to include statements from Eustis made on Tuesday. 
Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet.
“The story of my body is not a story of triumph,” Roxane Gay writes in her new memoir, Hunger, which publishes June 13. “This is not a weight-loss memoir.”
Instead, Gay ― the author of Difficult Women, Bad Feminist and An Untamed State ― explores her relationship to her body before and after the sexual violence that would rattle her youth.
Gay discussed her new book Monday on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah.” 
“As a comedian, I’ve made a lot of fat jokes,” Noah said in his conversation with Gay. So he was intent on listening to what Gay had to say about her experiences rather than continuing to equate fatness with farce.
Gay explained that she often feels uncomfortable on airplanes, at movie theaters and even at her own book signings, where readers and fans have offered her unsolicited weight-loss advice. 
“At the grocery store, people make commentary about what they see in your cart,” Gay said. “You don’t fit in the world, oftentimes. The world is not really interested in creating a space for you to fit.” 
Gay also shared a story from her childhood, when she was gang raped at the age of 12, before she was old enough to understand what happened to her.
“It was so unexpected,” Gay said. “I just thought, ‘I want to be stronger. I want to be bigger.’ ... It was a deliberate choice.” 
Hunger isn’t her first experience with discussing assault and its aftermath. For The Rumpus online literary magazine, she wrote about the careless language of sexual violence and other essays based on her experiences.
In Hunger, she writes, “I ate and ate and ate in the hopes that if I made myself big, my body would be safe.” This feeling courses throughout the book, which is subtitled A Memoir of (My) Body.
On “The Daily Show,” describing her motivations for writing the book, Gay said, “I wanted to tell the story of my body, because when you’re fat in the world, people have assumptions. They assume you’re stupid. ... I think it’s important to show what it’s actually like to live in this world in a fat body.”

In the face of political tumult, an online literary community is thriving.
Writers are signing petitions against the hiring of journalists who deny the existence of global warming; they’re using their platforms to earnestly protest and sarcastically mock our small-handed president.
Two popular authors ― J.K. Rowling and Stephen King ― have been particularly outspoken. Since November, King has been sharing his thoughts on Donald Trump to his 3.28 million followers.
“If Ivanka Trump had grown up in farm country, like some of us, she’d know her father is reaping exactly what he sowed,” the author tweeted yesterday.
His commentary must’ve ruffled feathers because today, to his dismay, he shared that Trump has blocked him on Twitter. “I may have to kill myself,” the author of over 50 novels ― many of them both classics and bestsellers ― added.
But, fellow Trump-decrier and beloved writer J.K. Rowling stepped in, in an act of writerly camaraderie. “I still have access,” she wrote. “I’ll DM them to you.”
I still have access. I'll DM them to you. https://t.co/MhibEYDBTg
Here’s hoping Rowling’s ongoing quest to contextualize Trump’s tweets can continue. 

As critics denounce a Trumped-up version of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” actors, writers and illustrators are pledging their support for one of New York City’s most beloved cultural attractions.
Every summer Shakespeare in the Park arrives in New York City, bringing with it free stagings of the Bard’s best works, sometimes updated to appeal to modern audiences flocking to Central Park to see a play.
This year, that was certainly the case. The Public theater’s update of “Julius Caesar,” Shakespeare’s famous play about the assassination of the titular Roman dictator, features a Trumped-up storyline in which Caesar, golden hair and all, wears a business suit instead of a toga. His wife Calpurnia dresses in silk and high heels, speaking with what’s been described as a “heavy Slavic accent.” An American flag can be seen waving onstage. 
The decision to infuse the story of Caesar with the spirit of today’s political mania ― to base the main character on U.S. President Donald Trump ― was a bold one. (Though hardly unprecedented; for example, a 2012 American Conservative article recounts a version of the play with an Obama-esque Caesar.) Bold because in the production, the leader of Rome is assassinated, stabbed to death by senators who felt his death would be best for their troubled republic. So in director Oskar Eustis’ rendition, a figure that looks an awful lot like Trump dies at the hands of ardent critics every night of the play’s run.
When Fox News and the corporations sponsoring The Public Theater caught wind of the death, they, still digesting the bloody antics of comedian Kathy Griffin, bridled. Delta and Bank of America pulled their support for the play. Appalled citizens made their opinions known on Twitter, threatening to boycott the free program.
While the outrage machine seemed to be throttling forward, a few famous artists, actors and writers took to social media to disrupt the current of negativity and defend Eustis and the staging of “Julius Caesar.” While some did so by simply pointing out the fact that detractors were largely misunderstanding the very essence of the play, others began rallying support for the theater by pledging to see the show and donate to The Public.

Going to the opening of @PublicTheaterNY JULIUS CAESAR tonight to support the arts unlike @Delta and @BankofAmerica . Shame on both of you.
To avoid further censorship in art, you may donate to The Public here: https://t.co/e8ZdGBk18p
I’m going to Shakespeare in the Park tomorrow. Prepared to be simultaneously thrilled and horrified at the tyrant’s bloody demise.
New Yorker cartoonist Tom Toro promised to give those who donated more than $25 to The Public a free print of a themed illustration, which reads, “Just when you’re about to lose your faith in humanity, you see Shakespeare in the Park.” Actress Amber Tamblyn and author Joyce Carol Oates tweeted their intent to see “Julius Caesar” despite Delta’s lack of support. Others, like Nia Vardalos, shared links to The Public’s donation page.
While those strongly opposed to the “Julius Caesar” play have expressed that they don’t want their tax dollars used to fund what they have perceived as an anti-Trump artwork, the National Endowment for the Arts cleared up those concerns quickly: “No taxpayer dollars support Shakespeare in the Park’s production of ‘Julius Caesar,’” it announced in a statement.
And in response to those choosing to boycott The Public, a few individuals have in turn suggested boycotting corporations like Delta, who’ve pulled their support unwisely. 
“Maybe we should be less concerned that Shakespeare in the Park staged Caesar & more that Caesar calls Trump to mind?” author Celeste Ng tweeted. “Just a thought, @delta.”

After they pulled support for the @PublicTheaterNY, I will no longer be using @Delta for my airline needs. #BoycottDelta
Those familiar with Shakespeare’s centuries-old work know the playwright presents Caesar’s death as a disastrous event for Rome. The murder is similarly depicted in The Public’s production as an inarguable mistake on behalf of those American democrats who felt deposing of a tyrant through violence and illegal means was an act of patriotism.
“’Julius Caesar’ is about how fragile democracy is,” Eustis wrote in a statement about the play before it even opened. “The institutions that we have grown up with, that we have inherited from the struggle of many generations of our ancestors, can be swept away in no time at all.”
Shakespeare in the Park to liberal New Yorkers: If your hatred of Trump leads to violence you will destroy the RepublicFox News: AN OUTRAGE
In a more recent statement from The Public Theater, the organization affirmed that it stands “completely behind our production of Julius Caesar. We recognize that our interpretation of the play has provoked heated discussion [...] such discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater; this discourse is the basis of a healthy democracy.”
The theater also reiterated that it in no way condones violence towards anyone. In fact, it makes the exact opposite point: “Those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save.”

Julius Caesar is slated to run at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater until June 18 as part of New York’s Shakespeare in the Park festival. Tickets are free.

Monday, June 12, marks the 50th anniversary of the landmark United States Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia, which quashed anti-miscegenation laws in 16 states around the nation, ushering restrictions against interracial marriage to the wrong side of history. 
The date is now remembered as Loving Day in honor of Richard and Mildred Loving, the couple who defied the state’s ability to dictate the terms of their love based on their skin color. Mildred, who was of African American and Native American descent, and Richard, who was white, wed in 1958 in Washington D.C., because interracial marriage was illegal in their native rural Virginia, as well as 15 other Southern U.S. states.
When the Lovings returned to Virginia, however, local police raided their home one early morning after being tipped off by another resident. They declared the Lovings’ marriage license invalid within the scope of the state, placing the couple under arrest.
The Lovings pled guilty to “cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth,” and were sentenced to one year in prison. A judge later agreed to suspend the sentence if Mildred and Richard left Virginia and did not return for 25 years. 
The couple relocated to Washington, D.C., but they did not end their story there. In 1964, attorneys from the ACLU filed a motion on behalf of the Lovings, requesting the charges and sentences against the Lovings be dropped. The Lovings appealed the local ruling all the way to the Supreme Court, where their sentence was unanimously overturned in 1967.
“Under our Constitution,” Chief Justice Earl Warren said in his decision, “the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.”
Two years before this verdict, in the spring of 1965, Life magazine photojournalist Grey Villet spent time with the Lovings, as well as their family and friends, documenting the lives of a couple whose love had transcended the everyday to become the stuff of legends. 
Villet’s photo essay, titled “The Lovings: An Intimate Portrait,” captures Mildred and Richard when word of their civil rights battle was spreading throughout the country and the fate of their relationship remained unknown. Through black-and-white images, the photographer captures the subtle glances, spurts of laughter and moments of quiet determination that, together, comprise a love story whose power echoes today. 
We commemorate the Lovings’ bravery and tenacity in the face of prejudice and the systems of white supremacy. Villet’s photos help us remember the Lovings not just for what they represented, but who they were. The simple moments of connection, support and companionship that provided the strength to change the world. 
The Lovings: An Intimate Portrait is available on Amazon. 
The Divine Miss M just made personal Tonys history.

The 2017 Tony Awards have finally arrived.
One year after “Hamilton: An American Musical” vied for a record 16 statues at the annual ceremony, the Broadway scene looks a little different. Without a clear Tonys frontrunner, a number of critically-acclaimed musicals and plays competed for recognition, including favorites like the Ben Platt–led musical “Dear Evan Hansen” and the Pulitzer-winning play “Sweat.” (The former prevailed, while the latter lost to “Oslo.”) 
Hosted by your favorite “House of Cards” villain Kevin Spacey, the 71st edition of the awards show featured an impressive roster of celebrities: Mark Hamill introduced the night’s “In Memoriam” segment that paid tribute to his former co-star, Carrie Fisher. Another “Star Wars” alum, 86-year-old James Earl Jones, was honored with a Tony for lifetime achievement. Bette Midler won her first competitive Tony award for her performance in “Hello, Dolly!” (She unfortunately did not perform; co-star David Hyde Pierce took her place.)
Other stars who made appearances included Stephen Colbert, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Tina Fey, Keegan-Michael Key and more. And Broadway fans outside of New York City caught performances from several musicals beyond “Dear Evan Hansen,” like “Come From Away,” “Groundhog Day,” “Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812,” “Falsettos” and “Miss Saigon.”
Taking place a year after the devastating shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, the 2017 ceremony was a joyous occasion filled with emotional speeches. Check out every win of the night below, so you can continue the Tony toasting long after the broadcast on CBS.

The ongoing harassment many women-seeking-men endure on dating apps across the internet is ... exhausting.
The presumptuous pickup lines, the aggressive responses to rejection, the  #NotAllMen evangelism, and, most potent of all, the unsolicited dick pics. Years ago, the penis-photo-we-did-not-ask-for was a horrifying anomaly. Today, the dick pic is everywhere, a sinister reminder of sexual harassment’s gross ubiquity online.
“This behavior is so commonplace we have all just accepted it as the norm,” Whitney Bell explained to HuffPost.
Bell is the woman behind “I Didn’t Ask For This,” an exhibition of over 150 real, unsolicited dick pics received by the artist and other women she knows. Displayed in a gallery furnished to look like your BFF’s apartment, the framed pictures are meant to evoke the feeling women get when a dick pic arrives. You’re sitting on your couch among your throw pillows, floral lamps and vintage suitcases when, all of a sudden, a man’s penis has overtaken your screen. It’s that easy to make a woman feel unsafe in her own home.
“When you put hundreds of dicks and the aggressive comments that accompany them up on display like this, the absurdity of it almost becomes comical,” Bell said. “I was fed up with the harassment and the threats, fed up with feeling unsafe. I was done quietly accepting harassment as my reality.” 
Her show, a version of which was previously on view in Los Angeles, opened in San Francisco on Friday. According to the artist, the exhibition is not intended to shame men, penises, or men with penises. Instead, Bell wants “to expose the normalization of misogyny ― especially online,” to provide a forum where people who are both shocked by or numbed to the practice of sending dick pics can talk about everyday harassment.
Whose dicks are featured in the show? “The river of dicks that line the gallery walls were sent by just that: Total fucking dicks. Unsolicited, unwanted dicks.” Bell, a woman whose life has been lived fairly publicly online, received a fair share herself; the rest came from female friends and members of feminist organizations who needed only open their old Tinder accounts to find a suitable addition to Bell’s show.
Bell is adamant that the collection of pics, accompanied by other work from 30 artists exploring “the female condition,” is not a form of “revenge porn.” When asked how she’d respond to people who think otherwise, she replied: 
Much like the All Lives Matter “activists” who crash Black Lives Matter protests, these people don’t really care about what they claim to. If you were really concerned about All Lives, or about harassment, you wouldn’t only bring it up as a response to a marginalized group’s plea for visibility. Do you really think your time is best spent defending men who use their genitalia to harass and intimidate women online? Do you really think that harassing the harassed for calling out harassment is beneficial to anyone? I implore you to pick a better battle. 
She does acknowledge that the “rules of dick pic sending” function differently in straight and gay communities. While she understands that abuse and harassment exist in queer spaces, her goal was not to lessen the experience of LGBTQ individuals by focusing on straight women, but to “highlight the the overwhelming issue of heterosexual harassment inflicted upon women. Most specifically I wanted to address the societally endorsed behavior of men attempting to exert their control over women through aggressive sexual advances.”
At the end of the day, Bell hopes those visiting her show will “look beyond the hundreds of penises and the threatening comments that line the walls,” and realize that the issue of sexual harassment is much larger than a few (or, in this case, 150) dick pics.
“I urge them to recognize how little respect many men have for women and that it’s high time we stop sweeping aside our daily harassment as routine.” 
See some of the original artworks by women on view at “I Didn’t Ask For This: A Lifetime Of Dick Pics” until June 11 at SOMArts Cultural Center below.
According to Bell, tickets for the Friday show have already sold out, though there will be a few hundred more available at the door, as well. If you’re in the mood to see the pics IRL, Bell suggests trying Saturday. “Go to brunch then come peep some peen.”
A portion of the proceeds from Bell’s show is being donated to We Are #HappyPeriod, which supplies homeless individuals with the menstrual products they need. Bonus: If you bring a box of tampons or pads to donate, you’ll receive a free drink ticket.
Earlier this year, Penguin Random House announced it would take Mark Twain’s ephemera and transform it into a full-fledged children’s story. The resulting chapter book ― The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine ― will be published in September.
The book is based on a 16-page story recorded by Twain in 1879, after he told it aloud to his daughters before bed. In it, a young man is granted the ability to speak to animals ― including his beloved pet chicken ― and his gift helps him on his quest to save a young prince.
The book is co-written by Twain and Philip Stead, who used the classic author’s notes to craft the tale. Erin Stead, a Caldecott-winning artist, is its illustrator. 
The below excerpt is from the first chapter of The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine. 
If we concentrate very carefully now, we will find ourselves in exactly the place we need to be. In fact, we will find ourselves in a land not all that far from here — not all that far, but hard enough to find that you’re likely never to get there. I have tried. This land has a name, but it is much too difficult to pronounce. It would not be dignified to try.
Of course, our land, the United States of America, rolls effortlessly off the tongue and is so easy to find that you’re likely to spend half your life looking for the way out. So already, you see, we’ve described two differences between Here and There.
Another difference to consider: In the hard-to-find-and-difficult-to-pronounce land in which our story takes place, the luckless and hungry remain luckless and hungry for all of their lives. By contrast, in the United States of America, everyone and everything is given a fair and equal chance. It would be rude to believe otherwise!
Here — be it Michigan or Missouri — the luckless and hungry are likely to stub a toe, look down, and discover at their feet a soup bowl full of gold bullion. Eureka! But There, the luckless and hungry are likely to stub a toe, look down, and discover only the dried-up root of a withered, old apple tree.
Which is exactly what Johnny, our hero, has just discovered —
“Eureka!” he exclaimed. He said Eureka!, and not something far worse, because long ago he’d made up his mind never to swear — not even when swearing was the necessity of a situation (as it often is). Johnny’s poor, wretched grandfather swore often enough for the both of them. His cursings hung like a cloud over their unhappy home. Once, when Johnny was very young, a flock of pigeons became lost in this fog and dropped dead from despair, the whole lot of “them belly-up on the roof. That is a fact. And it is, also, the reason that Johnny chose to carry a moral compass, in case he, too, ever became lost and needed to find his way.
Johnny had known no other family. And to say he knew his grandfather would be an optimism at best. And since a great many of the world’s tragedies, big and small, were first thunk up in the minds of optimists, we will do humanity a favor now and stick to the cold facts: 
Johnny’s grandfather was a bad man.
Johnny’s only true companion was a melancholic chicken with a peculiar name. Her name was: Pestilence and Famine. Presumably at some time in the past, there were two chickens — one Pestilence and one Famine. But again, we must stick to the facts. Now there is one chicken, and she goes by two names.
Pestilence and Famine wandered over to peck weakly at Johnny’s battered toe in sympathy.
“Thank you,” said Johnny. “I think it will be alright.” He hopped around on one foot. The chicken did likewise, thinking it the thing to do. Johnny smiled at his old friend.
This is how our chicken got her name —
For as long as Johnny could remember, his grandfather would greet the day by thundering out into the yard, kicking dirt into the air, and calling out to no one in particular, Pestilence and famine! Pestilence and famine! Pestilence and Famine thought this was great fun. She would set down her melancholy for a moment, prance around on skinny legs, and flap her ragged wings in delight. Then Johnny’s grandfather would go inside, lie down on the dirt floor, and nap till well past noon. As he slept, he would coo softly and sing a gentle love song. This was when Johnny loved his grandfather best.
Johnny had never heard two words of kindness from his grandfather. And so it was a great surprise to Johnny when his grandfather stepped out of their broken-down shack and into the yard to ask, “Are you alright? Can you walk?”
Johnny’s heart filled with happiness. “Yes!” he said. “I will be alright, thank you!”
“Good,” replied his grandfather. “Then walk to market and sell that chicken for something worth eating.”

Earlier this year, Evanna Lynch ― the actress who got her start when she was cast at Luna Lovegood in the “Harry Potter” film series ― announced on Instagram that she was ready to take on new endeavors.
“I feel like I’m stuck in my 18-year-old self artistically when I actually have a lot more to say,” the actress wrote on Instagram, addressing her choice to move on from regularly attending “Harry Potter” conventions.
 
Now, just a few months later, she’s starring in a forthcoming play in London, an update on Enda Walsh’s “Disco Pigs,” a story about a pair of teens who speak in their own intimate, expressive language. Lynch says the play is in keeping with the types of roles she hopes to pursue in the future: bold characters and unabashed misfits.
Below, Lynch discusses her recent starring role in the indie film “My Name is Emily,” and why she can’t help but return to Hogwarts stories, which, she says, have a “resetting effect” on her.
First, I’d love to hear about  “Disco Pigs.” How did you get involved with the project?
I wanted to do theater for a while, but I only recently moved to London so I only had that opportunity for a while.
I loved the script; it was so different from anything I’d read before. The language is so strange and idiosyncratic. I find the story very romantic. It’s these two teenagers, and they have their own little world. I always connect to characters who do things their own way, and who don’t really set their standards by other people.
What for you was the biggest difference between stage acting and on-screen acting? 
On-screen it’s nice because you get to film over a long period of time. Stage is different because ― for this play, anyway, it’s only an hour. Whereas on film you mull with it, you know, a month to six weeks, probably six to eight weeks, you’re with the character every single day, obsessed with them, thinking of them.
[In theater] you’re running on adrenaline. There’s a lot of fear. That aspect you don’t have in film, which is nice, it takes the pressure off.
You also had a fairly recent film that was released in the U.S. this year, “My Name is Emily.” This was your first starring role in a film. How was that experience different from your past work?
For one thing it was an independent movie, so there were a lot fewer resources. More responsibility, which I find very exciting. I felt like I was more of a collaborator. And I don’t know if that’s just about the position I was in, or if that’s my age. Because when I started the “Potter” films I was 14, I was more of a child, and on “My Name Is Emily,” that was the first time I was a collaborating artist. That was really exciting.
I just focused on the work. I’m not trying to make friends with everyone. I’ve seen with other films, the central cast member will try to really welcome everyone and I thought about that, but it’s just not me. I’m quite shy, I’m quite introverted, I like to sit and watch people. I feel like that’s how I learn about people, how I study them. So, it wasn’t a whole lot different for me. Yes, there was added pressure, but you have to do everything you can to not think about the pressure. 
By the time you were cast as Luna you were already a fan of the “Potter” books. What did you love most about the books?
I just loved it because it really felt like I understood the people ― the teenagers. I just felt like they were my friends. I loved that it was just like a bunch of misfits, and they were the heroes of the story. And I’d never read a book series before where the characters were so relatable, and inspiring in how relatable they were. I felt what they were doing, and what they were grappling with. The books just had this amazing ability to make me feel not alone. And I think I went through most of primary school and high school just feeling like I hadn’t really met my people, and “Harry Potter” felt like my people. They were the kind of friends I wanted to have.
Of course it was also a more fascinating world than what I was involved in. It just made me believe in things that were different.
I actually read Prisoner of Azkaban around Christmastime. I had a craving for it; I don’t know why. I often do press events and conventions, and I get asked a lot of questions. It was a point of pride that I was like a walking encyclopedia for the books. And I realized my trivia had been slipping the last few years. I was like, oh, this can’t fall away. This is something I need to maintain.
It’s just me being a nerd. The books almost have a resetting effect on me. They bring me back to who I am. And the films are sort of different because it became a career, and it’s so entwined with who I am as a public figure, which I don’t want to think about when I’m reading. The books still remind me of who I am.
Do you have a favorite “Potter” character besides Luna?
I always liked Dumbledore because he’s so wise, and he’s got such a deep mind and thinks so deeply on things, but he’s also able to enjoy the finer things in life. I like that.
And then recently I realized I really like [Gilderoy] Lockhart. I sort of admire that obliviousness he has. He doesn’t seem to be aware of what people think of him, or that not everyone wants his autograph. I think I’m probably too self-conscious. Not in an insecure way, but I have this paranoid thing where I’ll often think people are giving me a weird look or something. My best friend always points it out, he’s like, really, it’s not about you. […] My mind makes up weird stories, and I started to really love Lockhart for how he doesn’t do that. He does the opposite. He assumes everyone loves him. I just think it’s so funny.
I want to ask about your activist work. It seems that you use your platform to promote your causes ― especially veganism. Do you foresee yourself trying for roles that promote your political message?
For me, art can be political, but I don’t think you should force it. I think the best way to make people feel is just story for the sake of story.
I mean, I do often think about maybe working on a book or something like that, told from the animals’ eyes. The stories that really inspired me to be vegan ― well, vegetarian first, and then vegan ― and just to care about animals in the first place, were things like watching “Babe,” or watching “Chicken Run.” That, I think, is a very powerful tool. Other than that I do like to keep activism and art separate. I think if you try too hard for it to be worthy and have a message, it just ― I think it poisons it a little bit. Or, not poisons, but it loses its integrity.
Even books like “Harry Potter,” I don’t feel like it’s trying to force it down our throats that like, fascism is bad, but you pick up those things by osmosis of what the characters feel. Those kinds of stories have a much more powerful effect on me personally.
What would you say you’re looking for most in acting roles going forward?
Bold characters. I always look up to people who are very unapologetic. Whether their morals are in line with mine ― say for example, the character in “Disco Pigs.” She has no moral compass, really. She’s 17, for one thing. But they’re always eating sausages, they don’t give a damn. I didn’t see that as a reason not to admire her, because obviously that’s her blind spot, but what I liked about her was that she was so sure of what she was doing, such a unique person, such an individual. That’s what it is in characters. I just want to find something individual, something about them that makes them an outsider, and that encourages me to be more that way. Because I think if I’m around other people I tend to want to fit in. I think characters in books and in movies that are complete individuals and who are not apologizing for it, they remind me to be myself. That’s why I like the character Luna Lovegood so much. I just want to have more of that energy.
From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories.
After Frank Lloyd Wright died in 1959, an obituary described him as “the great radical of American architecture.”
During his lifetime, Wright condemned the “lust for ugliness” he saw in the sky-scraping landscapes and boxed suburban sprawls of the United States. “Mr. Wright scathingly condemned the topless towers of New York,” the obituary reads. “He had no use for the great steel and stone cities.” He didn’t care for American “box” houses, either, declaring them “more of a coffin for the human spirit than an inspiration.”
Instead, Wright preferred the low, integrated structures of a style dubbed “prairie architecture,” a term the famously arrogant artist would later reject. His organic, functional and mostly modest aesthetic would come to define the concrete office buildings and family homes he’s left scattered across the country. One-hundred and fifty years after Wright’s birth in Wisconsin, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City is paying tribute to this Midwestern brand of radical art by showcasing more than 400 of Wright’s designs. 
According to estimates, Wright produced over 1,171 architectural works during the course of his tumultuous career, of which 511 were built ― an astounding feat for an architect whose life was upended at various points by death, destruction, financial ruin and his own reckless behavior. Today, the man who began his career as a draftsman in Chicago, Illinois, is well associated with homes like Fallingwater and behemoth spaces like New York’s Guggenheim Museum. But MoMA’s scope is bigger, drawing attention to seven decades worth of his architectural drawings, models and building fragments, as well as his furniture, tableware, textiles, paintings, photos and scrapbooks, some never seen before. 
In honor of Wright’s 150th birthday, we’ve put together a digital tour of 20 of his greatest American works, filled with sketches and archival images of some of his most revered designs. If you can’t make it to MoMA’s exhibition, you can celebrate one of America’s greatest architects here.
”Frank Lloyd Wright at 150: Unpacking the Archive” is on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City from June 12 to October 1.
The new “Wonder Woman” movie, starring Gal Gadot and directed by Patty Jenkins, doesn’t just boast an iconic female superhero in all her glory: It’s also pretty easy on the eyes. (And not in the sense that certain critics might use it.)
According to the director of photography, Matt Jensen, the crisp but dimly illuminated palette of the film owes a lot to an unexpected source: American painter John Singer Sargent, who died in 1925. In an interview with Digital Spy, Jensen credited the artist with shaping the visual direction he and Jenkins took for the movie. 
“I think a key thing for us was we wanted rich blacks, beautiful portraiture on the faces, and when we did see color ― because he tended to not use a lot of color ― it was vibrant,” he told DS.
Sargent’s chosen palette of deep, distinct neutrals and vivid accents can be seen in the grays, blacks and olives that make up the world of “Wonder Woman,” offset by her red and gold costume. The above portrait shows the same delicate interplay between gleaming metallics, saturated blacks and muted backdrops as a still of Wonder Woman in action ― and the same elegant drapes of fabric and precise figure posing.
Sargent achieved much of his signature, nuanced aesthetic through an interplay between warm shafts of light and deep shadows. “His lighting style influenced the way that I lit the movie,” Jensen told DS. “I think Patty really responded to the beautiful soft light that he used in his paintings on his subjects.”
Like “Wonder Woman,” which is set amid World War I, Sargent depicted both portraits of elites in their element and grittier images of war and conflict. In his famous painting “Gassed,” he illustrated a gloomy yet sun-warmed scene of WWI soldiers injured by poison gas.
Looks like we have one more thing to thank “Wonder Woman” for ― reminding us all of the gorgeousness Sargent’s work has to offer:

A woman jolts awake, and for a moment she’s disoriented. She gathers up her clothes, and hears a shower running, presumably the morning sounds of a partner she’s not happy to see.
“Let me be severe to myself, but not unjust,” she says, words borrowed from a play called “Double Falsehood,” which is attributed to William Shakespeare by some scholars. “Was it a rape, then?”
It’s the opening scene to a short and potent film produced by Thaddeus Shafer, Kari Lee Cartwright and Charissa J. Adams. Called “Was It Rape, Then?”, the story borrows lines from Shakespeare’s plays to recreate the multitude of dire experiences that can arise from rape culture.
The short film ― adapted from an onstage performance by Charissa J. Adams for a burlesque show called “Cabaret Consensual” ― follows several women as they navigate social situations and private thoughts about non-consensual sex. Over the course of the film, a chorus of women questions the injustices done against them, but go on to turn their pain into personal triumph.
Early lines lament “what men daily do,” but as the film progresses, its heroines find it in them to “fight,” “with hearts more proof than shields.”
“Shakespeare played with context all the time ― double meaning, double thoughts, double lives. When we hear it live, we’re always halfway firmly rooted to the present moment onstage, and halfway floating in an imagined reality,” Shafer told HuffPost in an interview. “Flipping genders is not unusual in Shakespeare [...] It’s an especially powerful device when you can pull women into leading the rousing, militant speeches against a mortal enemy. We wanted to portray the fight of sexual assault survivors as, yes, an internal one, but also an external real battle for survival and autonomy, for truth and dignity.”
A post shared by Charissa J. Adams (@charissajactor) on Jun 5, 2017 at 5:13pm PDT
Shafer went on to explain that the aim of the short film is to explore the nuanced range of experiences that can fall under the descriptor of “rape.”
“We are so locked into our strict definitions in this culture, so much so that it can be very difficult to be expressive with words without painting yourself into a corner. ‘Rape’ is one of those words, and we wanted to find a way to let rape, and the question of rape, permeate without boundaries and without needing to divide our protagonists legalistically,” Shafer said. “They are all a part of one fight.”
Cartwright echoed that idea, and elaborated on it. She hopes that project will make viewers feel “connected, empowered, emboldened and energized.” She also hopes the film will generate empathy for assault survivors, and to look beyond the “harsh line between rape/not rape.”
“This has been happening for millennia, not just in the situations portrayed in our 3.5 minutes,” Cartwright said. “We also stand in solidarity with the countless forms of sexual violence all over the world, crossing all class and cultural boundaries, overt and subtle, whether in schools, or the military or minority communities.”

It should feel like too much to smash together a book about undiagnosable illnesses and New Age alternative remedies with a book about a New Age relationship experiment run by a narcissistic celebrity with a book about the dehumanizing gig economy with a book about growing up under Voluntaryist religious fundamentalism. The genius of Catherine Lacey lies in the fact that her new book, The Answers, doesn’t feel like too much; the pieces are bizarre and timely and fit together like puzzle pieces into a somehow timeless examination of humanity.
Lacey’s heroine has been backed into a corner. Raised by fundamentalist Christians in a rural home, she had no official documents or real contact with the outside culture until she left home as a teenager and moved in with an aunt, who renamed her from “Junia” to “Mary.” Now in New York, she’s drifted out of touch with her family. She has one dear friend, who has left on a mysterious quest of self-fulfillment. She has a job at a travel agency that barely keeps the lights on. And she has a mysterious, debilitating illness with no diagnosis. She sees doctors and specialists as her symptoms shift and worsen, but no one can put a finger on the root cause. Finally, she’s found a treatment that works ― PAKing, an alternative therapy that seems similar to reiki ― but that demands significant out-of-pocket expenditures.
So she decides, like so many young people crushed by debt and lack of opportunity today, to find a side hustle.
In another novel, that side hustle might have been driving for a ride-share or nannying the children of New York’s elite. In Lacey’s universe, nothing is so obvious. Mary responds to a mysterious help-wanted ad, then finds herself auditioning for a lavishly paid gig as, it turns out, the Emotional Girlfriend to movie star Kurt Sky. She’s both a guinea pig in an experiment to better understand the ideal relationship and an emotional laborer hired to keep the self-involved Kurt satisfied romantically. Scientists behind the scenes may be pulling the levers, but he’s providing the funding and reaping the immediate benefits of having carefully cast girlfriends to provide him with emotional support; for sex, for silent companionship, for arguing and for intellectual conversation.
This setup, dazzling and yet sinister as it may be, has little excitement for Mary. Being deprived of intimacy after her one relationship fell apart and her one friend disappeared on her seems to make her less particular about who she gives her time to ― besides, she needs the money. But she doesn’t much enjoy listening to Kurt’s emotional turmoil and responding in the directed fashion. He, on the other hand, finds himself fascinated by her quiet, submissive demeanor and her ability to listen with apparent interest for hours. (Naturally the Intellectual Girlfriend, with her frequently expressed opinions and education, soon wearies him.) He demands more and more of her time; soon, the experiment has transformed from a weird side gig to an all-consuming lifestyle that demands her to alienate herself from her own emotional needs to be what her boss asks. Still desperate to finish her PAK therapy, she clings to the unsettling but well-paying job.
As the novel progresses, we move in and out of Mary’s perspective to hear from Kurt, who muses on his failed past relationships and the movie he’s been trying to perfect in edits for 10 years; his obsessively devoted personal assistant, Matheson, who resents Kurt’s increasing dependence on Mary; and other women who participate in the project, particularly Ashley. A boxer with a burning grudge, she agrees to be Kurt’s Anger Girlfriend, only to find herself drawn back into a youthful trauma that threatens to blow up the whole experiment.
Lacey’s prose radiates elegance beneath its unassuming, unflashy surface; there’s nary a maladroit word or an unrevealing detail. She skillfully balances a truly absurd array of hot-button topics and weird narrative twists, playing them off each other virtuosically to weave a surreal-feeling story with deeply pragmatic concerns: How do we come to know ourselves? How do we become part of our community? What should we sacrifice to give a partner what they need? What should we demand from each other? Can a relationship be satisfying to us without dehumanizing our partner? How do we reconcile our personal fulfillment with the increasingly all-encompassing demands of simply staying alive in this economy? What are the limits of technology and science to provide us with happiness?
The Answers offers no answers, of course. Instead, in its stark portraits of bewildered, alienated people, it lays bare the unresolvable paradoxes of need that we all hold in our hearts.
The Bottom Line:
Lacey searches for the unanswerable human questions that drive us in her novel of lonely, lost New Yorkers grasping for connection in alienated modern society.
What other reviewers think:
NYT: “This is a novel of intellect and amplitude that deepens as it moves forward, until you feel prickling awe at how much mental territory unfolds.”
Kirkus: “With otherworldly precision and subtle wit, Lacey creates a gently surreal dreamscape that’s both intoxicating and profound.”
Who wrote it?
Catherine Lacey has written one previous novel, Nobody Is Ever Missing. She has won a Whiting Award and was selected as one of Granta’s Best Young American Writers.
Who will read it?
Fans of fiction that blends the surreal with realism, such as Murakami.
Opening lines:
“I’d run out of options. That’s how these things usually happen, how a person ends up placing all her last hopes on a stranger, hoping that whatever that stranger might do to her would be the thing she needed done to her.
For so long I had been a person who needed other people to do things to me, and for so long no one had done the right thing to me, but already I’m getting ahead of myself. That’s one of my problems, I’m told, getting ahead of myself, so I’ve been trying to find a way to get behind myself, to be slow and quiet with myself like Ed used to be. But of course I can’t quite make it work, can’t be exactly who Ed was to me.”
Notable passage:
“I looked at his face in the pale dawn, sleeping or just still, and I let myself completely feel the pain of missing a person who no longer exists. Not missing a person who has died, not mourning (I had yet to feel actual grief), but the strain of trying to see the person I’d fallen in love with inside the person he had become. Now I know this just comes with love, that there’s no way to avoid seeing a person gradually erased or warped by time, but the first time I realized this with Paul ― it felt apocryphal.”

The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book.

President Donald Trump’s tweets might be polluting the natural environment that is your mind, but they’re finding greater purpose somewhere: specifically, in a subterranean lavender field in New York City.
Austrian artist Martin Roth, now based in NYC, is the mad gardener behind an idyllic new art exhibition, which happens to be powered in part by Trump’s 140-character declarations. Nestled inside the Austrian Cultural Forum of Midtown Manhattan, it consists of 200 lavender shrubs that are nurtured by grow lights whose power corresponds with the activities of several social media accounts.
That’s right, the strength of the bulbs depends on how frequently accounts like @POTUS, @realDonaldTrump, @PressSec and @KellyannePolls issue a tweet. (Other connected accounts: @foxandfriends, @seanhannity, @tuckercarlson, @breitbartnews, @heritage, @CNN and @washingtonpost.)
Motivated by the “heightened anxiety” many have felt in the wake of Trump’s election, the arrangement is meant to turn the chaos of our present political reality into something capable of assuaging our collective terror.
“The pace and tenor of the current political discourse, blasted out through social media 24/7 without respite, affects our psyche in a profound way,” Martin told Mashable. “I’m interested in Twitter because it seemed to be the only news getting through. It’s fast and used as a political weapon, but ... it seems overall just to be there to distract us.”
Using eight tons of soil, six rows of lavender and a soothing backdrop of nature-adorned wallpaper, Martin has created what appears at first to be place of refuge, a fragrance-filled spot where art lovers can stop to, quite literally, smell the flowers.
However, they can’t do so without wondering just how many tweets are flying through the digital ether at any given moment. If the lavender is thriving, so too are POTUS and co.’s statuses. The effect, Hyperallergic’s Claire Voon notes, is amplified by “the windowless, concrete space,” which she describes as “claustrophobic.” Even when the air smells like perfume, something capable of transcending the underground sanctuary is probably amiss ― you just can’t see it.
“The total effect is less an immersion into the woods, and more a sojourn in a doomsday bunker of the One-Percent,” Kate Sutton wrote in an essay that appears on the Forum’s website. “Any calm this environment induces is innately tinged by suspicion of its circumstances.”
You can visit the not-so-subtle installation until June 21.
With the seemingly relentless barrage of leaks and scandals during President Donald Trump’s relatively short time in office, it might seem a wonder to some how he hasn’t been impeached already.
While it’s a sentiment you might hear thrown around water-cooler conversations or happy hours, the actual process of impeachment is, in so few words, more complicated than you might think. As HuffPost’s Jonathan Cohn explains, impeachment isn’t about punishing an individual for a crime, but rather, is a means of protecting any threats to democracy.
Still, if you want to probe further and brush up on your U.S. governmental knowledge, podcasts have proven to be an excellent resource for covering the basics of relevant political issues and beyond. When the news feels overwhelming or difficult to parse through, political podcasts can serve as a guidepost through the swamp that we keep hearing will be drained one day.
Acast compiled a list of 10 shows that help to explain politics for the layperson, the news junkie, and the individual just trying to get the lowdown on what’s actually happening in Congress.

A pub seemingly operating on pure magic may be coming soon to some tucked-away spot on a London street ― but only if enough muggles pay attention to its founder’s bid for funding.
Self-proclaimed book nerd Matthew Cortland, with help from NASA engineer friend Travis Davis, aims to create an enchanted atmosphere at The Cauldron Wizarding Pub & Inn dotted with floating candles. Pint glasses will fill mysteriously from the bottom. Lights and taps will go on and off with a flick of a wand. Pictures won’t stay still in their frames.
The project almost shares a name with The Leaky Cauldron, the pub on Charing Cross Road that appears to non-wizarding folk as a dusty old shop. Due to licensing issues, it will need to avoid explicitly using the name “Harry Potter” or other direct references to the series. 
The $500,000 fundraiser, however, goes live on Kickstarter beginning June 26, the day Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was published in 1997.
The “inn” portion of The Cauldron Wizarding Pub & Inn will also be contingent on the final amount raised. As it should be, creating a pub is the founder’s Priority No. 1. 
Cortland told HuffPost in an email that he’ll draw inspiration from an array of magical worlds brought to life in novels by J.K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, using smart home technology to make it happen. Magnets, for example, can explain the candles. (We’re still iffy, though, on what explains magnets.) 
He also plans to host a series of hackathon events to “refine” the pub’s technology ― and also to figure out what, exactly, to serve.
A house beer dubbed Cauldron Ale will be sourced from a local brewer, Cortland said, and fans are also free to make other serving suggestions through a wiki page. Butterbeer, unfortunately, is likely off-limits due to licensing.  
As a former teacher, Cortland said he aims to open up The Cauldron to school groups in order to encourage an interest in S.T.E.M. subjects ― and foster an appreciation for literature. In perhaps the best homage to the pub’s source material, the place will also be lined with books, with visitors encouraged to bring a copy of their own favorite childhood story. Cortland has partnered with the Harry Potter Alliance’s “Accio Books” campaign to donate those books to schools.
The New Jersey native, who now lives in Dublin, noted that London is the perfect place for the fantastical project since so many beloved works in the genre pull aesthetically from the city. The pub itself will be modeled after one of his real-life favorites ― John Kavanagh in Dublin, the pub alongside Glasnevin Cemetery known locally as “Gravediggers.”
“It’s been around since 1833 and is a traditional old-man pub with scrubbed wooden floors, sturdy tables, a cozy atmosphere and excellent Guinness,” Cortland wrote, noting that The Cauldron, in London, would also draw from traditional British pubs.
“We just want The Cauldron to be a place of community for the extended fandom, and we will host book signings, book readings, meet-ups, pub trivia nights, fundraisers and movie nights,” he wrote. “Basically we want to be a place of meeting and happiness, and as one of the world’s great cities, London is perfect.”

Elisabeth Moss, the powerhouse star and co-producer of Hulu’s hit adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” has no small list of challenges in portraying Offred, a woman conscripted as a reproductive slave in a dystopian theocracy called Gilead.
Not least: Filming scenes in which her character is routinely, clinically raped by her commander (Joseph Fiennes) in order to conceive a child. In a roundtable discussion for The Hollywood Reporter, Moss opened up about her process and the undeniable horror of her character’s victimization. 
Speaking with five other actresses, including Oprah Winfrey and Nicole Kidman, she elaborated on previous thoughts she’s offered about depicting Offred’s rape on screen. “It was really important for us to have it be extremely clinical, mechanical; there’s nothing remotely sexual about it,” she said.  
Moss also explained how she prepared to portray her character during these harrowing scenes:
I just thought, “What would one do in this situation?” Which sounds so oversimple, perhaps, but I was just like, “If you were being sexually assaulted on a regular basis and you knew there was nothing you could do about it, what would you do?” There’s no escape and you can’t fight back. And so I thought, “Well, she would probably try not to be there — try to go somewhere else.”
The trauma Offred suffered would have been so extreme, Moss suggested during the THR roundtable, that allowing herself to experience it would be impossible. “You can’t experience it,” she said. “You wouldn’t make it. Which happens to women in that world; they don’t make it.”
Shows that frequently depict sexual violence against women, such as “Game of Thrones,” have been critiqued in recent years for mingling the overt brutality with titillating touches and, some argue, glamorizing the crime of rape. By removing any sexualized excitement from Offred’s character and the framing of the scenes, “The Handmaid’s Tale” aims to focus viewers on the inhumanity of the act.
“It was really important to show it exactly for what it should be,” Moss said. “That no one is enjoying this. That all three parties are in a terrible place.”

The Well-Read Black Girl has come a long way in just a couple of years.
Founded by creative strategist Glory Edim, the digital book club started as a way for her to talk about books with her friends. She took the name from a custom T-shirt her boyfriend gave her ― a nod to her bookishness ― and began posting book recommendations on Instagram. Now it’s an online community of more than 20,000, and Edim has begun regularly hosting in-person meetings as well.
Next up: A conference and festival held in Brooklyn, New York, which will be all about celebrating black women authors and creating a space for black women to share their literary passions and experiences. 
The timing and location of the festival is telling ― just one week before the annual Brooklyn Book Festival. On a practical level, the choice will likely make things easier for authors to appear at both; the Well-Read Black Girl has already arranged meeting discussions with major writers such as Angela Flournoy and Margo Jefferson, and asks potential festival attendees to “Imagine the world’s best book club featuring an array of outstanding authors and writers, including Tayari Jones, Naomi Jackson, LaShonda Barnett, Tiphanie Yanique, Tia Williams, Jenna Wortham, Doreen St. Félix, and more.”
More important, the book world still frequently fails to make its spaces welcoming and inclusive of people of color, especially black women, or relegates them to token events addressing diversity or race in literature. Preceding the established festival with an event for black women provides a counterbalance to the whiteness of most shared literary spaces, an opportunity for black girls and women to celebrate their nerdy sides in a sisterly atmosphere.
In addition to author panels, talks and networking events, the festival promises special treats like a VIP kickoff party featuring a screening of author and filmmaker Kathleen Collins’ seminal, and rarely shown, 1982 film “Losing Ground.”
The festival addresses a long-neglected group of book readers, so it should be no surprise that Well-Read Black Girls has seen a surge of demand. Edim launched a Kickstarter on June 3 to support the event, and as of Tuesday morning had been funded to $17,000, exceeding its $15,000 goal.
HuffPost reached out to Edim about the project via email and will update the article accordingly. In the meantime, check out our past interview with Edim, for which she suggests 10 new books by women of color you should add to your 2017 TBR list.

Since her classic 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale was adapted into a TV series for Hulu, Margaret Atwood has used the story as a jumping-off point for discussion around current events.
In a recent call for more public library funding, Atwood reminded fans there are no libraries in Gilead, her fictional authoritarian regime. (“It’s no coincidence,” she added.) Atwood noted that a free press was not protected in Gilead, either, in a letter distributed by PEN America earlier this year regarding censorship and free expression.
Most recently, the author brought up Gilead at New York City’s BookCon 2017 this past weekend, likening recent abortion legislation in Texas to “a form of slavery.”
Atwood spoke on a panel alongside “The Handmaid’s Tale” showrunner Bruce Miller, discussing the historical precedents for Gilead and the intersection of their art and activism.
“I’m not a real activist,” Atwood explained, because activists get paid for their work, and she, on the other hand, doesn’t “have a job.” Her perch as an artist, she continued, makes it possible for her to say the things that others want to say, but feel unable to. For this reason, she said, she would never survive a fascist society because artists are usually targeted first.
“So, you are not yet living in a fascist society,” Atwood told BookCon crowds. “Whoopee.”
When the panel opened up to audience questions, Atwood was asked to put her speculative fiction abilities to use to predict what’s in store for the United States.
“I’m not a clairvoyant,” Atwood said. Instead, she said she looks at what’s happened in the past ― and what’s happening in the present ― when creating future, fictional worlds.
“I was born in 1939,” she said. “What was going on in 1939?”
Atwood continued to explain that she’s read a great deal about fascism, and is an avid reader of prisoners’ diaries. In fact, when asked what further reading she would recommend to fans of her book, she suggested The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: a History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer.
So, The Handmaid’s Tale arose from her imagining what fascism would look like in America. “It wouldn’t be atheistic,” she said.
While she didn’t feel qualified to comment on America’s possible future, she did provide a lengthy, impassioned comment on the current state of affairs ― regarding a question about abortion legislation in Texas.
“I’m [...] waiting for a lawsuit that says if you force me to have children I cannot afford, you should pay for the process,” she said. “It is really a form of slavery to force women to have children that they cannot afford and then to say that they have to raise them.”
Atwood also addressed the ways in which the Hulu adaptation of her book takes seriously the issue of climate change. Pollution and other environmental concerns catalyze the establishment of Gilead in the book, but in the show, the changing climate is more central to the plot.
The update to the show, Atwood said, was made to reflect what’s currently happening in the world. The author cited the example of everyday plastics affecting male fertility.
“But you’re not allowed to say that,” she noted.
Fans of The Handmaid’s Tale ― both the book and the TV show ― will know that her comments fit with the world Atwood wrote about. In her fictional Gilead, women bear the burden of society’s fertility issues, while male infertility is either ignored or dealt with in secrecy. That Atwood ensured her story was drawn from events and trends already existing in real life makes her vision of a possible future that much more frightening.

Thanks to Cher, we’re ready to leave this soggy, half-eaten sandwich of a year behind and fast forward to the bright (and likely beaded) future of 2018.
In a tweet heard ‘round the divasphere on Tuesday night, the Goddess of Pop announced that a musical based on her life is set to arrive on Broadway next year. It will have actors. It will have dancers. It will have singers. And, according to our best guesses, it will have the greatest costumes and wigs to ever grace the Great White Way.
Just got off phone w/Writer & Director of musical. There Will 🐝 performance in THEATRE WITH ACTORS,DANCERS,SINGERS‼️IT'll 🐝ON BROADWAY 2018
The show will feature hits from throughout Cher’s decadeslong career. So far, we know that Jason Moore (”Avenue Q,” “Pitch Perfect”) is set to direct the musical, Rick Elice (”Jersey Boys”) is set to write the book, and Jeffrey Seller (”Hamilton”) and Flody Suarez (”Rise”) are set to produce. 
The Hollywood Reporter noted that Cher previously tweeted approval of the musical back in January ― after an “an ultra-secretive reading of the show” featuring Jillian Mueller, Lena Hall and Lesli Margherita as different Chers ― exclaiming, “I sobbed & laughed, & I was prepared not 2like it. Audience clapped after songs, & gave it standing ovation.”
A November 2016 casting notice revealed that characters dubbed Babe, Lady and Star will represent Cher at various times in her life. A few other figures we can expect to see cast in the musical: Sonny Bono, Cher’s parents, Bob Mackie, David Geffen, Gregg Allman, Robert Altman, Rob Camilletti and, yes, Sigmund Freud.
Cher has yet to reveal more details since her Tuesday evening tweet. In fact, shortly after her all-caps announcement, she resumed her usual social media duties: calling out President Donald Trump.
Subway heroes come in all types: Army veterans, utility engineers, professional ballet dancers. 
The latest transportation savior is more likely to be seen in tights and dance slippers, leaping across a stage at New York City’s prestigious Lincoln Center, than performing a random feat of heroism in his city’s subway system.
Nonetheless, American Ballet Theater dancer Gray Davis did just that: Over the weekend, he came to the rescue of a 58-year-old man who’d fallen onto the tracks at the 72nd Street Broadway-Seventh Avenue station.
According to police, the incident occurred just before midnight on Saturday. The injured man, whose name has not been released, was allegedly pushed onto the tracks by a woman who initially fled the scene. (Carolyn Mack, 23, has since been arrested on assault charges, though she claims she did not push the anonymous man.)
Davis, who’d been waiting at the subway station with his wife, ABT soloist Cassie Trenary, and his mother, Janie Krabbe B. LeTourneau, saw the man fall. “At first I waited for somebody else to jump down there,” he told The New York Times. “People were screaming to get help. But nobody jumped down. So I jumped down.”
Not only did he jump down, but he reportedly lifted the unconscious man to safety, and, upon hearing an oncoming train, “swung” his way out of danger.
“I never realized how high it was,” Davis said of the subway platform ledge. “Luckily, I’m a ballet dancer, so I swung my leg up.”
Davis and Trenary were in the process of heading back from one of her Lincoln Center performances. Although Davis, who’s been with ABT for around 10 years, was not dancing that night due to a herniated disk, Trenary had danced in both the Saturday matinee and evening performances of “The Golden Cockerel.”
Davis’ mother recounted the sequence of events on Facebook in a post shared by ABT’s page, calling the altercation “the most disturbing thing I have ever witnessed”:
As we watched a man and woman on the opposite platform punching each other, Cassandra Trenary made Gray go look for security..all of a sudden the woman threw the man onto the train tracks, while a train was due any minute. We were all horrified about what was about to happen as the man lay unresponsive on that track...out of no where and just in time we all watched as a brave young man jumped down, and lifted the man high up on to safety like he was a feather. Shocked, I said, uh, Cassie is THAT Grayson Davis ? She said Yes it is. He then lifted himself up miraculously just before the train got there. People started cheering and yelling “you are a hero”. The three of us have been in shock ever since. The NYPD came, arrested the lady, then got our statement, and told Gray he did a very brave thing and no doubt saved the man’s life...the man was rushed to hospital and we pray he will be ok. My son has always made me proud, but I’ve never been as proud of him as I was tonight, out of 2 full platforms of people, he was the only person brave enough to jump down and save that man’s life. This certainly is a day I will never forget in more ways than one. (Did I mention Gray has been recovering from a herniated disc for the last month?)
According to several reports, the couple usually uses the 66th Street station after performances, but due to service disruptions, had opted to trek to 72nd instead.
As ABT noted, unlikely heroes truly are everywhere.
HuffPost has reached out to American Ballet Theater and Cassie Trenary for comment and will update this story accordingly.
In its 20 years on this planet Earth, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone — or Philosopher’s, if you’re British — has been officially translated into 68 languages (and unofficially even more than that).
Naturally, some aspects of J.K. Rowling’s characters and plot require a bit of finessing so they make sense in languages other than her native English. The verbal clues that help readers imagine the school houses of Slytherin and Ravenclaw, for example, turn into “Serpentard” and “Serrdaigle” (roughly “snake” and “eagle talon”) in French. In German, “The Mirror of Erised” becomes “Der Spiegel Nerhegeb” — “nerhegeb” being the German word for “desire” spelled backwards.
Character names aren’t safe from alteration in translation, either. Buckbeak the Hippogriff becomes “Hardodziób,” roughly meaning “haughty beak,” in Poland. In Iceland, Crookshanks the cat becomes “Skakklappi,” or “crook-legged.” The wayward owl Pigwidgeon simply is “Kvík” in Slovak, or “squeak.”
Rowling’s affinity for puns requires some smart work on the part of the translator, as well; in a recent discussion over whether Ron Weasley and Lavender Brown ever had sex on the “Harry Potter” sub-Reddit board, users mused over the differences in translation over a scene during Divination class. After Lavender realizes she’s found Uranus, Ron requests whether he can “see Uranus, too.” Oh, ho, ho — but for readers in other languages to get the joke, the pun had to be altered somewhat, from “Uranus” to simply a “heavenly body” (that Ron would like to see, too). Ten points to the translator who had to finesse that one.
The text isn’t the only thing that has changed as the story of “Harry Potter” traveled from country to country. Various publishers chose to stray from the American cover illustrated by Mary GrandPré or the U.K. version created by Thomas Taylor, while others did not. Here are 21 magical covers from the first “Harry Potter” book that stole our hearts.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified the Bulgarian cover as Russian.
This week, director Patty Jenkins made history. She became the first woman director to head up a summer blockbuster ― a big-budget sector of the film industry typically reserved for action movies directed by men.
That Hollywood has been notoriously unkind to women directors makes the feat more remarkable still. Jenkins ― whose biggest flick prior to “Wonder Woman” was made with less than a tenth of the budget ― is only the fourth woman director to head up a project in the $100 million plus range.
What’s more: critics say the film’s a hit.
In an interview with Hollywood Reporter, Jenkins was modest about her early success. “I can’t take on the history of 50 percent of the population just because I’m a woman,” she said. And we agree. There’s no dearth of talented women directors who haven’t been given a chance on big-budget projects; hopefully, Jenkins’ efforts will open doors for them, too.
We’ve got a few in mind. Between Marvel’s “She-Hulk” and DC Comics’ brainy Natasha Irons, there are dozens of superheroine stories waiting to be adapted into summertime hits. Below, we’ve paired our favorite women directors with the winningest heroes we love.
In recent Marvel installments of her story, “She-Hulk” has become much more than an object of desire. Mariko Tamaki — author of “This One Summer” — gives Jennifer Walters her own story, in which she’s coping with PTSD. And Karyn Kusama — director of “Girlfight” and “Jennifer’s Body” — has proven that she’s able to take on action-centered stories with dark psychological underpinnings.
Elisabeth Olsen is currently playing the Scarlet Witch, aka Wanda Maximoff, in the “Avengers” movies, beginning with “Age of Ultron.” Maximoff is (maybe) the daughter of Magneto, the twin sister of Quicksilver, and her husband is Vision, so a film centered specifically on Scarlet Witch ― whose powers include being able to alter reality in various ways ― would be a true comic book family drama. We’d like to see Reed Morano, the director of the first three episodes of Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” as well as films like “Skeleton Twins,” give the adaptation a bleak, intimate edge.
Raven is a half-human, half-demon superhero who was rejected by the Justice League due to her dangerous ancestry. She winds up forming her own group of rowdy do-gooder teens ― a story that seems suited to Amber Tamblyn’s penchant for dark and feeling character studies.
Faith, with her psychokinetic and telepathic powers, has earned praise as a body-positive superheroine who, according to writer Amy Diegelman, is “fat [...] and not hiding.” In her solo comic, Faith (aka Zephyr) has a boring job at a BuzzFeed-like media company, is dealing with a breakup and is living in a new city ― the perfectly relatable millennial scenario. Amma Asante, who directed 2016’s “A United Kingdom,” could bring out the best of this story.
Geeks everywhere already know that DuVernay is behind the promising new adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time,” so she’s already established herself as a woman director who’s interested in fantastical stories. DuVernay could work her magic on any of the Marvel of DC characters, really, but a cinematic retelling of Natasha Irons’ story would be worthy of her talents. Irons — like Tony Stark and her uncle, Steel — begins her world-saving career as an engineer donning Steel’s powerful suit. 
Maybe you don’t want a “Poison Ivy” remake, but we do. And who better to make it happen than Dee Rees? She’s known for directing the HBO film “Bessie,” the docuseries “When We Rise” and an episode of “Empire,” but is tied to the “Philip K. Dick’s Electric Dreams” Amazon project, giving her some sci-fi experience. In the comic books, Poison Ivy ― or Pamela Lillian Isley ― is a botanist-turned-eco-terrorist (and sometimes Batman love interest), which seems like a complex villain plot built for our post-Paris Accord era.  
Barring her uncreative name, Thor Girl (née Tarene) is a full-fledged superhero deserving of her own flick. After fighting supervillain Loki alongside Thor, she sought refuge on earth under the alias Tara Olson. Mimi Leder, the director of “Deep Impact” and executive producer on “The Leftovers,” would be a suitable match for Tarene.
“Buffy” would make for another contentious remake, but one that, under the helm of “American Honey” director Andrea Arnold, could be incredible. We’d love to see a film adaptation focus more on the mundane struggles of a high schooler living in suburban California ― which also happens to a “Hellmouth,” opening up Buffy’s home to a demonic gateway. 
Echo, aka Ronin, made her first appearance in “Daredevil” Vol. 2, Issue #9, as a Native American woman with gifted intellect and “photographic reflexes,” who also happens to be one of the first deaf comic book characters. Her biography could move in so many directions ― she’s been in love with Daredevil, friends with Wolverine and Dr. Strange, allied with the New Avengers. Heather Rae, who’s mostly directed documentaries (like the Sundance and Tribeca darling “Trudell,” which tells the story of historic Native American poet and activist John Trudell), has experience working on narrative films as a producer. We’d love to see what someone with her resume could do with a superhero flick.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article included an image of “Thor Goddess of Thunder” (Jane Foster), instead of “Thor Girl” (Tarene Olson). It also incorrectly described the plot of “Belle,” Amma Asante’s film. 
Hermione Granger, a 19-year-old seventh year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has retired to the lavish prefect’s bathroom for a relaxing bath. But ― uh oh ― just as she’s drying off, she hears someone else enter the marbled, gilded washroom. Someone smoldering. Someone romantic. Someone who’s about to rock her world sexually. Severus... Snape?
Allie LeFevere and Lyndsay Rush are aghast at the thought. “I hope this goes... it was Professor Snape, and he was just grabbing something and leaving,” Rush gasps, giggling. “God,” LeFevere adds, “I feel like this is going to get real aggressive.”
Snape is not just grabbing something and leaving, of course. This is “The Potterotica Podcast,” and the two cohosts have just begun the first season, in which they read a nine-episode erotic fanfic story aloud. The story: “In the Prefect’s Bathroom” by fanfic writer Mrs. Figg, which takes place after the seventh book. The pairing: Hermione and Snape, sometimes known as “Snermione.”
For those familiar with erotic fan fiction, the preceding three paragraphs probably won’t sound bizarre or disturbing; for more straight-laced Potterheads, they might be viscerally shocking. LeFevere, Rush and the third cohost Danny Chapman, who joined the podcast (now on its second season) more recently, fall into the second camp. Casual “Harry Potter” fans, they stumbled into the world of erotic fan fiction not long ago. But rather than being horrified by the vast world of Potter-based erotica, they embraced it ― and found the humor in it.
“It’s so fun and so silly, and sometimes it’s sexy, but mostly we’re just laughing,” Rush told HuffPost in a recent phone conversation. They framed “The Potterotica Podcast” as a comedy show ― and indeed, they spend much of each episode howling with laughter at the romantic speeches or descriptions of a male lead’s “slender, pale legs” that are “sparsely covered with black hair.” (Apparently some people don’t find that look to be arousing.)
Much of the comedy comes from juxtaposing these beloved children’s book characters ― none written by J.K. Rowling to be sex symbols, and some written as buffoonish, grotesque or evil ― with adult sexual situations and frankly expressed desire. “If it was out of a comedic context, I think it would be very difficult to talk about these characters in a sexual way,” LeFevere said, “but there’s something about layering on satire that makes it more digestible.”
“The Potterotica Podcast” isn’t the first erotica podcast played for laughs ― even some erotica and erotic fanfic is itself infused with absurd humor. (Remember A Gronking to Remember?) Before landing on Potterotica, LeFevere and Rush contemplated a romance novel podcast. Where does our urge to laugh at overtly sexual writing come from? Why might pornographic stories about Harry and Draco, or Hermione and Snape, seem hilarious rather than simply titillating or, alternately, disturbing?
“I almost wonder if it’s because there’s still so much taboo around sex,” LeFevere floated. “The defenses go down when you can laugh and also maybe talk about a topic that maybe feels uncomfortable.”
Rush agreed, adding that the humorous side to sex isn’t restricted to blowsy erotica. “Recording the podcast and discussing these things in this way feels like it would if I had a glass of wine with my friends and we were talking about sex,” she said. “I don’t know if it’s necessarily that laughter is you masking your vulnerability or if it’s just a shade of vulnerability. You’re looking at this intimate thing in a lighthearted way.”
The hosts ask authors for permission before sharing their work on the podcast, but they have received some pushback for making light of Potterotica. When they were promoting the podcast on fan communities, LeFevere ventured into a subreddit devoted to Potterotica enthusiasts, and found that the members were less than thrilled by their angle. For some fans, Chapman said, “this isn’t to be laughed at; this is serious business.” For these redditors, LeFevere said, “Us laughing at it and giggling and making jokes was very offensive,” she said. “They were just like, no, this isn’t our jam.”
The line between serious erotica consumer and comedy fan isn’t a bright one, however. Not only do the Potterotica podcasters receive story submissions from fanfic authors who want their works to be included in a comedy show, the three hosts have realized that sexual awakening can be found in unexpected places ― like a fanfic about Hermione receiving a “Magic Mike”-esque lap dance from Draco, the plot of a Facebook Live installment the podcast did. “I think that was the hottest one,” Rush admitted.
As for LeFevere, she’s a fan of another Dramione fic, the one they’re reading in the current season. “I love it because they’re both notorious in their class and were nemeses,” she told HuffPost. “They bring out a different side of each other in these stories: Hermione’s more risqué and edgy, and we’re starting to see the softer side of Draco.”
A certain gingerness surrounding the ages of the subjects also creeps in. In many fics, the characters are depicted in their adult lives, but others take place during the series timeframe. Some show relationships between professors and students ― before or after their graduation. “The one that I am shocked by is Snape and Harry,” said LeFevere. “That’s a really popular one, and I think more than anything the shock is because of the role he played in Harry’s life at the end of the books and movies… He almost to some degree becomes a mentor, a fatherly figure.” 
The cohosts pointed out that, though they try to be very mindful of the ages of the characters, we’re naturally curious about what happened next to fictional people we watched grow up. That includes romance. If anything, they wish there were more explorations of canon relationships, in a Potterotica world packed with Dramione, Snarry and Drarry fics. “In my limited experience, no one’s writing about Hermione and Ron like I hoped they would,” Rush said. “It sounds very lame and old-school, but I would have loved to see more of them.”
The accessibility of adult entertainment offered by fanfic (or a fanfic podcast) makes it a welcoming avenue toward sexual exploration, the hosts pointed out. “Something that makes this erotic world approachable is that these are characters you feel you know so well and trust,” explained Rush. “So you feel like, Oh, I could sort of get into this.” As many erotic fanfiction readers have discovered in the past, interweaving explicit content into a familiar, nonsexual story allowed them to gradually explore more sexually charged narratives, whereas porn may have seemed too intimidating and romance novels too weighed down by character backstory. Even as they laugh at the Potterotica they read, they find excitement in it.
“This has been a big sexual awakening,” said LeFevere, who has rarely read romance novels in the past. “It’s been a fun way to explore our own sexuality, our experiences.”
Though they emphasize that they know many Potter fans have enjoyed erotic fan fiction for years, the podcasters have found much of their listener base is newer to the art form ― a perhaps still-more accessible way for novices to get comfortable with adult entertainment. “The podcast format is also so great for it, because as soon as you watch a video, it’s like, uh, that’s porn,” Chapman joked. Opening up an erotic romance novel in public might seem nearly as embarrassing. On a podcast, though, “You can bring it to life and close your eyes and sort of imagine it without, like, watching porn on a plane.”
Surely anything that encourages more people to get comfortable with their sexuality, without watching porn in public, is a good thing.
From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories.

A post shared by Tom Toro (@tbtoro) on Feb 8, 2017 at 9:18am PST
”I think all of us have a social responsibility to resist Trump’s destructive agenda in every way we can,” artist Tom Toro told HuffPost. 
For Toro, his particular brand of resistance often comes in the form of cartoons, many of which have appeared in publications like The New Yorker. Shortly after it was announced that President Donald Trump would be pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement, an international effort to combat climate change, one such cartoon began making its way across social media. 
In it, two caricatures resembling Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are pictured in shoulders-deep water, marooned on an island, the former muttering: “Don’t worry ― I’m tweeting that climate change is fake.” Pence appears, hands joined in prayer, as a complicit witness.
“Humor is the heartbeat of a healthy democracy,” Toro added in our previous interview. “And, well, as we’re soon going to show our so-called president, the joke’s on him.”
A post shared by Edel Rodriguez (@edelrodriguez) on Jun 2, 2017 at 9:06am PDT
Toro is far from the only artist to created scathing Trump takedowns in the form of political cartoons. Edel Rodriguez, known for his no-holds-barred covers for Der Spiegel, has been satirizing everything from Trumpcare to the U.S. president’s “America First” attitude.
This week, his DS cover features a Mar-a-Lago-ready Donald embracing his backswing as a flaming golf ball drawn as planet Earth throttles into the cartoon’s foreground. “You’re fired,” the image’s caption reads.
“My work encourages people that are a little afraid,” Rodriguez told HuffPost earlier this year. “When they see what I do, and all the stuff that comes at me, they might say, ‘Wow, that guy has some guts. Maybe I should get some too.’”
Emily Flake, another New Yorker cartoonist whose work has subtly and not-so-subtly remarked upon Trump’s presidency, has thought a lot about cartoonists’ handling of Trump’s policies and personas.
“I tried to be circumspect about when I mentioned DT by name or drew him in an attempt to keep the audience from being exhausted and the work from being too one-note,” she told HuffPost in January. “And I think that when people’s brains have just that extra nanosecond to put the idea together, it can help a joke land harder. That said, Trump has a look that just begs to be drawn ― for better or worse, he’s a gift to cartoonists, visually speaking.”
Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet.
Diana Prince may be a fictional superhero, battling enemies with her Lasso of Truth, but her story has also had a heroic impact on the film industry.
With this week’s release of “Wonder Woman,” director Patty Jenkins became the first woman to helm a big-budget superhero flick. If it’s a critical and box office success, the feat will likely open doors for other woman filmmakers, too.
So, the movie is a boon for women working behind the camera ― but its also a step in the right direction for how women are portrayed on camera too. Jenkins’ Wonder Woman is tough and gracious, self-possessed and physically agile. She’d make a great role model for young girls, which is why nonprofit organization Girls Inc. is raising funds to send 70 high-school-aged women in New York City to see the film.
“Wonder Woman has been a cultural icon since her creation in 1942, and symbol to girls and boys that a woman can be strong, bold, and compassionate,” the organization writes on its GoFundMe page. 
The aim of Girls Inc., headquartered in NYC, is to provide young women with resources to succeed academically, and to participate in physical activities. The group also hopes to help women “manage money” and “navigate media messages.”
The effort to raise money to send girls to see “Wonder Woman” is co-led by Legion of Women Writers, a network of women working in media and entertainment.
Their GoFundMe campaign has already exceeded its initial fundraising goal of $1,200 and, as of Friday morning, surpassed its stretch goal of $5,000, too. According to an update on the campaign, the additional money will go to Girls Inc. of NYC’s Annual College Shower, which helps freshman girls pay for college costs.

For some, curling up with J.K. Rowling’s legendary Harry Potter series is a blissful childhood memory. Who didn’t dream of receiving their very own Hogwarts acceptance letter when they were a kid?
But for the true devotees, the magic never died. Harry Potter remains a powerful force in their imaginations and identities. Their love of all things H.P. is not just written on their hearts ― it’s right there on their flesh. 
In honor of the 20th anniversary of the very first Harry Potter book ― Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (Sorcerer’s Stone in the U.S.), published on June 26, 1997 ― we asked 24 superfans to share the stories behind their enchanted ink. For some, the epic tale and its themes of courage, hope and magic proved invaluable during the more difficult hurdles life throws your way. For others, well, they just really love Snape. 
My tattoo is of the stars at the top of each page of each book (the American versions).
I got it in March 2016, and I was 21.
I’ve read the Harry Potter books countless times. I had to buy a new set of books because I read the first so many times they were falling apart! I read them every single year. I used to do it over the summer but just last year my coworker said that she reads them starting at Halloween because that’s really when the story started, so I started doing that with her. 
This tattoo is just a reminder that Harry Potter is always there for me when I need it ― it’s a comfort for me. Whenever I see it, I feel happy that I was able to find Harry Potter and that my life was changed for the better by it.
Gryffindor!
The tattoo on my back is the Dewey Decimal and Cutter number for Harry Potter.
I got it on my 22nd birthday, just after finishing my master’s degree in library and information science. 
I’ve been a Harry Potter fan for years. I was heavily involved in the Wizard Rock and Harry Potter fandoms at the time. Most of my social group came from the H.P. fandom. I had a tradition of getting a new tattoo for each birthday, which I stopped after my 24th birthday, but the idea was to sort of commemorate some aspect of my life over the course of the previous year with my birthday tattoos. I had just finished my master’s degree at the University of Illinois. Melville Dewey founded the library school there, so I decided to get the Dewey and Cutter code for the Harry Potter books as they were catalogued in my university library.
My tattoo is of my patronus, which is a swan. My patronus is meant to be my guardian, which is perfect because that also happens to be my last name. I couldn’t believe it when I did the test. It also has the classic phrase “always” which was Snape’s response to Dumbledore when asked, “After all this time?” The “A” is also in the form of the Deathly Hallows. 
I got it in August of 2016. I was 26 at the time. 
This tattoo is special to me for many reasons. I have been with my boyfriend for 12 years, and the “always” speaks to how I feel about him. Similarly with Snape, no matter how much time goes by, I will always have that love for him. The swan is special to me because I will eventually marry [my boyfriend], and my last name will change. I will always be a Swan and having that reminder in beautiful artwork makes me happy. 
Gryffindor.
The tattoo is of an asphodel (a variety of lily), with the stem fading into the word “always.” Snape’s first words to Harry in Sorcerer’s Stone were “Potter! What would I get if I added powered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood” ― the ingredients for the Draught of the Living Death, which Harry perfects with the help of Snape’s old textbook in Book Six. “Always” is perhaps the most significant Snape quote, regarding his love for Lily. 
Nov. 26, 2016, on my 26th birthday. 
Snape is my favorite character ― hands down ― and his love for Lily, its extension to Harry, and how he reacts to his feelings of guilt and grief with isolation make him incredibly relatable. We’ve all had those people that have irrevocably changed our lives. The Harry Potter series was my first obsession, and I knew that I wanted to get a H.P. tattoo, but I didn’t want it to be your typical H.P. tattoo. 
What’s your Hogwarts house? 
Slytherin. 
I got this tattoo when my son was born. He was born at 23 weeks gestation, on the brink of viability. He was 1 pound, 5 ounces, considered a micro-preemie. He was given a 17 percent chance of making it, and [it was] assumed he would live with serious medical complications the rest of his life. Instead, he did the unbelievable, and made it out of the NICU (just over four months) with no real issues relating to his extreme prematurity.
His third birthday is coming up next month and he has blossomed into an amazing child with a personality to match his story. I got the protection spell along with his name, hoping to give him a little extra “magic” something. I still like to think it made a difference. It doesn’t hurt that his initial care physician in the NICU (one of among hundreds) pulled me aside after seeing it a week later and told me how he loved the books. We still visit the NICU and see the doctors regularly. It wasn’t until we got out of the hospital that we recognized how incredibly small the odds that Cam made it through his prematurity without serious learning deficiencies or other more major health issues ... it had to be the protection spell!
My first son was born prematurely due to a car accident. My wife was 25 weeks pregnant at the time. A driver hit us head on, coming around bend. He fell asleep at the wheel. Grayson was born within an hour of the accident, after we were all rushed to the closest hospital that could deal with our major injuries. He only survived a few minutes; the injuries sustained in the crash were too great for him to overcome. He was 2 pounds, 2 ounces, so pretty big compared to his brother. My wife was touch-and-go for about a week. It was the scariest time of my life. She spent a month in the TICU, and needed seven surgeries before she was able to go to a facility to rehab. I have often related the losses suffered in Harry Potter to those in my own family.
Losing family is never easy, losing a child even less so. The pain that Harry accepts as part of his life is something I can personally understand. That sense of loss never leaves you or your mind for very long. I always loved the story, and grew up reading these books (I am 33) so I literally grew into adulthood with these characters. To me Harry and the Hogwarts family show that perseverance and love can conquer even the worst the world can throw at you. I guess that’s a little deep considering the subject matter of an imaginary magical world, but the escape into this story has always helped me get through my darkest times.
One day my son Cameron will be old enough to enjoy Harry Potter, too, so together we can witness again what it means for Harry to overcome and persevere through it all, with his friends and family by his side. 
I got the tattoo in June of 2014, a couple weeks after my son was born. I was 30 years old.
The meaning has only gotten stronger to me as time goes on and my son continues to hit milestones that doctors weren’t sure he ever could. It is pretty cool to look over and see that reminder all the time.
I am a Ravenclaw according to Pottermore, but I relate to Gryffindor, too!
My tattoo is of Sirius Black in his animagus form with the symbol for transformation on his hind leg (a tattoo the actor has in the movies on his chest). Sirius plays a pivotal role in Harry’s life, showing him true family love for the first time after his parents passed. Sirius first showed himself to Harry in his dog form.
I got it when I moved back home to Los Angeles after college, age 22.
There are many layers to why it’s so special to me! My baby sister was still living at home at the time, and she and I share a fierce and passionate love for the Harry Potter books. She helped me design it; not only is it my homage to my intro to magic, but to my sister. It also connects me to every other magic-lover and seeker in the world. And finally, it is also representative of how I believe animals should be treated, with the same respect and dignity as humans. 
I would consider myself to have attended Ilvermorny School in Pukwudgie house! 
I have a tattoo of the Deathly Hallows on the inside of my right wrist. The Deathly Hallows (also the name of the final and seventh book in the series) refers to a story originally told by Beedle the Bard, that was passed down through wizarding folklore. It tells the story of three items given to the Peverell brothers by Death: the elder wand, the cloak of invisibility and the resurrection stone. It is said that whomever is in possession of all three is the master of death, and all three items make appearances throughout the series. 
I got in in September of 2014. I was 26 at the time. 
I was an avid Harry Potter fan growing up, standing in line at midnight for the book releases and locking myself in my room until I finished to avoid spoilers. The whole thing. My sister and I both grew up with it, and it played a big part in our childhood. As we got older, one of her first (of many) tattoos was a sleeve of the Marauder’s Map on her left arm and a smaller Deathly Hallows tattoo on her wrist. She passed away in August of 2014, and a few weeks later I went and got the same tattoo. Its meaning has definitely changed for me; every time I look at it I’m reminded of her. I think in a way that’s how you defeat death, by always keeping the memory of that person alive.  
I’m a Gryffindor. 
It is a white lightning bolt and it encompasses my overall love for the entire Harry Potter series. I fell in love with the books in fifth grade and was at every midnight book launch once I was old enough to attend. Of course I own all the movies, too.
I got it when I was 27. I have wanted it since I was 19, though, it just took me a while to pull the trigger. I was always too scared to actually get a tattoo because I’m not good with needles. I went with a friend of mine when she got her tattoo and it lessened my fear about it. A week later, I got the lightning bolt.
The image is special to me because it represents all of what Harry Potter is: strength, courage, dignity, bravery and best of all ― magic.
Oh, Slytherin for sure.
Harry Potter has played such a big role in my life. As a child, reading the books truly took me to a different world full of magic and mystery. I have always been into witches and the macabre, even as a child, and combing the two together through the writings of J.K. Rowling was just simply the best for my 11-year-old self.
My family totally helped in developing my love, too. One Christmas my mother made me and my sister our very own Hogwarts letters along with homemade spell books. Nowadays, as an adult woman, Harry Potter still instills the magic within me. It will always be a part of me and I look forward to many more movies and books from our beloved J.K. I can’t wait to finish my sleeve and have both children and adults enjoy looking at it and starting up Harry Potter conversations. 
I started my Harry Potter sleeve two years ago and have been adding to it as recently as April.
I am a Ravenclaw and Thunderbird (Ilvermorny house).
It’s a wolf with the back end of it transforming into a night scene with some stars and the moon, representing Lupin and the changes that he goes through due to the moon. I wanted to have a werewolf representation that was more artistic and less gruesome than the movie version. 
I got this done last year. I was 20.
This image is special to me because Lupin is one of my favorite characters in the series and I’ve always resonated with his outcast story and admired the fact that he had friends who accepted and included him and never thought badly of him for who he was. I don’t think I’ll ever not be fond of his character and his story, so the meaning of this tattoo will always remain for me. 
According to Pottermore, I’m in Gryffindor.
When I got my tattoo, I didn’t want something huge or elaborate because at the time I was looking for a job and needed something I could hide. I went for the simple rims of his glasses and the lightning bolt. My favorite thing about it is that if people aren’t into Harry Potter, then they don’t always realize what the tattoo is.
I believe I was 18 when I got the tattoo. I had just graduated high school and my best friend and I at the time got matching ones.
When I first got the tattoo, it was significant because my best friend and I got them matching. We both love Harry Potter. We went to premiers together and spent our entire grad bash at Harry Potter World at Universal. We really aren’t friends anymore, and as far as I know, she actually had her tattoo covered up. But this tattoo actually sparked the best conversation of my whole college experience. My first night in college I met some of my long time friends over them being in love with my tattoo. It means so much to me.
I’m a Slytherin! And proud. It doesn’t mean i’m evil, just cunning.
It’s the Deathly Hallows with the lightning bolt scar on top.
I got it at 19, which was back in 2012.
To me it was the beginning of the series, the lightning bolt scar that started it all, and the end, the Deathly Hallows that signified acceptance of death and loss.
Gryffindor!
I always knew I wanted to get a Harry Potter tattoo, but I knew I wanted to get something a little less common than other H.P. tattoos I’d seen. Not that the Deathly Hallows aren’t cool, or the “always” tattoos, but I wanted something that a true H.P. fan would recognize right off the bat and something that might make others ask the significance. So that’s how I ended up with the stars from the corners of the pages. It helps to separate the people who are solely H.P. movie fans from the bookworms.
Ironically enough, I actually went with one of my good friends and we both got Harry Potter tattoos on Daniel Radcliffe’s birthday a couple of years back. It was totally unintentional and I didn’t know until I checked Twitter later that day. It was July 23, 2014, and I was 19. 
Those books were such a big part of my childhood and experience growing up. The stars were always a welcoming and familiar sight anytime I cracked open a book from the series. I got the tattoo the summer after my first year of college, which was a particularly challenging time for me. I had a rough time with my major and ended up changing and had a falling out with my roommate. It was a very isolating time and it took a lot for me to even want to go back to the same school.
The following year the RA of my new dorm played Quidditch and after finding out that I had a Harry Potter tattoo she practically dragged me to a practice. It introduced me to so many people who I had an instant connection with. Harry Potter is unique in that way. People really connect with it and get so excited to meet people that are equally as into it.
I’m a proud Gryffindor.
I thought about which Harry Potter symbol or quote I wanted to get for years. There were so many directions I could have taken, but I ultimately decided on a simple spell: “protego.” It is a shield charm that can be applied to many other types of charms, intended to create this magical barrier to protect something or someone from harm. It’s used in the books dozens of times, from Harry protecting himself against spells casted at him by Death Eaters and Voldemort to the barrier put up at the final Battle of Hogwarts to protect the castle. 
I got it on May 30, 2012. I was 19 at the time.
I chose this spell for a fairly particular and intimate reason. I have suffered from depression and anxiety for the majority of my life and for a handful of my teenage years I engaged in various acts of self-harm. Right below my tattoo, you can see faint markings of previous self-harm scars. I got the tattoo right there as a reminder that I can use the resources I have and I can remind myself of the things that make me happy in order to protect myself from the “Death Eaters” in my own mind. Over the years, as my scars fade, it is a constant reminder to always protect myself and those I love from anything that makes me unhappy, uncomfortable or upset.
Ravenclaw, with Hufflepuff tendencies.
My tattoo is the last three words from the seventh Harry Potter book: “All was well.” As a child I was always a huge fan of the books. My dad and I read them together while I was growing up, and when I got old enough, I read them aloud to my entire family on road trips! When I was 8 years old, we got a puppy and I insisted we name him Harry Potter after my favorite book series. Harry and I grew up together.
I had been thinking that I wanted to get a Harry Potter–inspired tattoo throughout college, but didn’t make the final decision until Harry (our dog) passed away when I was 20 years old. 
I originally got the tattoo because I wanted to make sure I remembered Harry (my dog) every day when I saw the tattoo on my wrist. He was sick for a long time before he passed away and I spent his final minutes with him ― it seemed like a fitting reminder that in the end, everything was okay and that he lived a long and happy life. As I’ve spent more time with the tattoo, I feel like it also symbolized a a shift for me personally, from childhood to adulthood. Harry Potter (the character from the books) and my dog are such wonderful reminders of my childhood and family!
I would love to say Gryffindor, but I was sorted on Pottermore once and ended up in Slytherin. Not sure how that happened!
The tattoo is of the Deathly Hallows — a triangle with a circle inside and a vertical line running through it. It represents the elder wand, the invisibility cloak and the resurrection stone, the three items that you must possess to master death.
I got it two years ago, when I was 25 and finishing my masters in the U.K.
I’ve been a giant Harry Potter nerd my entire life, and when I see other people with a Deathly Hallows tattoo, I recognize them instantly as being My People. I like that feeling of community. I knew I wanted a tattoo but had been handwringing for months about what to get. Eventually I decided to let go of the idea of having “great art” on my body and just be part of a fun nerd club instead.
#Hufflepuff4Lyfe
My tattoo is a quote from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It’s the very last line in the book: “All was well.”
I got it in April 2016. I was 24 at the time.
I have been a Harry Potter fan since the age of 10. I grew up reading the books and waited with great anticipation every time a new book was to be released. I think the reason I chose this quote is because it’s so symbolic of the fact that so many bad things happened to the characters in the books: They lost loved ones, but in the end everything was okay. I cling to that, that all will be well for me, too. 
I am a proud Gryffindor. 
My tattoo is of the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, located on my right arm just above my wrist.
I got it about a year ago now, I was 21 at the time.
I chose the Deathly Hallows symbol for its philosophical undertones. Someone who possesses all three is supposed to be a master of death, and to me this symbol represents my own struggle to “master” death, and come to terms with my own mortality, something that is a part of life for all of us.
I am a proud member of Hufflepuff and plan to get a tattoo of the crest eventually as well!
Two of my eight tattoos are Harry Potter–related. I got my first H.P. one in 2014, when I was 22. It’s a small black lightning bolt, and it was my fourth tattoo. I knew I definitely wanted something related to the series but the Deathly Hallows seemed too common and more specific to the D.H. story. My next tattoo was the one pictured above. It’s the stars in the corner of the pages of the series. 
I got this tattoo in September 2016, when I went to visit my cousin who lives an hour from Universal in Florida. We got our tattoos, then spent the day at Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It’s even more special that I got to share the experience with my cousin. 
The meanings have not changed, but my feelings about them have. A lot of people don’t always draw the connection to H.P. immediately, since they are not super obvious, but those who do recognize the symbols ― it feels like a special connection, and makes me love them even more. 
Slytherin.
My tiny, hidden golden snitch. Not much explanation necessary, as it’s played many vital roles in our most beloved seeker’s life. 
I had this done in 2010, a few days after turning 18. 
The golden snitch held the most significance to me because it was always something that Harry was striving for. It stood for my goals and dreams: No matter how flighty and swift they may be, they are still golden. Also the words that appear near the end of Book Seven, “I open at the close,” spoke to me like nothing else had before. I was 18, my childhood was closing in, I was leaving my hometown and opening up to a new life at college in the city of my dreams. It was too perfect. Now, at 24, I can vouch that the message still holds meaning, as I’m learning and growing with life’s ebbs and flows. I may be constantly closing doors, but almost always never without opening a window. 
Gryffindor.
I have two tattoos. Harry’s scar on my left wrist and the Deathly Hallows symbol on my right wrist.
I got them in 2010. I had just turned 23.
Both images are very special to me. Harry’s scar is a reminder that all of us go through dark times, but we all have the chance to get out of these stronger if only we have friends and the necessary aid. (I had been bullied in school, so I had no friends. I started making friends when I found out on the internet that other fans were organizing events to know each other, so I went to one of these events and kept going every time there was one in the city. This was in 2006, and I’m still friends with several of them). The Deathly Hallows image is a reminder that, although we may have power, not everything is available to us. My aunt died before I got it, so I always relate the resurrection stone to her.
Slytherin, out and proud! 
I have the Deathly Hallows symbol on my right side.
I got the tattoo almost two years ago at the age of 26.
This image in particular was special because (in the book,) as Hermione began to tell the tale of the Peverell brothers, the presumed original owners of the hallows, I got chills. This is what I had been waiting for! All along I’d been on this journey and finally, here it was, an eery children’s bedtime turned reality and finally, it was time to end Voldemort and his crusade once and for all. While it was a symbol marked by death and destruction, to me it became a symbol of victory and triumph and a perfect ending to an adventure I had been on from fifth grade into my adulthood. 
Gryffindor! 
I have the word “always.” on the outside of my right wrist. Even though it may seem simple to muggles, to the Potter fans out there I think we can all agree this was one of the biggest plot twists J.K could have graced us with.
I got this tattoo in February of 2016. I was 24 years old.
The series of events that lead to the famous conversation between Dumbledore and Snape will forever be one of the biggest plot twists in fictional history. Not only did it change Harry’s life, but it changed mine. It allowed me to understand that love was strong, unwavering and infallible, but at the same time it was dark, painful and daunting. I was able to sympathize with this concept and I still hold it dear to my heart today. If you look up the word “always” in the dictionary you will find the definition is “forever; continually,” and to me that’s what love is. Whether it’s blissful or painful, it’s always.
Alas, I am a proud Slytherin and I carry the wand of Narcissa Malfoy.
I have a small “HP” stick-and-poke on the side of my middle finger on my left hand. The H.P. stands for Harry Potter, obviously, as a reference to the books and the boy. But because it’s just initials, it can still be slightly secret for the squares and nonbelievers.
I must’ve been 19 or 20 years old, so around 2008 or 2009. I started by giving the stick-and-poke to myself, but it hurt so badly I had to stop and left half an “H” on my finger for a long time. My ex-boyfriend/best friend finished the tattoo one night about a year later in his bed where he lived in the living room of an apartment on Haight Street in San Francisco. It hurt less when he did it.
I love the Harry Potter books (duh) and they always helped me through hard times. I have learned so much from reading them over and over and over. So I wanted a little tattoo to commemorate my love for the books; however, I didn’t want anything too obvious so I chose the “HP” instead of a Deathly Hallows or dark mark or something. Most people don’t know it stands for Harry Potter and assume it stands for Hewlett Packard (like, what?) or when I’m in Spain, “hijo de puta,” which is kinda funny, but I’m not that crude. A couple years later I gave my cousin a matching stick-and-poke in a hotel room over Christmas in Granada, Spain. She has an “RW” for Ron Weasley in the same place. Certainly the meaning has changed over time; not only is it a reminder of my one true consistent friend, the HP book series, it’s a connection to my best friend who hasn’t talked to me in three years, and an expression of cousinly love.
Def Ravenclaw, because I’m a Latin teacher/grad student (although I wish it were Gryffindor, but I’m not that brave). 
From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories.
Though originally a fanatic for Bathilda Bagshot’s Hogwarts: A History, Hermione Granger eventually took umbrage with the book. And for good reason.
Granger didn’t appreciate how the book neglected to mention Hogwarts’ use of House Elves. We second that, but we’re more perturbed about other omissions. For instance, what about the theory that Ron Weasley is a time-traveling Albus Dumbledore, or that Voldemort doesn’t have hair because he doesn’t want anyone to create a Polyjuice Potion of him?
No bother. In honor of 20 years since the “Harry Potter” books, and 15 years since the film “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,” we’ve gathered the most magical theories together in one place.
There are more theories than flavors of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans, but here are the ones you should know based on popularity and evidence.
We even brought in our sorting hat to put them into three categories: The Chosen Ones, Keepers and Simply Riddikulus. (There’s not a terrible theory alive that didn’t wind up in Riddikulus.)
These are the theories who lived. 
This theory, which has gone around Reddit and Tumblr, says Dumbledore represents Death from “The Tale of the Three Brothers.”
The fairy tale told to wizard children relays the story of three brothers who, in an attempt to use magic to cross a river that’s otherwise deadly, meet Death. Feeling cheated by the brothers’ attempts to outwit him, Death tricks the brothers into taking “gifts” that ― in two out of three cases, at least ― eventually lead to their demise.
In the theory, Voldemort is the first brother; he wants power, so he receives the Elder Wand. Snape represents the second brother; he lost Harry’s mom, Lily — the woman he loved, so he receives the Resurrection Stone. The third brother is Harry; like in the story, he receives the invisibility cloak. Dumbledore is then Death, who, like in the fairy tale, greets Harry “as an old friend” at the purgatory-ish King’s Cross Station after the Boy Who Lived gets “killed” by Voldemort. (The “gifts,” of course, are the Deathly Hallows.)
If you need more proof, J.K. Rowling approves:
Dumbledore as death. It's a beautiful theory and it fits. https://t.co/QqTQm2QnI0
Voldemort supposedly jinxed the Hogwarts position of Defense Against the Dark Arts after Dumbledore denied him the post. As evidence, Hogwarts was unable to keep a DADA teacher for more than a year while the curse was ongoing.
This is more of a fact than a theory. Rowling apparently confirmed by telling “Today” that the position wasn’t jinxed anymore after Voldemort’s death.
In “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” we learn about Obscurials, which are young wizards and witches who develop a dark magical force called an Obscurus as a result of their magic being suppressed.
A curious quote from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has some thinking Ariana Dumbledore was an Obscurial for suppressing her magic, too.
Talking about his sister in the book, Aberforth Dumbledore says, “She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless.” 
They might as well put that quote under the definition of Obscurial. Don’t be surprised if this Ariana Dumbledore reveal shows up in the new movies.
At the Battle of Hogwarts in the final “Harry Potter” movie, Harry, Ron and Hermione encounter a troll, giant spiders, a werewolf and then Dementors, in that order.
This sequence is thought to sum up or be an homage to the series. In the first movie, the three encounter a troll, in the second there are giant spiders, in the third there is a werewolf and Dementors.
If you heard someone say Kneazle, you’d probably say, “Gesundheit.”
But don’t do that.
In Rowling’s universe, Kneazles are magic cat-like creatures, known for their size and having a tail like a lion. Fans guessed Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, was part Kneazle from its lion-like appearance.
Well, we’re not kitten you. He is. J.K. Rowling confirmed this on Twitter.
It would be brutal and very close, but Crookshanks' Kneazle ancestry would bring him out on top. https://t.co/qLc08eGuMz
This really is the chosen one among “Harry Potter” theories.
Even before Rowling revealed the truth, there was speculation about Dumbledore’s sexual orientation. Readers could probably pick up on hints of it in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows when Rowling explained Dumbledore’s relationship with Grindelwald, but for a while nothing was confirmed.
Then, in 2007, the author revealed you were right all along. Yes, Dumbledore is gay.
Ten points to people who read way too much into things! 
Not every theory can be like a seeker in Quidditch and get all the glory, but you still need Keepers, too.
From the movies and books, we know Horcruxes are bad news. Just wearing the locket makes Ron a real stinker.
(Why you gotta be a stinker, Ron?)
Some believe the Dursleys were so lousy to Harry because he was a Horcrux, and they had to live with him. If you think about it, it is weird that the Dursleys took Harry in. They didn’t have to, and, as Dorkly points out, that’s a serious act of kindness. Why are they so terrible to him?
On the other hand, the Dursleys seemed to always have a strained relationship with the Potters. They were considered “unDursleyish.”
He Who Must Not Be Named wasn’t just into eating unicorns. The dude ate people, too.
The elaborate theory from Reddit user sirlionel13 first explains that Voldemort didn’t directly murder all the victims he used to make Horcruxes. The Basilisk killed Myrtle. But wait, Horcruxes require murder to be made, right? 
The Redditor suggests cannibalism is required to make a Horcrux. This would let Voldemort link himself to Myrtle even though he wasn’t the one who directly killed her. 
As evidence, the Redditor points out that cannibalism is seen throughout history as a way of gaining strength. For those griping that Voldemort didn’t eat Lily Potter, remember that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, not one intentionally made.
Rowling hasn’t publicly revealed the exact process to make a Horcrux, but reportedly said her editor threw up after hearing it. (It sounds like the process is nauseating, but we can’t rule out that the editor could’ve had a stomach flu at the time.)
This takes a literal interpretation of Professor Trelawney’s prophecy. 
Either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives...
Because Harry and Voldemort supposedly had to die at the hand of each other, and Voldemort crumbled away into a million pieces at the end of the movies, it looks like Harry Potter could be immortal.
He’s now The Boy Who Lived ... Forever.
OK, forget that immortal nonsense. This comes down to the rule that to destroy a Horcrux, you have to destroy the container.
Harry was the container for part of Voldemort’s soul. For the soul to be destroyed, Potter supposedly had to die.
The theory says Potter came back, not because Voldemort had somehow tethered the two of them together, but because Potter was the Master of Death, being the rightful owner of all the Deathly Hallows.
Yeah, Dumbledore kind of contradicts this theory in Deathly Hallows, telling Potter he didn’t die. But we say he’s full of Hogwarts hogwash. He possibly said that so Harry didn’t know he was the Master of Death. That could go to someone’s head.
According to Redditor n-d-j, “Voldemort doesn’t have any hair because otherwise people could use the Polyjuice Potion to transform into him.”
Sure, that could be the reason, but we’d also like to add that the hairlessness could be so he doesn’t get strands stuck in the shower drain. Both are equally frightening.
In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, there’s a moment when 12 people are seated around a table for dinner. Professor Trelawney comes and Dumbledore rises to offer a chair.
“Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!” said Dumbledore, standing up.
She freaks out, saying when 13 people dine together the first to rise will die.
Tumblr points out that there probably already were 13 people at the table, since Ron likely had Scabbers, aka Wormtail, in his pocket. By standing to offer a seat, Dumbledore may have sealed his fate.
The 13 eating together rule supposedly predicted Sirius and Lupin’s deaths, too. 
Throughout the series, you probably noticed that not all Gryffindors really seem like Gryffindors. Neville doesn’t seem very brave at times, and Hermione’s intellect makes her a perfect Ravenclaw. 
Tumblr user claudthecat thinks this is because you get into Gryffindor by asking. We’ve already seen Harry ask to be in Gryffindor, and, yeah, why is Hermione there? Either you get into the House by asking, or the Sorting Hat needs to sort out its priorities.
Some fans have noticed that Harry Potter’s class size seems unusually small, and the cause might be right in front of our faces.
Whether it’s because parents didn’t want to conceive during Voldemort’s reign or Death Eaters killed the families that would be sending kids to school, if Harry’s class really is extra small, He Who Must Not Be Named is likely the reason.
Tumblr user marauders4evr explains: 
Unless you’re repotting mandrakes, Neville probably isn’t your go-to wizard for magical purposes. That may simply be because he had the wrong wand.
Neville, who had been using his dad’s wand, gets a new wand after the old one breaks during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. (Remember, the wand is supposed to choose the wizard.) After getting a new wand, he seemingly goes on to be a badass, kill Nagini and pose in his underwear in real life.
A "regram" (is that what they call it?) from the one and only @josephsinclair. That boy got mad skillz with the camera.
A post shared by Matthew Lewis (@mattdavelewis) on Jul 22, 2015 at 3:42am PDT
Neville doesn’t need a Remembrall to remind him to do crunches.
The theory, which you can read on Quora, states that a cat the Potters had is actually Crookshanks. If true, it could be the reason the cat goes after Scabbers, recognizing him as Peter Pettigrew. 
The evidence comes from a letter written by Lily Potter that Harry reads in Deathly Hallows. In the letter, Lily mentions the family had a cat. Hermione bought her cat in Prisoner of Azkaban from someone who said the cat had been around the shop for a while and nobody wanted him. 
It’s not purrrfect, but there’s evidence these cats could be the same.
Quora thinks the centaurs knew Harry and Voldemort would face off in the forest.
After Harry gets saved from Voldemort by the centaur Firenze in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, it reads:
“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?”
Centaurs are pros at reading the stars and predicting the future, so, yeah, this is a possibility.
Just like that Nelly song says, “It was only just a dream.”
Though it’s a lame possibility, there is a chance that Harry Potter actually hallucinated everything that happened in the books to get away from his horrible life with the Dursleys.
Rowling herself has acknowledged that this idea had been suggested to her before. At the time, she didn’t outright deny it. She just said she heard it. 
While making up their Divination homework in Goblet of Fire, Harry and Ron may have predicted what happens in the Triwizard Tournament.
The passage reads:
“Okay...on Monday, I will be in danger of ― er ― burns.””Yeah, you will be,” said Ron darkly, “we’re seeing the skrewts again on Monday. Okay, Tuesday, I’ll... erm... ””Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was flicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas.”Good one,” said Ron, copying it down. “Because of... erm... Mercury. Why don’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend?””Yeah... cool... ” said Harry, scribbling it down, “because... Venus is in the twelfth house.””And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worst in a fight.”
Tumblr user thehpfacts explains:
When Harry and Ron begin making up predictions in their Divination homework in “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” they happen to predict, exactly, the dangers that await Harry in the Triwizard tournament: first that he will be “in danger of burns” (the first trial of overcoming a dragon); next that he will “lose a treasured possession” (Ron, his best friend, whom he will have to recover from the merpeople) and Ron says that he’ll drown (he’s submerged in the Black Lake); then get “Stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend” (his D.A.D.A. Professor); and finally “come off worse in a fight” (clearly, his duel with Lord Voldemort in the Little Hangleton Graveyard).
In the books, it seems like Dementors affect Harry more than your average Hogwarts student. This may be because Harry has part of Voldermort’s soul in him, according to Reddit. The more soul, the better for Dementors.
Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Marvin Gaye would be in trouble. 
Did Rowling secretly warn us of Sirius’ death?
While the group is heading to visit Mr. Weasley in St. Mungo’s during Order of the Phoenix, we read:
They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the Creature-Induced Injuries corridor, where the second door on the right bore the words: ‘Dangerous’ Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites. 
According to some, and apparently first posted on Muggle.net, this was a warning about Sirius Black’s upcoming death:
If you put these words on a sign, they would read: Creature-Induced Injuries. Dangerous Dai Llewellyn Ward Serious Bites Take the first word of each of these and what do you get get? Creature Dangerous Dai Serious? No – Kreacher dangerous, Die Sirius…
Not everyone’s buying it. Some Reddit users disagree, bluntly saying, “That seems incredibly far-fetched and definitely not intentional.” 
It seems like a bunch of B.S. when Dumbledore gives Neville 10 last-second points for standing up to his friends in “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” The points win the House Cup for Gryffindor, which is totally stupid. But perhaps it wasn’t such a rip off after all.
A Quora user suggests Neville got the points because Dumbledore sincerely knows what it’s like to stand up to friends, needing to face off against his friend/love, Grindelwald.
The first question Snape asks Harry Potter is, “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
Thanks to overly obsessed fans, it seems this question may have given away Snape’s big secret, his love for Lily Potter. Tumblr user tomhiddles explains it actually has a secret meaning:
According to Victorian Flower Language, asphodel is a type of lily meaning ‘My regrets follow you to the grave’ and wormwood means ‘absence’ and also typically symbolized bitter sorrow. If you combined that, it meant ‘I bitterly regret Lily’s death’.
Of course, Harry wouldn’t know that. We’re not even sure if Rowling knows it, since she hasn’t confirmed or denied.
As much as we’d wish some of these theories were true, sometimes you have to admit they’re “riddikulus”!
This theory is based off physical descriptions in the books and the fact that Ron and Dumbledore seem to have little contact with each other throughout the series. Because of this, some people believe that Ron and Dumbledore are the same person. Dumbledore has just time traveled to help Harry in the fight against Voldemort.
Rowling says, “Nah.”
Yes, “Harry Potter” is real and J.K. Rowling is secretly Rita Skeeter trying to expose the magical world to Muggles. Unfortunately for Rita/Rowling, according to the theory, we all believe it’s fiction. No worries. She gets lots of money and lives happily ever after, anyway.
There’s also an idea floating around that Rowling created the seven books as her own seven Horcruxes. We can clump these theories together since they both involve “Harry Potter” being real.
All we can say is: It better not be, or someone owes us some Hogwarts letters.
From physical descriptions in the books and some peculiar activities, the theory popped up that Draco is secretly a werewolf. Furthermore, he was turned into a werewolf as punishment for his father’s failings. (Way to go, Lucius.)
Snape, on the other hand, is a vampire. This mostly comes down to Snape being described as having a pale complexion, sometimes being compared to a bat and just being a creepy dude.
Unfortunately, Rowling is the silver bullet for these theories.
I've never seen that one before. Draco definitely isn't a werewolf (and Snape's not a vampire). https://t.co/TSliADJvyi
Are wizards so heavily regulated because Muggles deemed it necessary?
Reddit speculates that Muggles won a war or conflict against the wizards and set up the Ministry of Magic to further suppress wizardkind.
As evidence, the theory shows how wizards of the past, such as the Peverells (on whom “The Tale of the Three Brothers” is based), seemed to be much stronger than wizards in present time.
It’s notable that wizards appear to be heavily regulated to the point where there’s even a registry for Animagi. Because of this, it’s suggested that Muggles were secretly behind the creation of the Ministry to cause the decline of magic and make wizards think they were doing it to themselves.
Some think that Arthur Weasley’s deep disdain for the Malfoys is because he was once placed under the Imperius curse. 
It’s a lot of speculation, but it might explain why Arthur seems to have trouble rising in the Ministry ranks (since he would’ve done terrible stuff while under the influence of the curse) and why he hates Lucius Malfoy so much.
Malfoy claimed to have been under the curse when Voldemort was first in power. He was obviously a phony baloney. If Arthur was actually put under the curse, he has a right to hold a grudge. 
Redditor colmshan1990 explains that Ginny gave Harry a love potion, and that’s why he all of a sudden is attracted to her.

The evidence is that Harry didn’t really notice Ginny much until Half-Blood Prince. Then, all of a sudden, it’s see ya later, Cho Chang.
You might say, “Hey, that’s just part of growing up.” But the Redditor disagrees.
Potions, specifically love potions, keep coming up in Half-Blood Prince, the book in which Harry really notices Ginny. The Redditor claims this is a hint that Ginny gave a potion to our boy, Harry.
Of all the questions in the Potterverse, one of the most baffling is, “Why the heck did Dumbledore hire Gilderoy Lockhart?”
The hypotheses are that, since the position was jinxed, there weren’t many applicants. Some speculate on Quora that Dumbledore hired Lockhart because he knew his fraud would be exposed.
This is a major stretch, but it comes down to fans wanting there to be some sort of traitor reveal. The first books in the series all had reveals, such as Professor Quirrell being evil or Tom Riddle secretly being Voldemort.
The later books were lacking these.
Evidence that McGonagall is evil includes her comment about Muggles not being “completely” stupid and her supposed disregard for Harry Potter’s safety. 
It’s not a lot, but that’s more than enough for a theory.
Rowling has stated that she based the killing curse, Avada Kedavra, on Abracadabra, which would explain why the words sound similar.
But that’s not good enough for theorists.
Reddit users suggest that the two words sound similar because of the dark past between wizards and Muggles. According to the theory, Abracadabra was adopted into Muggle language after conflicts between the two groups. Some speculate that Muggles say Abracadabra to bastardize the killing curse and taunt wizards.
This theory/’ship relies on a lot of quotes taken out of context and prolonged gazes between Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.
Evidence includes phrases from Order of the Phoenix, such as, “Lupin’s eyes were fixed on Sirius,” and, “Looking away from Sirius at last.”
Sure, Lupin married Tonks, but why let that get between true love?
Huff and puff ... erm ... Hufflepuff is theorized to be the stoner house of Hogwarts. Redditor JusAHomie explains:
Hufflepuff: - Kings of HERBology - LIVED next to the kitchen - Most of them are considered the laid back, relatively Humble types compared to other houses.
It doesn’t get more solid than that.
During flying lessons, Neville’s broomstick flies off erratically, kind of like how Potter’s did during a Quidditch match.
Harry’s plight was caused by Professor Quirrell, and Neville happens to be the other possible “Chosen One,” so who’s to say Quirrell wasn’t trying to take out Neville, too?
The predominant evidence is that the movie version of Mary Poppins is English and uses magic. 
This inspired Redditor BiggsyBig to realize that Mary must’ve been a Ministry employee who was evaluating Muggle-born wizards, and Bert was obviously a squib who was aware of the magical world. 
Unfortunately, Mary was killed in the first rise of Voldemort for being so fond of Muggles. No spoonful of sugar could make that revelation easy to swallow.
Apparently, some time after the death of Fred, George Weasley took his body altering confections to his own sweets factory and became Willy Wonka, according to TVTropes.
As we see in the movies, Wonka also has a fondness for sweets that’ll change the way someone looks, and magic would explain Wonka’s crazy inventions. 
Earlier this year, Redditor DER_GOTTKAISER blew our minds by suggesting that Snape didn’t die in “Harry Potter.” The evidence includes Snape not showing up as a ghost before Harry faced Voldemort in the woods, and the fact that Snape’s body wasn’t discussed or seen when other bodies were laid out in the movies.
The Redditor says Snape, being a potions master and serving as a double agent, would’ve been prepared for a Nagini attack and took an antidote. Nagini just paralyzed him, and Snape later woke up and lived happily ever after far, far away from Harry Potter.
Is it wishful thinking? Yeah. Do we buy it after all this time? Always.
Got a Harry Potter theory? Send us an owl! Haha, just kidding. But, Sirius-ly, let us know.
From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories.

A lawsuit filed on Friday accuses the renowned Washington glass artist Dale Chihuly of passing off the work of another man as his own for 15 years.
The suit, filed by the lawyers of Michael Moi in King County Superior Court and the U.S. District Court for Western Washington, claims the prolific decorator of botanical gardens has been involved in a “myriad of clandestine painting sessions” with Moi, but has never compensated him or given him credit for his efforts, despite the artist’s promises otherwise.
“The truth behind the creation of his paintings has been intentionally hidden,” Moi claims.
In a press release sent to HuffPost, Chihuly’s camp strongly refutes Moi’s claims, dubbing the lawsuit “baseless.” 
The statement, sent on Friday from Chihuly’s studio headquarters in Seattle, claims the studio hired Moi as handyman for “various cleaning, repairing and small construction projects over the years.”
Moi “also alleges possession of Chihuly’s private documents, including medical papers and personal letters, that would be ‘substantively uncomfortable’ if released to the public,” the statement adds. In February, the statement continues, Moi asked for $21 million, “threatening to publicly file a lawsuit if his demand for money was not met. Earlier this month, when Chihuly had not agreed to pay him, Moi served Chihuly’s legal counsel with a state court complaint.”
Chihuly Inc. asserts that it has “allowed” Moi’s claims to go public “rather than accede to Mr. Moi’s ultimatum,” characterizing the demands as “nothing more than an ugly and reprehensible display of opportunism and exploitation” motivated by a desire to disclose private information, specifically about Chihuly’s mental health, a topic of a recent Associated Press interview.
Chihuly told the AP he has been dealing with bouts of depression since his 20s, and, at 75 years old, suffers from bipolar disorder. “I’m usually either up or down,” he said. “I don’t have neutral very much. When I’m up I’m usually working on several projects. A lot of times it’s about a six-month period. When I’m down, I kind of go in hibernation.”
Moi’s lawsuit demands credit for joint work ― “a large volume of paintings” he says were created at Chihuly’s Boathouse in Washington, some involving blow torches and plexiglass ― as well as the revenues derived from their sale.
Moi never held the position of painting assistant, the company counters, while acknowledging that Chihuly does not work alone ― he uses studio assistants to “execute his vision,” particularly his large, glass-blown sculptures that often resemble alien sea creatures or Seussian shrubbery. (A few anonymous reviewers of Chihuly Studio on Glassdoor claim to have experienced a less-than-ideal working environment.)
Chihuly has been a part of court cases concerning his art before. In 2006, he sued two fellow glass-blowers, one of whom was a longtime collaborator, for copyright infringement, claiming they had purposefully mimicked his signature style. (The case against one of them, Bryan Rubino, was settled.)
Chihuly’s work is currently on view in shows at the New York Botanical Garden, as well as Arkansas’ Crystal Bridges museum. It’s also included in more permanent displays in venues across the country.
As much as we love J.K. Rowling, there are a lot of things that don’t make sense in the “Harry Potter” series.
For example, there’s no discussion of kids taking subjects like math and science. If Muggles have to suffer through algebra, wizard kids should, too. And why didn’t Voldemort just break Harry Potter’s glasses or something? So many plot holes. So little time.
Beyond these little annoyances, one glaring plot hole remains the chosen one: Why didn’t Fred and George notice Peter Pettigrew sleeping in Ron’s bed on the Marauder’s Map?
The Weasley twins had the map, which is able to show the location of each person in Hogwarts, for years before they gave it to Harry. During all that time, wouldn’t they have noticed Ron hanging out with a guy named Peter Pettigrew, who was really an Animagus disguised as Ron’s rat, Scabbers?
We first posed the question to Rupert Grint, who said he didn’t know for sure but added, “That’s a good point,” after we suggested that Ron was technically going to bed with Pettigrew every night.
Thankfully, Oliver Phelps, who played George in the movies, came to the rescue. 
“Maybe it’s a boo in the family that no one talks of. ‘Who’s this Peter bloke?’” said Phelps. He later added, “Maybe it was an unspoken word in the Weasley’s family,” insinuating, perhaps, that Fred and George didn’t want to press Ron on a relationship he wasn’t yet comfortable talking about. Sure, Ron was 11 years old when he first had brought Scabbers/Peter to Hogwarts, but maybe the relationship wasn’t romantic. 
Phelps suggested that the family was probably surprised when Ron and Hermione got together.
“When it came out that he got with Hermione, they were like, ‘Oh.’” said Phelps.
The actor admitted he didn’t know for sure, but Phelps’ answer is as good as anyone’s since he’s basically an authority on the Weasleys. Phelps and his brother James, who played Fred Weasley, apparently even know secrets about their characters’ backgrounds from J.K. Rowling, but he wouldn’t reveal them unless it was already out there.
“It was kind of family-based, from her side of it” was all we could get out of him.
So as far as the plot hole goes, it looks like the Weasleys just let Ron do his own thing.
Phelps has to be used to questions like this. Despite getting involved in various charities such as WellChild, Help Harry Help Others and Teenage Cancer Trust and working on other projects, like a potential new TV show with his brother, “Harry Potter” still follows him around every day.
What was it like when the movies ended? Are you working on things with your brother or separately?
I remember the day we wrapped. It really felt like we were trapezing, and they pulled the safety net because we’d always had that balance. We could always go back to the next film, and it’s only subsequently since that I realized what a big thing it is. We were always pretty impressed to be part of it, but it’s a bit weird like, “Oh, what? Not every film is $150 million budget?” You know what I mean? Those sort of things. So it’s certainly been an eye-opener doing it the other way around, I suppose, to what conventional actors do. But since [then] we’ve been very lucky to get in the room with people and talk and meet.
James and I have been doing a few things separately, but I think we both realized that our niche is together in some aspects of it, so we’ve got some other projects of our own we’ll be working on, which has been, again, a new side of it, learning different things. We got a show we’re trying to get off the ground at the moment, so that’s been quite cool.
What’s the show going to be?
It’s still under wraps to a point. I can say it’s a travel documentary show, so the premise is we go to a certain city and we do two sides of the same city.
That actually sounds great. So you two never opened a joke shop?
No, but every time I ever go into Hamleys [Toy Shop] in London, I get a funny look. It’s one of those things, I think, because we are known as pranksters and everything else like that. We never quite went that way, but the good thing about being those characters is that people find us very approachable, which is brilliant. It’s nice when you’re out and about and some people recognize us, and they’ll take a second because the hair is different.
Do people recognize you all the time? Or only when you’re together?
If we’re both together, people know straight away where they recognize us from. I’d say it happens daily.
What’s a memory you have that fans don’t know about?
I remember instantly, the first time we did the read-through. For me, that was one of the funniest bits to sit there and think, “Wow, we’re actually doing this.” That was cool. In terms of stuff you don’t realize, there’s just lots of stuff. Playing football in the Great Hall, which I’m sure Warner Bros. wouldn’t like me talking about. Playing cricket on Privet Drive and things like that.
Did you ever interact with J. K. Rowling on set?
She was probably the most intimidating person I’ve ever met in my life, not by any fault of her own, just by ― she made everything that we were doing. I remember we were in Rupert’s dressing room on one of the later films, and she came in and totally blindsided all of us. I think we were doing something silly, like, we were playing darts but with a crossbow or something not very mature. And she explained where the twins characters came from and where their influences are and stuff like that. I didn’t want to rock the boat too much and ask, “Well, what do they do afterwards ... what does one of them do afterwards?” But it was quite interesting learning the backstories and where the characters came from.
Did you ever hear you weren’t supposed to say the T in Voldemort? It’s supposedly pronounced “Voldemor.”
Oh, really?
Yeah. Rowling revealed that. It was a big thing for days.
No. Wow. Probably could’ve done with knowing that while we were filming it. [Laughs.]
One of my favorite scenes of you was when you caught Ginny and Harry and said, “Morning.”
It was awkward as hell to do, but I remember for some reason the night before I was watching Looney Tunes and you’ve got Bugs Bunny walking around trying to be quiet, so if you watch that scene I pretty much do an over-exaggerated, long, quiet step in the background just because I thought that made it a bit more obvious that he’s goofing about. And the way I said, “Morning,” that comes from my parents, on the phone always speaking like, “Hello, morning.” To me, it made a bit more sense to do it like than to make it more awkward. But it’s kind of taken on a life of itself now.
There are a bunch of Harry Potter theories. One is that George became Willy Wonka.
Maybe. I supposed he’d stick with the entrepreneurship. I thought maybe Ron would come to work with him but he’d be the all-seeing guy. Maybe he would go a little bit mad as Willy Wonka did, to a point. James often talked about maybe Fred became a ghost, like he’d always be jumping out at people or stopping people from stealing in the shop or something like that.
Ever do the switcheroo with each other?
We did on the second film in a long shot rehearsal. I actually read somewhere that we got caught and they had to reshoot the whole film, which I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t. And we were playing identical twins, so it probably wouldn’t have made much difference.
Do you have a lifetime entrance to Harry Potter World?
I think so. I mean, they did say that they would. I wanted a gold card they give you at Disneyland to get in. They said, “Well, we don’t do that at Universal. Just call the office, and they’ll get you in.”
I want a gold card to show you. [Laughs] To be fair to the guys, they’ve always been awesome when we’ve been down, and they’ve had close friends in as well.
From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories.

Hillary Clinton has become a role model to countless young girls and women thanks to her glass-ceiling-busting career, including her run for president as a major-party nominee. Her own role model? Well, she wears sweater sets, fights crime and is completely fictional.
Clinton is already one of the most prominent fans of teen gumshoe Nancy Drew, the iconic heroine of a mystery franchise dating back to the 1930s. During a conversation with author Cheryl Strayed at BookExpo 2017 on Thursday evening, she opened up about her childhood fondness for the classic series. 
“I read a lot of books when I was growing up, but that had a big impact on me, because she was, dare I say, a little bit of a role model,” said Clinton. “She just seemed like such a go-getter and really smart and brave [....] She was taking care of the house, she was going to school, she was solving mysteries.”
To readers today, Nancy Drew might seem a bit prim and conventional; the only child of a widowed attorney, she runs the household from a young age. She always appears to be dressed stylishly, with not a strawberry-blonde hair out of place. When the series first launched, however, it filled a gap in the market that most publishers had simply ignored: Despite numerous mystery novels starring and promoted to boys, there were none geared toward girls. Media coverage at the time professed bafflement that there was even demand for a girl sleuth.
“How [Nancy Drew] crashed a Valhalla that had been rigidly restricted to the male of her species is a mystery even to her publishers,” wrote a Fortune analyst in 1934. “Nancy Drew tops even Bomba, the most popular of modern male heroes.”
With so many accomplished and ambitious women among the fans of the series, the reason seems clear: Young girls were just as interested in adventure as their male counterparts, they just needed to see that it could be an option for women.
The series evolved over time, through different editors and ghostwriters, to slowly shape the idea of Nancy we have today. The original sleuth, sketched by ghostwriter Mildred Wirt Benson, was risk-taking, outspoken, sometimes even sarcastic, and resistant to authority. The series later underwent a makeover that both expunged certain racially problematic notes and remade Nancy into a model of demure girlishness. It’s pretty clear which Nancy inspired Clinton, who specified that she “liked the earlier ones better than the later ones.”
Though she’s come a long way since her days of devouring “every Nancy Drew book,” she admits that one thing hasn’t changed: Her love for mystery novels. “I’m a very devoted mystery reader,” she said. Maureen Corrigan pointed out during the campaign that Clinton seems particularly devoted to reading domestic mysteries by and about women ― much like Nancy Drew. At BookExpo, she named several women authors, including Jacqueline Winspear and Louise Penny, as particular favorites. 
Clinton, who said she often turns to books for “total distraction,” hinted that escaping into these page-turners has been one post-election relaxation strategy. 
“I’ve read a lot of mysteries,” she said wryly, “and it was very comforting, because it was someone else’s problem.”

More so than a collection of stories, the “Harry Potter” series can be characterized by its most devoted fans as a hobby, or a lifestyle. The increasingly voluminous installments were hefty enough to get lost in, and they managed to create not only a convincing world, but lovable characters, too.
It’s hard to imagine a world in which the books (and films, and video games, and personality quizzes) might not have been published. But, according to J.K. Rowling’s first agent Christopher Little, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was not an easy sell. 
Little told HuffPost over email that Rowling selected him as her agent in part due to his name, which she liked. He was, in turn, enamored of her story, believing after reading it that it was ready to be sent out to publishers, requiring few big changes. (The rules of Quidditch, however, were altered.)
Below, Little describes the experience of trying to sell a book he believed in ― in spite of publishers’ protestations that it was too long or too “exclusive.”
“When I received the submission from Joanne (as she was known at the time) Rowling, it just came in as an unsolicited submission (of the first three chapters) and was picked up by our then office manager who was looking through the slush pile,” he said. “She liked it and bought it to my attention. Once I read it, I had no reservations whatsoever and in fact felt very excited about it. 
“It was clearly presented as a fully realized world […] I don’t think I recall reading anything so immersive since The Lord of the Rings many years earlier. We quickly wrote back to Jo asking to see the rest of the manuscript as soon as I had finished those initial chapters.”
“The suggestion to use initials instead of J.K. Rowling’s given name, Joanne, came from discussion with Bloomsbury. It’s notoriously harder to get boys to read in comparison with girls, as many parents will know, and an author being obviously female was more likely to be off-putting to boys. Joanne selected the ‘K’ after her paternal grandmother.”
“There were very minor differences in the full manuscript that was received and that which was sent to the publishers — I do recall that the Quidditch rules were tweaked a bit!”
 “Over a period of nigh on a year, the book was turned down by more or less every major publishing house in the U.K. Various reasons were given including the story being too long, the fact that a story set in a children’s boarding school might feel too ‘exclusive’ to many readers, etc.
“When I first spoke to Barry Cunningham, who had at that time recently been hired to run the new children’s department at Bloomsbury Publishing, the book was accepted and an offer was made. He saw the same potential as I did ― perhaps as we both came from a background other than publishing originally, so arguably thought slightly less conventionally and considered this well-characterized, unique story as one that clearly should be published despite such considerations.”

You might know Canadian illustrator Jillian Tamaki for This One Summer, her 2014 collaboration with cousin Mariko Tamaki that artfully chronicled a formative season between two friends and earned her a Caldecott Honor award. Now, the illustrator returns with a new book that’s all her own.
Boundless, from Drawn & Quarterly, is a series of graphic stories, some more rooted in narrative structure than others. Tamaki’s imagined scenarios — in one, a narrator becomes over-invested in the life of a bizarre Facebook mirror; in another, a lengthy cult internet recording called “Sex Coven” sparks a murky trend of teens gathering in the woods — are finely drawn, part of a world that feels eerily unfamiliar and recognizable at once. There are benchmarks of our modern lives, like short-lived television that earns a fandom online, and then Tamaki twists it into something bizarre: that television show is, in fact, a sitcom porno.
This treatment is also given to notions of femininity. In one story, a character seems to be shrinking in an attractive way. One acquaintance asks her if she’s lost weight. Her shrinking doesn’t stop, however, and soon she’s unable to work and requires tiny clothes hand-sewn by her sister, before she eventually grows smaller than what is recognizable to the eye. In another, a mostly disembodied narrator extolls the virtues of a multi-level marketing beauty product.
Bedbugs, too, and the strain the invasive creatures can put on a relationship, feel relatively modern, and Tamaki handles this deftly. In “Bedbug,” she tells the story of a couple sorting through their things, deciding which to keep for fumigation and which to toss after an infestation. The quick intimacy she creates for the reader allows you to feel the full weight of the stresses and secrets that unfurl.
Read an excerpt below:
Boundless is now available from Drawn & Quarterly.

When J.R.R. Tolkien returned from the Battle of the Somme, he set out to write a story that might’ve lifted his spirits. The resulting fantastical fable ― Beren and Lúthien ― would take on several revisions and iterations before it would become a central story in The Silmarillion.
Today, a version of the story edited by Tolkien’s son Christopher goes on sale. In it, the original is kept intact, published alongside revisions and marginalia.
Beren and Lúthien will sound familiar to Tolkien fans ― even those who haven’t read The Silmarillion. Like Aragorn and Arwen in The Lord of the Rings, Beren and Lúthien are star-crossed lovers who must reconcile one huge difference that stands between them: Beren is a man, and Lúthien is an immortal elf. Lúthien’s father disapproves of Beren, and tasks him with an impossible challenge to win his daughter’s hand.
According to BBC News, the story was inspired in part by Tolkien’s wife, Edith. “On a walk in an East Yorkshire wood Tolkien’s wife Edith danced in a glade filled with white flowers, which became the key scene in Beren and Lúthien,” Tolkien specialist John Garth told the outlet. The names Beren and Lúthien are also engraved on the couple’s shared headstone.
This isn’t the only Tolkien story to be revised, updated and re-released recently. In 2015, The Story of Kullervo ― an unfinished work by the author ― was published along with ancillary materials.
So, for those who’ve read The Silmarillion from cover to cover, there’s plenty more of Tolkien’s world to explore.

You’ve probably read the stats: books by women are being reviewed more and more by prestigious outlets, but gender equity in the literary world has yet to be achieved. And, books by women are far less likely to win major awards.
Organizations such as VIDA work to hold reviews and awards committees accountable for not only their coverage of women, but of all kinds of women. However, they tend to focus on the so-called literary genre. So, how do women in other genres — science fiction, mystery, street lit, women’s lit — fare?
Ahead of a panel at the Bay Area Book Festival centered on “Feminist Activism Through Popular Fiction,” authors Meg Elison, Aya de Leon and Kate Raphael weighed in on the challenges they face as women writing in their respective genres. Raphael, an activist who writes mystery books, says there’s an active feminist community among her fellow mystery writers. But, she says she struggles to publish stories about women characters who indulge in the same antics as their noir-ish male counterparts.
Meanwhile, Elison and de Leon ― a dystopian writer and a street lit writer, respectively ― both say there is a dearth of the types of stories they want to tell, stories about the reality of women’s struggles, amid an action-centered plot. Below, they discuss the specific road blocks that women who write popular fiction face:
Meg Elison, author of The Book of the Unnamed Midwife: I write speculative fiction, which comes under the big umbrella of science fiction. My first books are post-apocalyptic stories. Science fiction was invented by a woman, and most of my favorite writers in the genre are women. Post-apocalyptic fiction, however, is crazily unbalanced. Most of the stories that take place after the end of the world are by men, about men and written for men.
I read hundreds of books in the genre where women were irrelevant, used as plot devices and barely verbal. They almost never needed birth control and they definitely never needed tampons. I realized that the story that I wanted to read really hadn’t been written yet: What if the apocalypse was very asymmetrical? What if it (like everything else) was harder on women and children than it was on men?
Aya de Leon, author of the Justice Hustlers series: My Justice Hustlers series mixes elements of women’s fiction, street lit and erotic romance. They are politically charged tales of labor organizing, women’s health care and wealth redistribution that center on the planning and execution of multimillion dollar heists. 
Street lit is traditionally male-dominated, and — as in most parts of the literary industry — male gatekeepers and audiences tend to ignore women’s writing. Every genre has its trademark cover art imagery. They function like signals to genre audiences: This is your type of book. The symbols of urban fiction are guns, money, jewelry and urban landscapes. While male cover models are sometimes shirtless, they are generally heavily muscled and often armed. Typically, women’s book covers in the genre skew toward romance tropes, rather than action.
In order to be consistent with other books in the imprint, my novel covers have a single young woman of color looking sexy in a sort of “come hither” way. A more accurate representation of my series would be a sexy, multi-racial group of armed women in the midst of a heist operation. A male writer wouldn’t have the same problem, because the mainstream images of male strength and sexiness are the same: power is sexy and power is power.
Kate Raphael, author of Murder Under the Bridge: I write mysteries, and women actually make up over 50 percent of published mystery and crime fiction writers, but as Sisters in Crime has documented, get fewer than 50 percent of reviews and far fewer in the most prestigious outlets. There is also a narrower range of characters that are acceptable for women in crime fiction. An agent rejected my book because my main character, a Palestinian policewoman, disobeyed her boss. So many mysteries involve a male detective pursuing an investigation after he’s been ordered not to, having his badge and gun confiscated, that it’s a cliché. 
Elison: The “strong female lead” is just another trope. Too often, it means a stereotypical cool girl who eschews femininity to be one of the guys and wield weapons. Too often she carries her own internalized misogyny, or she’s just a regulation hot chick who happens to know kung fu.
It’s insufficient because the movement for the correct representation of the wild spectrum of human gender and sexuality is just getting started. We’re just staring to see tender boys in films like “Moonlight,” or fully realized tough women in books like Chuck Wendig’s Atlanta Burns. We’re just now seeing realistic trans and nonbinary characters, asexual characters and so many more. Ripley in a mecha suit is great, but not enough. A disabled Furiosa is a wonderful start, but it’s got to keep rolling.
De Leon: Pop culture stories with a strong female lead are an important component of feminism, especially in a media world that skews so strongly toward men: Male writers of books, and male protagonists on-screen with male creators behind the scenes. But Andi Zeisler’s recent book, We Were Feminists Once, reminds us that the ultimate goal of feminism isn’t to applaud an individual woman being “empowered,” but about creating gender equality for all women. I am most excited about the feminist potential of stories that have a broader scope of what they envision as far as interrupting and ultimately ending sexism in the world.
Raphael: So many of the strong female leads are still very stereotyped. There’s still an expectation that a woman can be beautiful, fashionable, f**kable, vulnerable, not shrill and at the same time be kickass. Of course some women are all those things, but many aren’t. The real-life struggles of women are often oversimplified. Like, who’s doing the childcare? And how does the driven woman cop or spy or agent or lawyer feel about leaving her kids to go running off after the murderer at all hours? If she’s heterosexual, is her husband resentful, and if so, what does she do about it? I try to introduce those dilemmas in my books. In a feminist novel, women should see characters like themselves ― women of different races and cultures, different body types, dykes, mothers, single women, poor women and hopefully not in a United Colors of Benetton way, but in the messy, complex way that exists in the real world. 
Elison: Absolutely, unequivocally, yes. There is no part of my outlook or my work that is not shaped by my experience as a woman, and my belief that we are entitled to equality and almost always denied it. Writers and artists will often try to dodge or soften this label, claiming their work is for everybody, that it’s just a story about people. My work is for everybody who agrees that women are people. That isn’t too much to ask.
De Leon: Definitely. I’m not interested in turning readers on or off with the feminist label. I’m interested in embodying feminist values.
Raphael: Feminism is really core to who I am so I can’t conceive of not writing a feminist book. 
Elison: The story must come first and definitely did for me. Wrapping a story around your politics invariably turns out a monstrosity like Atlas Shrugged, where somebody just rants for 40 pages about your philosophy. Nobody is fooled. Letting your life and your truth come through in a story without fear cannot help but be built partly of your own politics. My stories contain myself, my sexuality, my identity. Those things are political; they do not come apart. If a writer finds that their politics work against their story, it is likely because there is some part of themselves about which they cannot or will not tell the truth.
De Leon: I was really interested in reaching beyond the traditional feminist audience. That’s why I wrote a book that has elements of chick lit and romance. I wanted to mainstream subversive political ideas by serving them in the forms that women have been taught to consume. And I was interested in remixing tropes of romance and chick lit that seemed to conflict with feminism: hunky men, swooning moments, stiletto heels, shopping, competition between women. I wanted to engage all those mainstream appetites, but challenge them, as well.
Raphael: It’s a tough question. Again, the crime genre lends itself to political storytelling because it’s concerned fundamentally with questions of justice and injustice. A good crime story lays bare the power relations in a society ― in my case, in Palestine and Israel. So it was well suited to what I wanted to do. I could never set aside my politics to tell a story, because a radical analysis of social relations is how I view the world. If I didn’t bring in radical politics, and activism, I wouldn’t be telling a true story and certainly not one about Palestine. I just am not interested in apolitical stories, they seem flat and devoid of meaning to me. I can barely stand to read one, so I could definitely not write one.
Elison: I don’t know if “comfortable” is the right word to describe it, but it has always felt right. The obstacles are mostly that people whose opinions don’t matter will shout them at me on the internet. I’m perfectly capable of handling that. I’ve had a lot of thoughtful conversations about my depictions of gender and sexuality, and it’s fascinating to hear different interpretations of my work. But the difference between that conversation and an anonymous all-caps accusation of feminazism is pretty easy to discern. Though I respect the work of authors like Roxane Gay and Lindy West who give of their time and patience to try and educate trolls, I find it a poor investment of both in my case.
De Leon: In the past, I think I was more preachy. I had a harder time writing flawed protagonists. I wanted everyone to be much more honorable, but they weren’t very interesting. […] I hope to bridge some of that with a book that is politically charged but delivers all the feels in the romantic arc, and a good heist plot, as well as upending stereotypes of race, gender, sexuality, gender identity, nationality, and class. Ultimately, that’s what I want to do, whatever the cover or the genre or the shelf in the bookstore.
Raphael: I have no choice because if anyone Googles me, the first hundred things that come up are going to be my activism. I do a feminist radio show, I used to write for feminist and queer newspapers, I was interviewed by the FBI after 9/11 because of my feminist and antiwar organizing, there are stories about me being deported from Israel ― that’s just who I am. For sure, it narrows the market. 

”My work is not within the accepted box,” the late architect Zaha Hadid previously told HuffPost. “Maybe because I am a woman. Also an Arab. There was a certain prejudice about these things.”
Today, that same outsider is being honored with a Google Doodle, one that celebrates her status as a game-changing designer of the contemporary world.
Throughout her life, Hadid spoke openly about the misogyny and racism she encountered as a woman of color working in the world of architecture. As a student at the Architectural Association School in the 1970s, women made up just 6 percent of her field, fellow architect Yasmin Shariff estimated. When Hadid died of a sudden heart attack in 2016, that percentage had jumped to a still-paltry 24 percent. Still, she forged ahead.
Surrounded by men, Hadid’s tenacity was often interpreted as egotism, her drive to be heard seen as a symptom of bad manners. “Who needed a mouthy diva in a world where men got by perfectly nicely, talking politely and shaking hands on the golf course?” The Guardian’s Simon Hattenstone asked, facetiously. This was the unnerving reality faced by a woman who graduated with a degree in mathematics from the American University of Beirut.
“They’re not used to an opinionated woman,” Hadid has said of men in Britain in particular. “They’re scared of women.”
Despite the obstacles, Hadid, born in Baghdad, Iraq, in 1950, rose swiftly to fame. Her professor, the celebrated architect Rem Koolhaas, once described her as “a planet in her own inimitable orbit,” and she’d prove the adage correct. She opened her own architectural firm, Zaha Hadid Architects, in London in 1980. She went on to design a number of recognizable buildings throughout her career: the Guangzhou Opera House, Rome’s MAXXI National Museum of the 21st Century Arts and the London Olympic Aquatic Centre. Her neofuturistic style, heavy on smooth curves and concave shapes, earned her more accolades than most. In 2004, she became the first woman, as well as the first Muslim, to win the prestigious Pritzker Prize, dubbed the “Nobel Prize of architecture.”
“Zaha Hadid was widely regarded to be the greatest female architect in the world,” a representative for her company told HuffPost on the day she died, March 31, 2016, at age 65.
You can explore Hadid’s work more thoroughly over at Google Arts & Culture. In the meantime, check out a few of her notable designs below.

The pilot episode of “Twin Peaks,” which aired in April 1990, begins with an image at once horrific and strangely compelling, disturbing yet deep-down familiar, the image of Laura Palmer’s washed-up dead body, sealed in a plastic bag. Her face is lifeless, her lips a grayish blue, and yet the blonde teenage girl retains her beauty, looking more like a washed up mermaid in need of a warm bath than a corpse that’s been decomposing underwater.
Before we even meet Laura Palmer, and long before we figure out who killed her, we know her type: The Pretty Dead Girl. In an article for Esquire, Anne T. Donahue recently argued that The Pretty Dead Girl trope, at least in pop culture, began with David Lynch’s cult series. However, our cultural obsession with lovely lady corpses probably began centuries earlier. 
Some very early examples of the widespread idolization of beautiful, inanimate women can be found in what are known as “Anatomical Venus” figures, idealized waxen sculptures tucked into glass cases, used in 18th-century Italy to teach doctors, artists and interested citizens about the human form. These figures were less aesthetically bland medical abstractions and more sumptuous, lifelike sculptures of women with golden curls, pearl necklaces and ample breasts ― who happened to have their innards exposed. In an interview with HuffPost, historian Joanna Ebenstein explained that the corresponding figures used to teach male anatomy hardly ever involved skin, let alone other accessories. The female sculptures, however, were painstakingly detailed, even sensual, prompting doctors and students to find pleasure in their dead forms. 
But one need not travel to a niche medical museum in Italy to see the Pretty Dead Girl motif in full view. Simply consider the Disney fairy tales so many young girls grow up with. Three of the original Disney princesses were Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora, the latter otherwise known as Sleeping Beauty. Of the three, two spend the majority of their narrative lives unconscious. Sure, they aren’t dead, but they would have been, had a handsome prince not kissed them back into life. 
In his 1846 “The Philosophy of Composition,” Edgar Allen Poe hammered the point home, asserting “the death then of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.” The theme appears again and again in his poems, most famously in the 1849 poem “Annabel Lee.” 
“And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side / Of my darling — my darling ― my life and my bride, In her sepulchre there by the sea — In her tomb by the sounding sea,” Poe writes. More times than not, when mentioned in the poem, Annabel Lee’s name is preceded by a simple description ― “beautiful.” 
The halls of art history, too, are littered with images of the lovely dead, perhaps none more famous than Sir John Everett Millais’ 19th-century “Ophelia.” The pre-Raphaelite painting depicts Ophelia, the character in Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” who drowns herself after being driven mad by her lover’s violence. She wears a ballgown and clutches a string of flowers ― crow flowers, nettles, daisies and long purples ― her hair tangled up with surrounding weeds and brush.
For Surrealist and pre-Raphaelite artists, hers was an archetypal image of liminal sleep, a trance-like state between life and death, the natural and supernatural. All quite romantic, but, of course, extrapolated from a tale of anguish, mental illness and suicide, dressed up in a flowing gown and tousled red hair. There are countless other iconic portraits of women in various states of deep sleep ― Giorgione’s “Sleeping Venus,” Henry Fuseli’s “The Nightmare,” Sir Frederic Leighton’s “Flaming June,” the list goes on. 
Contemporary photographer Gloria Oyarzabal was horrified by the eerie misogyny embedded in this unseemly obsession, though a part of her was also entranced by the image. She worked through her feelings by drawing images of Ophelia, restoring some feminine agency to the lifeless muse. Eventually, representation was not sufficient. Oyarzabal took to embodying the character herself, documenting the act in a series of nude self-portraits. 
“I picked up my old Mamiya [camera] and got into nature, into places where I could ‘smell’ tension,” Oyarzabal told HuffPost. She tried to imbue her poses with strength, power and discomfort, rather than eternal rest. “It was like screaming silently,” she said. 
Another artist who repeatedly placed herself in the role of a dead woman, challenging anyone who dared look, was the late Cuban-born Ana Mendieta. In art school, Mendieta took to misogynist violence as a subject, blood as a medium, influenced in part by a rape and murder of a female university student that occurred on her campus.
For one piece, Mendieta tied herself to a table and didn’t move for hours, her naked body drenched with cow’s blood. She invited students and faculty to drop by without warning, turning them into witnesses to a “murder.” In a work titled “Clinton Piece, Dead on Street,” Mendieta, lay still in a pool of blood as a classmate stood over her taking photos of the carnage. In “Untitled (Rape Scene)” Mendieta was photographed lying motionless and blood-spattered at various spots across her university’s property.
The artist died in 1985 after falling from the window of her 34th floor apartment. Her husband, artist Carl Andre, was with her at the time; Mendieta was heard screaming “no, no, no, no” just before her body hit the ground. Andre was tried and acquitted for her murder, found not guilty on grounds of reasonable doubt. The defense argued Ana’s death was suicide, and used her haunting artwork to back up the claim. The tragedy was a horrific warning to women who dared to take ownership over images of their own death and destruction 
Of course, not all manifestations of The Pretty Dead Girl are fictional. One of the most notorious true crime cases of all time is the 1996 murder of 6-year-old beauty pageant queen JonBenét Ramsey, six years after “Twin Peaks” debuted. Just this year, Netflix released the documentary “Casting JonBenét,” examining the lasting imprint the grisly killing left on the nation’s collective psyche. 
“It was the imagery associated with it,” the film’s director Kitty Green told HuffPost, “which was all the pageants and crowns and the dress and the feather outfits that she was put in. I think those images were really haunting. So it was almost like this image of this pageant queen who almost seemed to have it all, but whose life went horribly wrong, or horrifically had it taken away from her.” 
Natalee Holloway, Elizabeth Short, Laci Peterson ― all are or were real-life women whose deaths were sensationalized in tabloids and on TV, in part because of their pretty faces. Their untimely ends became forms of entertainment, ghost stories disconnected from lived identities, not quite art or fiction but something close. (By some measure, Holloway’s death was treated as fait accompli, even though she wasn’t declared legally dead until 2012.)
Writer Maggie Nelson addresses the American-ness of murder ― particularly, the murder of young, white women, in her book The Red Parts, which chronicles the trial of a man accused of murdering Nelson’s aunt, Jane, a law student engaged to be married at the time in 1969. When recalling watching Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo” in a UC Berkeley class, Nelson makes an even more disturbing realization: culture doesn’t just privilege its pretty dead girls. By denying female characters independence, nuance and vitality, so many forms of art and culture create women characters who, even while walking and talking, are virtually lifeless.
“I remember feeling disconcerted by the way Kim Novak’s character seems stranded between ghost and flesh,” she wrote, “whereas Jimmy Stewart’s seems the ‘real,’ incarnate. I wanted to ask my professor afterward whether women were somehow always already dead, or, conversely, had somehow not yet begun to exist...”
Why is it that our cultural landscape is so fixated on unconscious female characters? Do we really privilege women most when they lack agency to such a degree that they lack a pulse? By perpetually returning to images of Pretty Dead Girls, are we accepting the prototype and the warning? A beauty ideal blemished by the violence women face on a daily basis, an advisory to those who still proceed with uninhibited independence?
Shows like “Twin Peaks” have provided depth, darkness and nuance to their Pretty Dead Girl leads, presenting Laura Palmer as a complex person rather than a random corpse that’s easy on the eyes. Yet most viewers, rather than recalling the fact that Palmer volunteered with Meals on Wheels or struggled with drugs, will remember a single, searing image: the first moment her face is revealed, lovely and docile and blue.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story referenced the sensationalized death of Elizabeth Smart; we meant Elizabeth Short.
Supposedly, your third decade of life (that is, ages 20–30) is one of your most crucial. During that time, it feels like you’re generally supposed to figure out your career, your outlook on life, your love situation, your family plans — no pressure.
Luckily, if you’re in the midst of doing more flailing than to-do-list-checking during these years, there are plenty of people who’ve come before to commiserate, elucidate or simply provide a few laughs through the churning waters of young adulthood.
Behold, 12 great essay collections by women that are perfect for the 20-something in your life (which may be, well, you).
For a generation of ballerinas, Wendy Whelan was a walking goddess. The former New York City Ballet principal dancer joined the company at 17, and was quickly singled out for promotion and praise. She served as a muse for multiple then-up-and-coming choreographers and would go on to have more new ballets made for her than any other dancer in the company’s history. She became the defining American ballerina of her generation.
All the while, she says in a new documentary, she was asking herself, “What the fuck is it going to be like when I can’t do this any more?”
In 2013, she found out.
At the time, Whelan was 46 years old, which is all but ancient by ballerina standards. Ballet is so punishing on the body, and the standard demanded by top companies so high, that most women peak by their 30th birthdays and retire not long after. When Misty Copeland was promoted to the top rank of American Ballet Theater in 2015, it was a bittersweet moment: she’d been promoted at last, but at the age of 32, she probably didn’t have many dancing years left in her. Whelan, whose professional ballet career lasted three decades, was truly an anomaly, a ballet institution who outlasted some of her younger colleagues by years.
By 46, she noticed that she was being cast in fewer ballets, including, to her chagrin, the iconic Nutcracker, in which she’d been dancing the role of the Sugarplum Fairy for years. Her boss, Ballet Master Peter Martins, hinted that it might be time for her to move on. And then, her hip started hurting.
The documentary “Wendy Whelan: Restless Creature” finds Whelan preparing for surgery to repair a labral tear, which has made even walking across the stage an agony. She travels to Vail, Colorado, and puts herself in the hands of one of the world’s best hip surgeons, whose walls are covered in the jerseys of the pro athletes he’s treated. This is the man people see when they need to get back in the game, she explains. She needs to do just that, she says, especially since “I don’t have a ton of time left at my game.”
”Restless Creature” shows us Whelan’s recovery from the surgery (after first showing us the surgery itself, in rather gruesome detail), and her return to New York to contemplate what comes after ballet. She gets off crutches, returns to the ballet studio and begins to branch out into contemporary dance, hoping that it will be less brutal on her body. But it soon becomes clear that her body can’t take a return to ballet in addition to her ambitious plan to create a contemporary dance program and tour it all over the country. She has to focus on ballet for what little time she has left before retirement becomes inevitable.
Throughout the film, Whelan consults her former colleagues, all of whom have already retired. She asks them: How did you do this? How did you walk away from the only job you’ve ever had, the thing you’ve been working toward almost since you could walk? Who are you when you’re a ballerina who can’t do ballet any more?
Career paths out of ballet are notoriously narrow. Dancers usually skip college, and even the end of high school, to devote themselves to dancing in their late teens and early 20s, which means that when they retire from dancing, they’re out in the job market without an entry-level degree. Some dancers go on to teach or coach, and some to choreograph, though the latter path is often even less stable, predictable or lucrative than being a dancer. Some go into ballet-adjacent work, like dance photography. Some will be picked to run companies; Pacific Northwest Ballet, Miami City Ballet, Washington Ballet and Pennsylvania Ballet are all run by alumni of the New York City Ballet or American Ballet Theater. But there are only so many ballet companies to run, and turnover at the top can be infrequent.
Besides, as Whelan explains in the film, she hadn’t made a plan for her post-ballet life; while some of her colleagues were setting themselves up for the next step, she was busy just ... dancing.
At its core, “Restless Creature” is a film about grief. We watch as Whelan comes to the realization that her career is ending; that she’ll soon lose the structure of morning class and rehearsal and performance that have defined her days for decades; that she’ll leave behind a large piece of herself, and her identity, when she leaves the Lincoln Center stage for the last time. She moves through the stages of grieving, showing the camera very little anger, and the film ends with her farewell performance in October 2014, which featured yet more new works made just for her.
Now, she’s “really close to the end” of that grieving process, she told HuffPost in a phone interview. She didn’t go to the ballet for a while after she retired, but, she says, now she can go “and not feel pangs in the same way. I’m really happy about that. I can watch works that were made for me and feel a separation, and I’m really glad about that.”
She’s still performing. Her collaboration with the cadre of contemporary choreographers she assembled at the end of her time at City Ballet has toured around the country, and she opened the Joyce Theater’s spring season this year. She’s started coaching other dancers, and recently set a piece by Alexei Ratmansky with Pacific Northwest Ballet — meaning, she learned every step and movement of the ballet and then taught them all to the dancers at that company.
In her new life as a contemporary dancer, she says, her body and her mind have begun working differently. “I’ve let my body soften,” she says. “I’ve let it relax. There’s a lot of anxiety in the ballet world and nervousness,” but in contemporary dance, she feels more grounded. “There’s this calmness that I didn’t have in ballet because I was always up so high on my toes. For me there’s a parallel between how I was dancing and how I was feeling.” After decades of sewing ribbons onto pointe shoes every night, she now rehearses in socks, or bare feet, or canvas ballet flats.
Her new role allows her far more artistic control than she had as a ballerina. She chooses who choreographs on her, she designs programs, she wields far more power than she could as a dancer — something most ballerinas never get to experience before or after they retire. It took some getting used to. “I was so comfortable with my ballet power, my dancer power, that to have a voice, the comfort with having a voice, is slower to come to me,” she says. “I’ve always had a point of view, but to be in the front of the room, I didn’t move into a front of the room position until I retired, and that was really slow. “ While contemporary dance sees more women at the front of the room — running rehearsals instead of dancing in them — than classical ballet does, there’s still an enormous gender imbalance. Most dance companies are run by men, and most choreographers (even those with whom Whelan now collaborates) are men.
Above all, Whelan doesn’t plan to stop dancing, even if she’s not dancing ballet anymore. After she retired, she had a full hip replacement, which she says left her totally pain-free. She says that good genes and “great energy” in her family gave her a body that took easily to dance and was able to keep dancing long after most people have to stop, “a lucky body, not a great body.”
Still, she’s no longer on the regimented rehearsal schedule of a principal ballerina, and when asked what she most misses and least misses, she answers both questions the same way: “I really miss dancing all day long,” she says. “But something I really love is not dancing all day long. I love that I can’t rely on dancing all day long to stay creative.” After the heartbreak of leaving her old self behind, she’s found that she didn’t need it as much as she thought, or feared.
As for the beautiful and cruel ballet slippers that she put on her feet every day for almost 40 years, the bodily extensions that are synonymous with the ballerina, does she miss those? “Sometimes I miss being en pointe, but not a whole lot,” she says. “Every once and a while I would love to float for a minute on a shoe. But for the most part, I did it long enough that it’s OK.”

The past year in language has been closely tied to the speech patterns of the current president. If Donald Trump lambastes “bad hombres” or describes something as “bigly,” people rush in droves to look up the words or mock his vocabulary on Twitter. Other language kerfuffles have surrounded his eccentric use of punctuation and his haphazard spelling, which Merriam-Webster patiently continues to correct for him.
On Tuesday night, Trump took to Twitter, but this time he had no ordinary misspelling in store. “Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” he wrote in a now-deleted tweet that remained up for several hours and sparked an almost giddy reaction from Twitter users. 
covfefe pic.twitter.com/2kIHlF0H1x
Observers have previously commented on the president’s relatively limited working vocabulary; he often resorts to favorite modifiers, like “bigly” (or “big league”) and all-purpose insults. He calls terrorists and political opponents alike “losers.” His preferred terms have been carefully observed, defined and discussed for the nation over the past year.
Despite that, he’s managed to make news once again for his diction ― and this time, it was likely just a typo. 
Trump himself embraced the furor (likely a welcome distraction from reports that he plans to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord):
Who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ???  Enjoy!
Merriam-Webster, for once, took a pass on the assignment:
Wakes up.Checks Twitter....Uh......📈 Lookups fo......Regrets checking Twitter.Goes back to bed.
The cool thing about language is its plasticity. Groups of people are quick to assign meaning to new words or to expand what a word signifies. All that is to say that “covfefe” already has an Urban Dictionary entry, and it’s pretty on point:
When Urban Dictionary nails the definition. #Covfefe pic.twitter.com/r3nMr6obgs
Not sure that’s what President Trump had in mind. Unlike his previous boast that he invented “prime the pump,” he did, in a way, coin the term “covfefe.” It’s a far cry from the neologisms created by William Shakespeare, John Milton and other creative linguists, to be clear ― they created intentionally, typically using building blocks from existing language to craft meaningful new terms. Given Trump’s later tweet, it seems clear that he did not tweet “covfefe” on purpose and has no idea what it should mean.
Now that it’s happened, this epic typo seems like an inevitable step in this presidency’s effect on language. First we’re gripped by the simplicity of his language, then his frequent inability to spell it, and now we dedicate hours to finding a use for a nonsense cluster of letters.
Language matters ― in politics, in diplomacy, and, of course, in all interpersonal relations. In a time when it seems many long-established norms of how we operate politically, how we ensure international peace and cooperation, and how we treat other people no longer apply, it’s little wonder that a carelessly made-up word, with no long-established meaning, becomes a touchstone. Real words don’t seem to matter anymore either, or not in a way that makes sense.

The “Fearless Girl” statue ―- the one installed adjacent Wall Street’s charging bull during this year’s Women’s History Month ― has a new decrier.
Sculptor Alex Gardega told The New York Post that the proud, gangly young woman “is corporate nonsense.”
“It has nothing to do with feminism,” the artist went on. “And it is a disrespect to the artist that made the bull. That bull had integrity.”
To protest, Gardega put up a work of his own: a shoe-sized pug urinating at the girl’s ankles. Unlike “Fearless Girl” and the financial district’s renowned bull, the dog is a carefully stylized work, rather than a realistic one.

“I decided to build this dog and make it crappy to downgrade the statue, exactly how the girl is a downgrade on the bull,” Gardega told the outlet.
Gardega isn’t the first to voice concern with “Fearless Girl,” which HuffPost’s Emily Peck dubbed an example of pinkwashing. Several critics have dismissed the small Wall Street addition as a sheeny, infantilizing attempt at feminism.
The creator of the bull sculptor, Arturo Di Modica, has claimed the city violated his legal rights by permitting the statue’s placement at all. He’s suing State Street Global Advisors, the investment management firm that placed “Fearless Girl” near his work, for trademark and copyright infringement.
NY1 News reports that Gardega’s “Pissing Pug” has since been removed. “Fearless Girl” artist Kristen Visbal has yet to make a statement about the ordeal.
You oughta know that your favorite ‘90s woman rocker is headed for the theatre.
Alanis Morissette, whose Grammy-winning album “Jagged Little Pill” you’ve probably wailed along to with a hairbrush mic, will have her album adapted into a musical next spring.
Diane Paulus ― of “Hair” and “Finding Neverland” fame ― will head up the production, and “Juno” writer Diablo Cody is writing the book.
According to a press release, Cody and Morissette are basing the musical’s story on “a modern and multi-generational family and their complex dynamics, touching on issues of gender identity and race.”
“The chemistry between all of us is crackling and I feel honored to be diving into these songs again,” Morissette said in a statement.
And yes, hits like “Ironic” and “Hand in My Pocket” will be worked into the musical, which will premiere May 2018 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

One of Alabama-born photographer Yuki James’ first interactions with a camera was when his grandparents bought him a red 35mm while he was visiting them in Japan.
“I took photographs of everything, and even had my grandmother take photographs of me, nude,” he said in an email to HuffPost.
These unorthodox beginnings aptly foreshadow James’ later works, which explore the limitless ways people can surprise one another, regardless of age, appearance or background. A series of James’ portraits, now on view at the the National Arts Club, invite the viewer into close proximity of strangers to revel in just how strange they, and by proxy we, really are. 
“I am interested in shooting people [...] who are in some way outside the realm of convention,” James told HuffPost. “I’m not interested in those that everyone calls beautiful. I find it’s harder to get something authentic with conventionally beautiful people because they are used to the attention and thus more systematic in how they respond to the camera.”
James mostly shoots his friends and family, along with people he recruits through chance encounters or on social media. The artist shows his potential subjects his past work, to make sure they know what they’re in for. He then visits their home and, together, artist and subject look through their environment to find the items and spaces that stand out. 
“We then decide on the styling together,” James said. “What feels most comfortable. Aside from the lighting, which I tailor to each shot, I alter the environment very little.”
In one photo, James captures a woman called “Granny” wearing a red, long-sleeved robe at her sewing machine. She meets the camera with a cartoonish look of surprise, alerting the viewers to the intimate nature of their vantage point. In another, “Willie,” dressed in leather, stares at the camera, his expression neither confrontational nor bashful. “This is who I am, this is what I like,” the photos communicate one after the other, without stereotyping, oversimplifying or apologizing. 
In James’ world, expectations and reality often collide within the frame. Perhaps you wouldn’t expect Okachan, a middle-aged Japanese woman, to accessorize with a silk headscarf and a ball gag. Or Tawan, a young black man eating popcorn in bed, to do so enveloped in sable fur. These small surprises, James hopes, help to unite subject and viewer through “evoking some sense of empathy,” and embracing the contradictory forces we all possess.
“The only assumption I care to challenge is the belief that we are inherently, vastly different from each other,” James said. “Aside from that, I don’t go into my work wanting to prove any point, nor do I have a desire to make political statements. I shoot people I am interested in, and that just happens to cover a broad spectrum.”
With influences including Richard Avedon, Philip-Lorca diCorcia and Deana Lawson, James creates straightforward portraits that speak to the humanity inside us all. Instead of photographing moments of sameness, James prefers instances of subtle surprise, showing that difference is the quality all of his subjects share. 
“My only agenda is to make beautiful images that make people feel something,” he said. “But if I boiled it down to a message, it would probably be that we are not alone in our loneliness.”
”Yuki James: Portraits” is on view until June 3, 2017 at The National Arts Club.

They’re around every corner, frighteningly vacant shells of what they once were. What renowned editor Harold Evans calls “zombies” ― or, words that have lost their vitality ― are spotted often amid unclear writing. And, according to Evans, they’re muddying up our language to the point of total opacity.
Evans’ new book, Do I Make Myself Clear?, is a case for the value of clear writing, and a thorough guide for making writing clearer.
“One of the reasons we get tired in writing and in studying, is we have to carry all this dross in our heads. All this excess wordage,” Evans told HuffPost in a phone interview.
A statement like that might be dismissed as pedantry, but Evans’ professional experiences more than qualify him for making such a claim. He was the longstanding editor of The Sunday Times, and has since held positions at The Atlantic Monthly and New York Daily News. Before that, he worked in India and Northern England, where he endeavored to use straightforward, evocative language to communicate directly to papers’ readerships.
In the 1980s, Evans moved to the U.S., where he founded Conde Nast Traveler and later served as the publisher of Random House. These roles inspired him to hone another title on his resume: author of instructional writing books.
“There was no economy in the writing, there was no conciseness,” Evans said. “My metaphor for it was, while the English are still on the starvation diet of WWII ― which we were, because all the newspapers shrank in size, and had to be very economical ― Americans grazed gently over acres of pasture.”
In Do I Make Myself Clear?, Evans ventures to change that. He identifies the worst offenders of verbose, inexpressive writing. “Academia is one of the major criminals,” he said. “The major criminals are lawyers, academics, bureaucrats of all kinds, insurance companies.”
Politicians, of course, are among the guilty. Evans points out Trump’s unclear language, and the power it has to mask the decisions being made by his administration. With his book, Evans is interested in alerting readers to “the deceptions practiced on us. For instance, in the health care bill going through Congress at the moment, the deceptions in the language are serious.”
To this end, Evans points out several easily identifiable offenses. The aforementioned zombies, or verbs that are used as nouns, are one. For example, rather than, “I authorized the expenditure,” a zombiefied version would read, “the authorization of the expenditure was approved.” “The verb is being turned into a flabby noun,” Evans said.
Another impediment to clarity: pleonasms, or extra words. The example Evans gives is “35 acres of land”; “of land” is an unnecessary add-on. “American newspapers and online are full of pleonasms, some of which are funny,” Evans said.
And another: flesh-eaters, or, as Evans puts it, “words [or phrases] without any meaning whatsoever.” In his book, he lists pages’ worth of examples, and translations into clearer iterations of the words. So, “currently” becomes “now,” “adjacent to” becomes “near,” “due to the fact that” becomes “because,” “in order to” becomes “to,” and “this day and age” becomes, simply, “today.”
Today, Evans’ ode to clarity is much needed. As he argues in his book, murky descriptors make it harder for readers to see the truth behind a tweet, a treatise, or a proposed new law.
Do I Make Myself Clear? is available now.

A wrestler sets his sights on the NCAA championship; a man goes on a statewide search for his missing son. A trends forecaster learns to cope with the market’s return to IRL experiences; an ex-musician reflects on his glory days. The journeys — both literal and metaphorical — that make up this summer’s new titles will move you. Below are a few of the books we’re most looking forward to in the coming months.
In LA, “the beauty’s in the tap water.” At least that what memoirist Lady Daniels says when S., the woman she’s hired to care for her young son while she works, arrives at her door, looking plainer than she’d expected. But she grows close to S. amid the heat of the Hollywood summer. -Maddie Crum, Books and Culture Writer

The award-winning author of Caucasia is publishing her first novel in over 10 years this summer: a striking, off-kilter exploration of race and class. Biracial graduate student Maria lives in Brooklyn with her fiancé Khalil, also biracial, where they’ve ensconced themselves in a bourgeois, racially mixed community of intellectuals. Maria finds herself falling into an unrequited obsession with a black poet that threatens to shatter her relationship, her reputation, and her fragile mental state. -Claire Fallon, Books and Culture Writer

Sixteen years ago (!), Matthew Klam wrote a collection of much-anthologized stories. He hasn’t published a book since then, so Who Is Rich?, his first novel, actually earns the perhaps hackneyed label of “highly anticipated.” The book follows Rich, a struggling cartoonist, and Amy, a painting student, through their dangerous liaisons at an artist’s retreat. -MC

Warning: This article contains nudity and may not be appropriate for work. 
”What I remember is laying on the bathroom floor,” Brooklyn-based artist Rowan Renee wrote in 2015. “I might be four, or five, or six years old. It was always in the bathroom.” 
As a child, Renee, who is gender non-binary, was abused and molested by their father. Renee’s mother and grandmother were also victims of sexual assault. “Is this story not yet tired of rewriting itself?” Renee continued. “Obedient daughters and wives. Women taught that to speak out means to be shunned, brutalized or killed. Women taught to hate their bodies as much as the people who ravage them ... Women who are abused and set out to find what lays beyond it, like me.”
Renee’s father was eventually convicted of lewd and lascivious battery of a 13-year-old boy and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He died while incarcerated. Five years after his death, Renee began to explore the physical and psychological traces years of incest and abuse left behind, using their camera as a guide. 
For the series “Bodies of Wood,” Renee photographed their partially nude body in various positions of power and submission, tension and release. In one image, Renee sits naked on a kitchen counter alongside a sink, clutching the edges of a stained glass window. The dilapidated domestic space surrounding them recalls the work of Francesca Woodman, whose photos explore how women’s bodies can simultaneously evoke presence and absence.
In another, Renee again lies naked amongst fragments of splintered wood, their face shielded from view. The image is reminiscent of the spirit of Cuban artist Ana Mendieta, who placed her body in nature in order to envelop herself in the primordial elements of the universe ― responsible for the life and death of all things. 
Mendieta’s spirit looms over Renee’s project. As a woman who was subjected to violence at the hands of a man she loved, Mendieta plummeted to her death at 33 years old, after falling from the window of the apartment she shared with her husband, artist Carl Andre. Andre, who was heard fighting with Mendieta just before her death, and was found with scrapes across his face afterward, was charged and eventually acquitted of her murder.
“Women who are thrown out of windows, like Ana Mendieta,” Renee wrote. 
With their series, named after a Carl Andre quotation, Renee reclaims their body, formerly a site of pain, imbuing it with the potential to experience pleasure. In the process, Renee proves a nude photography subject is neither vulnerable or powerless by default, giving their body a tangled mess of agency, rage, forgiveness and desire. 
Read HuffPost’s interview with Renee below. 
This series grapples with brutal violence within a family unit. Can you talk about your decision to address these issues in an abstract visual language? Why did you opt away from more direct representation?
One of the questions I often ask myself is: How do we represent violence without perpetuating it? While incest is a particularly brutal kind of violence, I don’t think the brutal moments are actually the most effective to represent it. For one, depictions of brutality are always at risk of being fetishized. And if not fetishization, they still elicit such strong reactions that they can eclipse the nuance and the deep contradictions that pervade the violence that occurs within the family.
Brutality is the sensationalized moment, but it’s only the beginning. For me, it was more important to focus on subtle, unsettling and deeply psychological responses. There’s a profound realness to the way trauma stays with us long after the traumatic circumstances are over. In that sense, I wouldn’t say my images are abstract. They reflect the longer acting and quieter aspects of trauma that do not typically hold the audience’s attention in mainstream representations.
How did you decide to incorporate your own body into the images? How do you see the relationship between memory and the body?
In the historical role of testimony, brutality is difficult to communicate to people who have never experienced it. My body was essential to this project because no one else can testify to my experiences. Trauma survivors often talk about how memories come up first as physical responses. When people experience trauma they enter a dissociative state. If the trauma is chronic, dissociation becomes a daily survival mechanism that can literally reshape the neural pathways of the brain.
That’s all to say that the relationship between memory and body is a complicated one. The body may communicate things the mind is not ready to consciously accept. The mind may physiologically change in response chronic abuse and begin to see the world differently. Sometimes the process of externalizing memory, in writing or in image, becomes a process of witnessing one’s own memory. Distance can be a space to build compassion for one’s own experience.
What do the words “Bodies of Wood” mean to you?
“Bodies of Wood” is a quote from Carl Andre about sculpture. He says: “Wood is the mother of all matter. Like all women hacked and ravaged by men, she renews herself by giving, gives herself by renewing.” Andre is also believed to have murdered his wife and artist Ana Mendieta, although he was acquitted of the crime. I mention Andre and Mendieta in the zine/personal essay that accompanies “Bodies of Wood,” and I basically call out Andre’s words as a hollow fantasy that men use to justify violence in aesthetic terms. The zine was how I brought a more literal narrative about my childhood in relation to the imagery. [Editor’s Note: The zine can be read here.]
Where are these images shot? What drew you to these spaces?
All of the images were shot during a five-week artist residency on a houseboat in Sausalito, California, called the VAR Program. The boat used to belong to Alan Watts and Agnes Varda, and was decked out with much of the original decor. I often worked on the boat because it was so strange and evocative, interacting with particular areas or pieces of architecture that resonated with me. Other times I went for meandering bike rides along the Marin Coastal Reserve. The outdoor shoots were much riskier, because they inevitably involved me taking off my clothes while alone in the woods, often very close to active trails.
There’s one image that I took in a parking lot on the way back from one of my walks. It had been raining and the sun broke through the clouds in a beautiful way. After some deliberation I decided to do it, but I would leave my underwear on. There’s obviously a bit of fantasy in that logic. Of course I know that underwear would do little to protect me from an awkward encounter or a physical threat. But, I think the actual precariousness of my body was necessary to capture that feeling in the image.
You describe your photographs as “solitary performances for the camera.” What does this mean to you and how does it differ from sitting for a portrait?
When I talk about my process for producing these images, I often describe being in dialogue with both the camera and my unconscious. I didn’t think of the process purely in terms of constructing an image. Instead, I think about channeling a specific moment, place, and state of mind. In the language of “mindfulness,” I sought to capture a moment of total presence.
The photos also deal explore tensions related to gender-based violence and victimhood. How does posing nude for the camera, a traditionally feminine and submissive role, feel for you? Do you find it objectifying, empowering, healing? What is the relationship between subject and victim, in your opinion?
Working with the nude female form in these images is a sleight of hand. The context of incest adds conflict to the desirability of the body in the minds of most viewers. They are confronted with the discomfort of having to hold two opposing truths, that the body shown has been violated and is speaking openly about violation, and the body shown is desirable. And I think that speaks more accurately to the aftermath of trauma.
Victimhood has a way of removing agency from individuals and pathologizing adverse experiences, setting victims of sexual violence into a category where they are meant to unfairly carry the burden of shame, and are expected to be “broken” by their experiences. I don’t think of my body as submissive in these images, I think of it as confrontational, transgressing the taboos that would rather not see me or acknowledge the resilience, strength, and empowerment that can be claimed from the position of “victim.”
In a statement, Aperture described how the images represent a journey to rediscover pleasure after violence and trauma. How, if at all, did creating these works affect your relationship to physical pleasure?
Through “Bodies of Wood” I began to understand what it means to experience artistic inspiration. Something happened where I became uninhibited and was able to tap into a fundamental life force. While I was working on “Bodies of Wood,” I felt a profound joy. That feeling was connected to the feeling of freedom. But it also was connected to the feeling of my craft. I had developed a fluency at making images, and I could wield it with power and confidence. The experience of creative genesis was a source of pleasure in this project. Being able to access that part of me builds wellsprings in every other aspect of my life.
Creative expression is often associated with therapy and healing. Was creating this work a therapeutic process? If not, how would you describe its effect psychologically?
There have been many therapeutic aspects to making this work, but I think the one with the most implications for social change is the process of breaking the silence. The taboo in our society is not the incestuous act — it’s common and the perpetrators are frequently protected from consequence. The taboo is talking about it. As long as incest is something that cannot be openly discussed, we will see this kind of violence continue to be used as a tool to control behavior and dominate.
Can you share a reaction to the series, whether positive or negative, that stood out to you?
As part of the weekend-long program at Aperture, we collaborated with The Voices and Faces Project to host a testimonial writing workshop for survivors of gender-based violence and other human rights abuses. One of the writing exercises was to look at “Bodies of Wood” and react to a single image with a piece of writing. Hearing the participants’ stories was like witnessing creative genesis.
It was also an exercise in relinquishing control of interpretation. I was surprised at how the writers in the workshop landed so close to my original inspirations, while still inflecting the images with their own experience. It was as if the images had tapped into the collective unconscious and that was legible in people’s responses.

In mythology, the trickster is an archetypal character that takes many shapes ― animal, human and divine ― distinguished by intellect, cunning, a penchant for mischief, and an aversion to rules, lines and norms of all kinds. In African folklore, the trickster takes shape through Anansi the spider; in America, Brer Rabbit; in France, Reynard the Fox. In pop culture, you’ll recognize trickster tendencies in characters like Bugs Bunny, Felix the Cat and Bart Simpson.
In each case, the character uses questionably moral tactics and a generous helping of wit to subvert the natural order of things, tip-toeing over boundaries and shaking up power dynamics to turn the world topsy-turvy. They are clowns, jokers and provocateurs, able to outsmart traditional hero archetypes through their ability to camouflage, think on their toes and step outside traditional moral frameworks. 
Outside the realm of myth, in contemporary life, artists often embody the trickster ethos, pushing buttons and testing limits in a world that, quite often, doesn’t quite know what to make of them. This was, at least, painter Kehinde Wiley’s understanding when he embarked upon his most recent painting series “Trickster.”
“Artists are those people who sit at the intersection between the known and unknown, the rational and irrational, coming to terms with some of the confusing histories we as artists deal with,” Wiley said in an interview with HuffPost. “The trickster position can serve quite well especially in times like this.”
The series consists of 11 paintings, all depicting prominent black contemporary artists who, according to Wiley, embody this trickster mode of being. There’s Mickalene Thomas, known for her bedazzled portraits of glamorous black women, as the Coyote, portrayed with feathers in her hair and a hand on her heart. And Nick Cave, whose boisterous “sound suit” sculptures are ecstatic cyclones of matter and sound, assumes the role of famous portrait subject Nadezhda Polovtseva, wearing a beanie and high-top sneakers while beckoning to the viewer with an umbrella. 
Wiley described his subjects as his heroes and peers. “These are people I surround myself with in New York,” he said. “Who come to my studio, who share my ideas. The people I looked up to as a student, as a budding artist many years ago.” He savors that intersectionality, using his brush to peer into art’s past, present and future. 
Since 2001, Brooklyn-based Wiley has painted grandiose, large-scale portraits of black subjects, injecting them into the largely pasty halls of Western portraiture. Riffing off traditional Renaissance imagery canonizing kings, nobles and saints, Wiley gives his contemporary subjects a hybrid sense of regal aplomb and swagger, a nod to the performative gestures that communicate youth, blackness and contemporary, image-saturated life.
Wiley’s painted figures are most often swallowed up by his sumptuous textile backdrops that creep meanderingly into the foreground. The serpentine vines and decorative flourishes usher Wiley’s typical human subjects ― whom he plucks from sidewalks and shopping malls ― out of their previous existences into the realm of paint, timeless and eternal. Over the past 15 years, Wiley’s artistic style has become immediately recognizable, if not iconic. And yet the artist believes his much of his practice remains, to a degree, misinterpreted.
“So much of my work has not been fully investigated,” he said. “Many people see my early work simply as portraits of black and brown people. Really, it’s an investigation of how we see those people and how they have been perceived over time. The performance of black American identity feels very different from actually living in a black body. There’s a dissonance between inside and outside.”
Wiley perceives his current series, too, as an exercise in careful looking. “It’s about analyzing my position as an artist within a broader community,” he said. “About an artist’s relationship to history and time. It’s a portrait of a group of people coming to terms with what it means to be an artist in the 21st century dealing with blackness, with individuality.”
Those familiar with Wiley’s work might do a double take upon seeing this new work, which does away with lavish, cloth-like backdrops in favor of phantasmagorical scenarios. “This show is about me being uncomfortable as an artist,” he said. “When I’m at my best, I’m trying to destabilize myself and figure out new ways of approaching art as a provocation. I think I am at my best, when I push myself into a place where I don’t have all the answers. Where I really rely on instinct.”
While Wiley’s earlier works have drawn comparisons to Barkley L. Hendricks, Jeff Koons and David Salle, this current series calls upon the spirit of Francisco de Goya, specifically, his “Black Paintings,” made toward the end of the artist’s life, between 1819 and 1823. The most famed work in the series, “Saturn Devouring His Son,” depicts Saturn as a crazed old man ― bearded, nude, eyes like black beads ― biting into his child’s body like a cut of meat. 
“I’m interested in blackness as a space of the irrational,” Wiley said. “I love the idea of starting with darkness but ending up with a show that is decidedly about light. There is a very self-conscious concentration on the presence and absence of light ― tying into these notions of good and evil, known and unknown. There is a delicate balance that comes out of such a simple set of metaphors.”
The trickster, like Goya, alternates methodically between these notions of light and darkness. Yet the practice extends beyond the metaphorical and into all too real life when black artists navigate the hegemonic and largely white institutions of the art world. “The trickster is an expert at code switching, at passing and posing,” Wiley said.
“In African-American folklore, the trickster stands in direct relation to secrecy,” he continued. “How do you keep your home and humanity safe from the dominant culture? How do you talk about things and keep them away from the master? These were things talked about in slavery that morphed into the blues, then jazz, then hip-hop. It informs the way young people fashion their identities.”
Just as a young man hanging out at the mall performs black masculinity through his look, walk and speech, artists like Kerry James Marshall, Wangechi Mutu and Yinka Shonibare are cast in the role of “black contemporary artist” ― a role they pilot with dexterity and finesse. “It’s about being able to play inside of it and outside of the race narrative at once,” Wiley said. “It’s difficult to get right.”
Wiley’s paintings are visual folktales littered with clues ― a rifle, a leather-bound book, a slew of dead foxes ― that, like Goya’s 19th-century canvases, reject certain understanding. Instead, they place viewers in an indeterminate space of in-between: between past and present, dark and light, classical and contemporary, reality and myth. 
“I am painting with this romantic idea that portraiture tells some kind of essential truth about the subject,” Wiley said, “but also with this modern suspicion of any representation to tell the truth about an individual. It’s about being in love with a tradition that is inclusive of so many possibilities, but still contains so much absence.”
Indeed, portraiture has historically served aristocrats and elites, leading critics like Vinson Cunningham to question whether such a medium can ever transcend its chronicled prejudice. “How can Renaissance-descended portraiture, developed in order to magnify dynastic princes and the keepers of great fortunes, adequately convey twenty-first-century realities or work as an agent of political liberation?” he wrote earlier this year. 
Yet what Cunningham views as painting’s weakness, Wiley sees as its strength. “Any writer or artist or thinker must have a set of limitations from which to push off from,” he said. “By virtue of its familiarity it can offer surprise.” And it does. With each subsequent series and show, Wiley stretches the understanding of what shape a portrait can take, who the art establishment serves, what the next generation of great American artists has in store. 
“When I have exhibitions, the people who don’t belong to the typical museum demographic show up,” Wiley said. “People view themselves within the rubric of possibility.” The artist himself had a similar experience back in the day, upon seeing Kerry James Marshall’s portraits flourishing, black American life at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The works left him “thunderstruck.”
Today, Wiley refers to Marshall as “a hero who has, in an improbable way, become a friend.” His smiling face appears three times over Wiley’s “Portrait of Kerry James Marshall, La Lectura.” Seated amidst a dim, rocky cave, Marshall assumes the roles of both student and teacher, directing the viewer’s attention to a large book in his lap, whose insides remain indecipherable. His grin is illuminated with wisdom, kindness and a glint of mischief, leaving the viewer to question what comes next. 
Kehinde Wiley’s “Trickster” runs until June 17 at Sean Kelly Gallery in New York. 
This morning, Amazon ― the online bookseller-turned-everything store ― opened the doors to its latest brick-and-mortar outpost in New York City’s Columbus Circle. The company added in-person retail to its arsenal of buying options in 2015, when it opened a store in Seattle. Beginning today, it occupies a space where a Borders once was.
Unlike its competitors ― which mostly include independent bookstores, after the company’s rise lead to the fall of Borders and many Barnes & Noble locations ― Amazon’s physical bookstore relies on sales data to determine which titles will be prominently displayed. At the Columbus Circle location, a table labeled “Highly Rated: 4.8 Stars & Above” sits near the entrance. On it, are such titles as 100 Days of Real Food: Fast & Fabulous: The Easy and Delicious Way to Cut Out Processed Food by Lisa Leake and Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat by Chrissy Teigen.
For publishers, especially those who support the work of emerging authors, disempowered authors or authors whose voices aren’t in chorus with the mainstream, this data-based approach to bookselling is disconcerting.
Michael Reynolds, the editor-in-chief of Europa Editions, told HuffPost that Amazon’s ratings-based system isn’t conducive to discovering writers like the lyrical, wave-making Elena Ferrante, whom Europa publishes.
“While a new bookstore, any new bookstore, is generally good news, I can’t see how Amazon applying its unsatisfactory recommendation engine to a physical space is going to result in the kind of discovery experience a reader has when she enters any good brick-and-mortar store,” Reynolds said. “It is certainly not going to help with bringing about the kind of bibliodiversity that, with authors like Elena Ferrante, Muriel Barbery, Boualem Sansal and Domenico Starnone, we seek to cultivate, and that I think is more important today than ever.”
Dennis Johnson, the co-publisher of Melville House, agreed. “Things like Tolstoy are going to have lower ratings than the new book by the new YouTube star,” he told HuffPost. “Real literature is slowly not going to be available there.”
Caroline Casey, the managing director of Coffee House Press, was more optimistic about readers’ appetite for well-told stories, and the tenacity of indie presses.
“I don’t expect [Amazon’s] experiments to damage independent bookstores, because what people value them for isn’t replicable in the Amazon model,” she told HuffPost. “So those booksellers, who are our very best advocates and sell our books better than I ever could hope to, should be fine. And so will we.”
Coffee House Press describes itself as “committed to diversity and inclusion,” and that mission statement is reflected in the titles it publishes, including Valeria Luiselli’s The Story of My Teeth, Saeed Jones’s Prelude to Bruise and Jade Sharma’s Problems. Casey says that while a “significant portion” of Coffee Houses’ sales come from Amazon, she doesn’t expect the seller’s physical locations to have either a positive or negative impact. Instead, she expects that indie bookstores will continue to account for most of the press’ in-person sales.
“A good bookstore offers not just curation, but also personality and the opportunity not [just] to find what you want, but to also find out what you want,” Casey said. “Amazon might have a lot of customer data, but it’s not the kind that yields a surprising, joyful bookstore visit.”
The decision to open brick-and-mortar stores isn’t the only recent change Amazon has made to its bookselling approach. Last month, the retailer tweaked its online buying options, so that publishers are no longer automatically granted the right to be listed as the default sellers for their titles. Instead, third-party retailers are now allowed to compete to become a book’s default seller. So, prime real estate on the site is often granted to those with the lowest costs.
Casey declined to comment on this new development. But, Johnson and Reynolds agreed that the move could hurt publishers and, consequently, authors, who aren’t owed a cut of the sale from third-party distributors.
“The Amazon paradigm sees books as a function of a hyper-competitive market rather than cultural products that create a market, shape it, and at times disrupt it,” Reynolds said. “The most recent development concerning Amazon’s buy box will make it increasingly difficult for authors to be paid adequately for their work when it is sold through Amazon, and for publishers to invest in bringing new and diverse voices to the market and maintaining a robust backlist. As a publisher animated by an abiding belief in the broad and lasting value not only of books but of ‘bibliodiversity,’ I cannot be anything but concerned by Amazon’s insistence on chipping away at the perceived and actual value of books.”
“It’s another instance of Amazon killing the goose that lays the eggs,” Johnson said. “Screwing their partners in the ecosystem that naturally grows around any kind of product. What they’re doing now is something that nobody makes any money from, except Amazon.”
And it’s not just indie presses who could suffer from Amazon’s business decisions. In fact, Johnson said that Melville House ― which only relies on Amazon for around 25 percent of its sales ― will likely fare better than big-five publishers such as Random House, which leans on Amazon to sell classics and other backlist titles.
“This is treacherous for everybody in the business,” Johnson said. “Everybody’s threatened by this.”
“Amazon is nothing if not Trumpian in their behavior,” he continued. “The ruthlessness, the naked capitalism. It’s all there. They’re positively Trumpian. They have that in them.”

When Donald Trump was elected president last November, the cast and crew of Hulu’s “Handmaid’s Tale” were already hard at work bringing Margaret Atwood’s gut-wrenching 1985 novel to the screen.
Much of the scripts had been written, the characters formed ― and then America voted in a leader who supports the kinds of oppressive, totalitarian policies that seem better suited for fictional Gilead than present-day U.S.
“It was horrible for the world but great for me,” showrunner Bruce Miller told The Hollywood Reporter.
His series was bound to be relevant anyway. (After all, Atwood said she based the story on very real, historical circumstances of women around the world.) But Trump’s election undeniably carried the show’s import to new heights. Since it debuted, audiences have not held back in drawing terrifying parallels between the show’s portrayal of Gilead ― a theocratic regime whose continued existence depends upon its ability to force women to surrender control over their own bodies ― and the divided state of America today. 
Neither has the cast and creative team behind the series.
“[Joseph Fiennes and I] are the villains,” Yvonne Strahovski, who plays the commander’s wife Serena Joy, explained to THR. “Suddenly Trump is elected, and all this negative behavior comes to light. I start seeing these parallels between [my character’s] actions and what Trump’s doing. It’s in a weird way an inspiration but also a horrid parallel.”
”People were all of a sudden saying the venomous things that they had always thought out loud — things I didn’t think people thought anymore in my little bubble,” Miller added. “It made me change one or two things [in the show], but I’m not going to tell you what they are.”
Of course, in countless other interviews, series star Elisabeth Moss (who plays Offred) and director Reed Morano have reiterated that the story would be effective regardless of Trump’s position at the White House. 
“The whole message that Margaret was sending in the book is that big changes like this don’t happen overnight,” Morano told audiences at 92Y in early May, “they happen very slowly over time, almost so that you don’t know that they’re happening until it’s too late.”
And yet, as Miller makes clear, the election had its effect. “I think that I definitely had personal feelings about [the election],” Moss told HuffPost in April. “All of a sudden I felt like [the story] was much more personal, much more relevant. It wasn’t so crazy. And this whole idea of ‘it couldn’t happen here’ kind of started to fade away. And that’s kind of what everyone else has felt as well.”
The parallels might be tough to stomach, but there’s hope, Samira Wiley (who plays Offred’s friend, Moira) told THR:
One of the things that’s so interesting about this show is the caste system, specifically within the women. It is, I think, a false sense of authority. We have Serena Joy and Offred, who are of two totally different statuses in the society, but how different it would be and how amazing it would be if they could see that banding together could be a revolution? Pitting women against each other is something that also happens in our world today. I hope people have conversations that they wouldn’t be having otherwise.
Miller agrees. In a previous interview with HuffPost, he said he wants the series to encourage people to “appreciate the freedoms that we have, and see little ways that they’re chipped away and what that can lead to.”
“There’s been just an unrelenting assault on [...] women’s sovereignty over their own bodies,” he added, “that’s been happening at the state level and the national level, that’s been head-spinning.”
Moss put it best to THR. When asked which women’s right she thought was the most vulnerable in our current political climate, she responded: 
Damn. How much time do you have? The easy one that comes to mind is sort of a blanket: the right to do with your own body what you want to do. Which covers a lot of things, frankly. It doesn’t just cover the right to have a child or not have a child.
On Jan. 16, just days before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, artist and teacher Steven Silberg asked people to welcome the commander in chief with a letter ― more specifically, a letter that functions as a work of art.
The project, called “In Care of the White House,” invites citizens of all types to mail original works of art to the mailbox at Trump’s new place of residence, flooding the office with drawings, handmade cards and collages that will allegedly have to be archived, guaranteeing that the opinions of those served by Trump are remembered.
According to Silberg, all materials sent to the White House are preserved in the National Archives as a result of the Presidential Records Act. He cites U.S. Code Title 44, Chapter 22, which defines “documentary material” to include both correspondence and works of art. In the past, presidents Reagan, Clinton and both Bushes all treated such letters and other modes of public communication as presidential records.
The law also states that “upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office [...] the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.” As a result, Silberg explained in an email to HuffPost, the documents could eventually be housed in a presidential library, unless the materials are disposed of with permission from the archivist of the United States (currently David S. Ferriero).
The hope is that, as a result of Silberg’s project, a gallery of art inspired by Trump’s term will bloom within the archives, in either digital or physical form. “I’m not yet clear on whether the physical objects will be stored or if they will be scanned and held digitally,” Silberg said. “I believe this determination falls at the discretion of the current administration in consultation with the Archivist of the United States.” 
Whether the body of work will look kindly or critically upon Trump remains to be seen, though the odds so far are certainly not in the president’s favor. One contribution is a short comic written and illustrated by Michigan-based art professor Erin Zerbe titled “Grab Back,” an allusion to Trump’s recorded 2005 statements boasting about grabbing women “by the pussy.” 
“This origami folded single page comic is about the first time I was sexually assaulted at the age of 12,” Zerbe writes in her letter to Trump, “and subsequently about my response to your vile comments on women and your election to the presidency.”
She adds:
Please understand, this comic and this letter are in no way intended as an attack on you. Rather, I’m hoping for a moment of honest, sincere conversation about sexual assault in this country, and how in many ways you have contributed to the rape culture that permeates all facets of our lives.
Other submissions address a wide range of topics from immigration to climate change, the Women’s March to fake news.  
“What I’m offering is an opportunity to make a gesture,” Silberg said, “to place one’s voice on record. Conservatives, liberals, libertarians, socialists and independents of all persuasions have felt that their voices were not being heard on issues of gender identity, gender equality, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, education and employment.
“As Allen Weinstein, former Archivist for the United States, wrote in the forward for Dear Mr. President: Letters to the Oval Office from the Files of the National Archives: ‘We have something important to say, and we expect the most powerful person on Earth to pay attention to our concerns.’”
Following the initial launch in January, Silberg followed up with a related project in March, called “Art as the Message.” Those who choose to submit work can do so online with an accompanying message; Silberg then turns the artworks into greeting cards on the artists’ behalf. 
One such letter, submitted by Hew Murphy along with the visual poem below, reads:
Dear Mr. President,
You speak a language of fear, hate, and ignorance when millions of children are listening. America’s children need more from you than jobs and walls. Please don’t lose your opportunity to be a positive role model.
Eventually, Silberg hopes to mount a physical exhibition comprised of the images and letters submitted through the project. Until then, he’s working to spread the word, encouraging artists, activists and concerned citizens to express their thoughts, whatever they may be, and put a stamp on them. 
“These are extraordinary times and a lot of people have a lot to say,” Silberg said. “And even though the likelihood that any one piece of artwork sent to the White House enacting change is small, it is my hope that I can help facilitate creating a permanent record of both dissent and support.”

“Two out of three of my friends have body image issues,” photographer Caroline Fahey told HuffPost. “Most girls I know do.” 
In her series “Silver Lining,” the 22-year-old photographer unravels her own complicated relationship with her body in front of the camera. Her self-portraits, captured in bedrooms and bathrooms, backyards and hotel rooms, reject an oversimplified idea of body positivity ― one that implies a hashtag here or a selfie there can yield unremitting self love. Rather, Fahey invites viewers to revel in her moments of confidence, self-loathing and ambiguity, privileging not one above the others.
In one image, Fahey looks out at the viewer from the shower, the clouded-over glass obscuring the edges of her form. A small area of the door smudged clean reveals an egg-shaped sliver of flesh, a fog-framed abstraction that hardly resembles a human form. In another, Fahey bathes in an outdoor shower, while drops of water ricochet off her bathing-suit-clad form. She is Boticelli’s “Venus” in a bikini, both nonchalant and sensual as she gazes off-camera.  
Fahey, who first became interested in photography after creating a pinhole camera her freshman year of high school, started snapping self-portraits as a college student at NYU. Her first series was about being a fat woman and the emotions her physical stature inspired ― as Fahey put it, “What it felt like to be bigger.” She soon found the subject made her peers react rather awkwardly. 
“Talking about being fat makes people really uncomfortable,” Fahey said. “People really shut the conversation down or they say something like, ‘You’re not fat.’ But it was really important for me to challenge people, to make them talk about it.”
In 2013, Fahey’s relationship to her body transformed radically when she was diagnosed with a blood clot in her brain, the result of changing birth control medications combined with obesity. “It was extremely painful both physically and emotionally,” she said.
Then a sophomore in college, Fahey left school for eight months of recovery. “My eyes hurt, I couldn’t hear that well, I was very sensitive to light and sound.” The artist’s mother would temper her frustration with an uplifting mantra, reminding her that the pain she was going through had a silver lining, though for a while, Fahey was unaware of just what that brightness would look like. 
“As time went on, I started to realize what the silver lining was,” Fahey said. “Me learning my health needs to be my first priority. Being healthy doesn’t mean losing weight and being skinny. It means being mindful of what you’re doing with your body.”
Oftentimes the narratives concerning “body positivity” and “getting healthy” do not overlap. Following her near-death experience, Fahey went on a strict diet and exercise regimen, attempting to love and accept her body as is along the way. There was no one goal, no simple answer. It’s this journey she documents in her “Silver Lining” series, a nuanced portrait of trying to better oneself and accept oneself at the same time. 
“My project became about loving my body while also struggling with the emotions of being fat,” she said. “It’s more complex than just, ‘I love my body!’ Some days you’re going to feel really shitty about yourself, and it’s important to me that my photography reflect that. Sometimes I feel sexy, sometimes I feel hideous. It’s okay if some days you don’t feel good.”
Since publishing the series, which was also her senior thesis, online, Fahey has been inundated with support from other women, many of whom write anonymously, who too have difficult relationships with their bodies. The experience, Fahey said, has helped her feel more confident in discussing her emotions and struggles on a larger platform, even if it makes some people uncomfortable.
“At the beginning I was really shy and timid,” she said. “It would be very scary for me to have a conversation like this. But the more I showed my work, it started to feel seamless and easy. You don’t expect people to be going through similar issues as you, but they are.”

Douglas Ridloff started composing poetry in American Sign Language when he was a teenager, after a well-known ASL poet named Peter Cook visited his high school. Fast forward 10 years, and he hadn’t done much in the way of slam poetry apart from a little dabbling. But then a friend of his invited him to an informal gathering of college students, where ASL was used to respond to challenges and prompts.
“I wasn’t interested in the first place,” Ridloff said in an interview with HuffPost. “At that time I only did ASL poetry and storytelling for fun at parties and backyard gatherings. The host who was also my friend dragged me to go to ASL Slam for the first few times, and I was sitting in the back at the bar chatting with other people and watching some performances and attempts on stage.”
Over time, he began joining in when there were gaps in performances. Gradually, he started paying more attention to the host’s approach to the craft, and began incorporating it into his own routine.
“Boom,” Ridloff said. “I found a home.”

That was in 2005, when a now-monthly gathering called ASL Slam was first founded. The show was co-hosted by ASL poets Bob Arnold and Jason Norman at the Bowery Poetry Club in New York City, where it still takes place today. Only now, Ridloff is the host. 
Ridloff says ASL Slam is mostly composed of performers from the deaf community, including native deaf individuals like himself. This marks a significant change from the program’s early years, when ASL students and others who use sign, but who are not deaf, made up a majority of the participants. 
Attendees are also likely to be people who sign, as Ridloff prefers not to have his work translated into English.
“The beauty is lost,” he said. “Think of music. If a song had its lyrics removed but the melody remains, the mood is still there, but something is lost. Or if the melody is removed but the lyrics remain, sometimes the song no longer makes sense.”
The show has gone on tour to Michigan and Austin, and overseas to France. Earlier this year, ASL Slam visited Cuba, to work closely with members of the deaf community there who are interested in creative expression.
“It was amazing to see how fast they got it and created something fresh for the audience,” Ridloff said. “They are about 50 years behind in sign language literacy. Just like the cars.”
Meanwhile, Ridloff is now performing regularly in New York City, in a medium that he says has benefits and nuances that spoken word poetry does not.
“ASL poets can create a complete poem or story by using one handshape to represent a multitude of concepts,” he said. In ASL, Ridloff explained, a single handshape can mean a different word depending on its placement of movement. The handshape for “rooster,” for example, is the same as the handshape for “car.”
“Maybe you could compare rhyming or alliteration to that concept, but that’s just something not experienced in spoken English,” Ridloff said.
People who sign ― including ASL poets like Ridloff ― also use facial expressions and other “non-manual markers” to communicate the equivalent of volume or inflection. A head tilt, nod or shake will provide tonal context for the words that are signed, marking the difference between a declarative statement and an inquiry. Raised eyebrows indicate questions; lip movements indicate superlatives. 
This, he says, contributes to the “spherical” or nonlinear nature of ASL poetry. “Spoken English can be non-linear too, but what it cannot do is exemplify three, four things at the same time,” Ridoff said.
So, for him, what began as a passing hobby has evolved into its own unique art form.

Warning: Some spoilers ahead.
There are three leading men at helm of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a show that centers more frequently on the horrific experiences women endure in a theocratic dictatorship known as Gilead.
Each male character probably consider himself a “good” man: The commander (Joseph Fiennes) would argue that any his so-called faults ― and there are many ― pale in comparison to his devotion to a greater future, which he is engineering for all of humanity. Nick (Max Minghella) would claim powerlessness, for he is, after all, just a driver, incapable of truly saving the woman he’s falling in love with. He might be a spy for the men who’ve made this hellish existence reality, but he chooses not to inform on Offred (Elisabeth Moss), or June as she was once known.
And then there’s Luke.
Luke, played by British actor O-T Fagbenle, has escaped the dystopia that’s ensnared his wife June and turned her into a sexual slave for fearful misogynists. He reluctantly crossed the U.S. border into Canada, nearly dying in the process, eventually finding his way to a settlement known as Little America. By Episode 7 of the series, he’s lost his partner, his daughter, and ― unable to be the savior he’d probably imagined he could be; escape was his only means of reuniting with his family ― he’s stuck in limbo. In Canada, he’s begging officials to update him on the status of June, to help him locate her and their daughter, rescue them, bring them to safety. 
In Margaret Atwood’s book, the source material for Hulu’s series, Luke is but a figment of Offred’s memories. The Luke of the TV adaptation, however, has been given a heftier storyline, a little bit more agency in this stomach-churning universe that’s made life an existential nightmare for nearly everyone involved. Still, showrunner Bruce Miller and the series’ writers held back ― they didn’t turn Luke into a hero. In fact, even in Offred’s memories, he’s the imperfect feminist ally. He, like so many others, turned a blind eye to the creeping acts of sexism and violence around them. He wasn’t painted as a key member of the resistance; instead, when the world was falling apart, he attempted to quell June’s fears with the standard motto of masculinity: “I’ll take care of you.” These murmurs of imperfection are hardly indictments. “Good” men can be patronizing, the series makes clear. “Good” men can be fail to be heroes. 
Ahead of Episode 7, which was released on Wednesday, HuffPost spoke to Fagbenle about his character’s evolution. Check out our conversation about male feminists, Little America and populism below.
What was it about the character of Luke that drew you to the show?
To be honest, my first draw to it was the source material and the script that’s so profound, so important, so beautiful. And then to work with Elisabeth Moss, Bruce Miller, Reed Morano. I was like, I’m a fool not to be a part of this journey. But Luke is the one guy you meet outside of Gilead, and represents the counterbalance to the men who’ve bought into that system. I was really intrigued by that.
We experience Luke in two ways throughout the series ― first, through Offred’s memories, which seem dream-ified, maybe a little bit idealized; second, through the scenes that show Luke’s perspective on what happened during and after he and June are separated. As an actor, did you approach these scenes differently?
I think I had to approach each moment as if I was there and responding to everything, because there’s no real way of me playing someone else’s dreams, that you don’t know about. I just have to play my truth in that moment and hope that reads. For me it was more of a continuum.
Having read Margaret Atwood’s book, were you happy about the ways Bruce Miller adapted Luke’s character for the show? Were you excited about anything in particular?
You know, I’m an actual fan of the book. I can’t recommend enough to your readers to actually go and read the book. Don’t worry about spoilers, just go and read the book, because it’s amazing. It’s nourishment for the soul. So as a fan of the book, I’m very protective of it as well. What’s amazing about what Bruce and his extraordinary imagination has done is it’s taken the book and I think in ways fulfilled it visually. In terms of Luke, he’s taken scant lines, little whispers of Luke from the book, and helped create something ― along with Lynn [Renee Maxcy, who wrote Episode 7] ― and expand on Luke and the world in such a satisfying way. That’s one of the things I enjoyed so much about reading the script, because I have so many questions about this world and I’m so excited about this world. I’ve still got more questions I want answered and luckily we live in an age where there is a medium that can help fulfill my infatuation with the novel.
Episode 7 is such an intense episode for your character. How did you conceive of the emotions Luke’s going through at the time of his and June’s separation, when he’s forced to cross the border into safety himself, leaving his family behind?
I think the two main tools actors have are the imagination of what other people have gone through, to connect with and through research, and there’s one’s own experience. I think what was challenging about Episode 7 was trying to draw on everything I could to try and navigate my way through each scene. Fundamentally, that’s when you’ve got a great script and a great director and a great crew and actors opposite you.
Did Bruce Miller or any of the directors/producers prep you and the rest of the Episode 7 cast on what this “Little America” represented to the story? In terms of what morale would be like there, what quality of life looked like, what the goal of the establishment was?
There were discussions about that. Luckily, Floria [Sigismondi], our wonderful visionary director, her and I would sit in this cute vegan diner in Toronto and hash over our ideas about what Little America was and how long Luke had been there and what he’d been doing ― why he was there ― and kind of emotionally fulfilling what that place is. Ultimately, I think for Luke and others like him, it turns out to be a very well-funded and resourceful place for refugees. And unfortunately, a lot of the refugees in our world don’t get such a haven.
A lot of Americans today are drawing pretty frightening parallels between the show and what’s happening in politics today ― as a Brit, do you see parallels between the show and real life beyond America?
There are so many things to take from the show. I think there’s questions of populism and charismatic leaders, and what happens when we abandon logic and empiricism about fundamental principles about creating a society, and instead, attach ourselves to fear and xenophobia and non-rational principles. And we can see consequences of that in lots of societies around the world. We can see the consequences of that inside families. I think there’s lots to be see in terms of the dynamics between the powerful and the powerless ― how structures can maintain those and normalize those, to the extent that we actually think those imbalances and inequalities in our society are inherent in them, when actually they’re not. They’re created by powerful people to maintain their power. It’s important for all of us to recognize and fight against those forces.
Another one of the interesting aspects of “The Handmaid’s Tale” show I wanted to talk to you about is how the show is able to explore this idea of “good” men as “bad” feminists. There are a few scenes that stick in my mind: For example, when June and her college friend Moira are panicking after they’ve been fired from their jobs and lost access to their bank accounts, Luke says to June, something along the lines of “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you.” He doesn’t mean in it a malicious way at all, but it is, in a way that Moira points out, dismissive of what’s really happening. Later on, when Luke asks June if she and Moira ever fooled around in college, it’s posed as an innocent question, but certainly a problematic one ― and you can tell that’s the case by June’s incredulous and amused response. Ultimately, the show allows Luke to be this imperfect character. So I’m wondering, when you were preparing for the role, was this something you thought about? About how a lot of “good” men would potentially fail to become heroes when a regime like Gilead first took control?
Right. We all fail and we all have weaknesses. I think that’s what helps us relate to characters we see on TV or read in books, is that we recognize our frailties within them and maybe don’t feel so alone. We get learn from their mistakes. Talking about that scene, when he says “Don’t worry, I’ll look after you,” I really love that scene as well, because it’s tough sometimes for men to know how to talk about feminism. It’s also sometimes hard for people to talk about the prejudices against minorities ― any number of things that you’re not necessarily experiencing yourself. But that doesn’t mean the conversation can’t take place. I find that very interesting, because we see how difficult it is [in the show] and also how incumbent it is on men ― and all of us, really ― to become more aware of the historical and present social context of what you say. The context of Luke saying, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you,” is insensitive and betrays a lack of understanding about what real women around him are going through. It’s so exciting to be able to explore those things and share them with people who I’m sure can relate.
Hulu has renewed “The Handmaid’s Tale” for a second season. What are you most eager to see as the series moves beyond Atwood’s book?
There are so many questions raised in the book. I want to know ― and this is personally, I don’t know if this will be in the second series ― I want to know about the colonies. I want to know more about the outside world. I want to know more about Canada and the world outside of Gilead. And, of course, just give me more Elisabeth Moss, please. Because I could watch her for weeks, months.

Photojournalism is far removed from its glory days ― the so-called Golden Age of the 1930s to 1960s ― when photographers toted Leicas and experimented with the first flash bulbs. Back then, behemoths like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and other founding members of Magnum Photos dominated the field, delivering onto the public historic images of military events, far-away countries, and images of the world people would otherwise never see.
Decades later, after magazines began to decline in popularity, so too did the prestige of photojournalism. Nonetheless, those left on the front lines of professional photojournalism are still responsible for capturing some of the world’s most captivating images. Take, for example, Associated Press photographer Burhan Ozbilici’s photo snapped seconds after the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey. 
“Photojournalism is responsible for dictating how the general public sees the rest of the world,” documentary photographer Daniella Zalcman told HuffPost. “The photos in our newspapers and magazines expose people to issues and places and individuals they’ll likely never interact with personally.”
However, much like the early days of Cartier-Bresson, Capa and co., another aspect of the photojournalism scene has persisted: The majority of our chief storytellers are also still white men, Zalcman explained.
According to The New York Times, women have consistently accounted for only 15 percent of the entries to the prestigious World Press Photo awards in the last five years. Furthermore, around 80 to 100 percent of the images contained in publications’ roundups of most significant photos in 2016 belonged to male names. Incredible (and mostly white) female figures like Margaret Bourke-White, Dorothea Lange and Inge Morath managed to overcome the stale assumptions of their time ― that women couldn’t handle the necessary equipment or fend for themselves in conflict-ridden areas. Yet their success stories can register as outliers today.
Women in the 21st century aren’t getting the most valuable assignments from wire services, newspapers or magazines, Zalcman told the Times, suggesting that gender disparities in the industry are alive and well. She cited a few obstacles contemporary women photojournalists face in particular, such as biased hiring practices, a gender-based confidence gap, the difficulties of balancing personal lives with careers, and sexual harassment in the field. 
In an attempt to help women overcome these obstacles ― and educate publications unaware of the many, many female photojournalists available for hire ― Zalcman founded Women Photograph, a database promoting 400 women photojournalists from 67 countries across the globe. Described as “a resource for female* documentary and editorial photographers and the people who would like to hire them,” the site links directly to the portfolios of women from Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Cameroon, Chile, Russia, Canada and beyond. It also provides resources and grant information to aspiring photographers who might frequent the page.
(The asterisk denotes that “gender nonconforming, transgender, and genderqueer friends are all welcome” on the site.)
“We can’t just look at war and politics and human rights stories through the eyes of men,” Zalcman told HuffPost. “If we want to be responsible storytellers, our community needs to be as diverse as the voices it represents.” 
Zalcman is aware that a mere list of female photojournalists won’t erase the gender-based obstacles women encounter in their line of work. But “Women Photograph” is a succinct retort to any editor who claims not to know any women in the business. 
Below is a preview of some of the photojournalists on display at “Women Photograph.” To see more photojournalism from women today, head to the database here.

Ben Platt, who you might remember as scene-stealing Benji in the “Pitch Perfect” movies, stopped by “The Late Show” on Monday to perform a song from his Tony-nominated musical “Dear Evan Hansen.” And like the utter Broadway professional that he is, he managed to pull a standing ovation out of the studio crowd.
In fact, following Platt’s faultless rendition of “For Forever,” host Stephen Colbert reemerged onstage with an appropriately stunned smile, appearing like he was about to burst into tears. (According to the Late Show’s YouTube account, he did cry.) Shaking his head, his disbelieving response represents only a fraction of the emotional fallout theater audiences have encountered after seeing Platt sing it live on Broadway.
“Dear Evan Hansen” is far away the favorite to nab the Tony for Best Musical this year, just as Platt is the frontrunner for a Best Actor statue. The show centers on the eponymous high school senior with social anxiety disorder who becomes mistakenly bound to a fellow student who committed suicide. The New York Times described it as “a nightly display of almost unbearable anguish.” 
Tickets to the musical are hard to come by, but we’ll all get a sneak preview of the “Hansen” cast on June 11, when the Tony Awards ceremony airs on CBS. In the meantime, check out “For Forever” above.

“I am furious and dumbfounded,” Oregon-based theater producer Michael Streeter wrote on Facebook last week. “The Edward Albee Estate needs to join the 21st Century.”
The short statement ― totaling just over 50 words ― claimed that the estate of the late Pulitzer-winning playwright had withdrawn the rights to his play “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” disallowing Streeter from staging the well-known production in Portland. Its reason, according to the post? Streeter had cast a black actor in the supporting role of Nick.
“The Albee Estate called and said I need to fire the black actor and replace him with a white one,” he added. “I refused, of course.”
According to The New York Times, a spokesperson for the Albee estate maintains that it hadn’t exactly withdrawn Streeter’s permission to stage the play ― namely because it hadn’t provided explicit permission to begin with. But the spokesperson did confirm the crux of Streeter’s statement: It indeed objected to the casting of a black actor in the play.
“It is important to note that Mr. Albee wrote Nick as a Caucasian character, whose blonde hair and blue eyes are remarked on frequently in the play, even alluding to Nick’s likeness as that of an Aryan of Nazi racial ideology,” spokesperson Sam Rudy allegedly wrote in a letter to Streeter. “Furthermore, Mr. Albee himself said on numerous occasions when approached with requests for nontraditional casting in productions of ‘Virginia Woolf’ that a mixed-race marriage between a Caucasian and an African-American would not have gone unacknowledged in conversations in that time and place and under the circumstances in which the play is expressly set by textual references in the 1960s.”
“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf,” a widely adapted play, centers on husband-and-wife duo George and Martha, whose lack of marital bliss becomes the central conflict of a night of drinking with a younger couple, Nick and Honey. First staged in 1962, Albee ― known to demand creative control over various productions of his play ― originally conceived the play’s characters as white, including, as Rudy pointed out, a description of Nick that involves the word “blond.”
Streeter, in a subsequent Facebook post, explained his “color-conscious” casting choice further:
I believe casting Nick as black adds depth to the play. The character is an up and comer. He is ambitious and tolerates a lot of abuse in order to get ahead. I see this as emblematic of African Americans in 1962, the time the play was written. The play is filled with invective from Martha and particularly George towards Nick. With each insult that happens in the play, the audience will wonder, ‘Are George and Martha going to go there re. racial slurs?’ There are lines that I think this casting gives resonance to, such as the fact that his (white) wife has ‘slim hips’ and when he says he’s ‘nobody’s houseboy’. He is a biologist and it is suggested that he is looking to make everyone the same. (Nazism and Arianism is implied, but never specifically mentioned.) This could be a reasonable goal or fantasy for an African American biologist in 1962 for the distant future. 
He went on to say that he does “not question the motives of those that made the decision” on behalf of the estate, adding that he believes “they have some fealty to a sense of integrity to Edward Albee’s desires.”
“But I had hoped the negative aspects of Albee would die with him,” he concluded. “All I did was post a very short Facebook rant about my disappointment in their decision. I think they made the wrong one. I think the benefits of casting Nick with an African American Actor outweigh the drawbacks.”
Streeter also acknowledged that the estate had not yet granted him full rights to stage the play at Shoebox Theater, in a production originally scheduled for this fall; rather, his ability to move forward rested on receiving casting approval from the estate. 
The Times noted that Albee had previously issued concern regarding the potential casting of a black actress as Martha, the daughter of a college president: “That would instantly raise a lot of questions, since it’s a totally naturalistic play,” he said. “Is this a black college? Do we have a black president of a white college? Not very likely.” According to The Guardian, Albee also took action in order to halt a version of the play with two gay couples.
The estate’s refusal to grant rights to Streeter has reinvigorated conversations about colorblind and color-conscious casting in theater ― the latter technique being one that was famously employed by Lin-Manuel Miranda’s production of “Hamilton.” Several theater fans even remarked on seeing “Virginia Woolf” with actors of color before.
Streeter himself wondered whether or not the casting of an interracial couple in particular was the sole reason for the estate refusing to grant rights. “I think if I had proposed an all black cast they may have been more open to approving it,” he wrote. Still, the estate’s reasoning fell flat for many.
“The reasoning, if that’s quite the word, of the Albee estate doesn’t seem to be simple racism,” Scott Simon explained on NPR. “It sounds like convoluted racism.”
“This is terrible,” journalist Mark Harris wrote on Twitter. “I don’t know if this reflects Albee’s wish. If it does, that wish should not have survived him.”
The husband of the actress originally cast as Martha in Streeter’s production took to Facebook to post his reaction, too:
“While we are Whitewashing our movies and pop culture on a daily basis (Emma Stone as Native Hawaiian in ‘Aloha,’ Zach McGowan as a native Hawaiian, David Carradine as a Chinese man in ‘Kung Fu’?! and how about JESUS CHRIST as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, white guy?!?!) we have a responsibility to #Resist these weak excuses for allowing racism to exist.”
UPDATE: In an email to HuffPost, Streeter explained that he believes the recent coverage of his play has amounted to a “new and ongoing discussion of the issues of authorial control, particularly after the author’s death, and diversity in casting. I see these as positive developments.” When asked whether there have been any other developments in the story since news of the Albee estate’s decision broke, he added that he is “pursuing a new play to produce. It will take some time.”
HuffPost has reached out to the Edward Albee estate by way of the Edward Albee Foundation for comment and will update this post accordingly if and when we hear back.
Artist and activist Robin Bell has captured the nation’s attention with his provocative light projections, cast across the facades of high-profile political buildings across the United States.
His most recent artistic interventions, executed late into the night on May 17, used the exteriors of the Department of Justice and FBI building as canvases. You might have been paying too much attention to Trump’s travels in Saudi Arabia to notice, but the images are pretty hard to miss: Bell projected Attorney General Jeff Sessions dressed as a Klansman in a white hooded robe adorned with the Ku Klux Klan insignia. 
#SessionsMustGo projecting now at the DOJ. #fireSessions #WeNeedToSeeTheMemo 📽 https://t.co/pEuQBmvE0N
The image tears into Sessions for past allegations of racist remarks and his present potential meddling in James Comey’s recent firing.
His image was framed by text snippets including “#SessionsMustGo” and “FireSessions,” as well as the line “I thought the KKK was OK until I learned that they smoked pot” ― an approximation of a statement Sessions made in the 1980s. 
So....this is being projected right now onto the DOJ building in Washington, DC.  And Sessions really did say that.  #SessionsMustGo pic.twitter.com/PE4bIDCKlZ
Bell also projected images of politicians including Rex Tillerson, Nikki Haley and Scott Pruit, endowing them with truly haunting black demon eyes. Messages including “#WeNeedToSeeTheMemo” and “Impeach” flashed alongside them.
The artist also flashed a silhouette of a figure behind bars, accompanied by the phrase: “1/3 of black males can’t vote because of the war on drugs.”

Just last week Bell also made headlines for his work projecting “Pay Trump bribes here” and “Emoluments welcome” onto the exterior of Trump International Hotel in New York, attacking Trump’s questionable business ties with foreign governments.
An earlier work depicted the simple phrase: “Experts agree: Trump is a pig.”
Bell’s work provides simple yet searing messages of resistance where Trump and his team are sure to see them. As he told HuffPost in an earlier interview: “Maybe in the history books, it’ll show that we were not for this.” 
We look forward to seeing where the vigilante light artist strikes next.

Jean-Michel Basquiat, hailed as the first black art star to break through New York’s predominantly white gallery world, made history on Thursday when his untitled painting sold for a heart-stopping $110.5 million. After the record Sotheby’s sale, the late Basquiat ― who died at age 27 in August 1988, in the midst of a meteoric career ― officially became the highest selling American artist at auction.
Born in Brooklyn in 1960, Basquiat has often been described in terms of what he was and what he managed to become ― long before he dethroned Andy Warhol as America’s most expensive maker of art. “How did a young graffiti rebel go from selling drawings for $50 in 1980 to having a painting come up for auction this week at a staggering $60 million?” The New York Times asked ahead of the May 18 sale.
Even when he was alive, critics gawked at his rise from homelessness and unemployment to unfathomable celebrity status, selling single paintings for five figures when he was just 24 years old. The artist himself spoke openly of his fractured past, of the domestic abuse he experienced as a child at the hands of his Haitian father or the bouts of mental illness suffered by his Puerto Rican mother. He was exposed to art and foreign languages at a young age (he was famously fluent in French, Spanish and English), excelling at both, but as a teen he ran away from home and dropped out of high school.
He was reportedly selling T-shirts and postcards on the street shortly before he and a friend adopted the shared pseudonym SAMO, spreading their graffiti tag across SoHo ― a neighborhood flush with the galleries and gallerists they needed to take notice. This technique was how Basquiat rose: by making his work impossible to miss.
Basquiat painted his $110.5 million painting when he was just 22 years old. By then, he’d already scrawled “SAMO IS DEAD” on a wall in lower Manhattan, announcing the end of the collaboration that first brought him to New York’s attention. He’d already gone to lengths to rub elbows with artists, writers and other fixtures of the era ― Warhol, “TV Party” host Glenn O’Brien, Blondie, David Bowie, art dealer Larry Gagosian. He’d already brought his explosive body of work ― a punkish blend of Neo-expressionism and primitivism that involved wild colors, manic brushstrokes and skeleton-like faces and bodies ― into galleries for critically acclaimed solo shows. His art (thousands of paintings and drawings), his words, his body, even his hair, soon became part of the very bedrock of pop culture at the time.
O’Brien, who wrote the film, “Downtown 81,” starring Basquiat, put his popularity in perspective: “Basquiat’s got fans like Bob Marley’s got fans.”
His ascent to art stardom was swift, but decades after his death, Basquiat’s legacy is much grander; the undeniable impact he had on the art world is more impressive than his quick ability to infiltrate it. He worked tirelessly in those few years, performing and networking and making art, to ensure that his vision was acknowledged ― a vision that involved bright condemnations of America’s racist past and its history of police brutality, as well as celebrations of black heroes and events otherwise missing from gallery walls. He used reclaimed materials and graffiti techniques to wedge politics into these pristine spaces.
One work in particular, “Defacement (The Death of Michael Stewart),” memorialized the death of a black graffiti artist who was beaten to death by New York City police. “It could have been me,” Basquiat said, in a phrase that reverberates now. “It could have been me.”
Before he died of a heroin overdose, Basquiat maintained complicated relationships with the segregated art world illuminated in his obituaries. “Ultimately, Basquiat would be the only black artist to survive the graffiti label, and find a permanent place as a black painter in a white art world,” one reads. Today, his place in that world is often used as a prism through which we can view the contemporary art establishment ― how it’s changed and how it hasn’t.
“There was no not seeing Basquiat. He was everywhere and made sure everyone saw him,” Jordan Casteel told The Guardian. “Today it is going to be the same, there is no not seeing. You will see us. We as black artists will continue to fight for that visibility, and we can do that, but, it is also going to mean that the ‘mainstream’ art world has to accept that there are more than a few and there is some true talent out there.”
Nearly 30 years after his death, Basquiat’s work, and his work ethic, are far from being forgotten. He’s bested Warhol, posthumously exceeding the auction prices of other “quintessentially American” (read: white and male) artists like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Robert Rauschenberg. While Warhol’s pop art embraced the sheen of consumerism, allowing wealthy buyers to feel like they were in on his jokes, Basquiat’s violent canvases critiqued power, colonialism and class conflict, rarely letting viewers who really looked off the hook.
The art market and the institutions that support it have a long way to go in terms of inclusion ― and, in many ways, they provide a fun-house reflection of the U.S. and its slow work toward the same thing. But it the meantime, the market has crowned Basquiat as the ultimate American artist, and for that, we’re thankful. 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated Basquiat’s year of death as 1998; he died in 1988.

Candles, yogurt, rosé, and now rompers: Our capitalistic marketplace overflows with desirable, fun products that suffer from their association with women. Fortunately, businesses have found a way to market their goods to both women and men: bro branding. (”Bronding”?)
We’ve had mandles, brogurt, brosé, and now the latest example, the RompHim™, a short jumpsuit for men. The RompHim launched via Kickstarter this week and quickly drew derision from Twitter wits. Men in rompers! Imagine!
The summer romper, a cute number that typically looks like a sundress with shorts instead of a skirt, has firmly established itself in the past few years as a popular option for women. Though nearly impossible in bathroom contexts (nothing like hovering naked over a public toilet with one’s entire outfit pooled around one’s ankles to induce skepticism of the trend), it’s otherwise quite convenient. Women can have all the flirty style of a short sundress without the fear of stiff winds, bicycling and sitting cross-legged. 
Both men and women have rocked jumpsuits before this latest romper bubble, but the sudden popularity of ruffled, floral jumpsuits for women seems to have tainted the style’s gender-neutral reputation. Many of the recent Twitter jibes directed at the garment centered around the absurdity of a man dressing like a woman ― showing up to a date wearing the same romper as his female counterpart, preening himself over his cute new look, etc. 
There’s a genuine merit to the RompHim™ approach: Rompers are convenient (probably even more so for men, who will be able to pee in a romper without disrobing), and they’ve become ubiquitous in women’s fashion but not men’s. But it’s infuriating that advertisers have come to rely on artificial layers of masculinization to convince men to buy products that should be gender-neutral. 
Pink wine? That’s girl stuff. Brosé, though, that’s something for bros. Yogurt is something ladies in grey hoodies eat to maintain their svelte figures in between mothering and wifing, but brogurt is powerful, protein-packed nourishment for men. Scented candles are chick tchotchkes, but a mandle redolent of freshly mown football fields is perfect for your man cave. The products are marketed directly at men who actually want scented candles, rompers and rosé, but who fear their very masculinity will come into question if they indulge.
Even as feminists chip away at the socially constructed gender roles that men and women have long felt obligated to perform, male anxiety seems more pervasive than ever. While women feel empowered to lean in to male roles ― and styles ― men battle internal and external pressure to protect a male-only space that distinguishes them from the “weaker” sex. Women today wear pants, Oxford shoes and shirts, and menswear-inspired everything; it’s still rare to see a man in a skirt, and many even find men in shorts to be laughable. Our conception of what men can wear remains as narrow as it was 50 years ago, if not more so. 
her: romperhim: ROMPHIMher: shirthim: SHIMTher: pantshim: MANTSher: waterhim: BROATER.. FOR MEN
In the past, activists have mocked the pinkification of products to appeal to women ― perhaps most hilariously, Bic for Her ballpoint pens ― but apparently when women buy basic, mainstream products, men become embarrassed to consume the same things. It’s not too hard to get women to buy gender-neutral items (or even male-coded ones: think of the popularity of “boyfriend” jeans). After all, liking and using things men like and use can result in higher status for women. Drink whiskey, watch football, down a plateful of wings ― as long as you’re hot, you’re the perfect woman, and even if you’re not a solid nine, your choices will at least be deemed respectable.
It’s men who nurture the more acute anxiety about gender neutrality. (This makes sense; in a world divided neatly into men and women, men have almost uniformly gleaned the advantages from this demarcation.) A man watching “Real Housewives” with a glass of zinfandel in a romper is flouting gender norms, but by adopting the lesser-respected female-coded habits. His wine and outfit need to be placed in a separate, more macho category than the identical versions consumed by women. “Don’t worry,” says a carton emblazoned with the name Powerful Yogurt, “just because you’re eating yogurt like a lady doesn’t mean you’re effeminate! You’re still the man here.”
A 2016 follow-up on brogurt noted that brands like Powerful Yogurt were going “gender-neutral”: “[Excluding women] was a risk,” said one executive of their male-focused advertising. Was it, though? Women have always been OK buying products coded as male ― even as men run screaming from anything pink or cute. RompHim suggests their men’s cut rompers as a good option for women who prefer a unisex silhouette; the reverse of that two-birds-one-stone approach would never work out. 
The veritable rash of bro-ified terms for non-gendered products shows how deep male fragility runs: A man’s manhood requires constant signaling and buttressing to remain secure. Men who step out of line are derided as emasculated and sexually confused. For men to reap the benefits of a gender-neutral world, we rely on verbal tricks that only reinforce the gender-normative stereotypes that keep men boxed in. The real progress will be made when men can drink rosé in a romper without a single batted eyelash or “bro” prefix.

Longtime Margaret Atwood followers are having a great year.
First, Hulu’s adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale arrived to rave reviews, seemingly providing America with the timely dystopian cautionary tale it needed. Now, Netflix is hopping on the Atwood train with its own miniseries based on the author’s book Alias Grace. 
Published in 1996, the work of historical fiction centers on the very real deaths of Thomas Kinnear and his pregnant mistress/housekeeper Nancy Montgomery, allegedly murdered by two of Kinnear’s servants, Grace Marks and James McDermott in Upper Canada, a region that is now Ontario. Both were convicted, although the guilt of Marks ― often described as an attractive young woman ― has been feverishly questioned, so much so that she was exonerated after 30 years in prison.

Atwood fictionalizes the 1843 murders in a 468-page story that addresses big, familiar themes like female villainy and how class stratification affects criminal justice. A 1996 review from The New York Times describes the weighty nature of the book well:
“Alias Grace” has the physical heft and weighty authority of a 19th-century novel. In its scope, its moral seriousness, its paradoxically ponderous and engrossing narrative, the book evokes the high Victorian mode, spiced with the spooky plot twists and playfully devious teases of the equally high Gothic ― the literary styles of the period in which the book is set.
According to Entertainment Weekly, “True Blood” favorite Anna Paquin will take on the role of Montgomery, while Sarah Gadon (who was recently in Hulu’s “11.22.63”) will play Marks. Ker Logan and Paul Gross will play the men ― McDermott and Kinnear, respectively. Edward Holcroft will play the fictional doctor added into the story by Atwood.
The miniseries, written and produced by Sarah Polley and directed by “American Psycho” veteran Mary Harron, is set to debut this fall.
This sort of makes up for the fact that HBO dropped Darren Aronofsky’s already-written adaptation of Atwood’s “MaddAddam” trilogy. Can someone jump on that, please?
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article mistakenly described “11.22.63” as a Netflix show. It is a Hulu project.
In 2012, artist Sherrill Roland received a call from a detective with a warrant for his arrest. Roland was an art student at the time, preparing to begin graduate school at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Roland, who claimed he had not committed any crime, was in utter disbelief.
He showed up for his trial in October 2013, five days after turning 29. Roland was accused of four misdemeanors and was found guilty on all counts. A D.C. judge sentenced him to 13 months in prison. 
Roland spent just over 10 months in the Central Detention Facility, a space described by lawyers as a “human-rights disaster.” A 2015 report prepared by the Washington Lawyer’s Rights Committee for Civil Rights and Urban affairs described the prison’s condition as “alarming,” citing potentially dangerous structural problems like pests, mold and crumbling walls.
The account concluded that the “appalling conditions of confinement in D.C. prison facilities, especially in light of their disproportionate impact on African-Americans, are a key criminal justice and civil rights issue in Washington, DC.” Black men, including Roland, make up approximately half of the incarcerated population. 
Roland was freed from prison in August 2014. One year later, however, new evidence emerged that ultimately proved his innocence. The judge who’d overseen his trial two years earlier threw out the convictions, and all records of his arrest and prosecution, at Roland’s request, were sealed. In an effort to move forward, those convictions are no longer disclosed or discussed by Roland or anyone else involved with the case.
It was as if his entire incarceration had never happened ― to everyone except Roland himself and the people who love him. 
Despite the fact that Roland’s wrongful conviction was expunged from his record, the experience left him shattered and confused. He wondered, “If I’m not the same person I was, who am I now? Who is the new me?” Ultimately, he decided to address this seemingly irresolvable question, of how to return back to art school after incarceration, through art. 
In an ongoing social justice performance piece titled “The Jumpsuit Project,” Roland wears an orange jumpsuit to spark conversations about incarceration and its impact on individuals, families and communities. He started wearing the suit after returning to UNCG in 2016. Unsure of how to re-enter the academic safe space after serving prison time, he opted to wear his experience and his trauma on his sleeve.
It’s jarring to see a man in a orange jumpsuit roaming public spaces. Roland told HuffPost that confused bystanders occasionally asked him where his guard was. This level of discord is heightened on college campuses, known for their insularity. The same goes for the art institutions where Roland occasionally performs. When he enters a museum, he explained, “the vibe changes instantly.” The suit manipulates the space in which it exists, making room for new, often intimate, interactions between virtual strangers. Strangers approach Roland to discuss his experiences and share their own, chipping away at the estrangement that incarceration can bring out. 
Roland graduated from UNCG last week with a Master’s degree, and he wore his jumpsuit to receive his diploma. This month, the artist will spend three days in front of the Brooklyn Public Library, performing “The Jumpsuit Project” for participants and passersby.
Read on for an interview with Roland about the origins of the piece:
How would you describe your art before you were incarcerated? 
I had a design background. I was focused on making objects with my hands and also liked the quickness of sketching things out with digital software. When I was going into my grad school program in 2012, I was making work based off narratives from my home in Asheville, stories from my mother’s generation. 
In 2012 you were issued a warrant for your arrest. What was your life in general like before this moment? 
Going into grad school I was very focused. I thought I had everything figured out. I was going to get this MFA and go teach at a collegiate level. I planned to work on my own art during the summertime. I thought I had my path all laid out.
What was it like to receive a call from a detective requesting you turn yourself in?
I remember being at home ― it was the week before I was going to move to Greensboro. I was in my mother’s room, but she was away at the time, maybe at work or something. When I got the call I was completely shocked. It was crazy being alone and not being able to reach out to my mother when it happened. 
What were your expectations after your court hearing? Do you remember how it felt when you were found guilty? 
I had entirely expected to not be found guilty. I didn’t get any of my things in order to prepare me to go to jail. It was inconceivable. I couldn’t imagine it. I didn’t know how to plan for it. I didn’t know how it would go.
During the trial, everyone was trying to stay positive. I’ve never felt so blank-headed. I had no idea what was going on. I was so scared. It was hard to think about what could be taken away from me — everything I had accomplished, my family, my friends. Every day something new popped into my head, something I would potentially be giving up. I tried not to think about stuff like that.
During your time in jail, did you make art? 
I came up with ideas for art projects I could do while I was in there, but my perspective on art shifted a bit. I lost the taste for making things for myself. I just couldn’t do it for some reason. I drew for other inmates ― portraits of their families that they could send as gifts. It’s hard to put a value on how much those cards meant to the people receiving them. We on the inside did not have anything to give. It is really powerful creating something for someone’s significant other or child, helping them get a gift from someone who can’t obtain one any other way. I was willing to make things as long as they meant something. They had a different type of value and weight.
Did you have any other outlets to communicate or express what you were going through?
Writing was my therapeutic release. My letters going out were the only things that were not looked at. Letters coming in were opened and read, our phone and video calls were recorded. I would write at least five pages for each letter. A lot of time I was on lockdown, so I couldn’t have phone conversations. I would end up just writing and writing. I had no indication I was going to get my freedom back. I was facing the fact that I had to deal with this wrongful conviction.
Were there other habits or tactics you developed in jail to make your time there more tolerable? 
I tried to stay connected. The Washington Post circulated inside there. Somebody would find it and pass it around. I was the only one who looked at the Art and Style sections. I found ways like that, to get what I wanted. For example, most people hated vegetables but loved cake, but I hated the cake, so I traded for vegetables. I was always trying to trying to figure out ways I could succeed, ways to stay connected to who I was before I came in. 
Tell me about when you first began thinking about “The Jumpsuit Project.” 
After my conviction was overturned, I just sat at home for a very long time. I spent a long time waiting to see what I was going to do with my life. How am I going to accept this experience? I figured out how much it would cost to go around the world on a small budget. I dreamt of getting away. I had a very strong reaction against sitting still. I had been restricted in so many ways. I just wanted nobody to tell me what to do. I brought that idea and another idea to a professor of mine. The other idea, which was kind of unformed at the time, was “The Jumpsuit Project.”
What did the idea look like in its early stages? 
It came to me in a dream. It was more of a question than an idea. I’m used to thinking as a designer, so when I see a project, I see an end product. But here, for the first time, there was no answer. It was uncharted territory for sure.
Sheryl Oring was my teacher at the time. I remember going to her house being like ― What would it be like if I wore an orange jumpsuit on campus? I was contemplating ― If I’m not the same person I was, who am I now? Who is the new me? I used to think I had a certain safety on campus. I was naive. I see the world totally different now. Who am I on this campus? I felt like I carried the burden of my experience anyway. What if I just wore an orange jumpsuit?
I had trouble figuring out how to explain it, but right away she said: “That’s it. You should definitely do that.” Immediately I tried to take it back. Sometimes you get an idea and you worry it might be too much for you. You’re not sure if you can handle it. I think the first thing I said was, “Well, I have to talk to my mother first.”
What was it like re-entering your college campus wearing an orange jumpsuit? 
The very first day my teacher Sheryl walked with me to the library. It was the most terrifying thing I have ever done. I thought, I am about to step out there into this world and tell people I just went to jail. I had received my bill of innocence in 2015 and started the project in 2016, so it was all very fresh.
I remember this guy coming out of the library, checking me out, and literally walking around me. It didn’t even phase him. I have had all kinds of reactions ― people bolt the other way, people side step, give me space. Sometimes I’ve frightened people.
Do you follow specific guidelines while wearing the suit? 
There are restrictions while in my suit. I treat the academic institution like a correctional institution, so I’m not allowed to stop outside and talk. I can only go to point A and B, one classroom to the next. If you want to talk to me you have to escort me; we can’t stop and chat. But once I’m in the library or in an enclosed space, I am free to talk. Whenever that happened, people started to gather around. Mostly, as quick as I can, I tell my story. I get a lot more hugs and support than negative looks. But it happens. There are some people sneaking by me and taking pictures, people laughing. Some people clearly have no idea know what I’m doing. 
As far as the conversations go, are there certain ideas or talking points that come up again and again?
A lot of people come up and say, “My brother is going through the same thing,” or someone else in their lives. I had family members who had been locked up before, but they didn’t want to talk about it. And when I talk about my experience with my friends and family, they can’t totally get it because they weren’t there. Then I start think, Am I alone? But once I started talking, I met people who had so much to share. It opened up a whole other support system. People were willing to share so much, in fact they needed to share it, they just didn’t think they’d have an opportunity to, to talk to someone that got it. 
What misconceptions did you have about incarceration before experiencing what it was like yourself?
When I went in, I was trying to separate myself. “I’m not supposed to be in here, I am innocent, I am not supposed to be with these other guys.” I ended up realizing that I was no different than anyone. They dehumanize you in there. No one has a name. Me saying I’m innocent — well, a lot of people think they’re innocent. The correctional officers didn’t have time to hear any of that.
I remember this old timer in there, he got sentenced 20 to life for murder. He came to jail temporarily for a parole hearing and they housed him in with us. He said, “I know you say you’re innocent, but there has to be a reason why you are here. Open your eyes and see what’s here.” At first I was like, “What? That makes no sense!” But I started to take in all the people here. Everybody was going through the same things. Everyone was trying to deal with having their friends and families taken away. We were each other’s only support system.
I had this idea of what the word criminal meant. But when I was listening to this guy, who was in for murder, it was a big perspective change. Everyone in there is a human being. People have made mistakes and learned from them. When you have nothing, you need each other. One day, after I’d been wearing the same clothes for two months, some of the guys collectively got me fresh T-shirts and underwear and socks. Once I saw what goes on in jail, how we were treated, I will never forget. We need to have more conversations about it. I don’t believe anybody has to go through what I went through to get this perspective. I got my innocence restored. A lot of people don’t get that opportunity. 
You will perform at the Brooklyn Public Library. Do you expect the performance to differ from the UNCG performance in any specific way? 
I’ll alter the performance to fit a public setting. Every place has its own culture, so in a way, it’s up to the community that comes through the library. It can go a number of ways. I just hope it goes safely. I’m interested to hear the stories. It’s not always about jail itself, but about overcoming things. Sometimes it’s just about getting through a struggle.
How long do you plan to continue this project? Do you envision it changing shape in the future?
I want to take a break from the performance part and make tangible objects to go along with the performance. I have other things I want to get out. I don’t want to drop the opportunity for conversation the jumpsuit has provided. It offers a network for people to come together. I’m going to continue working on it, making it more of an entity as opposed to thinking about just me in a suit. A place where I can start organizing things. An opportunity to share.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Roland will perform “The Jumpsuit Project” from Tuesday, May 23, until Thursday, May 25, at Brooklyn Public Library’s Central Branch. Follow the project on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. 
Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet.
Following what’s been described as a “rash of suicides in southern Colorado,” a school district in the state ordered librarians to temporarily remove the book Thirteen Reasons Why from its shelves.
The YA novel, written by Jay Asher, is the source material for a wildly popular and highly contentious Netflix adaptation of the same name, about a high school girl who decides to commit suicide after compiling a series of tapes that chronicle her reasons for doing so.
The show, considered a smash success for the streaming service, has been both praised by critics for its unsettling take on teenage-centric TV and denounced by psychologists for its irresponsible depiction of mental illness. 
Teachers and parents have expressed similar concerns, claiming that the TV show glorifies and romanticizes suicide ― taking issue with the graphic depiction of the lead character’s actual suicide, which some have claimed opens the door for copycats.
In response, the curriculum director at Mesa County Valley School District in Colorado, Leigh Grasso, told her schools’ librarians to temporarily pull copies of Asher’s book from circulation. “I think we were just being cautious until we had the opportunity to look at the book and see how closely related to the movie it was,” she told The Associated Press.
According to the AP, the order “rankled some librarians who called [the decision] censorship.” Following protests, the books ― 19 of which were already checked out by students at the time ― were officially returned to circulation. 
“Censorship is a slippery slope,” one librarian wrote to the school, according to emails obtained by The Daily Sentinel through a Colorado Open Records Act request.
James LaRue, director of the American Library Associations’s Office of Intellectual Freedom, confirmed that the book Thirteen Reasons Why has been challenged by at least one other school besides Mesa County, though he declined to give details on their ongoing investigation. (The AP cited yet another school district in Minnesota, which temporarily pulled the book after a parent complained about its sexual content.)
“There are a lot of people that are terribly afraid when something like this comes out,” LaRue told HuffPost over the phone. “That when teen suicide happens in an area, sometimes they’re contagious. Every time someone writes about, it seems like there tends to be more of them. So I totally understand the fear that some parents have about this.”
However, he does not condone the decision to remove the books without due process, noting that “people have been writing about suicide because it happens. It doesn’t happen because people write about it.”
Attempts to remove the book from the school, he says, particularly in ways that bypass processes that libraries have long had in place for reconsideration, could be hurting the situation rather than helping.
“When someone comes in and complains about a book, what should happen is not that the book is immediately withdrawn, but that a committee is put together, [made up of] some parents, some teachers, some librarians, and they look at this and say, ‘Does this fit the curriculum? Does it make sense? Is this a way for us to talk about an important issue?’” he explained, adding, “I would urge schools to follow their policies and procedures, rather than have this reflexive attempt to halt discussion of other important issues.”
LaRue pointed out that the book does stand apart from the Netflix adaptation, describing the show as more “in-your-face graphic” than Asher’s novel. (Other differences between the two have been outlined here.) Still, he believes that both the TV version and the book have merit.
“I just want to leave people with this thought,” he concluded. “The popularity of the series might really save lives and so might more reading and talking about the issue. But silence won’t help us at all, and censorship is never the answer.” 

America has heard a lot from the two people closest to political staffer Huma Abedin: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom she served as a top aide, and former congressman Anthony Weiner, her estranged husband.
We haven’t heard much directly from Abedin herself, but that may change soon, as The Hollywood Reporter revealed that she is shopping a memoir.
THR reports that Abedin has been speaking to publishers about the project, which she is pricing at up to $2 million. Given her central role in Clinton’s campaign and her marriage to Weiner, whose political career was repeatedly felled by sexting scandals, that price almost seems like a bargain. Compared to celebrity book deals like Lena Dunham’s ($3.5 million) or political book advances like Hillary Clinton’s post–White House deal ($8 million), a couple million doesn’t seem outrageous.
That’s assuming Abedin plans to spill the dirt, of course. THR describes the work-in-progress as “a reflection on how her personal and professional lives collided during the campaign.” Her experience brings together two of the juiciest political stories of recent years ― Clinton’s failed presidential campaign and Weiner’s sexting scandals.
Abedin separated from Weiner, with whom she has a young son, in August after news broke that he had sexted a woman while lying in bed with his son. The couple had previously remained together after two previous scandals, in 2011 and 2013, both surrounding his sexual exchanges on social media and via text.
During an investigation into Weiner’s alleged sexting relationship with a 15-year-old girl, the FBI announced that it had turned up emails that may have been relevant to Clinton’s handling of confidential information on Weiner’s and Abedin’s devices. The revelation ― which came just days before the 2016 presidential election ― kept allegations that Clinton mishandled national security information fresh in voters’ minds and sent shock waves through the campaign.
Abedin has never spoken candidly in public about her husband’s indiscretions, defaulting to an even-keeled silence that she has attributed to her desire to protect their son. Following the dramatic manner in which his digital offenses affected Clinton’s campaign, silence may seem like a less and less viable option.

Whitewashing is a problem that has been spotlighted repeatedly since the 20th century, and the awareness of it has increased especially in the past year with the growing prevalence of whitewashing in Hollywood. Despite opposing opinions, whitewashing is a legitimate racial issue: it is an instance of American media erasing POCs’ stories and histories, removing opportunities for much-needed POC visibility and representation. Furthermore, as whitewashing removes POC visibility and representation, it is also an instance of American media affirming the stereotype that to be American is to be white.
To be clear, there are five major forms of whitewashing: first, when characters that were originally drawn or described as POCs are replaced by white characters or actors in live-action adaptations of fiction; second, similar to the first, is when POC characters are played by white actors, but the white actors pretend to be POCs (eg. blackface); third, when films based on true stories about POCs portray these stories from a white perspective, by prioritizing or privileging the white experience; fourth, is when while the majority of characters are played by actors of color, all of the major roles or most developed characters are played by white actors. (Examples for each are: The Lone Ranger, The Last Airbender, Dances with Wolves, and The Last Samurai respectively.) Finally, the fifth is arguably when most films produced by a particular industry, or of a particular genre, feature only white actors.
Recent cases of Hollywood’s live-action adaptations of originally Japanese works are just more examples of whitewashing. Let’s take a look at the following remakes: Dragonball Evolution (2009), Ghost in the Shell (2017), and Death Note (2017).
Dragon Ball is not set in Japan, but there is a basic understanding that unless made clear otherwise, all manga and anime characters are East Asian, and usually Japanese at that (even if they are blond). Dragon Ball specifically, although it is a Japanese creation, is a story inspired by a famous Chinese novel, Journey to the West. Journey to the West is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature (read: it’s a big deal), and one of its main characters is named Sun Wukong. Dragon Ball’s protagonist, Son Goku, is based on that character and his name is derived from Sun Wukong’s as well; Son Goku is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese name Sun Wukong.
Do you know what this means? This means that Dragon Ball is inherently East Asian. No, it is not set in Japan, but its narrative is inherently Asian. Asian is not white. Goku is not white. So casting Goku with a white person, is whitewashing. Furthermore, this whitewashing of Dragon Ball is also problematic because the film remake preserves only the stereotypical Asian elements where a white protagonist has an Asian mentor while no other main characters are Asian, (as in the case of Karate Kid for instance). Films like this not only plays into the stereotyping of what Asian elements are, but also suggests that even when elements of a character are Asian, the role should be given to a white person.
Similar to Dragon Ball, Ghost in the Shell is an internationally acclaimed manga and anime created by a Japanese person. Unlike Dragon Ball however, Ghost in the Shell is explicitly Japanese both in terms of its setting and its narrative.
Ghost in the Shell is, as summarized by a critic, “sacrosanct among a generation of artists, writers, animators, and filmmakers who witnessed anime’s ascendency as a cultural export”. Therefore, it’s especially outraging that Major, “a character traditionally coded as a Japanese woman working at the behest of a Japanese domestic terrorism unit” is being played by Scarlett Johansson who is undeniably not Japanese (nor Asian for that matter). However, despite the whitewashing of the lead role, Paramount’s film still sets itself within a futuristic Japan with elements from other Asian locations.
The original plot-line of Ghost in the Shell is also integral to the Japanese narrative. As comic book writer Jon Tsuei explains, both the manga and the first film were released at a time when Japan was considered the world leader in technology. Japan, after having gone from being positioned to conquer the Pacific to being forcibly disarmed, poured their resources into their economy and set a new standard by producing all the new technology. What does that mean? It means that Japan has a highly unique relationship with technology and since the story of Ghost in the Shell plays off of all of those themes, it is inherently a Japanese story. Furthermore, Major’s Japanese identity is actually integral to the story because Major struggles with her identity specifically within the Japanese society. These elements that make the story richer are all lost when the cast is whitewashed.
To make things worse, Paramount decided to try to address this anger towards whitewashing by running special effects test to make Johansson appear “more Asian” (read: CGI yellow-face). They failed. But they tried again, this time by straight-up altering the plot of the Ghost in the Shell story itself. The plot-twist of the remake is that Major is a Japanese mind in a white body. This is a change the filmmakers created in an attempt to justify whitewashing – it’s a change from the original story, the source material.
It doesn’t stop there though. As a critic on Bustle explains, “It’s not just that Major is, essentially, a Japanese mind in the body of a white person, it’s that the white body is that of someone largely considered one of the most bankable movie stars and most beautiful people in the world — someone who has become a Hollywood beauty standard. In the film, Major’s body is the ultimate desire, the pinnacle of mechanic ‘enhancements’ enjoyed by everyone in Ghost in the Shell.” In other words, Major’s white body is considered an improvement from Motoko’s Japanese one – a problematic subliminal message.
Netflix, as if eager to partake in whitewashing, shared the news of its latest original film while Paramount’s Ghost in the Shell was still being criticized. The film is Death Note, an adaptation of the popular manga of the same name. Unlike Ghost in the Shell, Netflix’s Death Note is a completely westernized version of the original (similar to the remakes of Shall We Dance? and The Ring) – the cast has no Asians and the story is set in Seattle, instead of in Tokyo.
This adjustment, however, is still problematic. The casting choices imply that an Americanized version of an Asian story means none of the cast can be Asian. Whatever happened to Asian-Americans? It is not as if there were no Asian-American actors available to be cast. Asian-American actor Edward Zo has been vocal about how he was openly told not to bother auditioning for the role of the protagonist, Light Yagami, because “they were not looking to see Asian actors for [that role]”. Asian-American actors were explicitly excluded from even being considered, despite Light Yagami, and the rest of the leading characters in Death Note, being Asian characters.
In addition, the Japanese culture is integral to the story of Death Note. For instance, the Japanese school life culture largely affects the protagonist’s motivation in becoming a serial killer. It is also notable that the epicenter of what later becomes an international problem begins in Japan, and therefore the Japanese police force leads the investigation on the protagonist’s murders with the FBI acting as the backup force, (differing from stereotypical expectations). Furthermore, L, also a main character, is a person of mixed race – he is a quarter Japanese. Therefore it is meaningful that he, a mixed Japanese person, is the world’s number one detective, relied on by every country’s police force for solving the most difficult cases. Additionally, another one of the main characters, Ryuk, is a Shinigami – a death spirit particular to Japanese religion and culture. You wondering yet how Netflix is going to “Americanize” Ryuk?
Here’s the thing; Americans cannot use the relatively positive reactions of Japanese people to justify whitewashing – in America. This is because Japan and the U.S. are very different countries demographically. While the U.S. is (for the most part) celebrated as a country of diversity, Japan generally prides itself in its apparent homogeneous population. Majority of the people in Japan are ethnically Japanese and homogeneous in appearance, and as a result there are no problems of “erasure” or “representation” like in the US – at least, not the same kind.
In other words, Japanese people looking at a whitewashed Japanese film from a Japanese perspective, wouldn’t see anything wrong with it. In their minds, the thought process may be something akin to the following: Americans are mainly white. So, a remake of any film in the US would have a white person in the lead role. Just like how a Japanese remake would have an Asian person in the lead role, since Japanese actors are usually Asian. They don’t understand the stakes like Asian-Americans and other POCs do regarding whitewashing in the US, because they have never experienced it. They didn’t grow up as an ethnic minority in their home country, wondering why almost no one in the media looked like them. They didn’t grow up questioning the validity of their identities, while POCs still do because American media teaches them that to be American is to be white. They didn’t grow up with a media that whitewashed their voices, their stories, and their histories. Hence, Japanese condemnation of whitewashing, or lack thereof, does not matter; their reaction in no way validates said whitewashing.
George R.R. Martin was just 26 when he won the Hugo Award for Best Novella, an impressive feat for such a young writer. But he was published in print over a decade before that ― in the fan mail section of “Fantastic Four #17.”
In an upcoming History channel documentary about comics, Martin says that this letter was the first time his writing appeared in print.
In a post about the letter, Entertainment Weekly notes that the “A Song of Ice and Fire” author shows an early penchant for unexpected plot twists, a staple of his own writing.
“In what other comic mag could you see things like a hero falling down a manhole,” Martin wrote. He continued to shower the issue with effusive praise:
“You were just about the World’s worst mag when you started, but you set yourself to an ideal, and, by gumbo, you achieved it! More than achieved it, in fact ― why, if you were only half as good as you are now, you’d still be the world’s best mag!!!”

The following is the transcript from a TEDx talk given on March 7th, 2017 at TEDxBergenCommunityCollege in Paramus, NJ. See the actual talk on the TEDx YouTube channel by clicking here.
Have you ever felt scared and alone? Helpless, hopeless, or worthless? Like everything is suddenly out of control?
I was in the shower when it happened to me. Water was rushing over my body, when suddenly I started shaking and sweating. Feeling unsteady, I grabbed the clear shower curtain and fell to the floor of the tub. I started crying and sobbing uncontrollably. 
I was crashing.             
I had experienced mood crashes before, having suffered through depression and anxiety on and off throughout my life, but nothing like this. I mean, this was a full on crash from outer space to the depths of the earth. It was scary. I was a wreck. I was inconsolable. I couldn’t breathe. I honestly felt like I was dying. On the floor of my bathtub. With my 6-month-old daughter a few rooms away.
I needed help urgently. So I grabbed for my cell phone, but when I went to dial 911 I accidentally took a picture, and then another, and then another. The corner of the room. A cracked mirror. The ceiling.
And the strangest thing happened. I started breathing a little easier. Suddenly, the tears slowed down. It was miraculous, or at least it felt that way. I wasn’t healed, but I could imagine getting up and getting dressed. I could imagine calling my therapist to figure out what the heck was going on.
There were a lot of things I didn’t understand about what was going on that January day, but there was one thing I knew for sure... When I picked up my baby that night, and when she looked up at me with those big brown eyes, I knew I couldn’t leave her. I knew I couldn’t miss her life.
So, I had to face it head-on, whatever it was... depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder – all of the above? This was life or death, and I wanted to choose life. I just didn’t know how.
Thankfully I had a therapist I trusted. So for about a week straight I talked to her for long periods of time while I was in crisis. And there was something we really connected on… and that something was photography, and those pictures from the bathroom floor. She was a budding photographer and was starting a photography class, and I had studied photography. I was a photography major at Ithaca College and I had actually started my own photography business.
So what she had me do was she had me follow along as she went, and I did the photography assignments that she was doing for her class, and that gave me purpose in my extremely dark days.
And it got me out of my house, even if that was just around the corner. Even if that was just to the end of my driveway or just outside my door. And we used those photos in my therapy sessions. They gave me a voice. They allowed me to express my thoughts, feelings, and emotions when I couldn’t do so with words at that time.
They helped me to express my dreams...
My fears...
Even my nightmares...
They allowed me to express feelings about abuse I had experienced, and not having a voice...
And feelings about mania and confusion...
It was a long way from the shower floor back to a somewhat balanced state. It took a couple years, and to be honest I haven’t quite made it there, but it’s not for lack of trying. And I’ve tried a lot of things, not just photography. I’ve tried doctors, medications. I’ve even been hospitalized a few times, where I’ve tried magnetic and even shock therapy, ECT. But I must, if not for me, for my husband and my daughters, now two of them. Because they mean everything to me. And I made a decision. And that decision was that ending my life was and is not an option for me, and I make that decision again each and every day of my life. And I will continue to make that decision, and I will continue to try, and I will continue to use photography as a tool during my darkest days.
But let’s go back... Join me if you will, back in 2012, in the months following my crash. I spent a lot of my time in my bed. So let’s go back to my bed. On one of those days, I decided to visit a site called WordPress.com, and for those who do not know, it is a wonderful platform for making blogs. I wanted to make a blog that would be a collaborative blog where myself and other people affected by mental illness, both themselves and through people they love (because there are so many of us), could come together and have a place, a safe place, where we could create, and we could put our photography and our stories, and support each other and feel less alone. And by putting our stories we could raise awareness and fight stigma.
I wanted to call it Broken Light Collective, because so many of us feel broken, but there can be a beauty in brokenness, and we can share this beauty and spread the light. A light of hope, a light of inspiration, a light of healing. In the words of my favorite band, the Beatles, “images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, they call us on and on, across the universe.”
The first image ever posted on the Broken Light Collective was a self-portrait.
My head in my hands, with words written upon my arms. Words of pain and words of insecurity. Words such as... Fat. Vulnerable. Humiliated. Hurt. Unworthy.
Almost immediately, the comments started coming in, and people started sending their own photos and their own stories to post on the site. And then more people started sending their photos and stories, and more people. And it continued to grow, and grow. And pretty soon it didn’t feel like just a blog. It felt like a community. And the community grew, and the community grew...
And that Broken Light Collective community now has over 50,000 people, contributors and followers, from 181 countries around the world!
But it’s not the scale of our movement that’s most amazing to me, it’s the messages we get. It’s the emails. It’s the Facebook and Instagram messages, about the daily victories...
“I would not be out of my room if it wasn’t for Broken Light. It has changed my life.” -Colin
“The two photos you posted from me, wow, I don’t fully understand the magic it worked, but you publishing them lightened my load emotionally. A lot! It’s as if being connected via your blog was the final step in my healing. Both issues - the dissociative disorder and the battered woman syndrome - have improved greatly. THANK YOU for being there.” - Mary
“I just wanted to quickly say thank you, because I have been wishing something like this existed. I feel like I have come home.” -Jen
Broken Light Collective has become a home to so many creatives. We support each other through the lows and through the highs. We get to know each other through the photos and the stories that we share.
We cried together with BPD as she lay in her hospital bed with her head in her hands in the Middle East contemplating her existence...
We empathized with Kait as her diagnosis changed from Major Depressive Disorder...
to Bipolar Disorder...
And we cheered with Brandon as he overcame anxiety and self-harm, and he went to college where he started a peer group that was inspired by Broken Light Collective and the experience, so he could share with other people the experience he’s had with Broken Light...
In 2014, Broken Light Collective became a 501(c)3 non-profit to expand our efforts and mission to continue raising awareness and fighting stigma. Our first live exhibit was in New York City at the Fountain House Gallery. It was an inspiring 7-week exhibit called “From Darkness to Light” that featured the work of 37 of our artists with mental illness from around the world.
Since then, we have had exhibits, pop-ups, and talks across the country, from New York to Texas to California.
Now, here are some of the faces of Broken Light Collective. You can see the struggle, but you can also see the light shining through.
It’s as if they’re saying it’s okay to not be okay. It’s okay to be exactly who you are as you are. You are enough. You are worthy. Worthy of love, worthy of help. Because mental health is as important as physical health. Mental health is just as important as physical health.
Because 1 in 5 of us is affected by mental illness in a given year. Look around you, 1 in 5, that’s a lot of us. And every day, each and every day, there are about 121 suicides. That’s over 44,000 in a year, in America alone. We need to do whatever we can do. Whatever we can to help support each other and save lives. We need to use whatever tools we can. And photography and Broken Light Collective those are tools we can use to support each other and save lives. Lives like these lives. Like your lives. And my life.
I will continue to use photography therapeutically, whether I am coasting or crashing, and to encourage other people to do the same. To see beauty in the world around us, especially when we’re surrounded by darkness.
And with that, I welcome you all into the world of BrokenLightCollective.com. I hope you find beauty and comfort. And if you are so inclined to do so, I hope you will pick up a camera or your cell phone or anything and create, and if you would like to, you are welcome to submit.
But before we go, I want you to take a moment and really think…
Have you ever felt scared and alone? Helpless, hopeless, or worthless? Like everything is suddenly out of control?
YOU have the power to take control. With a camera and with Broken Light Collective you can take control. You have the power to fight darkness with a lens, to fight stigma with your hands and with a camera. Using your voice, and creativity, YOU can change your life. YOU can change the life of others. YOU can change the WORLD,
one photo at a time!

For everyone who has off days, can’t get out of bed or deeply feels the futility of everyday life, there’s Gudetama, Sanrio’s fried egg who constantly wallows around giving off Resting “Meh” Face.
He’s tired, he’s lazy, and he has a cute little butt. The character is a bit enigmatic, seeming to shrug in the face of cheerier cartoon counterparts like Hello Kitty and co. Unlike those perpetually smiling characters (that is, if they have a mouth at all), he lives in a world that allows space for our less pleasant tendencies.
That acceptance — the fact that we all have a little Gudetama in us — is part of what makes the character so appealing. 
Is it the weekend yet...
A post shared by gudetama (@gudetama) on May 8, 2015 at 11:13am PDT
Dave Marchi, vice president of brand management and marketing at Sanrio, described the collection in the following statement.
The Gudetama “Museum” Collection is a design series developed for Japan and inspired by Gudetama’s visits to museums around the world. Select pieces from the series are currently available on sanrio.com; expanded distribution is in the works for later this year.
For a lazy egg, Gudetama sure gets a lot of traveling done. A Facebook post from the official Gudetama page hints that other artworks, like “The Scream” by Edvard Munch and “The Birth of Venus” by Botticelli, will soon get the Gudetama treatment, too.
If you’re a fan of the “Mona Lisa” and “The Milkmaid” images, you can grab them on postcards, memo pads, notebooks and clear files.

So, things have been getting a little stale in the studio lately, right?
If you answered “yes,” here are 10 recommendations for things you can do to try and give yourself—and yourself—the chance to reboot and feel good about your work again.
1) Revisit an influence
However you can do it—by making a museum visit, reading books or magazines or searching the web—get back to looking hard at that one key artist who always inspires you. Take some time, study the work, drink it in. Ask yourself: “What is the magic in this work?” and ask yourself how you can bring some of that magic to what you do.
2) Make the work you have never seen before
This advice comes from painter Bo Bartlett, who offered it to a group of my students during a recent Skype session. Honestly, it’s pretty simple isn’t it? Ask yourself what you haven’t seen—in the galleries, in the magazines, or anywhere else—and give yourself the license to make it.
3) Look harder at your own work
There is a kind of “DNA” in your work that encompasses all your studies, ideas and influences over time. Look hard at some work from earlier in your career and then take something from it that deserves to be revisited.
4) Take a day off
Maybe the problem is that you simply need a break. Plan a day in your favorite place, possibly (hopefully) with a great friend and a great meal. Try not to talk about art. Oh, and stay off social media for a day while you are at it.
5) Try a new medium
You don’t have to spend a ton of money on supplies: just try a some new media or materials. If you are on a budget go Rauschenberg and try junk or recycled materials. Seriously...
6) Burn a few things
Take some of the work that has sat in your studio for years and take it to the dump or—if you are in a location where it can be done safely—burn it. You will be amazed how clean you feel afterwards. Don’t put it on social media and tell your friends “I’m offering bargain prices on some old work” because then your worst work will be turning up and haunting you for years.
7) Reach out to an artist you respect
However you can do it—via e-mail, phone, or in person—contact an artist you respect. Really, don’t be shy. Let them know that you would love to visit their studio and chat sometime. They might say “no,” but if they say “yes” you may just have a life-changing experience. Be brave.
8) Lower your standards
It sounds so wrong, but it can be so right. Is it possible you have forgotten how to have fun in the studio?
9) Get rid of the best part
When asked what he did when stuck in a painting, Picasso once answered “I get rid of the best part.” Sometimes the part that you think is great is actually holding you back.
10) Please yourself
Honestly, who are you doing this for? Are you still pleasing your friends, a certain critic, your ex-partner, the public as you perceive it, or your third grade teacher who you loved?
Then stop it now and just try pleasing yourself for a change.
In June, Amazonian hero Wonder Woman will make her on-screen debut. It’ll be a big moment in the comic book movie-verse ― but also for gender parity in filmmaking.
The movie is helmed by Patty Jenkins, of “Monster” fame, and it’s the first live-action project with a $100 million budget for the director. In fact, it’s only the fourth-ever film in that price range led by a woman, including Ava DuVernay’s forthcoming adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time, and Niki Caro’s recently announced “Mulan” update.
As a point of reference, four films cost more than $200 million last year, with several more just below that mark, including “Finding Dory,” “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” “The Jungle Book,” “Warcraft” and “Independence Day: Resurgence.”
Despite the range of subjects falling into the big-budget category, it’s a longstanding boys’ club, with few opportunities for women directors ― even those most interested in typically higher-grossing genres. So for directors like Karyn Kusama, who helmed “The Invitation,” “Jennifer’s Body” and the 2000 Sundance Film Festival darling “Girlfight,” smaller projects provide opportunities to explore riskier subjects, to sharpen writing skills, and to tell stories that are potent and contained.
Which is why, when she was invited to participate in “XX,” an anthology of short horror films directed by women and starring women as the stories’ heroes ― as opposed to hapless, slashed-off victims ― Kusama was glad for the opportunity.
“I think that there’s something about short films that just kind of keeps your muscles sharp,” Kusama told The Huffington Post over the phone. “It’s sort of like running a 10k while you prepare for a marathon. I don’t get to run many marathons. I don’t get to make many features. It’s not like that’s something I can just snap my fingers and make happen. So for me, it was a way to stay nimble and keep telling stories, and even create the story, but have it be a slightly more manageable scale for everyone involved.”
Kusama’s contribution to the anthology, which had its world premiere at Sundance on Jan. 22 and enjoyed a limited release soon after, is a riff on “Rosemary’s Baby,” which she calls a “core text” of filmmaking. In her version, Rosemary Woodhouse is a woman with a 17-year-old son who, as his 18th birthday approaches, begins behaving violently, as though possessed.
“The Rosemary Woodhouse character in ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ is quite helpless, a kind of infuriating, domesticated pet. Femininity itself is used against her,” Kusama said. “And I just wanted to imagine a world where the femininity, the vulnerability, becomes the strength. The femaleness becomes the strength, not the weakness.”
Kusama emphasizes that portrayals of mothers ― especially in horror films ― too often take the “Psycho” approach, characterizing any kind of motherly strength as perverse and deforming.
“I am a mother now, and I’m a mother to a son, and I want him to go into the world a feminist. I want him to go into the world with compassion for humanity,” Kusama said. “I just know I have so much to teach my child. And I just feel kind of like, what would our world be without mothers? What would our world be without mother love? I don’t think we’d have a world.”
Among the anthology’s other contributors are stop-motion animator Sofia Carrillo, “Riot Girls” director Jovanka Vuckovic, “Southbound” director Roxanne Benjamin, and first-time director Annie Clark, aka rock musician St. Vincent.
These directors are among a bevy of women filmmakers interested in horror ― in working within the genre’s traditions, or in subverting them to better fit their own views. Since 2014, several woman-led horror features have left their mark, including Jennifer Kent’s “The Babadook,” Lucile Hadžihalilović’s “Evolution,” and Julia Ducournau’s “Raw.” And women directors are proliferating among the short film-making set, too; at last year’s Nitehawk Shorts Festival, for which HuffPost was a media sponsor, bloody crime flicks and mysterious stories of witches were highlights of the slate.
These stories, and those anthologized in “XX,” showcased the sensibilities of their makers, demonstrating the point that their movies needn’t be categorized as “women’s films,” but, rather, great films made by women.
“A lot of the films I think you could argue are particularly female in their vision. And they’re just turning out to be really good,” Kusama said. “That, to me, means there’s a kind of awakening of the general public’s attention toward this concept of the female voice, the female lens. And I think that’s just wonderful, because it means we get so many different visions of the world that we didn’t have before.”
For Clark, who describes herself as a storyteller by nature, that vision means blurring the lines between horror and humor. Her addition to the anthology, “The Birthday Party,” involves a woman dressing up her recently deceased husband in a bear costume, to conceal his death until after her daughter’s birthday party.
“To me, the saddest part of the movie is the one that makes me cackle with laughter,” Clark told HuffPost.
Elaborating on the fine line between fear and amusement, she said, “you have the same emotional exorcism, which is build up, build up, build up, tension, and very quick, sudden release. It sounds like I’m describing an orgasm. So many things work this way. It’s the same with comedy. Tension, punchline ... where are they going with this? Oh, they land it, there’s the punchline. There’s the release. They’re very linked, I would say.”
Unlike the other directors in “XX,” Clark has never directed a feature-length film ― although she plans to in the future. For her, directing a short was a launching pad for future filmmaking projects ― a common trajectory for those exploring the storytelling medium for the first time.
For Benjamin ― who’s become somewhat of a horror anthology expert, between her work on “Southbound” and “V/H/S” ― the shorter form has merits that she says feature-length films might not. Her contribution to the anthology, “Don’t Fall,” is about four friends who discover a mysterious cave painting while camping in the desert. The visitors are glib about the cultural significance of the painting, and the land in general, and their glibness comes at a cost.
“You’ve got these privileged people coming in who just tromp all over another culture without thinking about it, because they think everything is for them. But what if the land fights back?” Benjamin told HuffPost. “If you get into a feature-length version of that, then you have to start explaining why this is happening. The thing that always feels the weakest in any horror movie is when you get into the explanation of why this is happening, rather than just letting it unfold.”
“A lot of shorts in the genre space tend to be morality tales,” she continued. “If you think of ‘The Twilight Zone’ or ‘Black Mirror,’ they work because of the length that they are. These stories don’t necessarily hold as features, but they work in a short format. If you tried to put that into a feature format, it would start to get pedantic.”
So, while Benjamin’s film differs from Clark’s and Kusama’s, each director voiced merits of the short film genre, and gratitude for the opportunity to work on the project. But, Kusama expressed hope that the anthology would be a springboard, for future, better-paying work, and proof that women-led films are diverse and engaging.
“Now that we’ve gotten this first female-led anthology off the ground, I’d love for us to imagine and create a world where more of these films can exist, and women can actually pay their bills,” she said.
“I do think it’s harder to tell female stories without getting put into some kind of fantasy box. Other people’s fantasies about what women should look like and sound like,” Kusama continued. “But once you see stories that actually portray complicated women ― and I’ll go a step further and say portray complicated people generally ― we’re just excited by that. I actually think audiences are starving for it.”
The “XX” horror anthology will be available in Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD May 23 from Magnolia Home Entertainment under the Magnet Label.
This year’s Nitehawk Shorts Festival will take place Nov. 7-12 at the cinema’s location in Brooklyn, New York. Huffington Post Arts & Culture is the Media Sponsor for the festival and will provide the Huffington Post Impact Award. For filmmakers looking to submit their own short films, early submission to the festival opens on Monday, April 3. Read more about the requirements for entry here.

In a move demonstrating the uphill battle President Donald Trump will face attempting to achieve his budgetary goals, 11 House Republicans have signed a letter expressing support for the National Endowment for the Arts.
The New York Times reported on Friday that the signatories included “one Republican who previously voted to defund public broadcasting,” though none of the lawmakers were named.
The letter was sent to Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) and Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-Minn.) ― the Republican chairman and top-ranking Democrat, respectively, of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over appropriation of funds for the NEA and National Endowment for the Humanities.
Eliminating the NEA and NEH has long been a conservative pet project, but it’s also a tricky one to accomplish, even when the Republican Party controls both legislative bodies. The endowments may be favorite targets of small-government, budget-cutting hardliners, but they’ve nonetheless enjoyed support from a healthy number of Republican lawmakers over the years. 
Several GOP lawmakers expressed their support for the endowments after Trump’s bold proposal that they be eliminated entirely. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) issued a statement in March that read, in part: “I believe we can find a way to commit to fiscal responsibility while continuing to support the important benefits that N.E.A. and N.E.H. provide.” Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) commented, “I support the present level of funding for these programs.”
Arts advocacy groups likely aren’t surprised ― in fact, they’ve been counting on some level of Republican support for the arts and humanities endowments to see them through this existential threat. In March, PEN America executive director Suzanne Nossel and Stephen Kidd, executive director of the National Humanities Alliance, each cited a February letter sent by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to the president advocating for continued support of the endowments. The letter was signed by 23 other senators, including two Republicans, while others, like Murkowski and Amodei, issued separate statements endorsing the endowments.
“We are heartened by the level of bipartisan support that members of Congress have shown for the NEH in recent years and in recent weeks,” Kidd told HuffPost.
After the embarrassing withdrawal of the Trump-backed legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act last month, which foundered due to a lack of Republican support, it’s clear that even with his party controlling both the House and the Senate, Trump may struggle to achieve much of his agenda. 
Signs from G.O.P. legislators continue to suggest that shuttering the NEA and NEH will remain an unlikely victory.

Before I joined the company of Sweat in February of 2017, I hadn’t heard of Sweat at all, I was in LA shooting Ryan Murphy’s show FEUD. The first I knew of it was when the script arrived and I was asked to tape myself and send it to NY. I tried not to google too much about it, so as not to make myself nervous and allow the voices of doubt to creep in that I wasn’t up to it. Knowing it was Lynn Nottage’s play was nerve-wracking enough. We had met once seeing the same performance of “Motherfucker with the Hat” I’m sure she doesn’t remember, I wouldn’t expect her to.
Though I’m not the only actor making their Broadway debut, I am the only newbie in this production. I wasn’t involved off-Broadway at The Public. I sort of stepped into a fully formed production for the Broadway transfer. Though I come from the Theater, I’ve been luckiest in TV and honestly didn’t know if the day would ever come that I’d actually make it to Broadway. I’m beyond thankful that it has of course, but feel extra blessed that it’s this particular play. What was exceptional about jumping in like this was I could sit in rehearsals and see all the other characters’ relationships from day one, their positions in the pack and personalities within the group dynamic. Usually, these things take time to develop and make themselves known but this amazing group of actors had already performed together for months and were so tightly knit together. So I got to decide where I thought Jessie could fit into this mix. Who she might like best, who was the funniest to her, who she perhaps resented, anyone she was attracted to, who did she trust most? All the interesting things.
My character Jessie begins the play mostly drunk and in a great deal of pain that her husband of 20 years has recently remarried. She’s drowning her feelings in booze, but is a fully functioning alcoholic and always shows up at the factory for her shift. “She stays out drinking until 2 every night, and has a 7am call, but always manages to punch in on time.” There are so many different kinds of drunk, I play with those every night, belligerent, weepy, blacked-out, brassy, confused, happy drunk even and of course she can be all of those things within a scene. She’s in a place of contemplation about her life and the reality is not looking too good. And that’s before the main Drama of the play begins.
Sweat to me, is the story of hard-working Americans and their parents and grandparents who dedicated decades of their lives to American industries, factories and plants that were the backbone of towns and cities. Industries that were not supposed to go anywhere. Yet they do, businesses are outsourced for cheaper labor without any concern for the carnage they leave behind.
Sweat resonates with me because I grew up in and around blue collar towns and cities. I remember the effects of the coal mines closing in the 1980’s and how it decimated villages and towns and entire communities. Everyone was on the bread line all of a sudden. The film Billy Elliot captures it perfectly. Generations of families paid into the industries they thought would be around forever. If you make a story specific enough it can be recognized universally.

In June of 1978, artist and activist Gilbert Baker hand-dyed and stitched together eight strips of vibrant fabric, yielding a rainbow flag. 
Each color signified a certain power: pink stood for sex, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sun, green for nature, turquoise for magic, blue for peace and purple for spirit. Today, that flag ― which over time was condensed from eight colors to six ― is immediately recognizable as a symbol of LGBTQ rights and pride. 
Baker, who called himself “gay Betsy Ross,” died in March 2017, but his iconic contribution to queer visual culture lives on. In honor of Baker’s legacy, advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather has teamed up with Newfest, NYC Pride and Fontself to translate the energy and strength of the beloved rainbow flag into text. Finally, there is a rainbow font. 
The colorful type, titled “Gilbert,” is made up of the deconstructed stripes of the Pride flag, with multicolored rectangles curving and overlapping to produce lettering reminiscent of the flag’s 1970s roots. 
“We wanted to celebrate something that he created that actually changed peoples’ perception of that community,” Ogilvy creative director Chris Rowson told Dezeen. 
The blending of colors visualizes, according to Rowson, the fluidity and openness of the LGBTQ community. “We liked the idea of that crossover and that overlay, it kind of creates new things,” he said. “People aren’t just one thing, they’re not just gay, or not just transsexual, everyone can be a mixture of things.”
The font is available for free download from Type with Pride. Its creators hope the eye-catching lettering will be spread across protest posters, Pride rally banners and queer-friendly public spaces around the world. 
Queers, allies and font fanatics, get ready to write with rainbow. 
There's a moment in an historical re-enactment when you start to question reality.
For me, it came as I stood on the deck of the USS Alabama on a recent Sunday afternoon, watching two vintage Russian Yak aircraft barreling toward us low and menacing over Mobile Bay.
On the deck of the meticulously restored battleship that served during World War II, pandemonium reigned. Sailors dressed in authentic era uniforms scrambled to load their weapons with blanks, tend to the pretend wounded and extinguish simulated fires. They're part of the USS Alabama Living History Crew, who take this kind of thing pretty seriously.
How seriously? Well, for just a second, I believed the warplanes were going to take the re-enactors and their audience out in a burst of simulated cannon fire. I saw my 12-year-old son flinch. Then the warbirds pulled up and and soared south toward the ocean. The onlookers let out a collective gasp of relief.
There's no better place to learn about WWII history than a road trip to Alabama and Louisiana. It's not just Battleship Memorial Park in Mobile, Ala., that will let you experience the war in a visceral way, the way the American South demands to be experienced. A short two-hour drive away in New Orleans, you'll also find the finest museum of WWII history, The National World War II Memorial Museum. You wouldn't expect to find two such opportunities so close together outside perhaps a major world capital, yet here they are.
By itself, Battleship Memorial Park is worth the visit even without its history buffs and re-enactors. (They do their thing every other month, so you have to plan it right.) The USS Alabama, or the Mighty A as they call it here, looks as good as she did the day she was commissioned and is filled with "wow" moments -- and plenty of opportunities to lose your kids.
I misplaced mine a time or two.
While the little ones will be fascinated by the weapons, of which there are plenty, there's also enough to keep the adults occupied. Thoughtful exhibits and displays mark the walking tour of the USS Alabama. You could spend an entire day exploring the ship. The Mighty A has earned its place in history as the vessel that led the American fleet into Tokyo Bay on Sept. 5, 1945.
Most tourists come to this area to experience Alabama's famous Gulf Coast, but the battleship is a worthy day trip and a sobering reminder of the sacrifices America and its allies made during World War II -- explosions and all. For a more immersive experience, though, you have to drive west and visit the World War II museum.
Why would perhaps the world's finest World War II museum be in New Orleans, of all places? It all started as the D-Day Museum, which wouldn't have been possible without the amphibious landing vehicles built here and tested on Lake Pontchartrain by Higgins Industries. President Eisenhower credited Higgins and his boats for our winning the war in Europe. From there, the project expanded and was supported by Stephen Ambrose, a New Orleans resident and historian. Ambrose, then a professor at University of New Orleans, and Gordon "Nick" Mueller, the current museum CEO, were looking for a place to house the stories of veterans Ambrose was collecting and the memorabilia the veterans were giving to him.
So it didn't surprise us when Tom Hanks -- the executive producer of the adaptation of Ambrose's book, Band of Brothers -- showed up to narrate the spectacular Beyond All Boundaries, a "4-D" multimedia explanation of the war. This is easily one of the most compelling presentations about war I've ever seen. If you're traveling with kids, you'll want to take them here first. The fog effects, pyrotechnics and moving seats really convey the drama of the conflict and set the stage for the exhibits that follow.
My middle son, Iden, saw the medical warning that preceded the show, about the possibility of it aggravating "certain medical conditions" and asked me if we were going on a rollercoaster. But after sitting through Beyond All Boundaries he sat in stunned silence as the credits displayed. This was a rollercoaster of the mind.
It's absolutely worth checking out the signature Campaigns of Courage after you watch the presentation. The Road to Berlin follows the conflict in Germany from the Normandy invasion to Germany's surrender. A second exhibit, The Road to Tokyo, charts the same course for Japan. The exhibits are highly interactive and deeply compelling. Visitors use special "dog tags" (they're actually plastic cards) to activate displays, which tell a personal story of someone who lived through the war.
For us, one of the most sobering exhibits was on the power of propaganda, Winning Over Hearts and Minds, a short display of wartime propaganda posters. It prompted a frank discussion with my children about the subtle effectiveness of propaganda and some of its modern-day uses. You can't walk though these displays without seeing echoes of the current rhetoric used by politicians both in America and abroad.
On a southern road trip, the last thing you would expect is a reminder of the greatest human conflict. But, thanks to a restored ship, a museum built in one of the unlikeliest places, and several loud explosions, you can find one that will stay with you for a lifetime.
If you go …
Where to stayThe International House is a boutique property located a few blocks away from the WWII museum, but also close to New Orleans' famous French Quarter. The hotel, located in a former world trade center, has been carefully restored with lots of attention to detail.
What to do
Check out the Hurricane Katrina exhibit at The Presbytère, the Louisiana State Museum. It's a moving exhibit that follows this devastating hurricane and its aftermath and a testament to the city's resilience.
What to eat
You mean, what not to eat? With only two days in town, we never got past breakfast. That's Cafe Du Monde for beignets and coffee and Brennan's for one of their famous breakfasts. Try the turtle soup -- but don't forget the Sherry. I'll discuss the differences between Creole and Cajun in a future story.

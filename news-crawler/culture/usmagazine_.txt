It would have been tough for Game of Thrones to outdo the blazing excitement of the August 6 dragon-centric episode, but in the latest installment, titled "Eastwatch," they didn't even try.
Despite a strong start featuring a pair of fiery deaths (buh-bye, Tarlys), the new episode was basically an endless series of meetings in which people talked about things written on various parchments — and which not even the return of a long-lost, fan-favorite character or a surprise pregnancy announcement could liven up. 
Here's everything you need to know about the latest doings in Westeros.
Jon Snow Touched the Dragon
Sorry, shippers; that's not a euphemism for Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) finally getting it on. With Daenerys back from conquering the Lannister armies (and executing the Tarlys, who wouldn't bend the knee), Jon took the opportunity to touch Drogon the Dragon while Dany looked on with … amazement? Disgust? (She also later mentioned that she sees the dragons as her children, which means she sat up there watching while Jon straight-up caress her baby. Awkward.)
Also, thanks to the show's extremely truncated timeline, a cured Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) arrived at Dragonstone shortly thereafter and got a hug from his beloved queen for his troubles. Aww.
Arrivals and Departures … and Impending Arrivals
Word reached Jon at Dragonstone that Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) and Arya (Maisie Williams) were back at Winterfell — and that the Night King's army was still on the move and advancing rapidly. The impending battle against the dead meant a change of plans: Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) traveled to King's Landing to propose an armistice, while Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham) took a side trip to Flea Bottom for a little fan service.
That's right, folks: Gendry (Joe Dempsie) rowed all the way home to his old blacksmith digs, where he's been waiting for Davos to come get him … and the giant hammer he likes to use to bash people's heads in. Meanwhile, Sam Tarly (John Bradley-West) got sick of pushing paper at the Citadel and bailed in the middle of the night — rudely interrupting Gilly (Hannah Murray) just as she was about to discover that Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark were legit married.
Oh, and Cersei (Lena Headey)? She's pregnant, and Jaime (Nicolaj Coster-Waldau) is the father! Because it worked out so well the last three times.
Intrigue at Winterfell
Jon's long absence from Winterfell isn't sitting well with his allies, and Sansa (Sophie Turner) was doing her best to placate them — but her best wasn't good enough for Arya, who not-so-subtly suggested that Sansa was jonesing for control of the North herself.
However, Arya's radar for wrongdoing may not be as finely tuned as her sword-fighting skills. She spent ages creeping around after Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) and breaking into his room to find a hidden piece of parchment … only for it to turn out that he'd been watching her watching him the whole time. Who's gaming whom?
Operation Wight Retrieval
Finally, the allied forces against the Dead Army had decided that the best way to convince Cersei of its existence would be to go north, kidnap a wight and bring it back to King's Landing … uh, somehow. (In a box? On a leash? It kinda seems like they haven't thought this one through.) Cue Jon, Jorah and Gendry arriving at Eastwatch castle, where it turned out the Hound (Rory McCann) and his pals were already waiting.
"Here we all are, at the end of the world," said Beric Dondarrion (Richard Dormer). And with a dearth of guys available for the wight-capturing mission, it only made sense for them to all team up. So they did, after some discussion. Maybe next week they'll actually, like, do something.

Big move! Shonda Rhimes, who created hits such as Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy for ABC, is officially leaving the network for a new gig at Netflix.
“Shonda Rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement on Sunday, August 13. “Her work is gripping, inventive, pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, taboo-breaking television at its best. I’ve gotten the chance to know Shonda and she’s a true Netflixer at heart — she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience. We’re so excited to welcome her to Netflix.”
Rhimes, 47, signed a mega multi-year deal with the streaming service. According to Deadline, her production company, Shondaland, will move over to Netflix, but Rhimes will continue to work on her ABC series — including To Get Away with Murder.
She reportedly had one more year under her four-year deal at ABC Studios and negotiated to leave early.
“Shondaland’s move to Netflix is the result of a shared plan Ted Sarandos and I built based on my vision for myself as a storyteller and for the evolution of my company,” Rhimes said in a statement on Sunday. “Ted provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for — the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous global reach provided by Netflix’s singular sense of innovation. The future of Shondaland at Netflix has limitless possibilities.”

Throwing a retro theme party doesn't mean you have to splurge to deck out your space. Instead, focus on adding vibrant accent pieces and reusable decor items that you can weave into your everyday life. "I thought for a game night, it'd be really fun to do a mid-century modern theme," says Lauren Conrad, Us Weekly's guest entertaining editor. To start, she created an easy craft project — color-blocked coasters — to add a pop of color while
 keeping furniture pristine (watch Conrad demo the steps in the video
 above).
When planning your design, "you want very simple geometric shapes," she advises. "Make sure your painter's tape is pressed down really firmly so you get a clean line." From there, the toughest part is waiting for your paint layers to dry before starting the next color, "but don't be afraid to overlap the colors."
If you do want to incorporate larger era-appropriate pieces, plenty of options are available in stores right now. "Mid-century
modern is really popular," she notes. "Designers are coming out with pillows and throws, but if you
wanted to go bold, you could also get a rug."
For her '60s-inspired fondue party, the LC Lauren Conrad for Kohl's designer, 31, also sourced vintage fondue pots and gold-accented glassware from Etsy, eBay and flea markets. "They're really easy to find," assures the Celebrate author, who recently welcomed her first child with husband William Tell. "They're not silly, and it's easy to incorporate them into the rest of your dishware."

Ouch! Tom Cruise appeared to injure himself while filming a stunt on the set of Mission: Impossible 6 in London on Sunday, August 13.
In a video posted by TMZ, the 55-year-old was attached to a safety rope as he jumped from rooftop scaffolding to an adjacent building, but the action hero fell a little short, hitting the side of the building with a thud.
He then pulled himself up but was clearly limping as he tried to continue the shot, falling to his knees when he got beside the camera.
The Top Gun star then stood up and walked a few steps, favoring one leg, before putting his hands on his thighs and leaning over.
He then was pulled back to the scaffolding as a crew member went to assist him, removing the safety rope and briefly holding Cruise’s hand as he steadied himself and limped away.
It’s unclear how badly Cruise was injured or whether it will affect filming. His rep has not responded to a request for comment.
Cruise is well known for doing his own stunts, which have included hanging off the side of an airplane in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation in 2015 and scaling the world’s tallest building — Dubai’s Burj Khalifa — in 2011’s Mission: Impossible - Ghost Patrol.
“There are shortcuts,” Rogue Nation stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood told Variety in 2015. “But Tom doesn’t like doing it that way. He feels that it takes away from the character and the acting.”
Mission: Impossible 6 is due out on July 27, 2018.

Getting cheesy! When Lauren Conrad's entertaining, she preps her food and drinks ahead of time so she can focus on spending time with her guests. For her retro game night party, fondue was an easy choice. "It isn't done a lot, and it's a fun, interactive food," says Us Weekly's guest entertaining editor.
Since she's "both a cheese and a chocolate person," she wanted to serve versions of both and provide a wide array of ingredients for friends to dip. To fit in with her theme, she sourced vintage fondue pots from Etsy, eBay and flea markets. "They're really easy to find," says the Celebrate author. Try these suggestions to throw your own '60s-inspired bash at home.
Cheese Fondue
Since fondue originated in Switzerland, classic recipes tend to rely on a combo of cheeses from the country: Gruyère and Emmentaler. Also key to recipes is a healthy glug of dry white wine, which adds to the flavor and helps keep the cheese nice and melty. (Serious Eats provides a good beginner's fondue recipe and primer.) Conrad likes to add a sprinkling of chopped herbs for a pop of freshness and color.
Five or six dipping options typically offers enough variety. Fruit and vegetables — chopped into bite-size pieces, if they're large — provide a light counterpoint to the creamy cheese. In this case, Conrad picked raw summer squash, zucchini, broccoli, cherry tomatoes, green apples and cooked red potatoes. Cubes of a good, crusty baguette tend to be another crowd-pleaser.
Chocolate Fondue
Dessert dippers should also be a mix of light and decadent options. The LC Lauren Conrad for Kohl's designer, 31, opted for halved strawberries, slices of starfruit, clementine segments, blondies, mini meringues and toasted marshmallows.
Regardless if you serve one or both types, it's a good idea to situate your fondue station where you want your crowd to gather. "Where you place the fondue depends on the game you're playing," Conrad explains. "If the game is something that takes up the entire
table, then you have to have it off to the side. But otherwise, you’re making
them two separate activities — unless you want to set up a buffet and have
people make their own plates."

Back to the boardwalk! Five years after they said goodbye to Seaside, the cast of Jersey Shore are linking arms once again for a reunion in the docuseries Reunion Road Trip.
“We’re a true family,” DJ Pauly D says in a new sneak peek of the upcoming special, as he toasts his friends and former costars. 
As the clip continues, Pauly D shares a laugh with Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi, Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola, Jenni “JWoww” Farley and Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino as the longtime pals stroll down the Jersey boardwalk.
Polizzi, 29, and Pauly D, 37, then snap selfies of Sorrentino, 35, who is confined to a neck brace!
However, Sorrentino’s ordeal may just be the beginning of the madness! “The best thing that could happen is Jenni or Pauly getting arrested,” Polizzi jokes during her on-camera interview.
The reality star shared an Instagram photo of herself arm-in-arm with Sorrentino and Pauly D to celebrate the reunion. “#SquadGoals #WereStillCoolISwear,” she captioned the pic on Friday, August 11.

As previously reported, the boisterous bunch will reunite for the pilot of the docuseries, developed by E!, and catch up on each other’s lives, address stories about them in the media, reveal wild memories and reminisce about their hit MTV reality show, which ran from 2009-2012.
The gym, tan, laundry gang also reunited in July to film a Burger King commercial. “I’m really not nervous about seeing everyone. I’m actually really excited,” Sorrentino said in the 5-minute clip. “We get to sit down, chill, have a good meal. We’re family.”
The close-knit clan also got together in March to celebrate Giancola’s 30th birthday party in Manhattan.
Reunion Road Trip airs on E! Sunday, August 20, at 9:30 p.m. ET.

She’s making the headlines! Brooke Shields is set to star in a recurring role on the upcoming 19th season of of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, NBC revealed on Friday, August 11.
While there are few known details about her character, the Suddenly Susan actress, 52, hinted that her role will cause trouble for New York’s finest and shake up Lieutenant Olivia Benson’s (Mariska Hargitay) world.
“I play a very different character from any I have ever played,” Shields hinted in a statement shared with Us Weekly. “I’m excited to stir the SVU pot a bit.”
Fans of the long-running NBC drama tweeted their excitement and guessed what role the Blue Lagoon star will be playing.
brooke shields is gonna be a regular on SVU this season. i think this is god trying to make up for 2017
One viewer surmised that Shields would portray Benson’s former boyfriend’s love interest!
What if Brooke shields plays Elliot's old lover and Brooke rubs it in Olivia's face every chance she gets
Another wondered if the Pretty Baby actress would be Benson’s sister.
So excited to welcome @BrookeShields to #SVU but if she comes on and steals my dream role as @Mariska sister I'll be VERY disappointed. pic.twitter.com/ThAflbpaHl
Philip Winchester will also join the cast to reprise the role of his Chicago Justice character, Peter Stone, son of Law & Order’s Benjamin Stone (Michael Moriarty). Winchester will make his SVU debut halfway through the season as an ADA in New York, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Not so fast! Despite speculation from fans, Luann de Lesseps did not wear her wedding dress to the Real Housewives of New York City reunion, which filmed three weeks before she announced her split from husband Tom D’Agostino.
Since a teaser for the special aired on Wednesday, August 9, RHONY devotees have taken to Twitter to share their theories that de Lesseps, 52, recycled her wedding day attire.
Luann legit wore her wedding dress to the reunion. What a bizarre choice....🤔 #RHONY #RHONYReunion pic.twitter.com/sXPE6fLcc6
attn: @molls @JackieSchimmel Luann definitely wore her wedding dress to the reunion pic.twitter.com/voLCwXfmuM
who else but luann could rewear her wedding dress for the RHONY reunion, airing only weeks after her divorce announcement?! WE'RE NOT WORTHY
While The Countess chose a dress that resembles the gown she walked down the aisle in, Us Weekly can confirm that they are not the same.
“It was not her wedding dress designed by Randi Rahm,” a rep for the reality star tells Us exclusively. “It was a white dress from Jiki from France.”
As previously reported, the Class with Countess author and D’Agostino, 50, had a physical confrontation at a NYC restaurant in late July. Shortly after, de Lesseps confirmed on Twitter that the couple were going their separate ways.
“It’s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,” she wrote. “We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!”
De Lesseps found comfort and strength from her supporters following the news, and she took to Twitter again to express her gratitude. “Thank you for the generous expression of warmth, kindness and understanding,” she said. “Your support and encouragement helps me to get through.”
A source close to the former flames explained that they often fought over the Bravo series. “He is the same person he was when Luann met him. He likes to go out and talk to people, but also wanted to live a private life with Luann,” the pal told Us Weekly exclusively. “Tom couldn’t handle the reality TV lifestyle. He was waiting for the hamster wheel to stop after filming, but it did not.”
The Real Housewives of New York City airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.

Caught in the act! Bryan Cranston revealed that he was once spotted having sex on a train!
The Breaking Bad alum, 61, and his wife, Robin Dearden, recently celebrated their 28th wedding anniversary with a trip to Europe. Cranston explained during his Wednesday, August 9, appearance on Conan that the coupled had been advised to take a train from Switzerland to Italy, rather than venturing over the Swiss Alps. “Imagine a flatbed train where three cars bumper-to-bumper are going on it. We were in the middle, there was a van full of kids in front of us and two couples from Italy in back of us,” he said, setting the scene for host Conan O’Brien. “And the travel agent said, ‘By the way, the third tunnel is 50 minutes long. It’s tradition for honeymooners to take advantage of that time.’”
While the Total Recall actor’s wife needed some convincing, the award-winning actor said she finally agreed to do the deed on the train. “It was exciting!” he exclaimed of the memory as he described a “completely dark” tunnel with “an absence of light.”
As the Why Him? star and the Last Chance actress “[enjoyed their] lovemaking,” Cranston said he was able to start seeing her facial features. At first he believed his eyes were getting acclimated to the darkness in the tunnels, but “within seconds, [we were] out in broad daylight!”
The Emmy winner remembered the Italian men behind him cheering him on, but the family in the front car was not so understanding. “The children in the front, they’re turning around and their grandmother’s like, ‘No, no, no, no!’ And she gives me a look like, ‘You! You! How? No.’ And I was like, ’50 minutes! They told us 50 minutes,’” he told O’Brien, 54. “And my gorgeous wife says to me those three words you always want to hear: ‘Get off me.’”
Watch the hilarious clip above to hear the full story!
Conan airs on TBS Mondays through Thursdays at 11 p.m. ET.

The Mooch is back. Sort of. Colin Jost and Michael Che have returned as anchors of the "Weekend Update: Summer Edition," just in time to capitalize on the White House’s scandals, including Anthony Scaramucci. In the premiere episode of the anchors’ new four-episode show, Saturday Night Live alum Bill Hader debuted his impersonation of the former White House communications director, and absolutely slayed it.
During a segment, Hader as Scaramucci calls into the show via FaceTime.
“Anthony Scaramucci, are you serious? I guess we should take it,” Che says.
“Yo! It’s me, Anthony Scaramucci. The Mooch! I heard you two nutless liberal a-- wipes mention my name earlier and when I hear my name three times, I appear like a Goomba Beetlejuice.”
“Everybody loves the Mooch. You know you missed me!" Hader, who left SNL in 2013, continues as The Mooch. "I’m like human cocaine. You got a little bump of me, I made you feel excited, but I was out of your system too quick. And now that I’m gone, you’re all depressed and edgy, and you’re trying to figure out how to score some more Scaramooch!”
Che replies: “I gotta admit, we did hope that you would stick around a little bit longer.”
“Me too, but the Mooch has no regrets, baby!" Hader continues with his hilarious impression. "All I did was sell my company, miss the birth of my child, and ruin my entire reputation. All to be king of idiot mountain for 11 days. The Mooch is loose!”
Scaramucci lost his job July 31, 10 days after President Donald Trump appointed him communications director. The firing came after the financier gave an expletive-laden and vulgar interview to The New Yorker, in which he criticized White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.

Following her departure from Kevin Can Wait, Erinn Hayes is ready to join the Pearson's extended family on This Is Us. 
"Last I checked, @TheMandyMoore had a sister on @NBCThisisUs,” a fan wrote to the actress, 41, on Twitter. "If she hasn't been cast yet, I nominate @hayeslady for the role.”
Hayes quickly retweeted the suggestion to her followers and replied, saying she would be happy to consider stepping on set of the NBC fan-favorite drama. "I wouldn't fight that,” she wrote. "We actually played sisters back on the day for a never seen pilot."
As previously reported, Hayes’ character will be killed off the CBS sitcom to make room for Leah Remini joining the cast as a series regular.  “The character will have passed away,” CBS programming boss Thom Sherman explained at the Television Critics Association Press Tour on Tuesday, August 1, Variety reports. “We will be moving forward in time catching up at a later date.”
Remini recently spoke to Stephen Colbert about the Kevin Can Wait role, which will reunite her with her King of Queens costar Kevin James, who now stars on the CBS sitcom. “At the end of the last season I played his partner, we were cops together,” Remini explained on The Late Show on Monday, August 7. "So I just come back as that character.”
When Colbert added how excited fans were to see Remini and James back on screen together after The King of Queens ended in 2007 after nine seasons, the actress acknowledged how special it was to have the support. “I love that,” she said. "It’s an amazing feeling.”

On the spot! Kate Beckinsale revealed which one of her former costars she would Shag, Marry, Kill on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Thursday, August 10, and her answers might surprise you!
Host Andy Cohen asked the Love & Friendship actress, 44, the question during the “Plead the Fifth” segment of his late-night show. So who did Beckinsale have to choose from? Former costars Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Colin Farrell!
“That’s quite hard! F--k,” the Aviator star exclaimed as she considered her options. “I’d probably … Jesus, that’s hard.”
After careful consideration, Beckinsale made up her mind. “I’d probably have to shag Colin,” she said of her Total Recall costar. “‘Cause I’ve sort of semi done it on screen, so I figured it wouldn’t count.”
With two more hard decisions to make, Beckinsale thought about which one of her Pearl Harbor cast mates she would put a ring on and which one she’d axe! “Marry Ben, and I’d kill Josh,” she told Cohen, 49. “Shocking odds there!”
As the game continued, the Bravo star asked the Underworld actress to address the rumors that she didn’t get along with her Vacancy costar, Luke Wilson, allegedly because he was “hung over, late to set and rude to [her].”
Beckinsale smiled and denied the claims. “He wasn’t rude to me. No, we got on fine! No, we got on OK,” she insisted. “It was a very intense movie. We were in a very difficult place in our marriage, those characters.”
Watch the clip above to see if Beckinsale pleads the fifth, or answers Cohen’s last hilarious question!
Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen airs on Bravo Sundays through Thursdays at 11 p.m. ET.

It’s been nearly 12 years since James Blunt’s “You’re Beautiful” hit the airwaves. Although the song became an overnight success, the lack of privacy that came with the new fame was a bit daunting for the British singer.
“It was amazing and scary. I’m a pretty private person, so the exposure made me uncomfortable, but you adapt, and I’ve had such great fun with it,” Blunt, 43, exclusively tells Us Weekly. “If I were to advise anyone, rather than pursue fame and fortune, I’d recommend pursing anonymity and fortune. Hell, maybe just pursue happiness.”
The hit was off his 2004 debut album, Back to Bedlam. Since then, he’s sold more than 20 million albums worldwide and is currently on tour with Ed Sheeran.
“I’ve just released my fifth album, and am on my fifth world tour – making the music, and playing it live has been an amazing experience,” he adds. “I took [Ed] skiing last year, which he’d never done before, so I taught him how to ski by day, and he taught me how to write songs by night. The song we wrote is called ‘Make Me Better’ and it’s on my new album, The Afterlove,” he adds to Us. “We got drunk and I said we should hang out some more, and so he invited me on his U.S. tour, so I’m now his opening act here in the States till mid-October.”
Blunt hasn’t just connected with audiences from onstage, though. He recently partnered with Smule’s Sing! Karaoke app, which helps him engage with fans more.
“I love karaoke. Once I was in one of those karaoke bars where you get your own private karaoke room for you and your friends in Sydney, Australia. It was about 2 a.m. when we heard some girls in the next door room singing my song, ‘Goodbye My Lover,’” he recalls to Us. “I kicked the door of their room open, jumped on the table in the middle, grabbed a mic from one of them and sung out the last chorus. They all started screaming their heads off thinking their drinks must have been spiked. I finished, said 'Thank you, and goodnight!' and left. The screaming carried on for a while.”
Other stars that have used the social platform include Darren Criss, Nick Jonas and DNCE.
For more, read the rest of his Q&A below:
US: What is it like touring with Ed Sheeran?
JB: I sleep on the side of the bed nearest the wall as he’s always getting up in the middle of the night needing the loo.
US: Do you have a ritual before you go on stage to perform?
JB: I check if my flies are done up on my trousers.
US: What are the three biggest must-haves on your tour bus rider?
JB: Corona and Heineken beer. My band and I are also partial to Buffalo hot wings. The hotter the better, please.

They can’t handle their emotions! Scandal is signing off after season 7 and the cast — as to be expected — are getting sentimental about their last days on set.
“I’m sad! I’m really sad it’s going to end. I love so many things about this job, from the story, to the writing, to the people that I work with, to the commute — I just love the whole thing,” Scott Foley exclusively told Us Weekly at ABC’s TCA All-Star Party in Beverly Hills on August 6.
“I’ve been really fortunate to be a part of this specific show on Shondaland. I think it really changed television for the better. And I think in its prime, I don’t know if there was better television on TV.”
Foley, 45, joined Shonda Rhimes’ ABC drama during season 2 in 2013, and his character Jake Ballard instantly became a viewer favorite (Team Jake!) thanks to the love triangle between him, Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and President Fitz (Tony Goldwyn).
Even Foley can’t help but to be a gladiator. “It just burned through so much story and I, as a rabid television viewer, I appreciate that. I appreciate being riveted, feeling like I have to keep up. And there is a lot of television that doesn’t do that,” he added to Us. “[Scandal] was fast-paced and you had to be there, you had to be attentive. I loved live-tweeting with the fans. I still love live-tweeting. Talking to them while I’m watching TV and hearing how they’re reacting versus my reaction. I think we were one of the first if not the first show to really implement a Live Tweet Night. And it did a lot for us.”
The Felicity alum isn’t the only one getting emotional about saying goodbye. “We cry twice a day. And I don't see that stopping,” Bellamy Young, who plays Mellie Grant, told Us at the TCA event. “I guess people will have grief fatigue but I feel like we will pace ourselves. It makes everything so dear, so precious.”
The cast began shooting the final season last month. “That first table read — it was incredible,” Young, 47, recalled to Us. “Kerry is such a good leader. Because it wasn’t just the actors — it's all the writers, all production, everybody's there — she just took a moment and was like, ‘I know I can't do this every table read but this journey is so incredible and I can't believe we've gotten to be on it together for seven years. So many people have been here since the beginning and every moment is precious and we love you guys.’”
According to Young, that bond with everyone will carry on after the show wraps. “My therapist would like to say that I've been re-parented by my Scandal family. Not just the cast but the crew and everybody. And it's true — the constancy, the love, the support — there's never any drama. There's never any undermining,” she told Us. “I can call them in the middle of the night. I'll be able to call them 14 years from now when something goes right and something goes wrong. This whole experience has been utterly transformative.”

What snub? 13 Reasons Why stars Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford weren’t even fazed when the Netflix series wasn’t nominated for an Emmy last month.
“I honestly didn’t even think anything of it,” Minnette, 20, exclusively told Us Weekly at the HFPA Grants Banquet in Beverly Hills on August 2.
“I mean for me, I would love to see the show get any attention that it can, but I think at the end of the day, we’re just trying to make something good and have the world respond to it, but not necessarily in an award,” he continued. "I don’t know, I personally don’t really care. I mean, especially about myself, I don’t care what happens for me. If getting an Emmy would be more positive for the show then that’s great.”
Like Minnette, Langford, 21, is just focusing on the work. “Right now we’re in the middle of season 2, so we’re very much in the mindset of working. I can’t speak for the cast or the crew, but I think personally, I feel regardless of whether or not we were nominated or we’re nominated for any award, I just feel very proud of the work that we were able to do.”
“Awards and accolades are an incredible affirmation,” she added, “but I think there have been some really wonderful nominees so I’m very excited for them and I can’t wait to watch.”
The Wallows singer and Langford play leads Clay Jensen and Hannah Baker, respectively, on the hit show. The cast also includes young talent such as Alisha Boe, Christian Navarro, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Ross Butler and Miles Heizer.
“I’m just very happy to be back with everyone filming,” the Australian actress added to Us. “I think everyone on the show is so exemplary and really gives it 110 percent.”

Will they win big on The Wall? In an exclusive preview of the NBC game show executive produced by LeBron James, Atlanta couple Tomeka and Andre are the deserving contestants playing for big money. Tomeka, a truck driver, and Andre, a detective, have dedicated their lives to helping foster children and even brought a Hurricane Katrina victim to live with them until she graduated high school.
The show, which premiered in December 2016, features a larger-than-life game board that offers the opportunity to win more than $12 million during each episode. “We wanted people to know when they saw the wall, they were in for something big,” NBA pro James explained.
Contestants are chosen from people who give back to their communities. “The Wall is all about helping good things happen for good people,” host Chris Hardwick said. “Most of this money is for their communities — it’s for helping people. It’s for helping their friends and helping their family. One ball could change your life.”
In The Wall’s two seasons, three couples have won more than $1 million so far. Watch the clip for a sneak peek of Tomeka and Andre, and tune in to NBC on Thursdays at 8/7c to see who strikes it rich.

Leslie Jones got the surprise every Game of Thrones fan can only dream of. During her latest segment of "Game of Jones" on Late Night with Seth Meyers, the comedian was surprised by Conleth Hill — who plays Lord Varys in the HBO series — and her reaction was priceless.
When Varys appeared during a scene in GoT, Meyers asked the Saturday Night Live star how she felt about the character. “Where do you stand on Varys?” the TV host asked.
“Varys is like the girlfriend that you don’t know if she is really your homegirl or not, because one minute she is supporting you and got your back but then the next minute you hear about some bulls—t she said to somebody else about you,” Jones said.
That's when the actor came into the room and she jumped up from the couch and ran into his arms.
“What were you saying about me?” Hill said in the clip.
The Saturday Night Live cast member said, “I was saying you can’t trust your ass!”
After the surprise, both actors got to watch season 7 episode four, titled "The Spoils of War,” for the first time together and it made for great television. The episode shocked fans everywhere, and their reactions were no different. The trio continued watching the show and during an explosive scene, Jones yelled, “GOT don’t let you down, son!”
Jones is known to live-tweet her hilarious reactions to the series as it airs, so they have turned their viewing parties for each episode into their own segment on Late Night. And this video proves it was a brilliant idea.
Watch the hilarious moment in the video above.

Talitha Bateman always had something to shout about.
“I grew up with six brothers, so I perfected my scream then,” says Bateman, the second-youngest of nine kids. “I’d yell, ‘Mom, the boys are picking on me!’”
Her lungs were put to the test in the horror flick Annabelle: Creation. “I screamed so much that my voice really hurt,” adds the actress, whose polio-stricken character Janice is haunted by a demonic doll. “I always had lemon and tea on set.”
The 15-year-old gives Us a fright.
Us Weekly: How does this movie differ from other horror flicks?
Talitha Bateman: It’s mostly female, which you don’t see a lot in horror movies. It’s about a girls’ orphanage and there are only two male characters. It’s really cool because the women carry this film.
Us: Do you relate to Janice at all?
TB: Janice is vulnerable. She sees the girls running around and she can’t. But she doesn’t want sympathy, she wants to shove everyone out. I don’t want people to see me hurt, either. But I’m tougher than Janice.
Us: How did you master her limp?
TB: Well, I didn’t want to go to set and wing it. So two weeks before, I started limping around my house or the grocery store with a cane. My leg got pretty sore! Now, one is probably larger than the other because I was lugging it around.
Us: After filming, were you more wary of dolls?
TB: I don’t believe in that supernatural stuff. But dolls have a creepy smugness to them. They’re angelic looking, which freaks me out. The first time I saw the Annabelle doll was at a table read and she had her own script. I was cracking up.
Us: Are you a scary movie junkie?
TB: I am! I watched The Shining when I was 5 or 6, and I’ve been hooked ever since. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies of all time.
Us: Ok, be honest: When you’re watching, are you the person who covers their eyes?
TB: It depends! Sometimes I will. But with some of them I’m like, ”Are you serious? What are you doing?”
Annabelle: Creation hits theaters Friday, August 11.

She's back! Pink released her new single, "What About Us," on Thursday, August 10.
The empowering track is the first single from the three-time Grammy winner's upcoming seventh studio album, Beautiful Trauma, which will be released on October 13. "What About Us" was cowritten by Pink, 37, Snow Patrol's Johnny McDavid and producer Steve Mac.
I could not be more excited right now. My single comes out today "what About Us" and my new album "Beautiful Trauma" comes out October 13th. I'm certifiably, insanely proud of this album. It's been a while, and I'm grateful for all the years we've had. Looking forward to the next chapter with you.
A post shared by P!NK (@pink) on Aug 9, 2017 at 2:15pm PDT
"What about us? What about all the times you said you had the answers?" Pink sings on the melodic tune. "What about us? What about all the broken happy ever afters?"
Later in the song, the "Raise Your Glass" singer appears to touch upon the current state of the world, belting, "We are problems that want to be solved / We are children that need to be loved / We are willing / We came when you called / But then you fooled us / Enough is enough."
Beautiful Trauma marks Pink's first album since 2012's The Truth About Love, which included the hit singles "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)," "Try" and "Just Give Me a Reason."
"I could not be more excited right now. My single comes out today 'What About Us' and my new album 'Beautiful Trauma' comes out October 13th," the singer-songwriter wrote on Instagram alongside the album cover, which shows her wearing a silver and pink jacket over a bedazzled white bodysuit. "I'm certifiably, insanely proud of this album. It's been a while, and I'm grateful for all the years we've had. Looking forward to the next chapter with you."

Blac Chyna is back, appearing in a new NSFW music video … but is she sending a message to Rob Kardashian?
The 29-year-old mother of two makes a cameo in rapper Belly’s explicit video for “P.O.P (Power of Pu**y)" wearing lingerie. She stares directly at the camera as the rapper says, ”She took you for everything, you let her do it again.”
A post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Aug 9, 2017 at 9:18pm PDT
As previously reported, Kardashian, 30, shared multiple nude photos of her on his social media accounts last month and accused her of cheating and using him for money, jewelry and plastic surgery. The model was granted a temporary restraining order against him on July 10.
"Once he posted all these things on the Internet, I had my two assistants drive the Ferrari and the Lamborghini, and took all the jewelry back to his house. Actually, to his mother’s [Kris Jenner] house, and had it dropped off," Chyna explained during an interview with Good Morning America. "And I also gave him back his wedding ring. Because I’m not gonna let this man buy me — or make it seem like he could just buy me and give me gifts and treat me any way, and talk to me nasty."
Kardashian’s lawyer Robert Shapiro said the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star’s actions were “a spontaneous reaction that he regrets.”
The E! reality stars were due in an L.A. court on Tuesday, August 8, for a restraining order hearing, but pushed the date back until September 18 to try and work towards a resolution themselves.
Chyna and the Arthur George sock designer broke up in December after a year of dating and are parents to 8-month-old Dream. The Lashed Cosmetics founder also has a 5-year-old son, King, with her ex Tyga. She was most recently spotted getting cozy with rapper Mechie in Miami on July 21.

James Corden teamed up with Jeffrey Tambor and John Boyega for a parody of Brandy and Monica’s 1998 music video for “The Boy Is Mine,” which aired on The Late Late Show on Wednesday, August 9. 
In “The Boyega Is Mine” spoof, Corden, 38, has a beef with Tambor, 73, over the 25-year-old Star Wars hunk. The video starts with a silky pajama-clad Corden calling up Tambor, who’s rocking red plaid PJs, to confront him.
“Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?” the late-night host asks the Transparent actor. “I just want to know, do you know somebody named … you know his name!”
Tambor replies, “Definitely, yeah, I know his name.”
Corden quips, “I just want to let you know that he’s mine.” Tambor retorts, “No, he’s mine."
The feuding stars hang with Boyega in separate hotel rooms. Corden gives him foot rubs, and the duo play patty cake. Meanwhile, Tambor feeds Boyega pancakes and thumb wrestles with him. Plus, they all show off some pretty sweet dance moves.
“You need to give it up, I’ve had about enough / It’s not hard to see the Boyega is mine,” they croon. "I’m sorry that you seem to be confused, but he belongs to me / The Boyega is mine.”
Just like the original video, it ends with Corden and Tambor teaming up against their two-timing man (who was played by Mekhi Phifer in the real music video) and slamming the door in his face when he comes by one of their hotel rooms.
The hilarious video was released the same day that the two R&B singers reignited their 20-years-long feud. Brandy, 38, slammed Monica, 36, after her rival’s fans called her tribute to the late Whitney Houston “self-centered.” The “I Wanna Be Down” songstress wrote, “Monica needs to really check her evil ass fans. It’s so much stuff I can post about hateful things they say to me … but I will never have time for that. Always thinking something is about her. It’s not!!!”

Nailed it! Jennifer Lawrence praised Ariana Grande’s impression of her, which she debuted during Saturday Night Live in March 2016. 
In the Celebrity Family Feud sketch, Grande, 24, poked fun of the Oscar winner. "They told me not to do a game show, but I was like, 'Screw it, I can have fun, I’m a regular person,’” she said in character at the time.
She added: "I'm just, like, a snackaholic. I mean, I love Pringles. If no one's looking I'll eat, like, a whole can. Like, every day is my cheat day, you know what I mean?"
Lawrence, 26, told Vogue that the impersonation was “spot f—king on.” However, she later reacted to the specific line used on the NBC variety show.
"That’s what other people have said. If I'd said, 'I’m a regular person,' I'd want to kill myself,” she said.
Grande is a pro at impersonating other stars. She’s previously belted out tunes while sounding exactly like Christina Aguilera, Celine Dion and Britney Spears.

Sayonara, Mexico! On the Wednesday, August 9, episode of The Real Housewives of New York City, the women were back in Manhattan. Luann de Lesseps was pumped that she and Tom had settled into married life. “I was on a mission to make this work, and I did,” she beamed to the camera. (As Us Weekly previously reported, she announced the end of their seven-month marriage last week.)
Meanwhile, Tinsley Mortimer was getting ready to throw a party for Sonja Morgan to thank her for her hospitality. Ramona Singer was over the moon that she and Bethenny Frankel had made up. But when one relationship mends, another cracks – just ask Sonja Morgan. Sonja was not at all pleased with Tinsley, whether Tins was going to throw her a soiree or not.
Bethenny Tries Dating
Bethenny had recently settled on a new apartment, where she was entertaining a professional hockey player. Dorinda Medley stopped by to check out both. “Oh, this is the cute hockey player!” she said before taking the grand tour of Bethenny’s new abode. Both Bethenny and Dorinda were very impressed with the athlete’s butt, but less so with his fake (removable) tooth. Everyone agreed the apartment was perfection, though.
Tinsley and Sonja Prep for the Party
“I want to make sure that she knows that I am, yes pissed at you right now, but I am eternally grateful to you and I want this to be a special party,” Tinsley explained to the camera. Carole Radziwill stopped by Tinsley’s new home. (ICYMI, Carole also recently set Tinsley up with a man who immediately became her boyfriend.)
Tinsley wasn’t the only one with a blossoming relationship, though. Sonja was head over heels for Frenchie (real name: Edgar). Frenchie was getting ready to head back to France, but Sonja was going to visit him soon. 
Thank You/ F--k You Bash
Tinsley’s new boyfriend, Scott, was one of the first to arrive, followed by Carole, Dorinda and her boyfriend John, and Ramona. When Ramona arrived, she reported that Sonja was threatening not to come. “Sonja’s not coming,” Dorinda reported to Tinsley. “She’s still in bed!” Shortly after that, Luann and Tom showed up. Luann told the cameras she thought it was a good move that Tinsley threw the party so that Sonja couldn’t be mad that she hadn’t thrown her a party. Bethenny thought the party was dumb, but came anyway.
While she waited to see if Sonja showed up, Tinsley introduced Scott to her sister and Sonja finally arrived. Ramona asked Sonja who told her it was actually a “f--k you” party and Ramona said Carole had delivered that message. (Tins would have to thank her later.) Tinsley was bummed that Sonja kept making comments about it being a “f--k you” party, but made the best of it by parading Scott around to meet people.
Ramona then had a heart-to-heart with Bethenny, admitting she was sad about being alone and not having a partner. “I don’t know if it’s ever going to happen,” Ramona said. Bethenny added to the camera: “I genuinely have compassion for that. It must be hard.” Bethenny reassured Ramona that she would find someone special and they hugged. Yes, that’s right. They hugged. Bethenny then marched over to Sonja to say that she agreed that Tinsley was a little disingenuous.
Tom's Behavior 
While Luann caught up with Dorinda and Bethenny, Tom flirted with his ex, Missy. He had the foresight to remove his microphone, though, so the cameras didn’t capture exactly what he said.
At the end of the night, Tinsley made a sweet toast thanking Sonja. “It’s not really a f--k you party,” Sonja said to the camera. “It’s just Tinsley being Tinsley and me being me.” Tinsley also gave Sonja a $5,000 gift card to Bergdorf Goodman. That also helped.
In the final updates of the season, we learned that Tinsley and Scott are moving in together, Carole is training for the New York Marathon, and Luann and Tom have already filed for divorce.

Now your pets can have book club too! Audible announced the launch of Audible for Dogs, a new offering aiming to “foster calm, relaxed behavior” in dogs while their owners are away, on Monday, August 7.
The new service was developed in collaboration with Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan so pets could listen to a human voice, even when their owner isn’t home. Audible was inspired to create audiobooks for dogs after a 2015 study that showed audiobooks to be more effective at reducing stress in canines than playing music.
In the company’s own study with 100 dogs, in partnership with the Cesar Millan Dog Psychology Center, 76% of owners who played audiobooks over a four-week period saw an increase in calm, relaxed behavior for their canines.
“Dogs are social animals, so they need to engage with someone and the purpose of Audible for Dogs is to make dogs feel there is someone with them. The person performing the audiobook is actually keeping your dog calm and taking the dog to a resting state, acting as an extension of you,” Millan said in a statement.
If you’re wondering which book to get, the study found pets responded best to audiobooks narrated by the same gender as their owner. Each curated title by Millan features a video introduction from the pet guru, as well as celebrity narrators. Current titles include Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood read by Trevor Noah, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice read by Rosamund Pike and more.

The late Princess Diana says her marriage to Prince Charles began to demise following the birth of their youngest son, Prince Harry, as seen in Us Weekly’s exclusive sneak peek of Diana: In Her Own Words.
In the clip, the late princess discusses her troubled marriage and the difference between the public perception of her versus her reality, via old audio interviews that had yet to be released. “On the outside, people were saying I was giving my husband a hard time. I was acting like a spoiled child,” she says. “But I knew that I was just…needed rest and patience and time to adapt to all of the roles that were required of me overnight.”
“By then, there was immense jealousy,” she continues. “Because every single day I was on the front of the newspapers.”
Diana, who died tragically in a 1997 car accident, explains via a past voiceover that getting unexpectedly pregnant with Prince Harry gave her a glimmer of hope about the state of their marriage. “Charles and I, we were very, very close to each other the six weeks before Harry was born,” she says. “The closest we’ve ever, ever been and ever will have been.”
However, following the birth of Prince Harry, who is younger brother to Prince William, was not enough to salvage the union. “And then, as suddenly as Harry was born, it just went bang, our marriage,” she says. “The whole thing went down the drain.”
The former couple wed in 1981 in an extravagant televised wedding, watched internationally by nearly one billion viewers. They separated in 1992 and formally divorced four years later.
Diana: In Her Own Words airs on National Geographic on Monday, August 14th at 8 p.m. ET.

Moving on! Fox is developing a new singing competition titled The Four, challenging ABC's upcoming reboot of American Idol.
Fox Television Group co-CEO Dana Walden announced at the Television Critics Association press tour executive session in Beverly Hills on Tuesday, August 8, that the series has officially been ordered, Variety reported. Walden even threw some not-so-subtle shade at other singing competitions, saying, "They've become much more about celebrity panels and much less about star making."
The Four features a different linear format than Idol. Rather than auditioning and eliminating thousands of aspiring singers, the show begins with just four finalists selected by yet-to-be-secured music industry experts. The performers will be challenged by other new singers determined to steal their coveted spots. If any of the four finalists are outperformed, they will be sent home and replaced.
Though producers have yet to secure an episode count, the series is expected to be brief. "I think it could be anywhere between four and eight [episodes]," Fox executive Rob Wade told Variety. "It's very different. … You want there to be pressure on America and the judges to find a star in a short amount of time. I think that's what works best."
Idol concluded its original run on Fox in April 2016 after 15 seasons. A revival is slated to premiere on ABC in 2018 with Ryan Seacrest returning as the host. Katy Perry is the only judge confirmed so far, though a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Idol alum Chris Daughtry will also join the panel.

The original fake news story! Orson Welles’ famous 1938 “War of the Worlds” radio broadcast has resurfaced — with a twist. The comedy Brave New Jersey recreates the hoax and, like in real life, the small town community actually believe that aliens are invading the U.S.
Sam Jaeger, who plays Paul Davison in the Jody Lambert-directed film, listened to the original audio before shooting began.
“It’s interesting — there’s so much information out there now that it’s so hard to avoid,” Jaeger, 40, exclusively tells Us Weekly. “And what I like about the movie is that it’s a simpler time. And I mean that in the best sense. Not that it was an easier time, but I like a movie that takes its time, slows us down, transports us in a way. Because what we really want right now, at least for myself, is I want to be transported from all the complications of today — politically and how much we work in society today. Going into a theater and watching something like Brave New Jersey helps to slow us down.”
Paul and his neighbors all react differently to the fear that extraterrestrial life is taking over. Some act carelessly while others rediscover their faith or show courage.
For Jaeger, he knows exactly how he’d spend his last night on Earth. “If I had one more night to live I'd eat nothing but Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, drink a good Whiskey and sit on the back porch and watch my kids just go crazy in the backyard. That would probably be it,” the Parenthood alum adds to Us. “And that's what's so sweet about Brave New Jersey. Watching people at the actual end of their lives and seeing what's important. It really comes down to what people regret the most is not spending time with their loved ones. Their work [isn't] nearly as important as the relationships they build. So, yeah, I think I’d spend my last moments with as much family as possible laughing and crying and celebrating as much as we could.”
For more, read the rest of his Q&A below:
US: How would you describe your character?
SJ: He's the most successful man in town, which is funny because it's a pretty small town so it doesn't take much to have a lot of money here. I think he carries himself as kind of a savior. He's a little smug, a little self-centered and what's amazing about this story is that we see all these people unravel and their true natures show when the whole community believe that there are aliens attacking this small town in New Jersey.
US: Did any of your family members actually listen to the broadcast in real time?
SJ: I don't think so. I think what is interesting about Brave New Jersey is that the reason people were so paranoid is that they used the name of a real town in New Jersey. And so communities around that town were really on edge that night.
US: Are you more drawn to stories that are based on real events?
SJ: Yeah, what I like about events like Brave New Jersey is that you can't write this stuff. Even a lot of the stories in Brave New Jersey is taken from real accounts of the event and truth is stranger than fiction. You get to see all of these people react in ways that are hard to believe but the fact that a lot of it really happened just makes it all the more interesting.
It's the nuances of those stories that are so fascinating. And the more detail and the more we can bring to life as a team when we are making movies the better. And thankfully Brave New Jersey really rests on the characters and how these people behave in this set of strange, bizarre and extraordinary circumstances.
Brave New Jersey also stars Anna Camp, Tony Hale and Heather Burns. It’s in theaters and on demand now.

He still knows every word to his ‘90s hits! Will Smith and James Corden went for a spin during the premiere of Carpool Karaoke: The Series, which premiered on Apple Music Tuesday, August 8. 
The duo kicked things off by rapping along to his 1999 track “Get Jiggy With It.” They didn’t miss a beat until the Late Late Show host, 38, suddenly stopped the tune to bring out an entire marching band to “fill out the sound.” The band played along as Smith and Corden danced out of the sunroof. 
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air alum, 48, chatted about how he got his start in music and ruled the school. “I had a record on the radio for the last 30 days as a [high school] senior,” he said. “You cannot beat your friends in high school knowing you have a hit record on the radio.”
Corden joked, “Were you named Most Likely to Have Already Succeeded?”
The pair went on to rap 1993’s “Boom! Shake the Room” and Smith revealed he’s been asked to play Barack Obama — and had a conversation with the former president about it. “I talked to Barack about it,” he said, casually referring to Obama by his first name. “He told me felt confident that I had the ears for the role.”
The Suicide Squad actor and Corden also did a hilarious bit, in which Smith had several opportunities to use his classic line, “Aw hell no!” Corden said things like: “Let me send you this hilarious 12-minute video of my niece at her school recital” and “It’s movie night, I rented Wild Wild West."
The segment ended with a teaser for what’s coming up on Carpool Karaoke: The Series, and it includes every star imaginable! The montage showed Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, LeBron James, Blake Shelton, Miley Cyrus, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams and more A-listers teaming up for a musical ride around L.A.
Watch a clip of Smith’s Carpool Karaoke above and see the whole video on Apple Music.

Two happy campers! Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon returned to Camp Winnipesaukee to reprise their roles as two preteens who won’t go to sleep after lights out on The Tonight Show on Tuesday, August 8.
The duo, who have been doing the sketch for years, stay up late to play “two truths and a lie” from their bunks. The “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” singer goes first and says, “I love sleepaway camp. S’mores are my favorite snack. I don’t secretly wish I was in Color Me Badd.” The TV host quips, “Last one’s a lie!”
After the games were over, the pair started up a sing-a-long to “What’s Up” by 4 Non Blondes. Mid-tune, camp counselor Mr. Fletcher (played by Keegan-Michael Key) interrupted to remind them to go to bed.
Fallon apologizes, saying, “I’m sorry, Mr. Fletcher. We were just singing a song.” Fletcher replied, “It sounded like you were just drowning in a lake, but you were aren’t drowning are you? You’re clowning. So, listen up you little bozo the clowns, plural: After lights out, it means you have to go to sleep or you are going to lose your snack shack privileges.”
After he leaves, Fallon and Timberlake remark that Mr. Fletcher looks different. “Way more theatrical,” the Friends With Benefits actor noted. (Tonight Show writer A.D. Miles usually plays the camp counselor, and this was Key’s first time playing the role.)
Not all superheroes wear capes... Tune into @fallontonight tonight!
A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Aug 8, 2017 at 5:33pm PDT
The group just couldn’t keep a straight face and kept breaking character to laugh. Timberlake even buried his face in the blankets to stop himself from cracking up, as Key scratched himself all over and revealed he “accidentally rubbed poison ivy all over my nut sack."
At the end of the sketch, a new camper Billy (played by Billy Crystal) from nearby Camp Buttonwood, snuck into the cabin. The friends danced the night away to Gloria Estefan’s “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” before getting busted one final time by Mr. Fletcher.

Let the games begin! Since the early days of their romance, Lauren Conrad and husband William Tell, 37, have relished spending an evening at home playing cards and charades. “We’re competitive,” she admits to Us Weekly. But it can be even more fun to invite four to six friends ("for even teams") and add a theme. As the Celebrate author  explains in the video above, in this instance, that meant weaving mid-century modern accents throughout the menu and decor.

Themed or not, the set up couldn't be simpler. “You provide the game and snacks, but there’s not a lot of planning to do,” says the new mom (her son Liam arrived July 5). To keep with the retro vibe, she chose Old Fashioned cocktails and served fondue in vintage pots found through Etsy, eBay and flea markets. "Fondue isn't done a lot, and it's a fun, interactive food," enthuses the LC Lauren Conrad for Kohl's designer. If it won’t disrupt the action (or increase the likelihood of spillage), set up your nosh where you’re sitting. “Otherwise,” she explains, “you’re kind of creating two separate activities.”
While she’d typically abide by a two drinks per person per hour average for a large party, the Little Market cofounder, 31, plays it looser for an intimate gathering. “When you’re having a small group, you know your friends and how much they’ll consume,” she notes.
Meanwhile, gold-accented glasses tie into the retro aesthetic, but “they’re not silly — you can easily incorporate them into the rest of your dishware.”
For the actual games, the lifestyle expert favors backgammon and Pictionary, but she suggests tailoring it to your crowd. "You can pick a
favorite card game, old-school board games, or one of
those apps that provides games," brainstorms Conrad. Whether you pick teams or let guests choose is also a matter of preference. “I like being with my husband,” she says. “We’re on the same wavelength.”

Bachelor Nation had plenty to say after Rachel Lindsay chose Bryan Abasolo as the winner of The Bachelorette's 13th season on Monday, August 7.
After popping the question outside of a castle in Spain, Abasolo, 37, expressed his love for the Dallas attorney, 32, once more when he pulled out a stunning Neil Lane engagement ring for the second time during the live reunion. Many social media users applauded Lindsay's final decision, while others felt heartbroken for runner-up Peter Kraus and third place finisher Eric Bigger.
"Congratulations to Rachel and Bryan on your engagement! All the best on your new life together," season 21 Bachelor Nick Viall wrote on Twitter shortly after the finale aired. Season 9 Bachelorette Desiree Hartsock added, "Rachel found the firm foundation love needs in Bryan and I'm SO happy for you guys!! Congrats @TheRachLindsay!"
Congratulations to Rachel and Bryan on your engagement! All the best on your new life together!
Rachel found the firm foundation love needs in Bryan and I'm SO happy for you guys!! ❥❥❥ Congrats @TheRachLindsay!
While many viewers criticized Lindsay for breaking up with fan favorite Kraus, 31, Kaitlyn Bristowe came to her defense. "If Rachel is happy... Trust her. And be happy for her. And support them," the season 11 Bachelorette tweeted. "I wish them all the happiness in the world. Don't be a d--k."
If Rachel is happy... Trust her. And be happy for her. And support them. I wish them all the happiness in the world. Don't be a dick.
Still, Bachelor Nation fans couldn't help but mourn the engagement that could have been. "'We're not rushing anything' GIRL NEITHER WAS PETER but you sent his ass home," one frustrated viewer tweeted. Another referenced Steve Harvey's infamous 2015 Miss Universe pageant mix-up, writing, "When does Steve Harvey show up to tell us Peter really won? #TeamPeter."
Others made political jokes. "Peter won the popular vote. Bryan won the electoral college," one fan tweeted, likely making a reference to the 2016 presidential election, in which Hillary Clinton lost to President Donald Trump despite winning the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.
Every single girl in America is convinced that Peter is their soulmate.

Now that Rachel Lindsay and her fiancé, Bryan Abasolo, got their happy ending when he proposed during the season finale of The Bachelorette on Monday, August 7, they’ve already decided which of the season 13 contestants should be the next Bachelor.
Lindsay, 32, didn’t choose runner-up and fan favorite Peter Kraus. Instead, the couple hopes that Alex Bordyukov will be the next leading man on the ABC franchise.
“I think we agree on this one. We would say Alex,” the Dallas-based lawyer told Michael Strahan during their joint appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, August 8.
“He's just quirky, fun personality, funky dresser,” Abasolo, 37, agreed. “He’s…a really smart guy. He has a really high I.Q. and I just think he would make an interesting season.”
“America didn’t get to see enough of him,” Lindsay added. “Alex is great.”
During a FaceTime interview before they arrived on set of GMA, Lindsay also opened up about facing Kraus at the After the Final Rose special, which aired on Monday, August 7. Kraus wasn’t ready to propose during the show and Monday was the first time they saw each other since their breakup.
“It was more frustrating to see Peter than anything else,” she shared. “That was a frustrating breakup.” 
Her fiancé added he didn’t see the runner-up at all during the taping — and that the finale was hard to watch. “I saw the final episode and, yeah, as a man, you feel a little frustration of how she was treated and the position she was put in for the simple fact that, you know, here I am, you know, totally committed,” Abasolo explained. “Totally invested. Totally ready to start a real future with this woman and on the other end, you have someone who is indecisive, wishy-washy and at the same time he's telling her he's in love with her and will propose. So, you know, it was just tough to watch.”

ABC is showing viewers the moments that occurred directly before and after the incident between Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson on Bachelor in Paradise, which temporarily suspended filming in June.
As previously reported, Warner Bros. concluded an investigation after finding no evidence of wrongdoing after a producer filed a sexual misconduct report stemming from an interaction between Olympios and Jackson on set.
In a new teaser, Olympios arrives in Mexico and immediately asks Jackson to go for a swim. “Come on,” she says in the clip, which aired during season 13 of The Bachelorette on Monday, August 7. “Pool time.” Offscreen, a cast member narrates the situation as footage plays of the duo splashing in the pool and laughing. “This is thirty minutes into Paradise,” the voiceover says. “Corinne and DeMario are already have a blast with each other hanging out in the pool.”
The clip cuts to a later scene, when a producer comes to take Olympios away from the group as another demands that the cameramen shut their cameras off.
The cast members narrate the situation in voiceover clips as footage shows the chaos and confusion. “The whole cast was just shocked and confused. Are Corinne and Demario ok?,” says Danielle Maltby, who competed on Nick Viall’s season 21 of The Bachelor. "All we know is that we aren’t filming, so what the f—k is happening?”
The promo takes a quick turn as Chris Harrison’s voiceover explains that “now, Paradise is back," and promises the show to be “bigger, better and wetter than ever before.” A montage of moments from the season plays, featuring hookups, breakups … and multiple shark costumes.
As in seasons past, it appears multiple love triangles will play out — one including Amanda Stanton, Robby Hayes and Raven Gates. “Amanda’s beautiful and it’s safe to say we’re off to a hot start,” Hayes says. “But I love the idea of falling in love with Raven.” Footage later in the nearly four-minute clip shows Stanton crying and Gates in a confessional saying, “I might get engaged."
Some of the relationship drama takes a heavy toll on contestants like Dean Unglert, who breaks down during a confessional. “I’m sorry for crying,” he says. “I literally hate myself right now.”
Bachelor in Paradise premieres on ABC Monday, August 14, at 8 p.m. ET.

Why rush? The Bachelorette's Rachel Lindsay has finally found her husband-to-be — but that doesn't mean they will be walking down the aisle anytime soon.
The Dallas-based lawyer, 32, and her fiancé, Bryan Abasolo, opened up about their wedding plans during After the Final Rose on Monday, August 7.
"She wants to do a winter wedding, and whatever she wants, she gets," Abasolo, 37, told host Chris Harrison.
"We're not rushing anything," Lindsay chimed in. "We just want to build our lives together in a normal sense."
In fact, "normalcy" is the only thing on their wish list right now. "We just want to grab coffee and go to the movies," Lindsay said. Abasolo quipped: "I want to show this woman off."
Like every other Bachelor Nation couple, the pair have been secretly meeting up since filming the finale. Lindsay chose Abasolo over runner-up Peter Kraus, and knew he was the one following their hometown date.
"[I knew] when I was defending him to my family, and when I was explaining why he means so much to me, and I told them that he was my best friend," she explained on Monday night. "I shocked myself in that moment. He is the man for me. He truly is my best friend."
And soon, she will be moving in with her BFF. Where, however, is still unknown. "We have three cities," he said. "Maybe Dallas, maybe L.A., maybe Miami."

He went on to gush that "every single day" gets better and better with the Dallas-based lawyer. "[It] reaffirms that God placed you in my path for a reason. We've gone through so much...the ups, the downs, the challenges...but in the end, what shines above all else is the deep love, loyalty, respect and admiration we have for each other and that's what will continue to carry us through into our future," he continued. "I can't wait to start our new life together full of fun and adventure! I am so blessed and lucky to have you and I promise to cherish you forever! I love you baby!"
Lindsay chose Abasolo following a brutal split from runner-up Peter Kraus. Following ABC's After the Final Rose special, the newly engaged couple jetted off to NYC for a round of press. Abasolo revealed their travel plans in a second Instagram photo, which showed the lovebirds kissing on an airplane.
Up next? New York, Connecticut, Dallas and Miami.

Decisions, decisions. On the season finale of The Bachelorette on Monday, August 7, Rachel Lindsay was down to the final three. The episode opened with Rachel joining host  The episode opened with Rachel joining host Chris Harrison for a live viewing event (not awkward at all!). 
The first footage picked up where things had left off two weeks back — with Rachel and Peter Kraus discussing their rift about getting engaged. Peter wasn't sure he was ready to get down on one knee and Rachel wasn’t sure she could move forward with a man who wasn’t definitely going to propose.
Ultimately, they decided to spend the night in the fantasy suite. “Maybe there will be clarity in the morning,” Rachel reasoned to the camera. The next morning, they woke up looking pretty happy to be together. “Peter just has me in my head,” Rachel said to the camera after he left.
Then came Bryan Abasolo. (She later admitted she almost didn’t offer Peter the chance to join her in the fantasy suite … but at this point, it was kind of moot.) 
Bryan or Bust
Rachel and Bryan kicked off their romantic date with horseback riding and wine drinking. Still, Rachel seemed distant, admitting to the camera that Peter had gotten in her head. Bryan could sense something was up and called their date “awkward.”
Later, Bryan told Rachel that he could tell something was up. Rachel apologized and assured him it was nothing he had done. Indeed, things seemed to go well since they woke up in bed together the next morning and immediately began feeding each other strawberries. “Our chemistry is hotter than ever,” Bryan assured the camera. “Moving forward, I am more confident than ever, not only that I’m going to get this rose tonight, but that I’m going to get the final rose at the end of the day,” he added. 
Final Rose Ceremony
Then came the rose ceremony – and Bryan was right. He was the first guy to get a rose. Rachel was torn because she desperately wanted a proposal at the end of it. In a voiceover, she insisted that she had to follow her heart … and she gave Peter the second (and final) rose. This meant Eric Bigger was going home.
Eric looked crushed. “It’s hard to say goodbye when I have such strong feelings for you. It’s just that I have stronger feelings for the other two guys that are here,” she said. “I do love you, it’s just that I’m not in love.” Eric encouraged Rachel to stay open in her life and thanked her for allowing him to get what he needed from the experience. “I’ll always love you,” he said. “It’s just the truth.”
Meanwhile, the fact that Rachel wanted a proposal wasn’t lost on Peter. “When she said that she wanted a proposal, she looked dead in my eyes,” he said to the camera. No pressure.
Rachel and Eric Catch Up on Live TV
Moments after watching herself send Eric home, Rachel had to see him for the first time since they stopped filming. Both of them seemed happy to see each other. Miraculously, Eric didn’t seem the least bit bitter, even though he reiterated to Harrison (and the rest of the world) that he had fully planned on proposing if Rachel had picked him. Eric was a gentleman about it and Rachel insisted things might have worked if they’d had more time.  
Final Dates
Next up were Rachel’s final two dates of the season. Bryan was feeling good as they headed out on a romantic hot-air balloon ride. By the end of their date, he seemed extremely confident that he had this thing in the bag — but Rachel still had a date with Peter coming up.
Peter and Rachel headed to a church where they discussed being married some more. Peter said he wasn’t afraid of marriage, but the idea of “having multiple marriages” scared him. “I didn’t expect to find someone who I truly and deeply cared about,” he added. (Not sure what he was hoping would happen on the show, but … whatever.) He said he was nervous about having to figure out his future with Rachel in the next 24 hours. “It’s so sad and it’s so hard,” Rachel cried to the camera.
“I am in love with you,” Peter told her later. “But I don’t feel that I am ready to ask you to marry me, tomorrow. I don’t want to stop being with you.” Rachel said she was “confused.” Peter said he was totally in, but not yet. Rachel said she’d been there and done that with a man who wasn't ready for marriage. Peter then turned the tables and asked her if she knew right at that moment that he was the man that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. “I can’t answer that question,” she said. “So if I can’t, you walk away.”
Things got tense. “I want you to do it because you want to do it,” Rachel said. Peter then said he would propose so that he wouldn’t lose her and she told him not to bother. Game over.
Enter Peter!
Harrison then brought Peter on stage so Rachel could confront him. “There were other deep-rooted issues that I began to see,” Rachel said, explaining that her feeling of wanting to end their relationship wasn’t just because he didn’t want to propose. Peter insisted that he knew during their first date that she was a person he was “excited for.” He said hometowns were stressful and he had trouble getting out of his own head and relaxing.
He then revealed that he’d tried to reach out to Rachel after the fact and she said she wasn’t open to that. Rachel concluded by saying that she didn’t think the show was a fit for him, personality-wise.
Bryan Proposes
He proposed on a windswept hill after picking out a gorgeous Neil Lane engagement ring.
"You are everything I could ever want in a woman, a wife, the mother of my children. I am completely head over heels, totally, absolutely in love with you," Bryan began. "I just hope you feel the same."
Rachel took his hands in hers and said that she had been "confused" this week and found herself trying to "find cracks" in what seemed like the perfect situation.
"This love has been so mature," she said. "It has tested me in ways that I couldn't even imagine and I've always said that I would know that the person I was supposed to be with was the person I couldn't picture my life without." She added that standing there with him, she saw her "forever" and her future. "I love you and I can't imagine spending my life with someone else."
Then they kissed until Bryan pushed her away to say that he had more to tell her. He went on to call her "easy and effortless to love" and said he wanted to love her for the rest of his life. Then he got down on his knee and asked her to be his wife. Spoiler alert: She said yes.
Cut to: the live finale. Bryan then joined Rachel on stage and asked her to marry him all over again for the live audience. (Insert eye roll here.) He slid the ring back on her finger again and told her he never wanted her to take it off.

Chelsea Houska’s ex-boyfriend, Adam Lind, tested positive for methamphetamines during the Monday, August 7, episode of Teen Mom 2. Also, Leah Messer and Briana DeJesus had to deal with the things that make their children different. Check out the five craziest moments from Monday’s episode of the MTV reality show.
Briana’s Daughter Has an Identity CrisisBriana’s daughter, Nova, doesn’t get to interact with her dad’s side of the family much, so she is beginning to be dissatisfied with her black features. Briana worried that because she doesn’t get to see other black people, she is missing out on part of her culture.
“I’d like for your family to be involved a little bit more,” Briana told her ex, Devoin Austin.
He agreed to try to be more involved in his daughter’s life, and admitted he’d like for it to happen without Briana’s supervision. He also complimented his daughter’s “pretty hair” when he saw her, which made her face light up. “She can learn a lot of things from us,” Devon said. 
Kailyn Feels Safe AgainKailyn Lowry was sick of being harassed by ex Javi Marroquin since he found out about her pregnancy, so she filed a PFI (Protection From Intimidation) against him. He isn’t allowed to be within 100 yards of her and can only contact her about Lincoln. They went to court and he agreed with her terms, which are valid for a year.
“She’s a real piece of s--t is what she is,” Javi said after court. “I’ll never have anything to say to her besides Lincoln.” Yikes, it looks like being civil after the divorce didn’t last long.
Jenelle Gets Dissed by Her ExJenelle Evans has been busy lately. She recently gave birth to her daughter, Ensley, and got engaged to her boyfriend David Eason. Everyone was excited for her, including her mom, with whom she has quite the up-and-down relationship. Well, except for her ex Nathan Griffith, that is.
“I really don’t give a f--k,” he said about the engagement, adding, “What the f--k kind of name is Ensley?”
Leah Deals With Her Daughter’s DisabilityLeah’s daughter Ali has muscular dystrophy and it’s been affecting her really bad lately. So much so that she didn’t felt like participating in tumbling. Leah was totally fine with it and wanted her daughter to do what made her comfortable.
“Whatever she wants to do at the end of the day that’s what matters,” Leah said.
However, her other daughter Gracie did not understand why her sister was quitting the sport, and Leah quickly shut her down. “Gracie you just need to mind your own business,” she said.
Chelsea’s Ex Tests Positive For DrugsChelsea’s daughter, Aubree, seemed over her dad as he ditched her for the father-daughter dance.
“I honestly don’t ever think about him,” Chelsea explained Aubree said.
Adam was trying to lower child support, but in order to do so he had to take a drug test. He tested positive for methamphetamines and amphetamines, and the court date was put on hold. “I wish she didn’t have a drug addict father,” Chelsea said upon hearing the news. Who could really blame her?

Three men and only one rose. Rachel Lindsay has three suitors to choose from heading into the season finale of The Bachelorette, which airs on Monday, August 7.
The 31-year-old attorney introduced Peter Kraus, Eric Bigger and Bryan Abasolo to her family and is gearing up for the last dates before giving out her final rose.
During the July 25 episode, Kraus told Lindsay that he was “falling in love” with her, and the Dallas native told him the feelings were mutual. However, the business owner told Lindsay’s mom that he wasn’t certain he was ready to propose and didn’t ask for her family’s blessing.
Meanwhile, Lindsay has said she always has a great time with Bigger. “Eric is always fun,” she gushed on the July 17 episode. “He’s truly that person that seizes the day.” Bigger’s meet-the-parents went great, and he asked Lindsay’s mom for her daughter’s hand in marriage.
When Abasolo got his turn to meet Lindsay’s loved ones, they totally grilled him and told her that he lacked sincerity. Even though the meeting was a bit rocky, the chiropractor still asked the family for permission to get down on one knee, and they said they trusted Lindsay’s judgment.
As Us Weekly previously reported, the Bachelorette’s hardest goodbye is with her runner-up. "When it gets down to the finale and the final two guys, the last breakup is the most heart-wrenching of all time,” an insider told Us. "They couldn’t say goodbye, and even when they did there were so many tears from her. After she left, he collapsed and sobbed.”
Despite the bad breakup, Lindsay has revealed that she’s happily engaged. “We cannot wait to walk down the street hand in hand,” she told Us last month. “I just want to be in public and do simple things like grab a cup of coffee together.”
Take Us Weekly’s poll and tell Us who Lindsay should pick!
The Bachelorette season 13 finale airs on ABC Monday, August 7, at 8 p.m. ET.

Like it never happened! The upcoming Roseanne revival will ignore the death of John Goodman's beloved character, Dan Conner, from the series finale.
"I don't want to talk too specifically, but I wouldn't say we'll ignore the events of the finale. Dan is definitely still alive," ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey announced at a Television Critics Association panel in Beverly Hills on Sunday, August 6, via Entertainment Weekly.
Roseanne concluded its original nine-season run in May 1997 with patriarch Dan suffering a fatal heart attack, which revealed that much of the series had been a figment of Roseanne (Roseanne Barr)'s imagination. The finale also uncovered that the Conners did not win the Illinois lottery, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) was a lesbian and Darlene (Sara Gilbert) was dating Mark (Glenn Quinn), rather than David (Johnny Galecki).
The news likely won't come as a huge surprise for fans. Goodman's name was attached to the revival when it was first announced in May. He also appeared alongside several of his costars at ABC's upfront event that same month.
Roseanne isn't the first reboot to ignore its original ending. The team behind Will & Grace recently revealed that the upcoming NBC revival will feature Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) still living together in a New York City apartment, rather than with the spouses and children they were given in the May 2006 series finale.
"That finale really caused us a lot of grief. You write a finale because a show is over. You never think that it's coming back again," executive producer Max Mutchnick told Entertainment Weekly earlier this month.
The eight-episode revival of Roseanne is slated to premiere on ABC in 2018.

Summer smash! Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s hit “Despacito” is now the most-viewed video on YouTube ever and the first to hit three billion views. The record-breaking video features the soundtrack for the duo’s original song, rather than the chart-smashing remix with Justin Bieber that was later released.
Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth previously held the honor with their 2015 song “See You Again,” which was featured on the Furious 7 soundtrack.
The audio for the song’s popular remix featuring Bieber has been viewed on YouTube more than 475 million times. Despite the song’s intense popularity, the singer has yet to learn all of the words to the Reggaeton remix. During a June concert in Stockholm, Bieber declined to sing the song after fans begged to hear it. "I can't do 'Despacito,’” he explained to the crowd at the time. “I don't even know it.” The admission promoted a fan to throw a water bottle at him, narrowly missing his head.
Weeks earlier, the “Sorry” singer butchered the words to the song during a night out at NYC’s 1 Oak nightclub, singing: “I don’t know the words, so I say poquito/ I don’t know the words, so I say Dorito.”
Fonsi, however, has come to Bieber’s defense over the flubbed lyrics. “That chorus is not easy to sing, even for fluent Spanish singers like myself,” Fonsi explained to Rolling Stone in June. “It’s got a lot of lyrics, it’s kind of tongue-twisty ... I’ve done songs in other languages. I know how hard it is.”

His tape isn’t over just yet. Dylan Minnette, who plays Clay Jensen on Netflix’s smash 13 Reasons Why, teased the upcoming season while attending the HFPA Grants Banquet in L.A. on Wednesday, August 2.
“The show picks up a few months after season 1 where we left off, and there’s a lot of catch up to play, and I think people might be a little surprised where Clay is,” Minnette, 20, exclusively told Us Weekly. “I don’t know if there’s a new love [interest], we’ll just have to see. But I think people will also be surprised by where he ends up, because I’m also trying to figure it out myself right now.”
When the show left off, Clay drove away with friend Tony Padilla (Christian Navarro) while Hannah Baker’s (Katherine Langford) parents finally found out her truth. Still, it was clear that there was more story to tell — and 12 more versions of events to unveil.
"I think that that last shot of season 1 was a glimpse at him maybe beginning to find some closure, whatever way that is. I don’t think it’s completely closure, because I don’t think he’ll really ever be able to find complete closure in that chapter of his life because it’s the biggest thing that’s ever happened to him, the most impactful thing that’s ever happened to him,” the Wallows singer added to Us. “I think it’s a long, long, long journey for him to find complete closure, and we’ll see that even in season 2. But I think he’s beginning, he’s beginning. Whether it maintains, we’ll find out cause it’s a few months after season 1 [where season 2 picks off], but you know, people will see."
13 Reasons Why, which is executive produced by Selena Gomez, was picked up for a sophomore season in May. The series also stars Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler and Kate Walsh.
"We're deep in the thick of it right now," Minnette said of filming the next season. "Selena has a lot going on in her life. And I think she’s very, very busy. She kind of trusts the people who are on set making it with just about everything, and I’m sure she’ll visit soon … I just go, read the lines, and hope I’m not screwing up."

Tyler Henry was only 2 years old when the series finale of Family Matters aired in 1998, so it may not come as a huge surprise that he doesn't know who Jaleel White is. In Us Weekly's first look exclusive sneak peek of Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry, the clairvoyant medium comes face-to-face with the actor behind Steve Urkel.
"This is embarrassing, but I don't even recognize you," Henry, 21, admits to White, 40, before placing his hand over his face to stifle his laughter.
"Don't worry about that part. We'll talk about that later," the actor responds. "It gives me joy that you don't know who I am."
In the clip, Henry nearly leaves White speechless when he channels a woman whose name includes "Elle," who turns out to be the former child star's late Family Matters costar and ex-girlfriend Michelle Thomas.
"You've got to be messing with me, dawg. C'mon man, you've got to be Googling this stuff before you come in here," the Dancing With the Stars season 14 alum says with a laugh. "You're talking about Michelle Thomas. She was my old costar from Family Matters, and she died of stomach cancer. Quickly. She had a lot of friends in the music industry."
Wiping tears from his eyes, White jokes, "You 'bout to get me meme'd up on Instagram. Wow!"
Thomas, who also starred on The Cosby Show and The Young and the Restless, died at the age of 30 in December 1998, just one year after she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.
Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry airs on E! Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.

Laguna Beach round two? Not exactly. Mark Ford, one of the producers behind MTV’s Siesta Key, compared the new series to the show that made Lauren Conrad and Kristin Cavallari famous in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.
The main difference? The cast is in a different chapter of their lives. “I think a life moves a lot faster now than it did back in the Laguna Beach days. We didn’t really have social media and Instagram and all the different pressures that come from that. And also these kids are older. The Laguna kids were — when we started I think 16 through 19. These kids are 19 through 23. It is a different time in life and they are moving a little bit faster then those Laguna kids were, which is really good for television,” Ford tells Us.
“They all grew up together. That’s what intrigued us. That’s what we loved about Laguna Beach and what we don’t like about other reality concepts. You really want an organic group of friends that know each other, understand each other and know the ins and outs of each other’s lives,” he adds. “That just deepens their connections and their relationships in a way that I think makes it relatable to real kids who grow up with those same friends and you reach that point in life where you are graduating college and everything is sort of up in the air. Like, ‘Am I going to live here the rest of my life? Are these going to be my friends as I move into adulthood? Are we changing? Are those old feelings coming back?’”
Secondly, the series will focus on the stars’ families more. For instance, parents won’t just be making a quick appearance to hand over graduation gifts.
“Because the drama is an hour supposed to a half hour we’re really able to digs into these kids’ lives in a deeper way compared to say Laguna Beach,” Ford explains. “Of course there is going to be the fun intrigue of who’s dating who and who’s in love with who and who’s breaking whose heart — there’s plenty of that. But there is also a lot of really relatable drama around one of the cast members’ parents who are going through a divorce. Another cast members’ mom is dealing with a chronic illness. So we are seeing how these kids are dealing with this time of life when adult decisions are hitting them in the face really hard. They are trying to stretch their childhood as far as they can but life is coming at them really fast. It’s going to be a really fun, drama-filled series but there is a lot of heart in the series as well.”
Still, there are some obvious similarities with the cast, which includes Garrett, Kelsey, Chloe, Alex, Juliette, Brandon and Madisson. There will be love triangles and frenemies galore.
“What it shares with Laguna Beach is the beautiful, idyllic backdrop and the idea of coming-of-age with your friends and dealing with that,” he says. “[Audiences] can definitely expect love triangles. They can maybe expect love quadrangles. There is a lot of organic, real relationship drama that unfolds.”
As for villains? “There’s not a specific villain. One thing that was always great about Laguna Beach is that you kind of can’t bullsh-t your friends. When you are around them you are who you are. Because they’ve known you your entire lives,” he says, before adding: “I wouldn’t say there is one villain, no. But there might be a few!”
Ford and fellow producer Kevin Lopez were first introduced to the concept by a producer in Florida. They pitched the show to MTV in March and began filming the next month.
“We’ve actually thought that this type of show has been missing from TV for a while,” Ford tells Us. “We feel like the landscape of television has kind of left it wide open, especially in the unscripted space.”
And they immediately realized that they may have another hit on their hands. “The big event that is in the first episode with Alex’s birthday. And he has a huge party and emotions came out so organically where the relationships became so clear to us and so relatable. That was probably day three of filming and I think we knew right there that we had a cast that could carry this. That were comfortable in their skins, were very open emotionally about their feelings and they are also incredibly gorgeous,” Ford says. “That combination doesn’t come along very often and I think we all producers felt from the beginning that we had lightning in a bottle.”
Siesta Key airs Mondays on MTV at 10 p.m. ET.

Keeping up with Kylie! Kylie Jenner got real with how her fame affects her and let fans see the real her on the series premiere of Life of Kylie on Sunday, August 6. She’s just like Us, well kind of. One moment, she’s eating McDonald’s fries and talking about shaving her toes, but in the next, she’s struggling to find a private jet and stresses about not driving her Lamborghini enough. Check out the five craziest things Kylie revealed during the show’s premiere on E!
Meet the Squad!
Kylie often Snapchats tons of pictures of a random group of people that seem to be with her 24/7. She formally introduced all of these familiar faces, including her best friend and model Jordyn Woods and her executive assistant Victoria Villarroel Gamero. She also revealed that she met her makeup artist Ariel Winter by DMing him on Instagram, and the true genius behind her signature wigs is her hair stylist Tokyo Stylez. Her gang does everything together, and they are the only people Kylie feels 100 percent comfortable around. “It’s hard to feel normal,” the reality TV star said. 
Prom Mayhem
Kylie wanted to live out her dreams of doing normal things by taking a random boy to prom. Albert is a boy Jordyn found who was bullied at school and needed a date to the dance. Because Kylie was homeschooled, she never got to go to prom and always felt left out, so she felt for Albert.
“I have a soft spot for the outcast because I was the outcast,” Kylie said.
Albert was excited and visibly nervous to have probably the most popular date at the dance. When they arrived, Kylie’s attempt at a normal experience went down the tubes. Everyone was taking photos of her and screaming, so they had to enjoy the dance from a private balcony.
“Kim always said this is what she’s made for, you know, and I respect that, but it’s just hard to do normal things when every single person knows who you are,” Kylie said. “It reminds me that I’m Kylie f--king Jenner.”
The entire school did chant Albert’s name, which Kylie said was “iconic.” It was definitely an unusual prom experience, but one Albert will remember forever. 
Friends Forever!
Jordyn is ready for a relationship, but scared to date as she’s worried guys will only want her because she’s Kylie’s best friend. However, Kylie set up a blind date that she was sure would be perfect for Jordy.
“He is cuter than any guy I’ve ever dated,” Kylie said. Do you need some ice for that burn, Tyga?
But Kylie wasn’t going to let Jordyn go on this date alone, so she gave her BFF an earpiece so she could speak to her and hear everything that was happening. It all sounded like a good idea, but Kylie was constantly cracking jokes to her friend, especially when Jordyn told her date she had two best friends.
“Who the f--k is the second one?” Kylie said. “You have one f--king friend.”
She also made Jordyn leave the date early because she was bored.
“I feel like I’m in a full relationship with her,” Jordyn later admitted. “She’s a needy girlfriend.” You can say that again. 
Losing Herself
Kylie decided to go to therapy to get an outside opinion about her feelings. She told the therapist she really only posts on social media to “stay relevant” and promote her makeup brand, but it often becomes too much for her.
“I really don’t know what it’s like to not have everyone know who I am,” Kylie said about being on camera since she was 9 years old. She also said that social media and online bullying made her really careful about what she posts.
“I think I lost a lot of parts of myself,” Kylie said, referring to her goofy side that only her friends and family get to see. We miss that Kylie, too!
Running Away
Jordyn could tell Kylie was feeling off after the session and decided to try to do another normal thing — go to the beach. Albeit, they went at midnight to avoid a crowd, but they still got to walk (or Heely, in Kylie’s case) on the beach in sweats. The laid-back vibe allowed Kylie to feel comfortable enough to really open up to her friend.
“I just feel like this fame thing is going to come to an end sooner than we think,” Kylie said. “I just want to run away. I just don’t know who I’m doing it for.”
Tell Us: Do you feel sorry for Kylie being so famous? 
Life of Kylie airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Is it hot in here, or is it just Game of Thrones?
Ever since Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) scored herself a trio of dragons back in season 1, it was only a matter of time until she took one into war — and on Sunday, August 6, that moment finally arrived.
In an episode titled "The Spoils of War," Team Targaryen hit back and hit hard, in a blazing conflict with the Lannister army. Meanwhile, in the North, a bittersweet family reunion turned violent … but in a fun way! Read on for the best moments from this week's Game of Thrones.
Starks Galore
At long last, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) has returned to Winterfell, and, well, it's complicated, as she enjoyed a somewhat lukewarm reunion with Sansa (Sophie Turner) — never her favorite sibling — and a somewhat awkward one with Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), whose supernatural gifts have made him medium prescient but extra-strength weird.
Fortunately, she found joy in a hardcore sparring match with a fellow lady badass and the only person at Winterfell who beat The Hound in single combat. Watching Arya and Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) sparring in the courtyard was a pleasure, even if Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) kinda ruined the moment by smarmily watching them from that balcony where he's always standing. On the plus side, there's now a chance that Arya might learn about his role in her father's death and knock him off her kill list as fast as she puts him on it.
Jon Plays Advisor
Meanwhile, Jon Snow's (Kit Harington) adventures in the dragonglass mine on Dragonstone led to an exciting discovery: a secret chamber full of petroglyphs drawn by the Children of the Forest, who mostly communicated their history through vague sun-like symbols, except when it comes to White Walkers, who were conveniently painted on the wall in a photorealistic style worthy of Gerhard Richter. 
The painting swayed Daenerys where Jon's testimony didn't; she promised to join his fight just as soon as he swears loyalty to her. But in the meantime, there were bigger problems afoot: Cersei's (Lena Headey) people were preparing for a siege, stockpiling all the kingdom's resources inside the walls of King's Landing. Dany impulsively vowed to fly her dragons to the Red Keep but Jon, asked for his opinion, advised her that it would be counterproductive. But, hey, if you wanted to fly your dragons somewhere...
Fire and Blood
Overseen by Jaime (Nicolaj Coster-Waldau) and Bronne (Jerome Flynn), a wagon caravan containing the spoils of war was being slowly ushered toward King's Landing. But not quickly enough. As the distant, thundering sound of the Dothraki army drew near, the Lannister men fell into formation — offering up a nice, fat, flammable clump of meat for Daenerys and Drogon the dragon. 
Chaos and carnage ensued, as the wagons (and a fair few soldiers) went up in flames — all but Bronn, who had the sense to locate Qyburn's (Anton Lesser) giant, dragon-piercing crossbow, load it, and fire. Wounded, Drogon plunged to the earth, where Daenerys struggled to remove the arrow. But wounded is not dead, and when Jaime Lannister thought to plunge a spear into Dany's back, his assault ended prematurely in a blast of dragonfire … and a hasty plunge into the safety of the river. Last we saw, Jaime was alive, but we wouldn't assume anything just yet. That water is awfully deep, and that armor he's wearing is awfully heavy.
Game of Thrones airs on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Zoe Saldana and the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy cast have teamed up with David Hasselhoff to appear in a cheesy music video for the song “Guardians Inferno.”
Director James Gunn debuted the ’80s-style music video — which is promoting the release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 digitally on Tuesday, August 8, and on Blue Ray and DVD later this month — on Facebook on Sunday, August 6.
“For your viewing pleasure, the one and only The Sneepers ft. David Hasselhoff performing Guardians Inferno,” he wrote, adding that the video featured appearances by Dave Bautista, Pom Klemenfieff, Sean Gunn, Saldana, Karen Gillan, Michael Rooker, Stan Lee and even Jimmy Kimmel’s sidekick, Guillermo. Gunn insists Chris Pratt is also in the video, but we couldn’t see him (let us know in comments below if you spot Star-Lord).
Hasselhoff, who had a small but important cameo in the film, sings the song that was featured in the closing credits of the Marvel box office hit.
There are dancing aliens, space-themed backgrounds and classic ’70s and ’80s-inspired disco dance moves that make the video worth watching more than once (if you can stomach repeat viewings of The Hoff’s hairy chest).
Fans of the films shared their love for the instant classic on Gunn’s Facebook page.
“I have literally wet my pants laughing at this,” one shared.
“This isn’t the video the world deserves right now, but it sure as hell is the video the world needs,” another commented.
“All sadness stops today,” Gunn, who co-wrote the song, replied.
Watch the video above. It will be included as a special feature on the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 Blu-ray, out August 22.

Although Will & Grace's 2006 series finale ended with Eric McCormack's character, Will, welcoming a son with his partner Vincent (Bobby Cannavale), in the forthcoming revival series, Will is once again playing the field.
"He's got a little bit more self-confidence and that's going to leave some very interesting dating things," McCormack, 54, told Us Weekly and other reporters at the Television Critics Association press tour on Thursday, August 3. "For anyone who says, 'is Will going to date?' Yes!"
The actor notes that the cast and crew of the beloved series are aware that they're leaving major plot holes behind in the transition to the new series. "We'd done a finale that not only answered the questions, but made it impossible," he said. "People saw that election video and what people responded to wasn't just how funny that video was, but how the show looks the same and feels the same. And we went, 'oh that's true! So why are we stuck with this ending that we gave it when we don't have to be?'"
Fans of the series, which also stars Debra Messing as Grace, Megan Mullally as Karen and Sean Hayes as Jack, will see the hilarious foursome transition into middle-aged life. "Will is more comfortable than, let's say, Jack is. I don't think Jack is comfortable aging into a middle aged gay man," McCormack said. "He doesn't know what to do with middle aged gay. Will does. He's a lawyer, he knows how to dress, he's had his own apartment for a long time. He's very comfortable I think. Not to the point of not being funny anymore, but I think it's a new angle."
He adds: "We're not here to reinvent this wheel. We're going to give it a coat of paint and that's it."

There’s no stopping Jay-Z and his famous friends. The rapper has released yet another thought-provoking video for his song “Moonlight,” off of his latest album, 4:44. The visual is a remake of the popular ‘90s series Friends, except now it stars an all-black cast.
The new clip is a parody of Friends, which now features Issa Rae from Insecure as Rachel, Tiffany Haddish from Girls Trip as Phoebe and Tessa Howard from Creed as Monica. The mogul also enlisted actors from the movie Get Out, Lakeith Stansfield as Chandler and Lil Rey Howery as Joey, and The Carmichael Show star Jerrod Carmichael as Ross.
The group is back on a set that looks identical to the famous set from the comedy series, and the cast recreates the intro replacing the classic “I’ll Be There For You” by The Rembrandts with “Friends” by Whodini.
Hannibal Buress stars as himself during the clip — appearing as the seventh friend — to tell them that the show is no good because they are remaking a popular show instead of making something authentic.
This theme ties into the song's lyrics since Jay-Z makes a reference to the now-infamous Oscars mix-up that named La La Land as the Best Picture winner instead of the movie Moonlight. Though it was later corrected and the Academy Award was given to the rightful owners, the moment overshadowed their win and took the spotlight away from the film.
"We stuck in La La Land. Even when we win, we gon' lose," he raps.
The video was directed by Alan Yang, cocreator of the popular Netflix series Master of None.

Now they're in a whole new world! Marwan Kenzari is in negotiations to join the cast of Disney’s live-action remake of Aladdin, while Nasim Pedrad has already been cast in the film, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
The Murder on the Orient Express actor, 34, and the Saturday Night Live alum, 35, will star alongside Mena Massoud (Aladdin), Will Smith (Genie) and Naomi Scott (Princess Jasmine). If negotiations are successful, Kenzari will take on the role of the villain Jafar, an advisor to the sultan of the fictional cosmopolitan city of Agrabah. Pedrad will star as a new character specifically created for her, Mara, Jasmine’s funny handmaiden and close friend, according to the industry publication.
Guy Ritchie will direct the 1992 classic reboot, which tells the tale of a street rat who wishes to become a prince in order to win the princess’s heart. Inspired by the folktales in One Thousand and One Nights, Aladdin draws from Middle Eastern, Indian and Chinese cultures.
The latest casting news comes shortly after Disney’s massive box-office success with the live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, which stars Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. The movie earned more than $1 billion at the box office, making it the most triumphant live-action movie musical ever made.
Aladdin is due to hit theaters in 2018.

She didn’t see it coming. Halle Berry spoke candidly about her 2003 Oscars smooch with Adrien Brody.
“That was not planned. I knew nothing about it,” the Catwoman actress, 50, explained during her visit on Watch What Happens Live on Thursday, August 3. “I was like, ‘What the f--k is happening right now?’ That was what was going through my mind,” she recalled of Brody pulling her in for a kiss after she announced that he had won Best Actor for The Pianist. “And because I was there the year before and I know the feeling of being out of your body, I just f--king went with it.”
When host Andy Cohen asked the Oscar winner if she enjoyed the kiss, she said, “I don’t know, I was too focused on what the f--k is going on right now. I don’t even know!”
Brody, 44, has also opened up about locking lips with the Monster’s Ball star. “That probably was one of the most memorable moments ever. You could say time slowed down,” he told Vanity Fair in September 2015. “In fact, it must have, because by the time I had finished kissing her and people kind of settled in, they were already flashing the sign that said, ‘Get off the stage, your time is up.’ It was amazing.”

Are they going to be heartbroken or get their happily ever after? In TLC’s new prequel series, 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days, six Americans travel around the world to meet up with potential spouses they’re been talking to online, and Us Weekly has an exclusive first look.
Everyone is hoping to get engaged before they embark on their journey to places such as Brazil, Haiti, the Netherlands and Philippines. In the clip, Paul flies to the Amazon of Brazil to see Karine, who he met on a dating app for Latinas. “I’ve traveled thousands of miles into the heart of the Amazon,” the Louisville native, 34, says. "She may not be the same person that she is online.”
However, he encounters some unexpected danger while looking for his 21-year-old love. “There’s a very, very good chance I’m not coming back alive,” Paul says.
Someone in the clip screams, “We just got mugged with a machete.” People are seen running, and a gun shot is heard firing in the jungle.
Meanwhile, Sean, 47, jets to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to meet Abby. “Even though we’ve only spoken online, I love Abby,” he says.
He also runs into trouble when he’s threatened by her relationship with another man, and the trio sit down for a discussion. “Honestly, I think you’re poisonous to her,” Sean snipes. “I do not want you and Abby having a relationship.”
It seems the conversation upset Abby, 20, because she’s seen bursting into tears and running off. "Abby listen to me,” Sean says, to which Abby shoots back, “No, I have nothing to say to you.”
Watch the clip above to see a sneak peek of all the drama.

UPDATE: "The story I told on Jimmy Kimmel last night seems to have spiraled out of control," Pattinson told E! News in a statement. "What didn't come across is that this was supposed to be a joke. No one at all expected or assumed that anything like that would happen on the Good Time set. We are all huge animal lovers and would obviously never do anything to harm an animal."
ORIGINAL STORY: Robert Pattinson is a dog's best friend. The star claimed that he was asked to perform an inappropriate act on a dog during the filming of his new movie, Good Time, but he refused.
The actor, 31, revealed during his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday, August 3, that his character, Connie Nikas, has an affinity with dogs and even believes he was one in a past life.
“There’s this one scene we shot where basically there is a drug dealer who bursts into the room and I was sleeping with the dog,” the British star said. “The director was like, ‘Just do it for real man, don’t be a p--sy.'”
He continued, “The dog’s owner was like, ‘He’s a breeder so you can, you just have to massage the inside of his thighs.’ I didn’t agree to do the real one so we made a fake [penis].”
The actor revealed the scene was eventually cut from the film, adding: “It will be on the DVD extras.”
PETA has since expressed how important it was for Pattinson to refuse to perform the act and for speaking about it publicly.
“PETA depends on actors and crew members to come forward when they see mistreatment, whether it involves a dog who is being forced into churning water on the set of A Dog's Purpose or an A-list actor who is being asked to molest his canine costar,” PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange said in a statement to Us Weekly.
“Robert Pattinson is our kind of guy (and everyone's who has a heart) for refusing to masturbate a dog — which is like child molestation — and for talking about it so that the public can see that once again animal trainers' top priority is money and animals' interests and well-being are often ignored. PETA is currently investigating whether the law was broken in this instance,” Lange continued.
The film received a six-minute standing ovation when it premiered at Cannes Film Festival in May and will be in theaters on August 11.

Wax on! Karate Kid stars Ralph Macchio and William Zabka are reprising their iconic roles as Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence, respectively, nearly three decades after the martial arts drama's release.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the duo will star in a 10-episode, half-hour series titled Cobra Kai on subscription service YouTube Red. The show, which will premiere in 2018, will be set 30 years after the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament and follow the duo once again reigniting their rivalry. While Johnny seeks redemption, a seemingly successful Daniel struggles to get through life without his mentor, Mr. Miyagi, who was originally played by late actor Pat Morita.
“The minute I heard about this project, I knew we had to have it. The Karate Kid became an instant classic in the 1980s, and still resonates with audiences around the world and on YouTube today,” Susanne Daniels, global head of original content for YouTube, said to Variety “We’re thrilled to partner with Sony TV, Overbrook and the talented writing team led by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg to add a fresh, new comedic twist on one of Hollywood’s most storied rivalries.”
The project's executive producers also promise that fans of the original 1984 film should expect plenty of similarities. "Like everyone who grew up in the 1980s, the three of us are enormous fans of The Karate Kid,” Heald, Hurwitz  and  Schlossberg said in a press release, adding that “Cobra Kai will be a true continuation of the original films – packed with comedy, heart, and thrilling fight scenes."

What happens in paradise doesn’t always stay in paradise! Chris Harrison revealed that The Bachelor’s summer spinoff, Bachelor in Paradise, will be airing a live finale to see which coupled contestants’ relationships survived back at home.
“One of the things that will be a little different is our time in Paradise was cut down and compacted, therefore the show will extend back into the real world,” the Bachelor franchise host, 45, told Entertainment Weekly on Friday, August 4. “It’s going to be a lot of finding out what’s been happening because things have been continuing back in the real world since the show wrapped in Mexico. It’s going to be interesting and I think a lot more fun for all of us.”
As previously reported, Bachelor in Paradise halted filming in June after a producer filed an allegation of misconduct on set involving cast members Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson. Warner Bros. immediately shut down production and launched an investigation. Filming resumed after the investigation revealed no evidence to support the claims. Neither Olympios nor Jackson returned to finish filming the season.
Harrison disclosed that the finale, which will have a live studio audience, will air after the show’s reunion special — which includes Olympios and Jackson — not instead of it.
“When I talk to Corinne and DeMario, that’s not just going to be part of a sit-down like the Women or Men Tell All special where there’s 30 people on set. I think people are misunderstanding how that’s going to go. Those are going to be a lot more in-depth and a lot more intimate and a lot more personal and one-on-one than your ‘tell all special,’” the executive producer clarified, adding that the sit-down interview will air early in the season because “it’s something that needs to be dealt with long before the finale.”
Harrison also explained that the live finale special “will be more like After the Final Rose where we’re live, the show is wrapping up, and there will be people involved that were on the show because we have to find out where everybody is. I don’t think you can put those into usual Bachelor boxes because they’re going to be so different.”
Bachelor in Paradise premieres on ABC Monday, August 14 at 8 p.m. ET.

So long and farewell! NBC likely won’t bring back Celebrity Apprentice for another season.
“We don’t have any plans for it at the moment, but I don’t think you’ll see it anytime soon,” the network’s entertainment chief, Bob Greenblatt, told TheWrap at the Television Critics Association press tour on Thursday, August 3. “We literally have put it on the shelf and I don’t think we have any plans to bring it back.”
The news comes five months after Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served as the hit series’ host when it was revived this year, announced that he will not be returning for another season. “I learned a lot, I had a great time, it was a really great opportunity. But under the circumstances I don’t want to do it again. even if asked I would decline,” the former California governor told Empire in March, before explaining that President Donald Trump, the show’s original host, is to blame. “When people found out that Trump was still involved as executive producer and was still receiving money from the show, then half the people [started] boycotting it … and had a bad taste and I don’t want to participate as a spectator or as a sponsor or in any other way support the show. It’s a very divisive period now and I think this show got caught up in all that division.”
Trump took to Twitter shortly after to refute the actor’s remarks. “Arnold Schwarzenegger isn’t voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me,” he wrote. “Sad end to great show.”
Schwarzenegger responded with a 40-second video later that month. “Oh, Donald, the ratings are in and you got swamped. Wow. Now you’re in the thirties? But what do you expect? I mean when you take away after-school programs for children and Meals on Wheels for the poor people, that’s not what you call ‘making America great again.’” he said in the clip. “Come on! I mean, who is advising you?”
The Apprentice first aired in 2004 and the Celebrity Apprentice premiered in 2008.

Believe it or not, Kylie Jenner feels out of place sometimes. As glamorous and popular as she is, Jenner has revealed that she feels like an outcast in her life. In a preview for her new show, Life of Kylie, the reality star, 19, reveals the reason she went to a high school prom with a fan named Albert from Sacramento, California.
"I have a soft spot for the outcast because I was the outcast I guess in a lot of ways growing up," she says in the clip. "And I still feel like an outcast in different ways now because I can't relate to a lot of people so it's like this little world. I do feel like an outcast."
In the video, Jenner and her best friend Jordyn Woods are FaceTiming Albert’s mother, who cries while telling them no girl wanted to go to the prom as her son’s date.
"Just seeing Albert's mom and the emotion she has for her son, I don't know it's just not cool. Kids are mean these days and it's not right to treat people like that,” Jenner said.
After that conversation, the makeup mogul decided to be Albert’s date on his big night. In a previous clip from the show, she admitted that this was also her first time going to prom since she didn’t get the chance to go because she was homeschooled.
She said, “It was really sad, actually. I had to unfollow all of my friends that I went to school with. They probably all thought I hated them, but I just couldn’t see it."
Life of Kylie premieres on Sunday, August 6, at 9 p.m. ET on E!.

Halle Berry is totally fangirling over Malia Obama.
During her appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, on Thursday, August 3, the actress, 50, finally revealed what it was like to have the former first daughter as a production assistant on the set of the CBS show Extant.
“She was fantastic. She was amazing. She is such a smart, beautiful, young woman,” she said about working with former President Barack Obama’s eldest daughter back in 2014. “Look at who her mother and her father are, so duh! She was amazing.”
While a PA is usually expected to help the cast and crew with tasks like fetching coffee, Berry admits that being part of the first family didn’t stop Obama, 19, from doing her job.
“I was such a huge fan of her. She was amazing. She was down to do whatever a PA is asked to do and I had wild respect for her for that,” the Kidnap actress continued. “But everybody couldn’t really see her as a PA. Although she tried and tried to be one, we just couldn’t really see her as one, but to her credit, she tried very hard to be one."
The star also joked saying that instead of asking for a beverage, she was tempted to ask if they could get Obama’s famous parents on the phone.
Berry's former Extant costar, Camryn Manheim has also talked about working with Malia.
“I can tell you that [Malia] is graceful, and lovely, and just charming and delightful. She's pretty remarkable. I mean, they are a remarkable family,” she told Entertainment Tonight in 2014. "When you get hoisted into the spotlight like that, and you grow up under the scrutiny of everybody, and to come out being so charming and in charge of herself, with so much poise, it's beautiful.”
Manheim, 56, added: “Any parent would look at her and be proud.”  “Any parent would look at her and be proud.”

“Roger!” Tia and Tamera Landry’s next-door neighbor may have gotten his happily ever after — with one of the siblings. Tamera Mowry-Housley revealed just this while teasing a possible Sister, Sister reboot.
“The obvious I think would be that one of the characters would end up with Roger. I have an idea on what the characters will be doing but it has to be a surprise!” Mowry-Housley, 39, exclusively tells Us Weekly.
A revival of the beloved series, which ran for six seasons from 1994 and 1999, hasn’t gotten an official green light, but the star says that plans are in the works. 
“I love that our fans are just as eager as we are to get this thing up and running. We are talking to producers as we speak. We’re talking with writers,” the star, who recently partnered with GoodNites Nighttime Underwear, adds. “My sister and I want to make sure that this is going to be amazing. We don’t just want to put something together and say, ‘Hey, look, the reunion.’ We want to make really good TV and that’s what we’re going to do now.”
Mowry-Housley and her twin sister, Tia Mowry-Hardrict, also starred alongside Jackée Harry (Lisa Landry) and Tim Reid (Ray Campbell). The Real cohost says that she “absolutely” wants to bring the original cast back to the show that made her a household name.
“My sister and I never auditioned for Sister, Sister. We helped create it! And that’s what was so inspiring about the whole process. Sister, Sister started with these two girls who just had few acting credits under our name,” Mowry-Housley tells Us. “We met with the right person and we created it. Paramount our distributor and ABC fell in love with the product, with the actual pilot and the rest is history. I guess that is the lesson learned. I am so happy that 14-year-old girl decided to go for her dream. She wasn’t too young to dream and to fulfill it.”
For more, read the rest of her Q&A below:
US: Do you have any memorabilia from the show?
TM: I have this skirt that I love. It’s always a little reward when I can still wear it especially after having my two kids. It makes me feel good. I can’t get into it with my second child but I got into it after my first! I’m working on it. I love it. It’s in my closet and I’ll never get rid of it. I also have a bathroom robe. It’s a pink bathroom robe with white polka dots and I wore it all the time. I still have that.
US: Do you have a favorite episode?
TM: I have a favorite! It’s when my sister and I learned how to drive and we crashed the car. That one was my favorite.
US: Do you have the theme song memorized?
TM: I don’t have it memorized! We did sing it. But I know the first part. ‘I got my own mind! I do my own style in my own time.’ Every part that people don’t know we don’t know as well.
US: Do you and the cast reunite often?
TM: We do! I just saw Jackée a week ago and I speak to Marques Houston all the time. And Tim actually played my dad in a series that I did on ABC Family that’s now Freeform. It was called Roommates (2009). And he played my father then!
US: Your character was so fun and Tia was so timid. Is that the same in real life?
TM: Actually, I’m the one that’s a little more cautious and Tia is fun and outgoing. I can be fun and outgoing too, but I am a bit more cautious, though. I’m a little bit more careful about my environment. I like to scope it out first and then if I’m cool with you, I’m cool with the situation, then I’ll turn up.

All’s well that ends well! On the Thursday, August 3, episode of Married at First Sight, the three couples sat down with the experts to reveal how things had been going since the cameras stopped rolling. While it was mostly a pleasant trip down memory lane, that hardly meant there hadn’t been more bumps in the road for the newlyweds – all of whom had decided to stay married at the end of the season. But were they still together now six months later?
Nate and Sheila Learn to Fight Fair
First up were Nate and Sheila. Asked what he thought when he first saw Sheila walking down the aisle, Nate didn’t mince words. “Damn!” he laughed. Sheila too said she had positive first impressions of Nate. They both agreed that the high point so far had been being married off-camera (probably because they really struggled with being filmed all the time). In other happy news, Nate’s mom had finally come around and embraced their union, which made Sheila much more comfortable.
Asked if they were still married, Nate said, “Marriage is work. We understand that.” Still, he insisted they were working on it every day. “We are still married,” he said with a smile. Sheila then revealed that they had relocated to her house and she had given up her dressing room so that Nate’s brother Tyrique could have his own bedroom. (Now that’s love!) They also reported that they’d finally learned how to fight fair. “We want our marriage to win, even if our egos don’t,” Sheila wisely said.
Sheila had not had an orgasm yet, but Nate remained determined to “find the chocolate factory” for her eventually.
Did Cody and Danielle Finally Do It?
Short answer: No. Though   they too were still married, Cody and Danielle still had not had sex.   Rachel De Alto did her best to conceal her surprise, but she didn’t do a   very good job. Danielle insisted she was “working” on it (i.e. working   on actually wanting to sleep with her husband), but Cody seemed a  little  more relaxed about the whole situation than he had when we last  saw him  when the season wrapped.
Pastor Calvin Roberson  encouraged them  to try to define what “commitment” meant to them and De  Alto tried to  nudge Danielle toward being a bit more affectionate,  praising her for  snuggling next to Cody as they did their interview.
Ashley and Anthony Reveal If They’re Having a Baby
Finally  came Ashley and Anthony. Though they seemed to hit it off from the  get-go and had the least conflict during the season, they still  struggled to find their way as husband and wife. Ashley still found  Anthony’s habit of procrastinating annoying, and he still felt that she  brought her stress from work home with her too often, but overall, they  were in a good place.
Yes, they are still married. “Are you  pregnant?” Rachel De Alto asked. “It’s in the future. It’s going to  happen, but not yet,” Ashley said, adding that she and Anthony “balance  each other out very well.” Anthony said that he knew that they were no  longer strangers when he felt comfortable enough to fart in front of  Ashley for the first time. Ahh, marriage.
Tell Us: Are you surprised all three couples are still married?

Get ready to see a lot more of Ana Maria Polo! The Telemundo star dished on FOX's new court show, Ana Polo Rules, her favorite cases and how she looks up to Judge Judy, in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.
The 58-year-old Cuban-American lawyer is making her way to English television for the first time while starring on the No. one Telemundo show, Caso Cerrado. While Polo admits her two shows will have dissimilarities, she reveals they will both still have the same style that fans have grown to love.
"There are going to be different elements, but it's basically me— it’s what I bring in, it’s my passion, it’s my point of view, it’s my style, my ideology.  There will be some differences, but basically it’s me," she explains.
The biggest distinction between the two? Polo reveals, "[The Telemundo show] was an hour long show. This is going to be a half-hour show. I’m going to deal with one case here, which will give me more time to concentrate, to develop it in a different way."
As for her favorite cases, she says, "One had to do with a drone and the concept of privacy. Does that exist anymore? Can we really put a price or a value in privacy? A lot of people say we do, but you ask most people nowadays, 'What do you want to do when you grow up or what do you want to do with your life?' And they tell you, 'I want to be famous,' as if famous was a career, so the drone case was quite interesting."
Being a popular judge, Polo has often been compared to another prominent woman, Judge Judy. "I admire her immensely," she says. "I admire her legal mind and I admire the way she analyzes things. She’s always able to guide you to where she needs to take you so that she can reach that legal conclusion that is inescapable." Polo also acknowledges, "I do the same thing. I reach the legal conclusion, but I go a different route. I concentrate more on the behavior, on the emotion, on the circumstances that brought about the conflict— less of the legal analysis, so that’s our difference."
While the two have never met, Polo says she "looks forward to having that pleasure and privilege."
Ana Polo Rules premieres on FOX stations in select markets on Monday, August 7.

Grab another tissue box! Mandy Moore revealed that she cried while reading This Is Us season 2 episode scripts that delve deeper into her character Rebecca’s complicated relationship with her daughter Kate.
“I’m excited to explore the relationship between Rebecca and Kate and why it’s still sort of frayed and disconnected in the present day,” Moore, 33, told Us Weekly and other reporters at the Television Critics Association press tour on Thursday, August 3, of her and Chrissy Metz’s on-screen dynamic. “I read [the script] and I bawled. I was like, “Oh, I think I have some stuff to deal with, with my own mother.’ It really touched something in me.”
The “Candy” singer continued to explain the root of Rebecca and Kate’s strained relationship. “We just finished an episode that addresses all of it. It’s interesting to sort of see the parallels in their lives with music and where sort of maybe the resentment started with her mother,” she said. “It’s like two sides of the same coin. They’re both right and they’re both wrong.”
The Walk to Remember actress also disclosed that the show has brought her closer to her parents, who avidly watch every episode, and helped her improve her relationships. “I find myself having really deep conversations. I feel like I’ve always sort of found myself in the position to do that,” the NBC star revealed. I feel very comfortable being vulnerable and being an open book, but I think [the show has] allowed other people around me to feel the same way, you know? The show sort of brings up issues, whether it’s about loss and grief or joy and divorce. Whatever it may be, I think it’s allowed other people to feel more comfortable to sort of start to have those conversations, but I’ve always been like, ‘What do you want to know?’”
Moore also gushed about her character’s charm and charisma: ‘She’s a badass. I feel like I’m lucky to get to sort of step into these shoes on a daily basis and then garner her wisdom.”
This Is Us season 2 premieres on NBC on Tuesday, Sept. 26 at 9 p.m. ET

We can thank President Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for the upcoming revival of Will & Grace, according to Debra Messing.
"The campaign season between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton absolutely was the catalyst for us coming back," the actress, 48, revealed at the Television Critics Association press tour in Beverly Hills on Thursday, August 3. "If that election did not happen and it was a different kind of campaign season, we could not be here right now."
The NBC sitcom's original cast members Messing, Eric McCormack, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes first reunited in September 2016 for a nine-plus-minute video released hours ahead of the first presidential debate.
"Just doing that made us realize that there is a kind of magical synergy between the four of us that just is there," Messing, who plays Grace Adler, said at TCA. "And the writing was just so smart and funny and relevant. I think that gave us all the confidence to say, 'OK, will this work in everyone's lives? And if it does, by all means, let's dive in together.'"
That viral scene resulted in the upcoming reboot of Will & Grace, which premieres this fall. And NBC announced on Thursday that the series has already been renewed for a 13-episode second season, something that Messing never imagined would happen.
"Never, never in a zillion years," she said at TCA. "I always said we can't do anything until we're in our 70s and we can do the geriatric version of Will & Grace and I'm in for that. Golden Girls is genius and I could see us doing that."
Kidding aside, the Emmy winner is beyond thrilled to reunite with the cast. "We really are like brothers and sisters," she gushed. "We can't keep our hands off of each other. We are the happiest when we are totally inappropriate with each other and we make each other giggle, and I think that is the thing that I am looking forward to the most."
Will & Grace returns to NBC on Thursday, September 28, at 9 p.m. ET.

Bachelor in Paradise’s host, Chris Harrison, is speaking out about how the show and ABC will deal with the footage behind the previously-alleged incident of misconduct that took place with Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson during the filming of season 4.
Harrison talked to EW about how they plan on handling the situation, that halted production of the season for an investigation to take place. Since no misconduct was found, the Bachelor franchise host, 45, confirmed that footage leading up to the moment in question will be used on the show.
“To the best of my knowledge, you’re going to see more than enough to show you what was happening that led up to the shutdown, within certain taste and values of what we can show on network TV,” Harrison said.
“It’s going to be literally dealt with the moment we come on the air. We’ll start talking about it right away and start dealing with it. If you don’t, it’s the elephant in the room and then it will taint the entire season,” the TV personality said. “So we want to show everybody and then get on with Paradise because there are some wonderful things that are going to be happening.”
“There’s been a lot written and assumed and said about what we’re going to do and what we’re not going to do. We had already shot for three days [before the shutdown] and a lot had actually happened — a lot of people had arrived, there had been dates, we’d gotten to the point where there was about to be our first rose ceremony — so we had a week’s worth of stuff [that] we didn’t want to just throw that away because that’s what impacted the show and it’s what led to the shutdown,” Harrison added.
The show won’t be airing the controversial moment, but the host plans on giving viewers more details about the situation.
“We thought you needed to see that. So you’re going to see a lot of it, including Corinne and DeMario on the show," Harrison explained. "When we restart, it will be me back in Mexico walking you through what happened and then we’re going to watch what happened. And then we’ll cut back to me and I’ll kind of shed some more light on things and then we’re going to go back and you’re going to see more of what happened, [and] not just the controversial. You’re going to see a lot of things, people falling in love, a lot of dates happening.”
He concluded, “I think people have this preconceived notion of what it was like and what was going on and really the only way to prove anything or show you anything is to all watch it and you can judge for yourself. So that will involve seeing Corinne and DeMario and it will also involve Carly [Waddell] and Evan [Bass]’ wedding.”
Bachelor in Paradise will premiere on ABC on Monday, August 14 at 8 p.m. ET.

Trying again. Million Dollar Listing New York star Fredrik Eklund opened up to Us Weekly Video about starting a family after his and husband Derek Kaplan’s surrogate miscarried twins in 2015.  Watch the video above.
“We feel really good,” Eklund tells Us Weekly. “We’ll share something soon.”
Before the loss, Eklund, 40, often discussed his desire to be a father on the hit Bravo show, but admits that he felt he prematurely shared too much in the past, which is why he is hesitant to divulge too many details this time around.
“We decided not to talk about it for a little longer and that decision feels really good,” Eklund shared. “When the first miscarriage happened I shared that and we filmed that. We had multiple after that and then when the show was airing I was going through the sadness of the second one.”
However, on a recent episode of the Bravo real-estate series, the reality star revealed he and Kaplan were finding “a new egg donor, new surrogate and a new doctor.”
Eklund’s fellow MDLNY costar Ryan Serhant may not be too far behind. The real estate broker, 33, told Us he will “eventually” have kids with wife of one year, Emilia Serhant, but for now, they are still getting used to married life.
“It’s a lot of work. To anyone who says it’s the same once you get married and when you live together nothing changes, a lot changes,” Serhant tells Us. “Especially for my mindset, which is every day I run around thinking about myself, my own business and what I have to do. So it takes work to really focus and work with another person, but it’s been great. It’s an awesome thing.”
To find out more about season six of the series, including an upcoming fight between Eklund and newcomer, Steve Gold, watch the video above!
Million Dollar Listing New York airs on Bravo Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.
Get ready for even more Will & Grace! The sitcom's revival has been renewed for a 13-episode second season, NBC announced at the Television Critics Association press tour in Beverly Hills on Thursday, August 3.
The highly anticipated first season of the reboot, which premieres in the fall, has also been upped again from 12 to 16 episodes. Original cast members Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally are set to return for season 2.
NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt played coy about the possibility of additional episodes earlier in the day. "I hope there is more to come and that would be the greatest outcome of this whole thing," he said at TCA. "We did the first table read yesterday of the first episode. Aside from some reading glasses that appeared, they look exactly the same as they did 10 years ago except there's some hair coloring."
Messing, 48, who plays interior designer Grace Adler, also opened up about the first table read. "We all came together and read and it felt like coming home," she said, via Variety. "We laughed so hard. For the last year, it's been a confusing time and I haven't laughed very much, and to come back together and to laugh out loud and to be surprised by one another and to have new stories to tell and to have another opportunity to do it, it's a no brainer."
Will & Grace returns to NBC on Thursday, September 28, at 9 p.m. ET. Watch a new promo above!

Not quite the collaboration that we were expecting! Sylvester Stallone is set to guest-star in season 2 of This is Us.
“Kevin is shooting a big movie and we needed his big costar, and Sly Stallone is coming to do a huge part on the show as Kevin’s costar and father figure in the film he’s shooting,” executive producer Dan Fogelman said during a panel for the hit NBC series at the Television Critics Association press tour on Thursday, August 3.
The Rocky Balboa actor, 71, who will portray himself on the show, will serve as a mentor for Kevin (Justin Hartley) and help him work through feelings he has harbored in his adult life about his relationship with his departed father, Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). Although the Creed star is only slated to appear in one episode, Fogelman suggested that his role may stretch on throughout the season.
Ventimiglia, 40, who worked with Stallone in 2006’s Rocky Balboa and played Rocky’s son, is close friends with the Escape Plan actor, and helped the NBC series cast him on the show.
“We have a great script for him,” Fogelman continued. “I think it’s going to really, really exciting.”
The show creator also teased that season 2 will reveal more information about how the Pearson family patriarch, Jack, met his tragic end. “If that is a question that has haunted people, over the course of the second season, they will get all the answers they want,” he teased. “The first episode has a big giant piece of the puzzle that will potentially set the internet abuzz and hopefully give some momentum toward that storyline.”

He lasted 37 days! Ramses Soto may not have walked out with a check, but he did leave with plenty of life advice. The Big Brother alum, who was evicted by a vote of 7-3, opened up to Us Weekly about his time on the CBS show — and his friendship with housemate Kevin Schlehuber.
Schlehuber, 55, was like a father figure to Soto, often teaching him street smarts and when not to burp. (No, really.) Still, their unlikely bond didn't keep the stay-at-home dad from going against him on eviction night.
"I love Kevin as a friend and a person, but in the game his loyalties were elsewhere causing him to lie a lot in the game. I do feel betrayed, but it's a game and he did what he thought he had to do at the moment, which was stupid to be honest because I would have always had his back," Soto, 21, exclusively tells Us. "He taught me a lot about how to react in bar fights and how to play pool, typical Kevin things. I'm totally going to Boston for Thanksgiving, I tried to be honest in the game and I'll keep my promises outside."
Soto initially was aligned with Alex Ow, Megan Lowder and Jillian Parker. However, he was ultimately left to fight for himself when Lowder and Parker went home and Ow attached herself to Paul Abrahamian and Jason Dent instead.
"I feel like Alex is really in this game for herself, and she has a good relationship and ship with Jason so she wants to take him far, too. I feel like my relationship with her diminished even more when Jillian left and they were pinning the Jillian vote on me causing neither side of the house to trust me at that point," the cosplay artist adds to Us. "I would have loved to have some type of alliance with Marlena [Mark Jansen and Elena Davies], Jillian, Jason and Alex. We would have went for Paul for sure! He's the best player in the house!"
For more, read the rest of his Q&A below:
US: What was the most challenging about living in the house?
RS: The most challenging thing was having to deal/damage control for situations I was not responsible for. For example, I was framed for pretty much everything in the house and I had to convince everyone by myself that I wasn't lying to begin with, but it's hard to do that when the majority is saying one thing and you're the only one who knows the truth.
US: What do you regret the most?
RS: I regret throwing that veto! If I knew Paul was scheming against me, I would have actually gunned for the win and rubbed it in his face just to show him he can't control me like he controls his minions in the house haha. I also should have annoyed Jessica [Graf] to death to convince her that I wasn't safe so she would veto me off, even though I thought I had the votes to stay.
US: What moment are you the most proud of?
RS: I'm really proud of the fact that even though I tried to throw the veto I actually did really well! If I would have tried to win I would have smoked Paul's time!
US: What do you think of Josh Martinez's feud with Cody [Nickson] and Jessica?
RS: Josh needs to cool off and stop personally attacking people and then apologizing afterwards. If it's for strategy then that's great, but if he's just doing it because that's who he is that's not genuine.
US: What does the house think about Mark bonding with Cody again?
RS: Mark seems really loyal to the people he says he'd be loyal to so I understand why he went back to Cody, but game wise it wasn't the best move for him.
US: What was the most shocking moment on Big Brother for you?
RS: The pendant of protection Paul pulled out causing Christmas [Abbott] to go up!
Big Brother airs on CBS on Sundays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET and Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.

Almost paradise! Bachelor Nation, brace yourselves — the official cast photo for Bachelor in Paradise season 4 is finally here.
The Bachelor franchise’s finest are posing on a beach in Mexico in the photo, which features fan favorites from Rachel Lindsay’s season — Dean Unglert, Jack Stone, Matt Munson and Iggy Rodriguez. The cast also includes last season’s Bachelor in Paradise stars who are eager to give love another go, Amanda Stanton and Vinny Venitera.
However, Nick Viall’s season 21 castoffs have a majority in the star-studded pic: Danielle Maltby, Raven Gates, Alexis Waters, Jasmine Goode, Taylor Nolan, Kristina Schulman and Lacy Mark are all smiles in the front row.
The snapshot was likely captured prior to the ABC dating series’ two-week production shutdown when Warner Bros. launched an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct on set between cast members Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, who both appear in the photo. After finding no evidence to support the claims, filming resumed — although Olympios, 24, and Jackson, 30, did not return to the show.
Both stars have since spoken out about the scandal. After launching her own investigation into the incident, the Miami-based businesswoman was “satisfied” with its conclusion. Jackson has offered his support to Olympios, telling E! News, “I love her and I’m here for her. She’s experiencing the same thing I am.”
While neither returned for the rest of filming, Olympios and Jackson have confirmed that they will appear on the season’s reunion episode.
Bachelor in Paradise premieres on ABC Monday, August 14 at 8 p.m. ET.

He may not have found love in Bachelor Nation, but there’s still hope! Vinny Ventiera opens up about his past relationships — and his ex Izzy Goodkind — in the Friday, August 4, premiere of Million Dollar Matchmaker.
“So tell me about Izzy. She kind of broke your heart in Bachelor in Paradise, right?” Patti Stanger asks Ventiera, 29, in Us Weekly’s exclusive sneak peek.
“Yes,” the reality star, who is giving love another go on season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise, replies. “We solidified our relationship. She said, ‘Yeah, let’s not date anybody else that comes in here.’”
Goodkind, 26, however, is not the first woman to let Ventiera down.
“My real first heartbreak was the girl that I moved in with,” the Florida native explains of his former flame who he moved in with after “a couple months” of dating.
Stanger, 56, then calls the Bachelorette alum out on his fatal flaw: “The rumor is that you fall in love quick,” to which he responds, “Yeah, I’m a lover.”
The WE tv host then suggested that Ventiera ask his potential suitors the three following questions to determine if they’re worthy of his love: “Are you close with your family? Do you cook? Where are you going?”
“I feel like I don’t want to come right out and ask these girls,” the DJ responds, hesitant to follow through with Stanger’s request, but she isn’t taking “no” for an answer.
“You have to. You have to get under the hood of the car, because I’m not letting you get a girl unless you tell me what you know about her in those categories, so those are my rules,” she says. “I mean, I could send you back to The Bachelor. That’s what you do there.”
Watch the clip above to see how Ventiera responds!
Million Dollar Matchmaker premieres on WE tv Friday, August 4, at 10 p.m. ET.
Bachelor in Paradise premieres on ABC Monday, August 14 at 8 p.m. ET.

Get ready for Grown-Ish!
It was announced earlier this year that the hit ABC show, Black-ish, was getting a spinoff series titled College-ish, but now the show has a whole new name. Meanwhile, three new stars have been added to the cast, in addition to actress Yara Shahidi, who signed on to reprise her role as Zoey Johnson. Emily Arlook, Chris Parnell and Trevor Jackson have officially joined the show as series regulars.
Freeform announced that production for the comedy will kick off next month and will premiere in the beginning of 2018. The show will follow Zoey, the oldest of the Johnson family’s kids, as she heads off to college and begins dealing with real adult problems for the first time.
⚡️ZOEY'S. ABOUT. TO. GROW. UP⚡️ Soon, Zoey will be jumping over to @grownish to continue her journey! College, friends, relationships, life, politics...ALL OF IT! Follow 4 updates⚡️ *No worries, she is still a part of @blackishabc as well⚡️
A post shared by Yara (يارا‎) Shahidi (@yarashahidi) on Aug 2, 2017 at 1:00pm PDT
"Grown-ish reflects what we'll be dealing with in the show – that in between place where you're not quite an adult but facing grown world problems for the first time,” Kenya Barris, the show’s creator and executive producer, said via a statement from Freeform. “Where 'black-ish' examines what it means to be black, grown-ish is an examination of what it is and what it means to be grown.”
Arlook, 27, will portray Miriam, a freshman know-it-all at Southern California University with a no holds-barred-attitude. Parnell, 50, will portray the dean of the college and Jackson, 20, will portray a socially-conscious sophomore.
Following the success of the ABC show, Shahidi, 17, revealed it is important for her to expand on society’s issues in her new show, even more so than they do in the original series.
“We want to explore and see where Zoey is going,” she previously told Seventeen. “Because on a college campus — given the socio-political landscape of our society at the moment — we're not only dealing with race policy that we got from Black-ish, [but also] the intersectionality of race, gender, sexuality and political views and ideals. And so [filming on] a college campus and having Zoey experience life as an independent would a perfect place to discuss that."
Similar to her character, Shahidi will also be attending Harvard University in 2018.

She’s worth it! Cecile Frot-Coutaz, CEO of FremantleMedia North America, which produces American Idol, defended Katy Perry’s reported $25 million salary to be a judge on the reboot. 
She claimed to The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published on Thursday, August 3, that American Idol’s production costs are on par with other similar shows — even with Perry’s staggering salary. "The show is not more expensive than its competitors in the genre. If other networks can make it work on similar properties, then there's no reason why ABC couldn’t,” she said. "This notion that the show [costs] a lot more than any other is completely untrue. We know that because we've made other shows in other genres. ABC wouldn't order something that didn't work for them financially.”
Frot-Coutaz, 51, added that she thinks it will also help propel Perry’s career. "Katy is in a transition in terms of her own career. It has been shown now what these platforms can do for artists,” Frot-Coutaz said. "It has been beneficial to other people, whether it's on Idol or The Voice. But I think she genuinely cares. She auditioned when she was a guest judge on Idol in 2010 and then on the [U.K.] X-Factor. She's brilliant.”
 The other judges have not yet been officially confirmed by ABC, but a source exclusively told Us Weekly in May that former contestant Chris Daughtry would be joining the Idol reboot.
Frot-Coutaz also explained to The Hollywood Reporter why ABC felt like it was right time to bring back the show just a year after it was cancelled by Fox. "When Idol wrapped, we did extensive research. We found that we'd recruited new, much younger viewers,” she shared. "Do you wait five or six years, with the landscape continuing to evolve, and risk losing those followers? In thinking about doing the right thing for the brand and franchise, it felt to us that it was an unfinished story. Even though the show lived on Fox for 15 years, its audience is actually closer to that of ABC or CBS."
The revival is also bringing back Ryan Seacrest, who hosted the show from 2002 to 2016. "It was always going to happen. It's hard for Ryan. He's on the East Coast now and had to figure out how to make it work, but he's the hardest-working man in show business, so there will be some flying back and forth,” she continued. "But, as I said, it was always going to happen. He's the face of Idol."

Reunited and it feels so good! Hawaii Five-0 alums Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park reunited in Canada on Wednesday, August 2, only weeks after exiting the CBS drama amid contract disputes.
In a pic posted to Kim’s Instagram account,  the duo were all smiles as they posed along the harbor in Vancouver, Canada.
“#Cousins #reunited.🙂 Until next time, #Vancouver! 🇨🇦” the   Lost star, 48, captioned the sweet snap.
Park and Kim — who portrayed Kono Kalakau and Chin Ho Kelly, respectively — have appeared on the show since its 2010 debut. Last month, the actors announced that they would not be returning to the series for its eighth season after they were unable to come to an agreement over pay.
According to Variety, Kim, 48, and Park, 43, were seeking equal pay to costars Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan.
The Spider-Man actor announced his exit on his Facebook page on July 5. “By now many of you have heard the news, and I’m sad to say it is true. I will not be returning to Hawaii Five-0 when production starts next week,” he wrote. “Though I made myself available to come back, CBS and I weren’t able to agree to terms on a new contract, so I made the difficult choice not to continue.”
Kim continued: “As an Asian American actor, I know first-hand how difficult it is to find opportunities at all, let alone play a well developed, three dimensional character like Chin Ho. I will miss him sincerely. What made him even more special is that he was a representative of a place my family and I so dearly love. It has been nothing short of an honor to be able to showcase the beauty and people of Hawaii every week, and I couldn’t be prouder to call these islands home. To my local community, mahalo nui loa.”
CBS addressed the stars’ departures on the same day. “We did not want to lose them and tried very hard to keep them with offers for large and significant salary increases. While we could not reach an agreement, we part ways with tremendous respect for their talents on screen, as well as their roles as ambassadors for the show off screen, and with hopes to work with them again in the near future," the network said in a statement.
CBS chief Kelly Kahl added: “We loved both those actors and did not want to lose them. We made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around. We wanted them to stick around. It’s an unfortunate byproduct of having a long successful show is sometimes you lose cast members. We didn’t want it to happen. We tried our darnedest to keep them … we never like to lose characters that the audience loves off long-running shows. It’s the nature of the business. We made very lucrative offers to those actors.”

Back in action! Nearly three years after the season two finale of Eric & Jessie: Game On, Eric and Jessie James Decker are returning for season three — this time with their two adorable kids. As seen in Us Weekly’s exclusive first look, the Tennessee Titans player, 30 , and country superstar, 29, juggle their successful careers while raising Vivianne, 3, and 23-month-old Eric Jr., who the couple calls Bubby.
In the clip, the camera flashes between several different scenes where the couple kisses. As fans are well aware, the duo doesn’t hold back with PDA or gushing over each other on social media. On June 8, Jessie posted a photo sitting on her kitchen counter kissing her husband of four years with a leg wrapped around him. As it turns out, their daughter was the one who captured the sweet moment. "When Viv catches mommy and daddy in the act,” Jessie wrote on Instagram. "📸 Vivi Decker."

A post shared by Jessie James Decker (@jessiejamesdecker) on Jun 8, 2017 at 6:51am PDT
Jessie opened up to Us in September 2016 about the couple's intimate moments, admitting that they require a bit more planning since welcoming their little ones. "I have to send him a message and be like ‘Babe it’s on tonight! This is what’s happening,’” she told Us at the time. "Because life gets really crazy and schedules are very hard, but parents and couples need to be intimate. You have to be that way to connect with your spouse and your partner so Eric and I have to find time to get creative because we have two full time jobs and two kids, but we make it work.”
The “Lights Down Low” singer added: "We love each other and even if there’s not time for that we still make time to have conversations and watch a movie together in bed and just hold hands, I mean, you just gotta make it work.”
Eric & Jessie premieres on E! Wednesday, September 6, at 10 p.m. ET.

When in Mexico… drink tequila, kiss your friends, and show everyone your boobs. The Wednesday, August 2, episode of The Real Housewives of New York City opened with the ladies very drunk. Sonja Morgan “went a little bipolar” (as Luann de Lesseps explained) after drinking margaritas out of a pitcher and ended up completely naked in a swimming pool with Bethenny Frankel – who was also completely naked.
Bethenny and Ramona Cry It Out
Bethenny and Ramona Singer then had a heart-to-heart in the pool. For the record, Ramona had her bathing suit on. “I want to get it out of her,” Bethenny said to the camera, explaining that she knew that Ramona had meant to hurt her. “I’m sorry. I’m a miserable person. I’m horrible. I’m a bad friend,” Ramona said as she broke down in tears. Bethenny didn’t seem very impressed with Ramona’s apology. Pretty soon they were both crying.
“I don’t want to be that person,” Ramona said. “I don’t want you to be that person,” Bethenny agreed. Ramona then said she didn’t know what her intention had been when she’d said those things to Bethenny about her being in “soft porn.”  Later, sober, to the camera Ramona admitted, “What I did was mean.” To Bethenny, Ramona said she felt a weight had been lifted and it felt good. “It’s closure,” Bethenny explained to the camera later. The evening ended with Sonja trying to makeout with Bethenny. “Let’s just have a nice time,” Bethenny said as she gently turned her down.
Dorinda Is Bleeding
Bethenny called Dorinda Medley the “weak leak” in the drinking department right before Dorinda sliced her hand open. As Bethenny tried to get Dorinda’s hand to stop gushing blood, Dorinda asked her if she didn’t find it exhausting to always be so concerned about being perfect all the time. “Sometimes you’ve got to just let it go and live a little bit. Super mom, super businesswoman, super wife, super girlfriend,” Dorinda slurred. “Super wife?” Bethenny asked.
“You know what? I’m not doing this with you,” Bethenny said. Carole Radziwill chimed in to say that she thought Dorinda just meant they all needed to be more flexible.
In a brief moment of peace (after Dorinda had stormed out), Tinsley made up with Ramona, admitting to the camera that she now suspected it had been Sonja who had talked trash about her to the press. When Dorinda wandered back to the party, she and Bethenny got right into it. “I never said a mean word about you,” Dorinda said. “Do your s--t, Bethenny.” Then Dorinda stormed out again. “I know exactly who I am,” Bethenny said as she started to cry. “She owes me an apology.”
The Morning After
The ladies gathered for a yoga class the next morning. “This argument isn’t even worth rehashing,” Dorinda reasoned to the camera. “Minus alcohol, there would be no argument.” Dorinda tried making up with Bethenny, but Bethenny said she wasn’t going to say anything to her. “You have a very nasty side to you,” Bethenny said.
Dorinda then cried to Carole about her fight with Bethenny, arguing she wasn’t a nasty person. Meanwhile, Luann de Lesseps told Bethenny to not take it personally. Ultimately, Dorinda apologized to Bethenny. “I feel like I’m always apologizing for being successful,” Bethenny said. “I’m hiding half the things I do because I don’t want to gloat.” Dorinda said her “heart was heavy” when she woke up and she didn’t mean to make Bethenny feel badly. They hugged and made up.
Plenty of Fish in the Sea
Carole, Ramona, and Tinsley Mortimer went fishing, while Sonja, Luann, and Bethenny hit up the spa. During the outing, Tinsley admitted that she was meeting her new boyfriend, Scott, in Las Vegas after this trip ended. “I’m ready to get married so I’ll take it anywhere,” Tinsley laughed to the camera.
The Last Supper
Ramona arrived for the last summer wearing a super-slinky dress. Dorinda said Ramona was “aging backwards.” Bethenny was actually bummed that everyone was on such good terms because it was a bit boring. Dorinda made a point of thanking Bethenny for a wonderful trip.
Bethenny then suggested they each say the best and worst thing about their trip, which she artfully called the rose and the thorn. Luann and Tinsley later got in a fight about the difference between West 
Palm and Palm Beach. “Let’s put a pin in it,” Bethenny wisely suggested.
Tell Us: Do you think Ramona and Bethenny will remain friends?

The Hecks are saying goodbye. The Middle is set to end with its upcoming ninth season, ABC announced on Wednesday, August 2.
The family sitcom, which premiered in September 2009, is one of ABC's longest-running comedies, along with Modern Family. The Middle followed a middle class family living in Orson, Indiana, and starred Patricia Heaton (Frankie), Neil Flynn (Mike), Charlie McDermott (Axl), Eden Sher (Sue) and Atticus Shaffer (Brick).
"The Heck family has been part of the ABC family for almost a decade," ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said in a statement. "It's rare for a series to have this type of longevity, and we are proud to have been its home. We've watched Axl, Sue and Brick grow up right before our eyes under Frankie and Mike's unique parenting style. I'm looking forward to the fitting and happy ending the producers will give the Hecks and our viewers."
Heaton, 59, took to Twitter to promise viewers that the final episodes will be ones to remember. "We love our fans and we're bringing you the most epic final season ever!" the Everybody Loves Raymond alum wrote.
According to executive producers Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline, the announcement has been in the works for a while. "Last year we sat down with our cast and made the bittersweet decision together that in this ninth season it is time to bring the Hecks' story to a close," they said in a statement. "It's been an amazing run, a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we're looking forward to having an entire year to say goodbye. Plus, we wanted to go out before too many people knew we were on the air."
The Middle's ninth and final season premieres on ABC on Tuesday, October 3, at 8 p.m. ET.

Fans of Will & Grace will be in for a surprise when the comedy returns to NBC this fall. The titular characters, played by Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, will be single and childless.
When the hit sitcom concluded after nine seasons in the 2006 finale, McCormack’s character had a son with his partner, Vincent (played by Bobby Cannavale), while Messing was married to Leo (portrayed by Harry Connick Jr.) and raising a daughter.
“When the decision was made to bring the series back, we were like, ‘Well, we left them with kids, right?’ executive producer/creator David Kohan told Entertainment Weekly in an August 2 interview. “And if they have children, then it has to be about them being parents, ‘cause presumably it would be a priority in their lives. And if it wasn’t a priority in their lives, then they’re still parents, they’re just bad parents, right? We frankly did not want to see them being either good parents or bad parents. We wanted them to be Will and Grace.”
“They’ve always been successful at life and living,” executive producer/creator Max Mutchnick added to ET of their decision to make the characters single. “It’s relationships that Will and Grace have always had the trouble with, and they still do.”
Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally will also star in the revival as Jack and Karen. Fans of Connick will be glad to hear that he’ll briefly reprise his role as Leo in the reboot, according to ET. 
Will & Grace premieres on Thursday, Sept. 28 on NBC at 9/8c.

Two years before he was elected President of the United States, Donald Trump was just happy to be offered a fictional version of the role in 2015’s Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No.
David Latt, co-founder of Sharknado’s production company The Asylum, told The Hollywood Reporter in an article published on Tuesday, August 1, that Trump, 71, said yes to the role almost immediately after it was offered. Latt recalled: “He was thrilled to be asked.”
"We got pretty far,” says casting director Gerald Webb of Trump’s negotiations for the role, which was originally offered to Sarah Palin. "It was serious talks."
After weeks of silence, Trump’s attorney Michael D. Cohen explained that the businessman’s real-life political ambition would likely have to keep him from the hit sci-fi franchise. "Donald's thinking about making a legitimate run for the presidency, so we'll get back to you," Latt recalled Cohen explaining. "This might not be the best time.”
The role was eventually offered to Mark Cuban, a move that Latt says didn’t sit well with Trump. The two have been exchanging in an ongoing war of words surrounding Trump's presidency for months. “We immediately heard from Trump's lawyer," recalls Latt. "He basically said, 'How dare you? Donald wanted to do this. We're going to sue you! We're going to shut the entire show down!’”
The film also starred Tara Reid, David Hasselhoff, Bo Derek and Ian Ziering. According to THR, Ziering suggested Trump for the part after appearing with him on season 14 of Celebrity Apprentice. 
The president has come under fire recently after he allegedly made some controversial comments to members of his Bedminster golf club. According to Golf Magazine, Trump told people that “the White House is a real dump,” although a White House spokesperson denied that the conversation ever occurred.

Netflix debuted the harrowing first trailer for Angelina Jolie's upcoming film First They Killed My Father on Wednesday, August 2.
The drama is slated to premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September before heading to the video streaming service. Based on Loung Ung's 2000 memoir of the same name, the film follows the journey of a young Cambodian girl struggling to survive the genocide of the Khmer Rouge regime after the United States withdrew from Vietnam in the mid-1970s.
The nearly two-minute trailer does not include any dialogue, but sets the stage by showing large groups of children soldiers loading ammunition. At the end of the teaser, Sareum Srey Moch, the young actress who plays Ung, stands in front of a building engulfed in flames.
First They Killed My Father marks Jolie's fifth directorial effort, following A Place in Time (2007), In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014) and By the Sea (2015), the latter of which she starred alongside her then-husband, Brad Pitt.
The former couple's eldest son, Maddox Jolie-Pitt, who was adopted from Cambodia in 2002, received his first executive producer credit for First They Killed My Father. "It was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked," the Tomb Raider actress, 42, said of Maddox, 15, in her recent Vanity Fair cover story.
First They Killed My Father hits Netflix on Friday, September 15.

As always, Dawson is just being honest. James Van Der Beek admitted that "yes" he was surprised that his Dawson's Creek costar Katie Holmes married Tom Cruise when he dropped by Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Tuesday, August 1.
The What Would Diplo Do? actor, 40, and Holmes, 38, played Dawson Leery and Joey Potter, respectively, on the beloved teen drama, which ran for six seasons from 1998 to 2003. Three years after the show wrapped, Holmes married Cruise, 55, and welcomed daughter Suri, now 11. She filed divorce, however, and the pair ended their six-year marriage in 2012.
Busy Philipps, who also appeared in the series as Audrey Liddell, talked about the exes during her own WWHL appearance in February 2015. The Cougar Town alum, 38, revealed that she and Holmes lost contact following their nuptials.
"I left her several voicemail messages," she recalled at the time. "I just remember when it happened and I was like, 'Are you on a plane in San Francisco with Tom Cruise? What's happening?' And then I saw her like three years later and she had a kid."
Van Der Beek, meanwhile, was asked several more questions about his Capeside days on Monday. He last spoke with Philipps and Joshua Jackson, totally forgot that writers gave Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams) a heart condition and admitted that he liked how Joey ended up with Pacey Witter (Jackson) and not Dawson.
As for what question he plead the fifth on? The actor refused to reveal whether Holmes or Williams was the better kisser.

Things are about to get creepy. Netflix has released a full-length trailer for its upcoming 10-episode crime thriller, Mindhunter, on Tuesday, August 1.
From executive producers David Fincher and Charlize Theron, the crime drama stars Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany as FBI agents who interview and study the minds of the most dangerous serial killers. 
Groff plays Holden Ford, a special agent in the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, who is based on former criminal profiler John Douglas. McCallany plays Bill Tench, a special agent based on FBI agent Robert Ressler.
As part of their work, Ford and Tench come face-to-face with imprisoned criminals to better understand what causes their violent behavior.
In the trailer, viewers are given a glimpse into the difficult task of tracking down and stopping psychopaths before they commit more crime.
“It’s not easy butchering people. It’s hard work. Physically and mentally I don’t think people realize you need to vent,” a prisoner says to Groff’s character.
Anna Torv, who plays a psychologist named Wendy in the series, is seen telling agents: "Psychopaths are convinced that there is nothing wrong with them so these men are virtually impossible to study, yet you have found a way in near-perfect laboratory conditions. That's what makes this so exciting and potentially so far-reaching,”
The series is based on John Douglas and Mark Olshaker’s non-fiction book Mind Hunter: Inside FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit, which details Douglas' work as a criminal profiler in the FBI's Investigative Support Unit.
Fincher received critical acclaim for his work on 2007’s Zodiac — a film based on the notorious Zodiac Killer whose crime spree terrorized the San Francisco  Bay Area during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Mindhunter premieres October 13 on Netflix.

As for why the character was killed, rather than written off in a different way, Sherman explained that it was simply the best way to further the storyline. “The discussions went on,” he told a group of reporters. “We talked about other things. Ultimately this what was decided with the producers that this was the best way to move forward.”

Mariah Carey didn’t mince words when asked for her two cents on rumors that Lionel Richie is being considered for a judging spot on the American Idol reboot. 
“I would say, don't do it," Carey told Entertainment Tonight on Monday, July 31. "No, I'm only kidding. If he wants to do it, that'll be great. I think he would be really good at it."
“Yeah, they just were trying to foil me when I went on there," Carey told ET of her time as a judge during the 2013 season of the singing competition show. "So, you know, that's the only reason why I say that [to Richie]." The pop star and “All Night Long” singer, 64, are currently headlining their All The Hits tour, which performed in Los Angeles Monday night.
Carey called her one-season stint on Idol, where she feuded with fellow judge Nicki Minaj, “the worst experience of my life” during a 2015 Australian radio interview. “I don't think they had any intentions for us to have a good experience doing that show. Pitting two females against each other wasn't cool," the singer revealed. "It should've been about the contestants instead of about some nonexistent feud that turned into even more ridiculousness."
Katy Perry has already been announced as a judge on the ABC reboot, and Carey gave the “California Gurls” singer her vote of confidence. “She'll be good too,” she told ET.

Kylie Jenner is finally getting her prom experience. In a new sneak peek for her forthcoming reality series, Life of Kylie, the makeup mogul, 19, is preparing to go to prom with a fan named Albert Ochoa.
In the clip, Jenner tries on a v-neck gown, ultimately deciding not to wear it. “It’s a little boob-y for me and Albert,” she says. “You know?”
As the group looks back on Jenner’s assistant Victoria’s old prom photos from high school, Jenner’s own prom experience comes up. Victoria asks: “Wait, why didn’t you go to prom?” to which Jenner replies that she was home- schooled.
“It was really sad, actually,” Jenner recalled. “I had to unfollow all of my friends that I went to school with. They probably all thought I hated them, but I just couldn’t see it."
As previously reported,  Jenner surprised students at Rio Americano High School in Sacramento when she attended their prom with Ochoa in April. Many students, including Ochoa's sister, shared videos of the reality star arriving at the event with her best friend Jordyn Woods and dancing on the balcony with her date.
"TELL ME WHY MY BROTHER TOOK KYLIE JENNER TO PROM 2NIGHT !!!!!!!" Ochoa's sister wrote on Twitter. She also shared a video of her brother sharing a sweet hug with Jenner, writing, "Proud to say that's my brother.”
Life of Kylie premieres on E! on Sunday, August 6, at 9 p.m. ET.

Alicia Vikander is preparing for the world to see her as Lara Croft in the upcoming 2018 version of Tomb Raider. The Oscar winner is on the cover of ELLE’s September 2017 issue and she opened up about what it takes to become Lara Croft in the action-packed franchise.
Vikander, 28, admitted to ELLE that taking on a role that once belonged to someone like Angelina Jolie was no easy feat, and she knew she had to switch it up completely to make it her own.
“I thought I was going to have to explain it to my mom, and she was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah—Angelina did that!’ It proves that [Jolie] set a whole tone for that kind of role, so I knew we had to do something very different,” she said.
After starring in a string of indie drama films, making the switch to a blockbuster is for sure a whole new world for the star. The Jason Bourne actress told the fashion magazine that preparing for the role was empowering and required a whole new level of preparation.
“I love big popcorn movies. I’ve never done action scenes on this level – not even close. It feels like I’m back to dancing – the training, the intensity. You need to be aware of your movement up in the wires and how your body works. I’ve never been able to lift my own weight, and the day when you have that capacity, it’s pretty empowering!” she said.
Despite taking on such a wide variety of roles throughout her career, Vikander admits it is still not easy to find new and challenging roles for women in film: “Complex roles such as that in Hotel] are actually hard to find, which is sad. It’s still—women are written safe.”

Judy Greer loves a nice present. Especially when she picks it out. “It is a Saint Laurent,” she says, referring to her black leather purse. “My husband bought it for me for my birthday two years ago. I was really specific about what I wanted so he wouldn’t mess it up.” The Casual actress, 42, reveals to Us Weekly Video what she won’t leave home without in this video version of our series "What's in My Bag?"
Selfie Ready
Greer, who was in New York to team up with Lactaid, shares her beauty must-haves with Us: “My ‘I can’t live without it’ Burt’s Bees Tinted Lip Balm.  I have more of a pop of color here —  this is a Christina Dior - Rouge [lip gloss] — 668 is the color number.” And for a sunny day she keeps a pair of retro purple-rimmed shades on hand: “These are called Zanzan, I bought them at a store called Sun Room in Austin, Texas.”
Coupon Queen
Who doesn’t love a good coupon? Greer keeps a stash of local car wash coupons that her husband, Dean Johnsen, gave her for Christmas. Also in her Louis Vuitton wallet? She tells Us, “I live in LA so my Triple AAA Card is really important. Hi guys, if you’re watching!”
Staying Organized
“I have a very long-corded charger which says Lucas on it, which is my step son’s name,” Greer explains as she pulls a mess of cords out of her bag. “There were never any chargers in my house because of my step kids and my husband and me. One day I got fed up and I bought one of those P-touch labeling machines and I labeled all of our chargers so no one could ever say that’s not my charger. It helped for like a year and then everything got mixed up again. Now I’m in New York with Lucas’ charger. So who’s the jerk now?”
And how does she organize her jewelry? “I have some fine jewelry in a ziplock — like you do. Thousands and thousands of dollars of borrowed jewelry in a ziplock.”

Kathy Bates will not be returning for the upcoming season of American Horror Story: Cult. The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that the actress, who has starred in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth seasons, will not be appearing in this year’s installment due to a new project.
According to THR, Bates, 69, had a scheduling conflict with her upcoming Netflix series Disjointed. The Chuck Lorre comedy will be released ahead of AHS on August 25.
While she will be missing out on Cult, Bates could likely appear on future seasons of the Ryan Murphy-created anthology series. Until then, she will be starring in the show as Ruth Whitefeather Feldman, a woman who is living her dream as the owner of a cannabis dispensary. Her character employs her recently graduated son and a group of young "budtenders" to help her run her Los Angeles marijuana shop.
As previously reported, Lena Dunham, Billie Lourd, and Colton Haynes have joined AHS: Cult along with vets Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson. The new season will be based on last year’s election and will be a reaction to Donald Trump’s presidency.
Murphy, 51, revealed the title during the San Diego Comic-Con on July 20. The trailer for season 7 showed a crowd of clowns marching together, while the creepy voice over is luring followers into their cult with the promise to make them “strong.” In the trailer, viewers were directed to visit the website AHS7.com, where a new update is being added each week ahead of the season premiere.
AHS: Cult premieres on FX on September 5.

Are Peta Murgatroyd’s Dancing days over? Maybe, according to the new mom, who revealed she’s not sure whether she’ll return to the hit ABC dance competition show.
“To be honest, we don't know yet,” the 31-year-old dance pro told Entertainment Tonight on Monday, July 31, referring to her and husband Maksim Chmerkovskiy. “We're sort of waiting to hear things, waiting to see what our schedules are gonna be like, so, yeah, I mean stay tuned.” 
One consideration for Murgatroyd is being away from her son Shai, who she and Chmerkovskiy, 37, welcomed on January 4. “There's scheduling, as I said before,” she explained to ET. “I don't want to spend 10 hours away a day from my child, so those things factor into it for me. I’m a mom now and that comes first, you know?”
The new mom also shared some milestones that Shai is hitting. “He’s nearly seven months now and he’s standing up, he’s nearly walking by himself … it’s amazing,” she gushed to ET. “It’s an incredible journey to be on.”
Murgatroyd, who competed in Season 24 of Dancing With the Stars less than three months after giving birth, is feeling better than ever about her post-baby body, adding, “I feel good. I really feel like I’m getting to my top shape again.”
Us Weekly exclusively confirmed that the couple tied the knot at Oheka Castle in Long Island on Saturday, July 8. “It was everything we ever dreamt of,” Chmerkovskiy told Us of their nuptials at the 127-room estate. “And the party of the year!” added the bride.

It's almost time to build another snowman! Disney Theatrical Productions has released the first trailer for its upcoming Frozen musical, which makes its Broadway debut in spring 2018.
The two-minute video gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at rehearsals for the new show, as well as the first glimpse of Elsa (Caissie Levy) and Anna (Patti Murin) in action. It also features interviews with the production team behind the musical, including director Michael Grandage, book writer Jennifer Lee, choreographer Rob Ashford and more.
The trailer also delivers some exciting news for fans: The 2013 film's original songwriters, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, who won an Oscar for "Let It Go," promised triple (yes, triple!) the number of songs for the stage play. That means the musical will feature approximately 21 tunes.
While the Disney movie quickly became a favorite for children across the world, producers for the Broadway show are working to make the story appeal to an older audience, too. "For us, what drove us, what inspired us, was the deeper emotions, the more adult themes," Lee says in the teaser.
"The narrative arc is so strong. We can go quite deep," Grandage explains. Lee adds, "Especially with Elsa. We can get inside her head."
Ticket sales and production dates for the Broadway musical will be announced at a later date.
Frozen: The Musical plays a tryout period at the Beull Theatre in Denver from August 17 to October 1, 2017, before moving to the St. James Theatre on Broadway in spring 2018.
A sequel to the Frozen movie, featuring Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, is set to hit theaters on November 27, 2019.

She's not a fan! Channing Tatum revealed during Jimmy Kimmel Live! that his daughter, Everly, was certainly not impressed with his 2006 film Step Up.
The Magic Mike star, 37, and his wife, Jenna Dewan Tatum — who also stars in the movie — expected their 4-year-old to enjoy it. Instead, she quickly got bored and proved them wrong.
"We showed her Step Up for the first time. We were like, ‘This is going to be really cool. It’s got dancing, she’s going to love it,'" the 21 Jump Street actor recalled on Monday, July 31. "Within 10 seconds she was like, ‘Can I watch a real movie? I dunno, like a good one?'"
He added, laughing: "We were like, ‘What do you mean? This is a real movie. It was such a real movie they made like seven more of these! You will watch it. Sit down!' After 10 more seconds, she was like, ‘Can we please watch a real movie?’ And we were like, ‘Fine, just put on Moana. I don’t care.'"
Although Everly hates when her famous dad does voices, the actor wouldn't mind doing a movie like Moana. "I would happily do that. That would be a really good career move," he told Kimmel. "What I want to do is do an animated movie and not tell her that I'm in it and make her go see it, and if she like its, I'm going to rub it in her face."
Step Up is actually where the couple first met. The World of Dance host, 36, revealed how she played hard to get on set, but he eventually knocked on her hotel room and decided to get committed.
"I said, 'Well look, if you want to date other people and be free that's totally fine. But we're not gonna hang out and watch movies. You have to figure out what you want because I want a relationship,'" she recalled to Ellen DeGeneres in April. "He said he had the chance to be free and he couldn't stop thinking about me. He's in a sombrero, underwear and Ugg boots and said, 'Let's do this.'"

As Rachel Lindsay gets close to handing out that final rose,  the castoff men of the season gathered to air their grievances, get  answers to their questions, and… in some cases… hug it out. On the July  31 episode of The Bachelorette: The Men Tell All, Rachel faced  the guys she had kicked to the curb over the last few months, but it  seemed more of them were more interested in facing each other.
DeMario Explains That Infamous Basketball Date
ICYMI, Rachel asked DeMario  to leave after another girl appeared during their date and claimed  DeMario was basically her boyfriend. DeMario still denied the truth of  those allegations. “That’s called a side chick,” DeMario said as the  audience started booing him. “You can boo me. I’m just keeping it real.”
Chris Harrison wasn’t going to let DeMario off the hook  that easily, however. “I feel like now you’re really distancing yourself  from Lexi,” Chris said. “I had this guy DeMario tell me he dated her  and had been in a relationship.” DeMario said he’d never said any such  thing. “I have that on tape,” Chris shrugged. Sadly, they didn’t air the  footage in which DeMario admitted to being in a relationship with Lexi.  Instead, the airtime was spent letting the other guys complain that  when DeMario blindsided Rachel with his (maybe-maybe not) girlfriend,  Rachel closed off emotionally from the process, making it harder for any  of them to connect with her. DeMario didn’t seem very apologetic and  Chris moved on.
Kenny Vs. Lee
Next up were Kenny and Lee, who had been at each other’s throats all season. Dean  was on Kenny’s side. “Kenny might have been the most well-liked guy in  the house and it’s hard to say the same about Lee,” Dean said. “I will  forever have Kenny’s back in that situation. I think that Lee made a  point to badger certain people.” DeMario jumped in to support Lee. “The  Lee that I know was a very genuine guy,” he argued. Will added that Kenny was “one of the smartest guys in the house” and that Lee had been hell-bent on getting under Kenny’s skin.
For  his part, Kenny reasoned that Lee’s behavior was a reaction to him  feeling that he was in over his head and couldn’t compete with the other  guys in the house. “It was just somebody who didn’t belong,” Kenny  said.
Lee admitted he “should have been a better friend” and  apologized to Kenny, who said he didn’t carry grudges, but he wasn’t  sure that he and Lee were going to “sit and kick it” anytime soon. Chris  then surprised Kenny by having his daughter come out on stage and  telling the two of them that they were celebrating Kenny’s birthday the  next day at Disneyland.
Lee Gets in the Hot Seat
Lee  then joined Chris on stage. Lee insisted he’d gone on the show “to meet  somebody,” and admitted that – watching the footage of himself as the  show aired – he realized he had some things about himself that he  “needed to fix.” Dean then jumped in to ask Lee why he’d fanned the fire  on social media while the show was airing if he had, in fact, been  embarrassed by his actions. Chris conveniently had some tweets ready to  go to refresh everyone’s memory. “You should have done this [and  apologized] two months ago,” Dean added, while Kenny said that Lee  needed to take responsibility for his actions like a man.
“I feel  like I have a lot to learn,” Lee said. “If you didn’t get caught, would  you be sorry?” Kenny asked. Lee insisted he didn’t like racism at all  and DeMario said he wanted to sit Lee down and give him a history  lesson. “If I hurt anybody in any way, with a bad joke, I apologize,”  Lee said. “I did things that were wrong.”
Chris then asked him if  he recognized the misogynistic, racist things he said. “I completely  denounce that and I denounce that Lee. I want to learn.” He added, “I am  sorry for saying things when I was not educated and ignorant in those  subjects.” Kenny said he was willing to “help” educate Lee and the two  hugged it out.
Everybody Loves Dean
Next up was  Dean, who reiterated how blindsided he was when Rachel dismissed him  after telling him she was falling in love with him. “She’s always going  to have a piece of my heart, but I understand that door is closed,” Dean  said. Fortunately, he is getting another chance to find love because  he’s appearing on Bachelor in Paradise.
Rachel came out to  join Dean on stage and told him it was “very, very difficult” to say  goodby to him. “I’m still confused about why you told me you were  falling in love with me and then I got the boot four days later,” Dean  replied. Rachel repeated what she’d said before — that she really did  mean it when she’d said she was falling in love with him, even though  she’d sent him home soon after. Dean didn’t seem totally convinced, but  said he felt better about it and let it go.
Rachel Vs. Lee
The  final showdown came between Rachel and Lee. After telling Kenny that  she was “disappointed” by the way he’d handled the situation with Lee,  Rachel turned to the Nashville songwriter to talk to him directly. “I  feel like I’m in such a unique position, I have the opportunity to be a  spokesperson for African Americans, for women, and I just feel like you  had such an amazing opportunity to be surrounded by different people and  different cultures and you didn’t take advantage of that,” she said.  “You can meet me backstage and I’d be more than happy to give you a  black history lesson and a lesson on women’s rights.”
Lee then  completed his unofficial apology tour. “Today, I learned how great the  people that I was with actually are and I just, I want to apologize to  you too,” he said. Rachel said thank you and that was that.
Tell Us: Do you think Lee really felt sorry for the things he’d said?

Stressing out! Kailyn Lowry spilled the beans about her new pregnancy, and her ex worried about how their kids would handle it on the Monday, July 31, episode of Teen Mom 2. Leah Calvert and Chelsea Houska were having problems with their kids giving them total attitude. Not to mention  Briana DeJesus was debating adoption and, as always, Jenelle Evans’ mom was being difficult. Check out the 5 most dramatic moments from Monday’s episode of the MTV reality show!
Leah's Dealing With a Daddy's Girl
Leah’s daughter, Addie, was having serious “panic attacks” about leaving her dad’s to go to her mom’s house, Jeremy Calvert said. “Addie never wants to leave to go home and it keeps getting worse,” he added. She didn’t even want to leave her dad’s house to go to a birthday party Leah planned." Leah was obviously upset, because she tries her hardest and can’t win Addie over. Addie ended up having fun at her party, so it might just be a phase. Let’s hope, for Leah’s sake.
Chelsea's Daughter Felt Left Out
Chelsea’s daughter, Aubree, has felt left out ever since her new brother was born. She started saying she was “scared of ghosts” so she could sleep with her parents and would constantly throw tantrums. Chelsea decided to confront her daughter about it because she was getting upset that Aubree’s attitude was “taking away from [husband] Cole’s experience” with Watson. “Your attitude has been so bad lately and so negative and I don’t even understand why,” Chelsea said to her daughter. “I want us to get along.” The talk seemed to get through to Aubree, so hopefully they all go back to being one happy family again.
Jenelle and Barbara Are Talking Again, Kinda
Jenelle and her mom “surprisingly” enjoyed each other’s company at a Christmas dinner, and were kind of getting along again. Well, for a minute. Jenelle invited her mom to her baby shower, and they bickered about dumb things, but nothing major. However, all hell broke loose when they were trying to schedule a time for Jenelle to pick up her son, Jace. Jenelle’s boyfriend, David Eason, and his girlfriend’s mom starting to argue as well, and it just wasn’t pretty.
“I’m sick of her sh--t I can’t take it anymore,” he said. Jenelle’s mom wasn’t happy with David giving his input either, and a very pregnant Jenelle was just stuck in the middle. “God she irriates the f--k out of me,” Jenelle said, but what else is new.
Briana Was Conflicted About Adoption
Briana started to get serious about giving up her baby for adoption. She called an agency and got more information, and she was just giving her ex-boyfriend Luis time to think. She seemed to have her mind made up, until she asked her daughter Nova what she would think of giving the baby up. Nova was seriously against it, and it made Briana reconsider everything. “My life is a f--king hot mess,” she said.
Kailyn Had Some Explaining To Do
So after Kailyn’s friend dropped the bombshell that the Teen Mom 2 star is pregnant by a third guy, she decided to tell the story herself. “I might as well tell my story and be transparent about it so the truth is out there,” she said while talking to her ex Jo Rivera. Jo already knew about the pregnancy, but Kailyn hasn’t told her latest ex-husband, Javi Marroquin, because she was afraid he will try to sell the story to media outlets.
She admitted that she’s going to try to stay with the guy she’s dating, and they weren’t trying to have a baby but they also weren’t trying to prevent a pregnancy. “He’s a big boy, he knows how to pull out,” she bluntly put it. Jo obviously is not happy with her decision and how it will affect her other two children, but said all he can do is be supportive. Although his fiancee, Vee, had a different opinion.
“It’s not just her life, she’s affecting everyone,” Vee said. “It’s hard for me to sit here and defend someone like that.” Vee’s not wrong, but Kailyn will figure it out like she always has when crazy stuff happens. The big question is whether or not her new baby daddy will appear on the show now that the news is out, or if he’ll stay in the shadows.
Tell Us: Do you think Briana should give her baby up for adoption?
Teen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

James Corden is stepping away from the driver’s seat for Carpool Karaoke: The Series, and it’s leading to some interesting celebrity pairings.
The Late Late Show With James Corden spin-off debuts on Apple Music on Tuesday, August 8, and while the British host appears in some of the episodes, others feature fun match-ups including John Cena and Shaquille O’Neal; Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba; Miley Cyrus, her sister, Noah Cyrus, and their family; Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane; and Chelsea Handler and Blake Shelton. 
The new one-minute trailer features Willie Nelson’s “On the Road Again” and shows celebs in the car and on the streets of L.A., where Will Smith crashes a wedding, Game of Thrones BBFs Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams ride a mechanical dragon and John Legend takes over a laundromat with a gospel choir.
The previous trailer for the show released in February showed O’Neal and Cena working in a bakery, Billy Eichner and Metallica invading a supermarket, and Smith and Corden taking to the skies over Hollywood in a helicopter.
Corden first did a Carpool Karaoke segment back in the U.K. with George Michael for Red Nose Day in 2011 and brought it Stateside when he began hosting the Late Late Show in 2015. Since then, his guests have included Adele, Britney Spears, Madonna, Michelle Obama and Mariah Carey.
As Us Weekly previously reported, Linkin Park fans will get to see a posthumous appearance by singer Chester Bennington in an upcoming episode of Carpool Karaoke: The Series.
The singer, who committed suicide at his California home on July 20, filmed a segment with his band mates just days before his death.

It’s all sun, sand and love triangles! The cast of MTV’s new series Siesta Key sat down with Us Weekly Video to chat about what to expect from the new show and how they went from Laguna Beach fans to working with the same team of producers. Brandon Gomes, Kelsey Owens, Chloe Trautman and Alex Kompothecras gave Us the scoop about the reality show.
Kompothecras explains that it follows a group of young adults living a life of luxury in the Florida beach town. "It’s like the day in the life of young adults living in Siesta Key,” he tells Us. "Yes, more fortunate than others, for sure, but we appreciate everything we have typically. It’s like a big brochure on what there is to do as youthful people in Sarasota [County]. Tons of girl drama obviously."
Siesta Key has gotten tons of buzz, with people already dubbing it the next Laguna Beach. “I watched Laguna Beach and The Hills religiously,” Trautman tells Us. “So, I’m kind of like, ‘You’re acting like a Stephen [Colletti] sometimes.’ I’m really big into it and then Juliette [Porter], who’s one of our cast members, she’s not here, but she’s super into it.”
Owens adds that although they’ve been filming for months, they’re not quite ready for their lives to change once the show airs. “Honestly, for all of us it’s pretty surreal, and I don’t think it’s hit any of us yet at all,” she says. "I think that’s going to take time to kind of adapt to but I think once it hits us it will be like, whoa.”
The cast also played a game with Us, revealing who’s most likely to get into a fight, skinny dip in Kompothecras’ pool, send a drunk text and more! Watch the videos above to see the whole sit-down.
Siesta Key premieres on MTV Monday, July 31, at 10 p.m. ET.

When Dr. Amanda Hess, an obstetrician-gynecologist, checked into a Kentucky hospital to be induced to give birth to her second child on Sunday, July 23, she wasn’t expecting to deliver another woman’s baby hours before her own.
After the OBGYN had already changed into her hospital gown, she overheard another expectant mother screaming. It turned out to be Leah Halliday Johnson, a patient of Hess’s, who was fully dilated and waiting for the doctor on call to return from a break so she could deliver. Hess sprang into action.
“I just put on another gown to cover up my backside and put on some boots over my shoes to keep from getting any fluid and all that stuff on me and went down to her room and I knew her,” the doctor explained to WYKT News. “She was just glad to be able to push and get to have the baby out and be delivered and not have to wait any longer.”
After Dr. Hess delivered Halliday Johnson’s daughter, she was able to welcome her own daughter, Ellen Joyce, just hours later. “I feel very lucky she was there and the type of person she is and step up to do what she did. We really appreciate her,” Halliday Johnson told WLEX 18.
Both moms and newborn babies are doing well.

Fans who don’t want to wait for a Dawson’s Creek reunion got to see two stars of the hit WB show back together on Monday, July 31.
Busy Philipps was filling in for Kelly Ripa on Live With Kelly and Ryan, and James Van Der Beek, who played the titular character on the long-renning drama, was a guest.
“He shot to fame in the '90s, a film and television star ever since. Please welcome the super talented, my friend James van Der Beek!” Philipps, 38, introduced her former costar. “We were together on a little television show called Dawson's Creek.”
“It was weird for both of us,” Philipps admitted of their time on the show. “We were both in weird places.”
“I got married very young and then I got divorced and then and I was single for the first time after not being single in a very long time,” the 40-year-old actor explained. “And Busy and Mark [Matkevich] were like my single counselors — I was not equipped for single life at all!”
Van Der Beek filed for divorce from Heather McComb in November 2009 after nearly six years together, but he found love again and married Kimberly Brook in August 2010.
“Luckily, you found the woman of your dreams and you have this beautiful family…four kids!” Philipps gushed. Van Der Beek, who was promoting his new Vice show What Would Diplo Do?, then gave each of his kids a sweet shoutout.
The actor shared a photo of himself and Busy after the show on Twitter, writing, “SO much fun to hang with my long-time friend (and woman who coached me through my singledom) @Busyphilipps25 @LiveKellyRyan.”

Grab the tissues. Rachel Lindsay’s breakup with her runner-up during the Bachelorette season 13 finale was “brutal,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.
Bachelor Nation last saw the Dallas native, 32, introducing her three finalists, Peter Kraus, Eric Bigger and Bryan Abasolo, to her family. Once she narrowed it down to only two men, Lindsay got very emotional sending one of her suitors home.
"When it gets down to the finale and the final two guys, the last breakup is the most heart-wrenching of all time,” an insider tells Us. "They couldn’t say goodbye, and even when they did there were so many tears from her. After she left, he collapsed and sobbed.”
The insider adds that the attorney didn’t have her mind made up well in advance. “She was torn until the very end,” the source says. "It’s brutal to watch this breakup — worst breakup in years on this show."
Earlier this month, Lindsay told Us that guy “number 2” was the “hardest goodbye.” She added, “That was the hardest moment in general.” 
The closer it got to the final rose, the more she struggled. "Hometowns was so hard because I was connected to every single guy in a different way,” she told Us at the T-Mobile Presents Derby After Dark event July 10. "Honestly, I just wanted to quit and run away rather than proceed, but I was like, the greater the risk, the greater the reward. I know what I want and I can’t quit now.”
She’s excited for the finale to air so she can finally go public with her fiancé. "Honestly, I just want to go on a walk, just walk down the street, hand-in-hand.  There’s nothing big I want to do, I just want to be in public,” she continued. "Do simple, little things, like go grab a cup of coffee, go walk down the street, go walk my dog, Copper, at the park.”
The Bachelorette: Men Tell All airs on ABC Monday, July 31, at 8 p.m. ET.

Viewers are getting their MTV back! After months of speculation surrounding its return, Total Request Live is officially coming to MTV in October 2017, MTV President Chris McCarthy confirmed to the New York Times.
The revived show, which originally ran from 1997-2008, will be hosted by five VJs and will be aired live from NYC's Times Square daily. Throughout its run, the program, which helped skyrocket VJs Carson Daly and Vanessa Minnillo to fame, became as known for its unpredictable moments as it did for debuting hot new artists. Here, Us Weekly has rounded up TRL's five most iconic moments.
1. Mariah Carey's, um, surprise visit
Special delivery! A stunned Daly looked on as the superstar showed up unexpectedly to deliver ice cream to the studio audience in 2003, announcing that the visit was her "therapy." Shortly after, she checked into rehab.
2. The Backstreet Boys shut down NYC's Times Square
Backstreet was back with their second album, Millennium, and the fans were there to show their excitement. The boy band's visit to the show caused so much pandemonium that Times Square had to be shut down so police could control the insane crowds.
3. Eminem's takeover
When he guest hosted, Slim Shady proved he was his own Stan when, rather than play fan-voted videos, he aired his own picks  -- most of which were his songs.
4. 'NSYNC performs "Bye Bye Bye"
Highly choreographed dance moves, matching outfits and harmonized vocals helped make this performance an all-time fan favorite — as exhibited by the nonstop screams from fans throughout the song.
5. Destiny's Child Says Goodbye
Pre-Beyhive! Minnillo helped the trio officially sign off as a group as they shared their favorite memories and listened to fan testimonials.

More Mia Thermopolis, please. The Princess Diaries author Meg Cabot reveals that there is a third movie script — but when or if the film will actually get made is still unknown.
"So, who knows? [It] could happen, as we say," she recently said during an interview with Entertainment Weekly.
When asked what the plot could be, she added: "I would love to sit and talk about [it], but I can’t. I'm not allowed. But it’s really more following the movie than the books, so if she — the last version I read, she definitely did not find out that she has a biracial younger sister … which I personally would’ve thought was hilarious, but that was not the direction they were going."
Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews star as Mia and Queen Clarisse Renaldi in the beloved franchise. If the stars reunite once more, Cabot hopes that the movie will be "a tribute" to late director Garry Marshall, who died at age 81 in July 2016.
Hathaway, 34, paid tribute to Marshall while celebrating the film's 15th anniversary in August the following month.
"It’s been 15 years (say it with me) SHUT UP!!!!! To all the fans who have loved Mia, Louie, Lily, Joe, Michael and, of course, Queen Clarisse, thank you from the bottom of my heart!" the Oscar winner posted via Instagram at the time. "And to Garry Marshall, thank you for making me a princess. I love you always my beloved friend and teacher, and I miss you every day xx."
Whether a third film or not, Cabot does hope that the characters come back in some capacity. "Actually, the one thing I'm really hoping for is a musical, so I hope we have a Broadway musical," she told EW. "Obviously, somebody has to write the music and lyrics, and I’m not gonna do that because that’s not where my talents lie. So I’m just keeping my fingers crossed that some day we’re gonna get one of those. That would be so fun."

First things first: let's pour one out for the baddest-ass old dame in Westeros. After a disastrous start to Daenerys' (Emilia Clarke) play for power in last week's Game of Thrones, Sunday, July 30, saw her weather a series of fresh setbacks, as Cersei (Lena Headey) dealt swiftly and lethally with Dany's allies — including, alas, everyone's favorite cool grandma from House Tyrell. Here's everything that went down in the latest episode, titled "The Queen's Justice."
A Venomous End After capturing a trio of lady prisoners in his raid on Dany's ships last week, Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asbæk) lost no time bringing Yara (Gemma Whelan), Ellaria Sand (Indira Varma) and Tyene (Rosabelle Laurenti Sellers) back for a shame parade through the streets of King's Landing. Euron kept his niece as a captive (for purposes currently unknown but almost definitely terrible), but deposited the Dornish women at Cersei's feet: the promised engagement present for a wedding that Cersei promised will occur when the war is won. In the meantime, the queen wasted no time getting justice for her murdered daughter by giving Tyene a poisoned kiss, leaving her to die in front of her own mother. She also wasted no time removing Jaime's (Nicolaj Coster-Waldau) pants for a little incestual victory sex, because yep, they're still doing that.
Scaly No More In a season that's been quite bleak so far, here's some good news: after a very disgusting experimental treatment that involved Sam (John Bradley-West) peeling off basically all of his skin, Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) turned up this week badly scarred but entirely cured. Hooray! That leaves Jorah en route to reunite with his beloved Khaleesi, while Sam continues to be woefully unappreciated by anyone except the flesh-eating paper mites who are his only companions at Maester college. Womp, womp.
A Stark Reunion Also good news: A knock at the gates of Winterfell revealed Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), reunited at last with older sister Sansa (Sophie Turner). Bran immediately made things weird by telling Sansa he'd taken a psychic peek at her wedding to Ramsay Bolton (Iwoan Rheon); clearly, he needs Arya (Maisie Williams) to show up so that they can compare their supernatural skills sets and leave Sansa to run Winterfell.
An Alliance at Dragonstone Meanwhile, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham) arrived at Dragonstone, where Daenerys demanded some knee-bending which Jon, stubborn as ever, refused. "You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King," he said — a threat that Daenerys, also stubborn, assumed he was just making up. (Really, these two should be able to figure out they're related from the quality of their bickering alone.) But when news arrived that the Sands and Greyjoys were captured, Daenerys made a concession that Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) wisely pointed out meant a lot to Jon but nothing to her: allowing the Northerners to mine and forge weapons from the dragonglass stores beneath her castle. And as far as alliances go, Dany had better hang on to that one, because ...
When They Go Low, We Go Highgarden The Unsullied invasion of Casterly Rock was supposed to be a piece of cake, thanks to Tyrion's unique knowledge of his ancestral home's sewer system. But when the Unsullied broke in, they found the place virtually empty — because the Lannister army was already off at Highgarden, murdering folks! The coup was swift and bloody, leaving only Olenna Tyrell (Diana Rigg) to have a last chat with Jaime about just what a dupe he is for his crazy sister: "She's a monster, you do know that," said the old woman, right before she swallowed a glass of poisoned wine. But before she died, she had one last move of her own to make in this game of thrones: confessing to Joffrey's (Jack Gleeson) murder at the Purple Wedding. You know, the one Cersei convinced everyone, including Jaime, that Tyrion and Sansa pulled off? Yeah. Cersei, you have some 'splaining to do.
Game of Thrones airs on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

She’s gonna get him good! Shania Twain debuted the music video “Life’s About to Get Good,” the first single off her long-anticipated album Now, and there’s a surprising blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearance from her ex husband, Robert “Mutt” Lange.
The upbeat tune about moving on from a shattered relationship is seemingly a nod to her marriage to Lange, which ended in 2010  after 17 years when the record producer, 68, cheated on her with her best friend at the time, Marie- Anne Thiebaud. Twain, 51, eventually moved on with Thiebaud’s ex-husband, Frederic Thiebaud, and the two married in 2011. 
In the video, Twain grabs a black and white photo of her and Lange as she sings, “It was time to forget you,” and turns it upside down as Lange falls out of the shot.
In another nod to her past, Twain opens her closet to briefly wear the same black bustier dress and top hat from her 1997 hit “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” music video. Twain posted a still to Instagram from the new single’s video, in which she wears the outfit, writing: on Thursday, July 27: "Still fits 🎩”
Twain opened up about the album in February, revealing that many of the songs are about Lange. While talking to Rolling Stone about the track “Who’s Gonna Be Your Girl?” the Canadian powerhouse vocalist hinted at why their marriage broke down. “It’s about feeling unappreciated and knowing that you are secondary,” she said at the time. “Having to live with someone that has different priorities and accepting that you’re not the most important thing in a person’s life.”
Watch the “Life’s About to Get Good" music video above.

It’s a go! Showtime has given the green light to an animated satirical series based on Donald Trump’s presidency and administration.
Stephen Colbert will executively-produce the untitled series, which will span 10 episodes and air this fall. “I know lot of people wanted to do this and I’m honored that the Cartoon President invited our documentary crew into his private world,” the late-night host, who has openly criticized Trump on his show, said of the forthcoming comedy. “I’ve seen some of the footage and I look forward to sharing the man behind the MAGA,” a nod to the commander in chief’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”
“Stephen [has] an uncanny genius for deconstructing the world of President Trump and this series opens a new realm for [him],” Showtime’s president and CEO David Nevins explained of the series-to-be.
Added Showtime, “the fresh, cutting-edge comedy will present the truths adventures of Trump’s confidants and bon vivants — family, top associates, heads of government, golf pros and anyone else straying into his obit — intrepidly exploring their histories and their psyches, revealing insights into what makes them so definitely Trumpian.” The network also explained that the show, which will produce content quickly in order to keep up with current events, is meant to be “a workplace comedy,” and a “character study in search of a character, as seen through the eyes of an imaginary documentary crew.”
The sitcom is inspired by Colbert’s Emmy-nominated Showtime special, Stephen Colbert’s Live Election Night Democracy’s Series Final: Who’s Going To Clean Up This Sh*t? The cartoon version of the commander in chief has also appeared on several episodes of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
President Trump has yet to comment on the upcoming series.

Adam Levine may be the only man who can hold a candle to Jake Ryan. In Us Weekly’s exclusive sneak peek of forthcoming comedy Fun Mom Dinner, four mothers with seemingly nothing in common except their preschool age kids wax nostalgic and swoon over Michael Schoeffling’s 16 Candles heartthrob jock — until Levine joins their conversation.
In the clip, Katie Aselton and Toni Collette’s characters discuss how great their night is going thus far. “You know what would make it even more perfect?” Collette asks. “If Jake Ryan just, like, wandered in here.” All of the women simultaneously agree, until Bridget Everett chimes in: “For me, though, it was all about Anthony Michael Hall.”
Molly Shannon challenges Everett, explaining that Jake Ryan was her “ideal” man. “He ruined romance for me,” she explains. "Honestly.”
Aselton’s character nods in agreement. “No guy could ever live up to him,” she says. “No guy ever will live up to him.”
Right on cue, Levine, as the film’s bartender, leans over and says, “I always liked Some Kind of Wonderful.” He and Aselton immediately engage in back-and-forth banter about the film before he’s pulled away by a customer.
After Collette calls out the obvious flirting, Aselton pleads, “Don’t judge.”
“Oh, I am not,” Collette says. “I mean, a little bit of male attention might be just what you need tonight.”
Watch the hilarious  moment in the clip above.
Fun Mom Dinner hits theaters on August 4, 2017 and will also be available On Demand.

James “Ghost” St. Patrick is ready for a clean slate with his wife Tasha (Naturi Naughton) on the Sunday, July 30, episode of Power. In Us Weekly’s exclusive sneak peek, Ghost (Omari Hardwick) plans for his future after he’s finally released from prison.
In the clip, Ghost looks like his old self again and is back home in his penthouse apartment with his wife, Tasha. After having an affair with his first love Angela Valdes (Lela Loren) that led to his arrest, Jamie is ready to do right by his wife and his family and have life go back to how it used to be before his ill-fated encounter with his old flame.
“I was thinking that we could start over. Put the past in the past, you know?” Ghost asks in the preview.
When Tasha says she is unsure if that will work, Ghost assures her that he regrets ever getting involved with Angela in the first place, and promises her that things between them are over for good.
“I wish Angela never came to the club that night. Can’t change what happened, though,” he adds.
In last week's episode, Angela took the stand and put her career as an Assistant United States Attorney on the line in order to get Ghost out of jail – where he was facing the death penalty for the death of FBI agent Greg Knox's murder.
Tasha tells Ghost that she knows Angie took that risk out of love, which means that there is a high chance that something romantic is still between them.

Power airs Sundays on Starz at 9 p.m. E.T.

April and Andy forever! Aubrey Plaza would love to return to Pawnee, Indiana. The actress opened up about the Parks and Recreation cast during the L.A. premiere of her new film, Ingrid Goes West, presented by SVEDKA Vodka and Avenue Los Angeles, on Thursday, July 27.
"I hope so!" she exclusively told Us Weekly about a possible reunion. Plaza, 33, noted that the longtime pals don't talk about it, but added: "I feel that would for sure happen at some point."
Nevertheless, the Parks and Rec crew were out in full force on Thursday night. Chris Pratt, Amy Poehler and Retta all came out to support Plaza at the event.

Can we be more excited? Jennifer Aniston is making her return to the small screen alongside Reese Witherspoon for a still untitled series about morning TV shows and the New York City media scene.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the project will be shepherded by former HBO drama executive Michael Ellenberg. House of Cards writer Jay Carson will pen the script, Harry Potter screenwriter and producer Steve Kloves will executive produce, and Witherspoon, 41, and Aniston, 48, will both receive executive producer credits as well, the outlet reports.
The show will hit the market soon and is expected to draw interest from HBO and multiple streaming services, including Netflix.
This show will be an exciting reunion for Witherspoon and Aniston. The Wild actress memorably made a cameo on two episodes of Friends in 2000. She guest starred as Aniston’s character Rachel Green’s sister Jill in season 6. While Witherspoon is fresh off her HBO drama, Big Little Lies, which earned her Emmy nominations for Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and Best Limited Series, Aniston hasn’t been a series regular on a TV show since Friends ended 13 years ago in 2004.
The Horrible Bosses actress previously told Variety that she was hoping to return to TV. “I’ve thought about it a lot,” she said in January. “That’s where the work is. That’s where the quality is. At this point in my career, I want to be part of wonderful stories, exciting characters, and also just having a good time.”

The Walking Dead producers have canceled their upcoming Television Critics Association press tour panel to attend stuntman John Bernecker's funeral, AMC announced on Thursday, July 27.
Showrunner Scott Gimple and more were expected to promote the show in Beverly Hills on Saturday.
As previously reported, Bernecker died at age 33 after sustaining a severe head injury on set. He was transferred to an Atlanta hospital after he fell more than 20 feet to a concrete floor during a stunt.
Last week, Gimple paid tribute to Bernecker during the show's Comic-Con panel in San Diego. "John passed away this week after he was injured doing something he loved — helping tell stories that excite, entertain, and give people escape," he said at the time. "John was someone beloved in the stunt community, someone who trained other people and helped them break into the business. He was living his dream, and he helped other people do the same thing."
AMC shut down production on season 8 of The Walking Dead for a week following the tragedy. The show returns on October 22.

Till death do us part… or not. On the season finale of Married at First Sight, the three couples were all feeling anxious as decision day rapidly approached. Cody and Danielle were still trying to find the spark, but it didn’t seem their efforts were really working. Sheila and Nate were working to avoid repeating their recent blowout fight. Anthony and Ashley continued getting along well, but she was nervous that he still hadn’t said “I love you.”
Cody and Danielle Struggle With Their Lack of Sex Life
Danielle met up with her friend Angie (who was hot and heavy with Cody’s brother). Danielle was clearly frustrated both that she and Cody didn’t have romance and that Cody kept reminding her of it. “Eight weeks is a long time not to feel comfortable giving kisses or holding hands,” Angie said. “It’s just so hard thinking about the future,” Danielle said as she almost broke down in tears. Cody meanwhile met up with his friend. “I’m going to hold on for as long as I can,” he said, noting that he didn’t know how much longer he could take it.
Cody and Danielle did manage to come together to exchange gifts. Danielle gave Cody a glassware set, and Cody gave Danielle a necklace – which she obviously loved. For one brief moment, she looked like she might be feeling a spark… but then she wasn’t. When Cody asked her about it later, she said she wasn’t sure what to say or how to navigate their lack of chemistry.
Ashley and Anthony Make Their Decision
Things were pretty dreamy in Ashley and Anthony’s world. She was clearly on cloud nine heading into decision day. When they finally sat down with the experts, Ashley said their biggest challenge was “communication.” Anthony thought the biggest challenge was that Ashley was not as “open-minded” as he would like. When the topic of kids came up, Anthony said he didn’t want to have kids in a year. He thought that would be “insane.” Then it was time to make it official.
Ashley told Anthony she thought the last eight weeks had been “amazing” and they had “so much to look forward to.” Not surprisingly, she wanted to stay married. Then it was Anthony’s turn. “Ashley, we’ve had a lot of ups and downs,” he began. “And I couldn’t think of anyone else I would rather spend the rest of my life with. I want to stay married to you. I’m usually not missing words, but right now I am. Ashley, I love you.”
She was totally over the moon. “I love you too,” she said. Then everyone cried, including Rachel DeAlto. When Rachel and Anthony got home Anthony said he was looking forward to “getting a family started.” That was music to Ashley’s ears.
Cody and Danielle Decide Their Fate
As they sat down with the  experts, Cody said he really regretted saying he just wanted to be  friends. Danielle said she didn’t have “falling in love” feelings for  him, but she cared about him a lot. Danielle was up first to say whether  she wanted to stay married or not. “I’ve thought a lot about this,” she  began. “We aren’t in a perfect place. It’s been tough at times.” She  struggled to find the words, but finally added, “I would like to stay  married and keep working.”
Cody smiled when he heard that. “It’s  been hard times,” he said. “In some ways, we’re not the perfect couple,  but no matter what, we always had one good moment in the day.” He then  added, “I would like to stay married to you.” They kissed – well, they  pecked. It was the most physical contact they’d had in weeks. They both  seemed hopeful for the future. “The main thing is that I want both of us  to be happier people because we’re in the marriage."
Sheila and Nate
“This experience was a huge leap of faith and  the thing about taking a leap is that you don't know where you will  land,” Sheila said. “I want to be your wife until the day I die.”
Then  Nate was on the hot seat. Nate took Sheila’s hands in his. “Eight weeks  have been amazing and today is decision day technically, but decision  day was when I said, ‘I do.’” He added, “I love this woman. I love you a  lot, a lot a lot.” To the camera, he said their first eight weeks  together “surpassed” his expectations. He then promised to never stop  trying with her. He promised to never give up and to cherish her every  day and every moment. It was a lot of promises, but he seemed sincere.
Sheila  broke down in tears. “Crying is what I do. You taught me what it means  to be loved and you love me so purely and unconditionally and for that I  will forever be grateful,” she said.

The current second season of Ryan Phillippe’s drama Shooter has been cut short after the actor suffered a broken leg on July 16, Us Weekly can confirm.
"They were only at like the eighth episode. But now production is shut down," a source tells Us. "They were supposed to shoot more episodes for this season."
Phillippe explained on Twitter the day after the accident that his injury did not happen on set of the USA series, which was originally slated to run for 10 episodes this season instead of its current 8. “I didn't injure myself doing a stunt or anywhere near the set of shooter. i was the victim of a freak accident during a family outing on Sunday. My leg is badly broken & required surgical attention,” Phillipe wrote in a series of tweets. “But i will make a full recovery, am in good hands, and will be back in action soon.”
Sources tell Us that while the writers had planned for two more episodes in the show’s season, the crew is happy with the way the story will wrap in the eighth episode.
The actor, who is dad to Ava, 17, Deacon, 13, and Kai, 6, recently dished on the series’ new episodes. "This season we pick up about a year later, so we find the Swaggers in quite a different situation" Philippe said in a behind-the-scenes video posted by USA Network on Tuesday, July 18. "From our very opening scene, you know we’re back.”

Watch your back! Warner Bros. Pictures released the full trailer for the upcoming film adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 horror novel It on Thursday, July 27.
The terrifying trailer begins with a group of children innocently exploring their hometown of Derry, Maine. "When you're a kid, you think the universe revolves around you," one of the boys says in a voiceover. "You think that you'll always be protected and cared for. Then, one day, you realize that's not true. 'Cause when you're alone as a kid, the monsters see you as weaker. You don't even know if they're getting closer."
The clip then cuts to one of the story's most iconic moments, when a young boy named George chases his paper sailboat down the street as it slips into a drain. When he looks inside to retrieve the homemade toy, he sees shape-shifting Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård) for the first time.
The trailer gives fans a much longer glimpse at the petrifying clown, who was only seen for a split second in a previously released teaser. As the new trailer goes on, seven members of the Losers' Club investigate Pennywise while also facing their own personal demons.
The Andrés Muschietti-directed film is the first in a planned two-part series, with the second movie following the Losers' Club as adults. It was previously adapted as a 1990 miniseries starring Tim Curry as Pennywise.
It hits theaters on Friday, September 8.

In the words of modern day philosopher Chris Harrison, the drama continues. Before Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay can begin her happily ever, she must first confront her rejected suitors on ABC’s Men Tell All special. Here, Us Weekly rounds up the best moments to look out for on Monday, July 31:
Lee’s Mea Culpa
”I’m here to mess with everybody,” Lee Garrett sneered during a confessional. His meddling backfired. After calling wrestler Kenny King “aggressive,” the Nashville-based songwriter, 30, was labeled racist — and sent home for making up lies about his competition. (He also came under fire for tweets criticizing feminism, Islam and Black Lives Matter.) Now, King, 35, hopes Garrett’s rejection will serve as an example. Sitting down with host Harrison, “Kenny says Lee never fesses up to anything,” reveals a show source. “They go back and forth, but Lee apologizes to everyone. He says he’s willing to learn.” At the end of the day, there are no thorny feelings. Adds the source, “The guys don’t hate Lee. They think he made some dumb decisions and did not handle things well.”
Dean’s Moving On
Blindsided. That’s how Dean Unglert felt when Lindsay sent him packing post–hometown date. (“She made a mistake,” explained the jilted suitor.) Torn apart, the start-up recruiter, 26, finally finds closure. “Dean puts Rachel on the spot and brings up how she said she was falling in love,” says the source. “They talk it out and everything is OK.” Better, actually. On Bachelor In Paradise, says a seconder insider, “he makes a connection.” 
Adam’s Big Moment
Meet Adam Gottschalk — again! While the Dallas real estate agent, 27, scored little screen time this ­season, ABC makes up for it on the special, says the source. “There’s a video package all about Adam and his relationship with Rachel.” The reason: Gottschalk, who brought a doll of ­himself on the show, hooks up with fan favorite Raven Gates on Paradise. Says the insider: “­Producers want people to be excited about their relationship.”
DeMario’s Defense
Though Lindsay cut DeMario Jackson for cheating, the executive ­recruiter insists he wasn’t in the wrong. The 30-year-old, whose ex confronted him on the May 29 episode, “blames producers for bringing her on the show and says it was all staged,” says the source. Off limits for ­discussion: his controversial hookup with Corinne Olympios on Paradise. Adds the source: “Producers want to keep the shows separate.”
Jack’s Redemption
On a one-on-one date with lawyer Jack Stone, Lindsay couldn’t help but look painfully uncomfortable. (Stone told the star he’d like to take her “home and lock the door.”) But the 32-year-old ­maintains that the outing, plagued by silence, was a ­result of editing — and asks Lindsay for her support. “Jack says it was not an accurate portrayal of who he is,” reveals the insider. “­Rachel ­acknowledges that ­people didn’t see that they actually did have great conversations and that it was easy to talk to him.”
Whaboom’s Still Seeking the Spotlight
Naturally, Lucas “Whaboom” Yancey, 30, does not miss a moment to promote his signature catchphrase — or his acting career. Before a commercial, “music plays and dancers come out from the audience,” the show source explains. “Whaboom rips his shirt off and starts doing a coordinated dance with them!” His castmates don’t let him off easily, adds the source: “They call him out for not being on the show for the right reasons.”
The Bachelorette: Men Tell All airs on ABC Monday, July 31, at 8 p.m. ET.

No one took Dominique Cooper’s nomination harder than Mark Jansen. (Remember the tears?!) But according to the government engineer, 31, the Big Brother housemates were just friends.
“Mark and I established a genuinely strong connection and I didn’t expect something of that magnitude to happen so early in the game,” she exclusively tells Us Weekly. “It was never more than friendship with us and I strongly doubt he had a crush on me.”
The fourth evictee was sent home packing during a not-so surprising 10-0 vote against Jessica Graf. Before saying goodbye, she called out Paul Abrahamian's snake ways and Elena Davies, who is in a showmance with Jansen.
"I suspected jealousy would surface eventually because of her demeanor around Mark and me. Mark shared with me on several occasions that she mentioned my name in their conversations more than often and questioned him about our private chats," Cooper tells Us. "For Mark’s sanity and emotional health, I hope their showmance endures until the end. Go Marlena!"
For more, read the rest of her Q&A below:
US: Did you strategically use your TV show as a way to get information from the other houseguests for your own gameplay?
DC: I have no idea why anyone would think the TV show was a ploy to extract information from other houseguests for my personal game. That is far from the truth relative to the intent of the show. The show was created to provide a platform for us to get to know each other. I’ve always wanted to host TV shows and events so I decided to take full advantage of this opportunity.
US: After you called out Paul, did you get a sense that the others now have red flags up with him?
DC: Unfortunately, not. I’m hoping someone will muster up the courage to annihilate his game sooner rather than later.
US: Do you think his game will blow up soon?
DC: I desperately wanted the chance to do so. Hopefully, they’ll devise a plan and execute it better than I did. Although I was right about Paul, I had no backing or support. It was Jesus and me.
US: Do you think your former alliance will now start to unravel?
DC: Yes, I believe the alliance (that’s no longer an alliance per Paul) will fall apart before the 60-day mark.
US: Who do you think will betray the others first?
DC: Marlena may turn their backs on Paul in an attempt to prove their loyalty to Jody [Cody and Jessica]. Or, history may repeat itself. Oh, how entertaining that would be?!
US: Who is the weakest member on your former team?
DC: I hate to say this about my brother but the team’s weakest link is Mark. His lack of emotional maturity may impact the team’s solidity.
US: Who might win the game?
DC: Kevin will go far. His memory is impeccable and his social game is lit.
Big Brother airs on CBS on Sundays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET and Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.

Buzz, buzz! The first official poster for American Horror Story: Cult was released on Thursday, July 27, and it's beyond terrifying.
The nightmare-inducing photo was shared on the FX horror series' social media accounts alongside the caption, "Be of like mind. The official poster for #AHSCult is here."
The poster shows a woman with 1930s-inspired Harlequin makeup and blood red lipstick. The top portion of her skull is missing, revealing an oozing, honey-filled beehive in place of a brain. Several bees are seen crawling out of the holes of the hive as the woman clutches her head with both hands.
Be of like mind. The official poster for #AHSCult is here. pic.twitter.com/oRGmYQXXia
This is the second time that bees have been used to promote the upcoming seventh season of AHS. Earlier this month, series creator Ryan Murphy took to Instagram to share an image of a woman covered in bees.
Though little is known about the premise, Murphy, 51, previously revealed that the latest 11-episode installment was inspired by the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. Fan favorites Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters are returning to play lovers named Ally and Kai, joining newcomers including Colton Haynes, Billie Lourd, Billy Eichner and Lena Dunham.
According to a report by horror website Bloody Disgusting, the first four episodes are titled "Election Night," "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark," "Neighbors From the Hell" and "11/9," respectively.
American Horror Story: Cult premieres on FX on Tuesday, September 5, at 10 p.m. ET.

Does she know who gets the final rose? Rachel Lindsay’s friend Astrid Loch just let a detail slip that may have revealed this season’s Bachelorette winner. (Warning: Stop reading now if you don’t want any hints.)
Loch, who appeared on Nick Viall’s season 21 of The Bachelor alongside Lindsay, was speaking with Entertainment Tonight and discussed the 31-year-old attorney’s vacation plans with her fiancé after the finale airs.
“They are going to Dallas to have a party there,” Loch said of Lindsay’s hometown. "He gets to meet all of her friends and non-Bachelor people, too. And then they’re going to Miami after that to have an engagement party there, too.”
Fans soon realized that Bryan Abasolo happens to be from Miami, and viewers saw Lindsay visit him there on their hometown date. Her other finalists, Peter Kraus and Eric Bigger, are from Madison and Baltimore, respectively. Although Miami could just be a fun, sunny spot for an engagement party, she could have also divulged that they’re doing a separate celebration with Abasolo’s family.
Lindsay previously revealed to Us that she’s so happy with her future husband. “I am so excited I found The One. He’s so amazing!” she gushed to Us earlier this month. “We cannot wait to walk down the street hand in hand. I just want to be in public and do simple things like grab a cup of coffee together.” 
She did say, however, that choosing between her final three was heart-wrenching. “I connected with each guy and that made this so hard,” she told Us. “Honestly, I wanted to quit and run away rather than proceed."
The Bachelorette airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.

After President Donald Trump announced his plan to ban transgender people from serving in the military, the late-night hosts all criticized his decision during their Wednesday, July 26, shows.
The Celebrity Apprentice alum, 71, tweeted the news on Wednesday morning: "After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in an capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you."
 James Corden, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah all aired segments slamming the ban (Jimmy Kimmel and Conan O’Brien are off the air this week). See their commentary on the issue below: 
James Corden
Corden performed a riff on Nat King Cole’s “L-O-V-E” and changed the song to “L-G-B-T” on The Late Late Show. He sang, “L, he doesn’t care for lesbians / G, he thinks two men should just be friends / B, to his dumb knowledge, is just a phase in college / T, he finds confusing so the army’s now refusing.”
He even included a few facts in the parody. “Transgender troops are not a huge expense. This ban only saves that budget .04 percent. How is there disruption worse than Trump’s corruption? Why’s it such a crisis? Thousands willing to fight ISIS."
Seth Meyers
Meyers brought out four female Late Night With Seth Meyers writers to respond to the news. "You know what an all-volunteer military always needs, people who want to volunteer for the military,” one woman said, while another finished, "As opposed to people like you who got out of military service by saying they have bone spurs in their feet."
They also poked fun at Ivanka Trump’s previous tweet that she’s proud to support the LGBT community. “I’m sure she’s going to give a speech any minute supporting trans people,” they joked before cutting to scenes of an empty podium.
Jimmy Fallon
The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon host invited transgender comedian Patti Harrison on his show to discuss the ban. “I was shocked because I assumed he already did that,” Harrison said. “I don’t necessarily want to serve in the military, but I want the right to serve. It’s like I don’t want to go to your baby shower, but I want the invite. … And yet Trump says transgender people in the military would be a tremendous disruption, and I get it. If you constantly draw attention to yourself, spend all day distracting everyone and cost taxpayers millions of dollars, the perfect job for you isn’t the military, it’s the President of the United States."
Stephen Colbert
The Late Show host spent nearly eight minutes slamming the new policy. “Why the hell would he do this? This wasn’t even one of his campaign promises,” he said. "What the hell does he think the ’T' in LGBT stands for? Trump? Tomato? ‘I’d like an LGBT sandwich, hold the mayonnaise and no gay stuff, okay?’”
The CBS personality noted that Caitlyn Jenner tweeted her shock over Trump’s decision. “Caitlyn, I don’t know if I’m the first person to break this to you, but he’s a liar,” Colbert said. “I know he said he was your friend, but he was using you girl. You deserve better."
Trevor Noah
During the Daily Show With Trevor Noah, the host blasted the POTUS’ early morning tweet. “That was before 9 a.m.,” he said. “You know, with Trump as president, you don’t even need a morning coffee. A little bit of him wakes you right up, takes you straight into it. And too much makes you s--t yourself.”
He played a montage of clips of Trump claiming to support LGBT rights. “Yeah, Donald Trump said he’d protect LGBTQ citizens, and actually, considering how many wars he’s gonna start, maybe he just did,” he quipped.

Never letting go of this moment. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Billy Zane had an epic Titanic reunion on Wednesday, July 26.
The former costars rubbed shoulders as they attended an auction gala hosted by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation in St. Tropez, France. As previously reported, BFFs DiCaprio, 42, and Winslet, 41, auctioned off a dinner where the lucky winner will get to sit down with both stars in NYC in October or November at the restaurant of their choosing.
Zane, 51, shared a photo of the trio posing together via Instagram. "Gangs back together. Now we're saving icebergs. Go figure..@katewinsletofficial @leonardodicaprio @leonardodicapriofdn," he wrote.
The actors starred in the 1997 James Cameron-directed drama, which went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture. In honor of the theme song's 20th anniversary, Celine Dion performed the hit "My Heart Will Go On" at the Billboard Music Awards on May 21.
The stars played Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet) and Cal Hockley (Zane) in the film. In June 2016, Zane exclusively told Us Weekly that he still had DiCaprio's phone number and opened up about his character's bad behavior.
"The world is divided into two kinds. When [women] were younger they were like, 'How can you do that to Jack?' And when they grow up they [now say to me], 'What was Rose thinking?'" he said at the time. He also recalled what it was like to shoot the scene where Cal flips a table during an argument with Rose.
"We did 17 [takes] and they only had two dresses, and I spilled orange juice once," he added. "The wardrobe department was like, 'Thank you so much!' I think it was our first day. It was our first scene."

Talk about strings attached! Cohosts Nev Schulman and Max Joseph met up with Robin from St. Paul, Minnesota, to discover one of the craziest Catfish twists of all time on the Wednesday, July 26, episode of the reality show.
The episode kicked off with a classic Catfish scenario. Robin hadn’t been able to get her online beau of three years, Wayne, to FaceTime with her and felt frustrated after he insisted on calling her with private phone numbers. Robin even revealed that at one point she sent Wayne $300 to buy a phone.
Wayne Stole An Instagram Model’s Photos
After meeting up with Robin and seeing photos of Wayne, Max told her point blank, “He’s not the guy in the pictures. He’s a super handsome guy. You gotta know it’s not him.” Ouch. After some research, Nev and Max discovered they were right — Wayne’s photos actually belonged to a popular Instagram user from Mississippi.
When discovering that Wayne was not the handsome man in his photos, Robin appeared crestfallen saying, “He took my life. That’s how I feel.” Eventually Nev and Max were able to get the real Wayne on the phone and asked if the three of them could visit him in Atlanta. He agreed saying, “Y’all can do whatever y’all want.”
Catfish Turns Out to Be Wealthy
Max, Nev and Robin pulled up to an enormously affluent neighborhood in Atlanta. Wayne appeared to live in a mansion with sports cars lined up along his driveway. Nev immediately commented, saying, “He doesn’t look like he needs $300.” Wayne then emerged from his enormous home and explained why he Catfished Robin, saying, “I wanted to know if she was real. … [Women] see the car, they see the house. … She didn’t see all the materialistic stuff. She liked me for me.”
Wayne Offers His Maserati to Robin
"This was the only female in my life that was genuine to me," Wayne said. "I could be myself and that felt good." He then revealed that he had been married when he started dating Robin but clarified that the relationship ended two years ago. "This is stupid," Robin balked. The wealthy Catfish then boasted, "You gonna come home or not? … You want the Maserati? ... Look at it as a blessing.”
Wayne Admits to Cheating on Robin
Wayne, embarking on an honesty streak, copped to sleeping with other women on top of being married during their online relationship. He then dropped another bombshell. Wayne said, “I’ve never just been solidly committed to one girl. I like to have more than one girlfriend at a time. … We could be one happy family all in one household." Robin said no. Two months later, Nev and Max checked in with Wayne and he was still single.

You send the Real Housewives of New York City to Mexico with unlimited access to tequila. What could go wrong? On the Wednesday, July 26, episode, the ladies’ trip to Mexico was in full swing. Things kicked off with Tinsley Mortimer receiving a huge floral arrangement from her new boyfriend (at least, that’s what she was calling him). “I am literally and completely overwhelmed,” she said to the camera as footage rolled of her accepting the bouquet. “You guys might be in love already,” Bethenny Frankel chimed in, while Carole Radziwill (who had originally set Tinsley and the new man up) added, “This is like a match made in heaven.”
Ramona Really Wants to Be Invited
Meanwhile, Luann de Lesseps was barely functioning thanks to a wicked hangover and Ramona Singer was shamelessly lobbying to get invited to Bethenny’s tequila tasting. “I’m not apologizing for anything,” Ramona insisted before trying to convince Bethenny to let her attend. When Bethenny reiterated that she did not want Ramona to come, Ramona replied, “Maybe you’ll change your mind by the end of the day.” To the camera, Bethenny explained, “I’m nervous that she’ll do something negative on a very expensive trip with partners that are very important to me.”
Bethenny then told Ramona that she knew Ramona didn’t like her. “I don't not not like you,” Ramona replied. Bethenny was a bit confused by that but didn’t have much to say in response. A group of the gals – including Bethenny, Carole, and Luann – then went surfing, while Ramona, Sonja, and Tinsley did some shopping.
Tinsley Confronts Sonja
One thing led to another and Tinsley finally confronted Sonja about the story that had run in the paper that day claiming that Sonja said Tinsely was a bad, ungrateful houseguest. Sonja continued to insist that she hadn’t said anything of the sort, even though she’d been saying it all season to anyone who would listen. Though Tinsley’s feelings were clearly hurt, Sonja wasn’t going to budge and ultimately Tinsley just gave up. Speaking of giving up, Bethenny finally agreed to let Ramona join them for the tequila tasting the next day.
“What’s to discuss?” Bethenny said to the camera. “You’re a deplorable human being who bought be a $62 handbag to get back on the trip.” Bethenny added that Ramona “better be on her best behavior.” Sonja told Carole and Bethenny that Ramona was unhappy because she wasn’t “getting banged.” Then she argued with Tinsley about whether she was an ungrateful houseguest or not. “You draw attention to yourself by being dramatic,” Sonja argued. It didn’t seem like anyone was buying what Sonja was selling here, but she wasn’t going to give up.
Bethenny Warns Ramona to Behave
Just because she had cracked and invited Ramona on the tequila trip hardly meant that Bethenny was letting her off the hook. “Please do not tomorrow do or say anything bad,” Bethenny practically begged. “This is my life. It’s my livelihood.” Ramona nodded as Bethenny continued, “If you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all. Start being a good, nice person that people want to be around.” Ramona said she was trying and Bethenny told her she needed to try harder.
An Alcoholic Trip for the Ages
The big day finally arrived and the women hopped on helicopters to head to the agave fields. The entire way there, Ramona was definitely on her best behavior, and it was driving the other women nuts. “I can’t bare watching Ramona kiss her [butt],” Dorinda Medley said to the group.
They then began drinking. Sonja decided it was as  good of a time as any to start drinking again and threw back some shots. By the time they got back to the villa, Sonja was trying to make out with Luann at every chance.
Then she turned to Ramona and began insisting that Ramona wasn’t happy. Ramona didn’t like that so much. “You don’t go from getting banged by Mario every night to getting nothing,” Sonja said, adding that Mario was like a sledgehammer.
Even Bethenny felt badly for Ramona and jumped in. “Sonja is literally just badgering her,” Bethenny said to the camera. “I want you to admit you’re not happy,” Sonja said to Ramona.
And… that’s when the episode ended.
Tell Us: Do you think Sonja’s out of line?

Count them if you can! Charli XCX’s new music video “Boys” features dozens of famous male faces, including Joe Jonas, Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa, Will.i.am, Diplo, Jack Antonoff and so many more.
The singer, 24, directed the music video and personally recruited her friends to make cameos in the video, which aims to flip the script on music video cliches. 
“They’re basically just doing all the sexy things that girls usually do in videos,” she explained to BBC Radio 1 of her creative vision. “I turned it around! It started with me listening to the song in the car, and I was just thinking about like, Joe Jonas being really sexy, like eating food, which is kind of a weird combo but I was like, ‘Wait! This could be like, an idea.’”
“So then I started thinking about all the guys I’ve worked with or met over my years in the industry and I was like, okay, I feel like I can harass enough of them into doing this video and text them and annoy them and basically started sending them all these ideas,” the British songwriter shared. “I just want to kind of flip the male gaze on it’s head and have you guys do the sexy stuff. And they were all super down and got right on board and it was amazing.”
Watch the whole star-studded video above to see famous guys pumping iron, playing with puppies, having a pillow fight and more.

A decade before he was elected, Kelly Ripa tried to talk Donald Trump out of running for president. During an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers on Tuesday, July 25, Ripa, 46, recalled a conversation she had with Trump, 71, when he guest-hosted her show in 2006.
“You know what’s crazy, he was talking about running for president then. Then! And I remember actively having this conversation with him,” the Live With Kelly and Ryan host recalled. "He said, ‘Everybody wants me to run for president,’ and I said, ‘Who?!’”
Ripa explained that she tried to convince Trump that he wouldn’t be able to maintain his lavish lifestyle in the Oval Office. “I said, ‘But why would you want to do that? Why would you want to give up your life, which is so good?'” she told Meyers. "'You’re not going to be able to go to Florida anymore. You’re not going to be able to golf every weekend.’“
Ripa added with a laugh: “And I was wrong! You can do that!”
As for Trump’s demeanor on her show, Ripa explained that the businessman was nothing but confident as he sat in the hosting chair: “He came out and he was like, ‘This is going to be the biggest-rated show you ever had in your life.’”
Meyers then asked Ripa if she heard from the president after impersonating him for Halloween last year with a wig and exaggerated tan, mocking some of his notable speeches. “I didn’t get any feedback from him,” she said. “Which I was thankful for.

Fresh off celebrating her 25th birthday, Selena Gomez released the music video for her new single "Fetish" on Wednesday, July 26.
The Petra Collins-directed visual begins with the singer walking down the street of a suburban neighborhood while carrying bags of groceries. She appears to be in a dream-like state as she blocks the sunlight with her hand and sings the first verse of the tune.
Things get intense when Gomez enters her home. Clad in a long, yellow dress, she stumbles into the kitchen and throws her groceries on the ground. She then rips her stockings before placing her tongue inside of an eyelash curler.
"You got a fetish for my love," she sings. "I push you out and you come right back / Don't see a point in blaming you / If I were you, I'd do me too."
In the next scene, the "Bad Liar" songstress writhes around a candlelit table in her dining room as rain mysteriously pours from above. Soaking wet, she makes her way to a walk-in freezer, where she rubs frost through her hair and squirms around as featured artist Gucci Mane raps his verse.
The video concludes with Gomez rubbing lipstick on her teeth, biting a bar of soap and spitting out an unknown, gooey orange substance.
"Fetish" is the second single from the 13 Reasons Why executive producer's as-yet-untitled third studio album, which is expected to drop later this year.

Back in action! Warner Bros. announced on Tuesday, July 25, that Wonder Woman 2 will hit theaters on December 13, 2019.
Gal Gadot will return for the sequel to the box office smash hit, although Patty Jenkins has not been officially announced yet as the film’s director. The second movie in the series was officially announced at San Diego Comic-Con, where Gadot, 32, had an adorable moment with an emotional young fan who was wearing the character’s classic cape and tiara. Footage of their interaction shows Gadot holding the young girl’s hands as she says, "There's no reason to cry anymore, right? Here we are together.”
Since its June 2 release, Wonder Woman has been critically acclaimed for its positive depiction of the superhero and general messages of female empowerment. Additionally, the film is currently the highest-grossing live-action film from a female director.
The Israeli native, who is mom of daughters Alma, 5, and Maya, 4 months, with husband Yaron Versano, opened up about nailing her audition for the role after listening to one of Beyonce’s female empowerment anthems. "They were looking at six or seven girls, and we were all in separate trailers and were told to stay inside until they called us. Waiting is my enemy Number One, and I was losing my mind. So, I decided to put on Beyoncé,” she recalled in W’s May issue. “Who runs the world?' Girls! I just started to dance, and I let my anxiety go. Thank you, Beyoncé!”

Abby Lee Miller broke down and revealed her biggest fears about jail, including abuse, underwear and salad bars in a Lifetime Dance Moms: Abby Tells All special that aired Tuesday, July 25.
The former Dance Moms star, who began serving her 366 days for fraud on Wednesday, July 12, opened up to The View’s Jedediah Bila, who conducted the interview for the special, about her concerns for her safety.
“If it's that bad, I probably won't survive,” the Lifetime personality, 50, revealed through tears. “I mean if a whole gang of people want to kill you, they're going to do it. If a whole bunch of people want to make your life a living hell, they're going to do it.”
She also worried that the jail-issued underwear wouldn’t fit, saying, “There's underwear that they give you, that are used, other people's underwear. I don't know how they're going to have a bra that's going to fit me.”
Miller, who underwent bariatric weight loss surgery in April, also lamented that jail likely wouldn’t have healthy food options. “I’m worried about eating in there,” she complained. “I don’t think there’s a salad bar and I doubt there’s going to be a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. I’m gonna go away for a long time and they’re gonna have whatever they have, and that’s what I have to eat.”
The choreographer was charged with bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy assets and false bankruptcy declarations in 2015.

OMG! Usher hopped in James Corden’s car for an amazing Carpool Karaoke segment that aired on The Late Late Show on Tuesday, July 25. 
The duo kick off the ride by jamming out to his 2004 hit “Yeah!” before pulling over into a parking lot so Usher, 38, could teach Corden, 38, some dance moves. First, the Grammy winner helps Corden with his stroll for stepping into the club, telling him to “be cool” and drop the jazz hands. Then, they put on OutKast’s “So Fresh, So Clean” while the comedian tries to copy Usher’s suave moves.
They later stop by the musician’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, only to find to that it has a smudge! So, the pair pull out rags and cleaner to tidy up as crowds of tourists watch. "Please be respectful of the star, guys. Walk around the star of Usher,” Corden tells everyone.
Then, during an energetic rendition of “I Don’t Mind,” they discuss whether it’s a compliment to call a girl “my bitch” like he does in the song. Usher explains, “You’ve got to think about the way you’re placing it. There’s a time and place for every expression. If you’re in an argument and you call your girl a bitch, you’re going to get slapped.” Corden says he would definitely get slapped either way if he introduced his wife that way.
In another unexpected turn, Corden and Usher see a group of guys having some car trouble. They help push the vehicle to the repair while and Usher stops traffic. The pair wrap it up by singing “OMG” and practicing some of those dance moves they worked on.
"I had no idea when I got in your car I’d end up pushing cars and also cleaning my star,” Usher joked.

Jess is breaking hearts once more. Milo Ventimiglia is keeping mum about more Gilmore Girls, even suggesting that it’s fans of Stars Hollow who are behind the rumors.
But seriously, can you blame Us?
“If you go to Warner Bros. or to [creator] Amy [Sherman-Palladino] or Lauren [Graham] or Alexis [Bledel] everything is generated by the fans and trying to will things to existence,” the This Is Us star, 40, exclusively tells Us Weekly.
“The thing that I always compare it to is a concert. You go to a show and it’s a great show and you love the band. And they go off stage and you clap and they come back on for one or two more songs and then they leave the stage — they don’t come back on the stage again,” he adds. “It’s a bit of an acceptance for an audience. You can’t have something live on forever. You have to accept that there is a time and a moment where you’re favorite show is on and you get to see stories of these characters but these characters have to go on. These actors that play them, the writers that write them, they have to move on.”
Luckily, Ventimiglia returned before that (possible) final curtain call for Netflix’s revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. Four new 90-minute episodes dropped in November 2016, which meant more trips to Luke’s Diner, a pregnancy bombshell and plenty of coffee.
“I think fans are very fortunate to have four more episodes of this show, but beyond that I’m kind of focusing on Jack,” Ventimiglia adds to Us, referring to his This Is Us character.
Nevertheless, Jess’ return was a nostalgia-filled treat for Team Jess fans. The favorite bad boy still had his leather jacket, dark locks, and a book on hand. Even more, he appeared to still be in love with Rory. In his final scene, Jess longingly watched on through a window as the Yale University grad helped Kirk (Sean Gunn) rest after he overdecorated Lorelai and Luke’s (Scott Patterson) wedding. (His side business Oober — not Uber — probably didn’t help either.)
“Shooting the last scene I remember was a pretty quick moment. Amy gave me some direction, I took it and then they captured it,” Ventimiglia recalls to Us. “I never dream about where any of my characters are when I take off their clothes. I take off the characters’ skin and move on from it. I don’t even imagine where they go so I’m not sure where Jess went.”

She's a trooper! Olivia Wilde adorably reached out to Jennifer Lawrence after the Oscar winner vomited during her Broadway show in NYC earlier this month. Wilde, 33, opened up about the incident when a viewer called in during Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Tuesday, July 25.
"Listen, she didn't need to apologize. I felt so bad and I sent her some Matzah ball soup and some bagels and she feels much better," Wilde said. "She had a stomach flu, the poor thing walked in sick."
She added: "She's feeling better thank the Lord because she's the best."
As previously reported, the Passengers actress, 26, got up mid-performance during 1984 at the Hudson Theatre to throw up in the bathroom. Ushers helped escort her out of her seat and into the lobby area.
As it turns out, Lawrence had to cancel her plans for the rest of the night. On Tuesday, Cohen, 49, revealed that she was expected to drop by WWHL after the showing — but as an audience member.
"She was supposed to come here," he told Wilde and fellow guest Anderson Cooper. "She was going to watch the show that night. It was so random. Vicki Gunvalson was on and she really wanted to come on. Not even kidding. Isn't that crazy?"
Lawrence, of course, has been open about her love for the Real Housewives franchise and is even friends with Lisa Vanderpump.

Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon did more than just go bro-biking during Memorial Day weekend in the Hamptons. The best friends actually broke into a house.
Fallon, 42, and Jessica Biel recalled the situation while the Sinners actress, 35, appeared on The Tonight Show on Tuesday, July 25. The foursome — including Fallon's wife, Nancy Juvonen — decided to check out an open house. But they soon realized that there was no real estate agent on the property.
"Nancy and I were hoping to go in and so we dragged you guys," Biel said. Timberlake, 36, and Fallon arrived a few minutes later (after bro-biking on their own for a bit) and noticed Biel and Juvonen, 50, inside the home. Biel said she checked every single door until she found one that was unlocked.
"We got out and were looking for you guys and your bikes were around the house," Fallon added.
Bro-biking. @jimmyfallon 🚲 #memorialdayweekend
A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on May 27, 2017 at 1:05pm PDT
Uninvited, the group decided to stick around for a while. They checked out every room, including the basement and pool house. The result? They were quite impressed!
Earlier in the day, the former boy bander and Fallon got Biel to film their hilarious bro-biking moment, which Timberlake shared on social media in May. "We thought it would be funny if you filmed this. We were doing it and one time Justin said, 'Don't ring the bell.' And then we go by and we didn't ring the bell and when we watched it back we could hear Justin directing at me — yelling at me!" Fallon said. "And we were like, 'Jessica, do you mind doing it again?'"
The couples — or at least, Biel — was prepared during their bike ride. "That is mom style. I do not leave the house [without snacks]," she said. "I’m gonna have pretzels, veggie sticks, apple, string cheese. I’m gonna have supplies! You will always have snacks if you're rolling with me."
These 2 angels... The greatest gift I've ever known. And, the reason I won't EVER STOP! Happy Fathers Day to all the Dads out there! Hope you are enjoying! #Howearlyistooearlyforafathersdaybeer
A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Jun 18, 2017 at 12:44pm PDT
She joked: "I would ring my bell and circle back around on my bike and get a handful and just drop it into Frannie's hand."
Fallon and Juvonen are parents of daughters Winnie, 4, and Frances, 2. Timberlake and the 7th Heaven alum share 2-year-old son Silas.
"He dresses like he's going to a club or something. He's the coolest kid. I felt intimidated hanging out with him," Fallon joked of Silas. Biel replied: "I feel a little intimidated by him, too. I mean, it's kind of like a mini Justin. It's his style. He’s got, like, a daddy swagger."

James Van Der Beek doesn’t care who Joey ended up with on Dawson’s Creek.
The 40-year-old actor revealed in the Tuesday, July 25 episode of the "Allegedly With Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss" podcast that he hasn’t even seen the series finale, which aired on May 14, 2003.
“I’ve never seen the last episode,“ the actor, who played the titular character from 1998-2003, said. “I remember, I think, how it ended.”
When asked if he was satisfied with Joey (Katie Holmes) choosing Pacey (Joshua Jackson) over his character, Dawson, Van Der Beek said, “Sure. It’s interesting. It’s a weird thing because people obviously … when you make any kind of entertainment, people own it. They own a relationship to it.”
“It’s amazing, and the fact that it resonates with anybody today … and that they even care my thoughts on it, I feel like my thoughts on it are kind of irrelevant,” the ‘90s heartthrob added. “I’m not as invested in that. It was something that I did, not something that I wrote. I was a part of it. Honestly, I feel like a passenger on the whole thing.”
Still, Van Der Beek knows it’s a big deal to some fans. “Honestly, it’s a weird thing to relate to because it’s not so immediate for me, but I do recognize that it’s immediate for people who watched it on Netflix like yesterday,” he said on the podcast. “I try my best to be there and be present for those kinds of questions.”
The show may live on with binge-watchers, but the Varsity Blues alum also revealed he doesn’t see much money in residuals despite its cult following.
“No, not much. Hardly any at all,” Van Der Beek said. “I was young. We signed really bad contracts.”
Meanwhile, he and his former costars have more or less all shot down ideas for a reunion or reboot.
“The answer hasn’t changed in 15 years,” Van Der Beek said. ”If you’re really curious, you can Google that answer.”

Anne Hathaway may be entering a life in plastic. The actress, 34, is in talks to replace Amy Schumer in Sony’s live-action Barbie film, Variety reports.
As previously reported, Schumer, 36, parted ways with the film in March due to other projects on the horizon. “Sadly, I’m no longer able to commit to Barbie due to scheduling conflicts,” the Trainwreck star said in a statement to Variety at the time. “The film has so much promise, and Sony and Mattel have been great partners. I’m bummed, but look forward to seeing Barbie on the big screen.”
According to the site, Sony still plans to stick to its June 29, 2018 release date, though it’s not clear when production would start on the project. Though nothing has been confirmed, The Hollywood Reporter says that Hathaway handpicked the film’s director, Alethea Jones. 
Hathaway has taken on fewer projects since welcoming son Jonathan with husband Adam Shulman in March 2016, however the actress has several films in the works, including the highly-anticipated Ocean's Eight.
Prior to shooting the action film — which also stars Sandra Bullock, Mindy Kaling, Rihanna, Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter and Sarah Paulson — Hathaway opened up about why the project was a good first movie to jump into after giving birth. “Honestly, right now I am looking forward to the hair and makeup trailer,” she told Entertainment Tonight in September 2016. “[My castmates] are fun and a lot of them are moms, so I am excited that my first film back as a mom, I get to work with women who have done it before and I get to ask them questions about that."

Agent 007 is back! The 25th installment in the James Bond franchise finally has a release date.
The as-yet-untitled movie is set to hit theaters in the United States on November 8, 2019, Eon Productions, the British production company behind the Bond movies, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced on Monday, July 24.
Though producers have yet to announce the cast and director, The New York Times reported on Monday that Daniel Craig will return for the leading role. Two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the newspaper that Craig's return is a "done deal." However, the BBC reported that the British actor, 49, has yet to sign a contract.
Eon and MGM also announced that the script will be written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who previously worked on the screenplays for the last six Bond films, beginning with 1999's The World Is Not Enough. The 25th movie will be released on the same day that Walt Disney Studios is scheduled to debut a new live-action fairy tale, though Disney has yet to disclose the title of the film.
After filming the most recent Bond movie, Spectre, in 2015, Craig sounded less than thrilled about continuing the role, which he took over from Pierce Brosnan in 2006 with Casino Royale.
"I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists [than continue as Bond]," he told Time Out magazine in October 2015. "No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on."
Sean Connery was the first to portray the famed spy on the big screen, followed by David Niven, George Lazenby, Sir Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Brosnan and Craig. Moore died at the age of 89 in May after a brief battle with cancer.

Whoa! Joey Lawrence and Mayim Bialik are in for a Blossom reboot. The “Girl” singer opened up about the possibility in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.
“We get asked to do that all the time, Mayim and I talk frequently,” Lawrence, 41, tells Us. “Mayim is interested in doing some type of reunion with the show and so am I, if we can find the right piece and the right way in for a reboot/reunion, we’re both open to it, there’s a lot of talk around it, so we’ll see!”
He adds: “We’ve talked about and it’s abut the public’s excitement continuing to grow and we’re trying to find the right way in. Then we’re down!”
Lawrence and The Big Bang Theory star, 41, played siblings on the beloved NBC sitcom, which ran for five seasons from 1990 to 1995. His character Joey was a typical high school jock who was best known for his catchphrase “Whoa!” and for wearing lots and lots of flannel shirts.
“I have some of the red flannels that I wore on the big photo shoots, some of the leather jackets from back in the day,” the Brotherly Love alum tells Us. “My mom keeps most of the things from back then, she has a ton of stuff.”
In April 2013, Lawrence told Us that his mom actually came up with the plaid shirt and ripped jeans style. “She gave that idea to the costumer, who loved it,” he exclusively told Us in his 25 Things You Don’t Know About Me feature. “And that became my look.”
Blossom also starred Jenna von Oy (Six LeMeure) and Michael Stoyanov (Anthony Russo). The foursome reunited to shoot promos for the TV series for its Hub Network syndication in June 2014.

Time to meet the Lindsays! On the Monday, July 24, episode of The Bachelorette, Rachel took the three remaining men to meet her nearest and dearest. Rachel insisted that she was falling in love with all three of the guys, even though Peter had told her he wasn’t sure that he would propose at the end of the journey. Speaking of Peter – he was up first.
Peter Tells Rachel’s Mom He Might Not Be Ready to Propose
Right before walking into Rachel’s parents’ house, Peter pulled her to the side to tell her how he felt. After explaining that he wasn’t sure their last conversation went the way he’d hoped (when he told her he didn’t know if he would be ready for marriage soon), he explained that he wanted to make sure she knew how he really felt. “I am falling in love with you,” he said. Rachel beamed. “I’m so happy to hear you say that,” she replied. “And I’m falling in love with you too.”
They headed inside to meet her family, including her mother, her sister, her sister’s husband, and their son (who basically stole the show). Rachel’s dad was “unable” to meet Peter – and was actually “unable” to meet any of the men — a detail that was not explained further and glossed over as quickly as possible.
Rachel caught up with her sister, who made it clear she was worried about Rachel getting hurt. Peter, meanwhile, had a heart-to-heart with Rachel’s mom. “I don’t necessarily know that in two weeks that I could feel that certainty,” he said. Peter then went on to explain that he wasn’t going to ask her for her blessing to marry Rachel today. Rachel’s mom said she respected Peter’s honesty – and Rachel seemed very smitten with Peter as she walked him to the car at the end of the visit.
Eric Asks Rachel’s Mom for Her Blessing to Propose
Eric dove right in with Rachel’s family. “I’ve never been in love,” Eric admitted to Rachel’s sister, who looked a little taken aback. He then tried to do damage control by insisting that he wanted kids. He promised to be someone who would “provide, protect, and take care of everything.” By the end of their chat, Rachel’s sis was convinced that Eric was, if nothing else, honest.
Talking with Rachel’s mom, Eric was the polar opposite of Peter, asking her for her permission to propose. “Mrs. Lindsay, I want to ask you if I have your permission to propose to your daughter and take her hand in marriage,” he said. Rachel’s mom said yes… without really saying yes.
Bryan Gets Grilled by Rachel’s Family
Unlike the other two guys, Bryan had a chance to meet a few of Rachel’s friends. To say her friends were Bryan’s fans would be the understatement of the century. Impressed with his professional achievements and confidence, they swooned as much as Rachel did when he announced that he loved her. Things took a turn, however, when Bryan met her family.
“I have a tremendous amount of love for the woman next to me,” Bryan gushed. Rachel’s mom jumped in to say she was skeptical of Bryan throwing around the word “love” and wasn’t thrilled about how close he was with his own mother.
At dinner, Bryan told the family that he’d felt like Rachel was his girlfriend after one week. “My gut is telling me that Bryan’s a charmer. He’s direct and he’s open, but I don’t think there’s a sincerity in it,” Rachel’s sister said. As the family continued to hound Bryan about the details of their relationship, he got openly rattled and finally asked to be excused from the table. Rachel told her family that she was “really low-key annoyed.”
Despite Rachel’s family giving him a hard time, Bryan asked her mom for his blessing. She replied by telling him that she trusted Rachel. To the camera, however, Mrs. Lindsay said it was “a little scary.”
Eric Gets the Fantasy Suite
Rachel was pumped to get to Spain, and made it clear that she was looking forward to alone time in the fantasy suite with each of the guys. She kicked off the trip with a helicopter ride with Eric, followed by a romantic seaside stroll. Later, over dinner, Rachel grilled Eric to tell her how he felt about her. “You embody everything I would want in a wife,” he said. “We get better with time and it just allows me to fall right in. Nothing else matters and I’ve never felt that before and so I’m just here to say that I’m in love with you.” That was music to Rachel’s ears. She then invited him to the fantasy suite, where they spent the night.
Rachel Breaks Down in Tears on Her Date with Peter
Next came Peter. Rachel decided enough was enough and asked him about his fear of proposing. “I didn’t come this far and put my life on hold… to do this to just have a boyfriend at the end of it,” she said. “That’s not what I want.” She added that to her a proposal didn’t have to mean that they were getting married immediately, but he didn’t seem too swayed. “My belief in engagement is that engagement is marriage.” He added that he only wanted to do it “once” and that he wanted to be “truly certain” that this was the person he wanted to spend his life with.
“I don’t think of it the same way that you do, but… it is extremely important to me and I only want to do it once too,” Rachel added. “If we really want this and we want each other, then somebody’s got to bend.” Peter basically said he didn’t think they were going to find common ground on this one. That’s when she started crying. “I was hopeful for what Peter and I could be and then just like that, I couldn’t see it.” To the camera, she called what Peter said to her “devastating.”
Tell Us: Do you think Rachel and Peter are over?

Baby on board? Kailyn Lowry's friend let it slip that the reality TV star might be expecting another baby on the Monday, July 24, episode of Teen Mom 2. But the real mystery is — who is the daddy? Briana DeJesus also found out her boyfriend has been cheating on her and wants to give up her baby for adoption. Grab some popcorn and check out the five craziest moments from the latest episode of the MTV reality show.
Briana Considers Adoption
Briana found out Luis was cheating on her, and her heart totally broke. The mom-to-be confronted him about the future with their baby, and he half-heartedly apologized but she didn’t fall for it.
“I can’t be with you,” Briana said. “I don’t want to feel obligated to do anything because of this baby.”
She also admitted that she was considering giving the baby up for adoption because she refuses to have her second child brought up the same as her first (without a father in her life), but Luis said that’s off the table.
“I refuse to have this baby brought up how Nova was. It could kill me,” Briana responded. Luis needs to stop being selfish and grow up.
Leah Feels Unloved
After Leah Calvert gets done with a long day at school, all she wants to do is spend time with her babies. However, all they want to do is hang out with their dads and not listen to their mom.
“Blah, blah, blah,” her daughter Aleeah Grace said while her mom was talking.
“That’s not being nice to me. I care about you and I want to hear about what you do, and you should do the same for Mommy,” Leah desperately responded. It seems like Leah has three daddy’s girls, and she doesn’t know how to handle it as a single mom.
Chelsea Is in Baby Heaven
Chelsea Houska delivered her new baby, Watson, last week and she couldn’t be happier.
“I needed a baby so bad. I just wanted one so bad,” she said.
She and her husband, Cole DeBoer, spend all day admiring Watson and acting so in love. However, her daughter Aubrey seemed a little jealous of the new baby and threw a temper tantrum, which led to a spat between Cole and Chelsea. It didn’t seem like anything significant, though, because they are over the moon about the new addition to the family.
“Not getting any sleep is worth it to me,” Cole said. What a good dad!
Jenelle Gets What She Wanted
Jenelle Evans doesn’t trust her ex, Nathan Griffith, to be alone with their son, Kaiser. He is allegedly having problems handling his alcohol and got arrested again. She went to mediation with him again this week to change their custody agreement so he only sees their son every other weekend, and he must be supervised by his parents when he’s with Kaiser.
“Brat got everything she wants, like always,” Nathan said after the agreement was approved. He also added that he “hit the rocks” and said sometimes he gets scared when he can’t take care of himself. At least he admitted it!
Kailyn Might Be Pregnant
Kailyn was on-edge for the entire episode. She kept getting annoyed at everything her ex-husband, Javi Marroquin, was doing and seemed to hate the world. She also revealed that she and the guy she was dating (who didn’t want to be on the show) broke up.
“I wish it could’ve worked out, but it just didn’t,” Kailyn said, admitting she felt like she was living a “double life” while dating him.
At the end of the episode, she was Facetiming a friend and complaining about how exhausted she was. Her friend, not knowing the cameras were rolling, joked that Kailyn was “so pregnant.”
“I’m filming,” Kailyn awkwardly whispered. Can someone say bombshell?
Teen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s latest stunt has gone viral. The actor’s mini-movie for Apple’s digital assistant, Siri, has been viewed more than 3 million times since being uploaded to YouTube on Sunday, July 23.
In the 4-minute clip, the 45-year-old actor — whose HBO hit Ballers premiered season 3 on Sunday night — enlists the help of Siri to tackle his never-ending schedule and conquer one of his busiest days. 
Teamed w/ @Apple to make the biggest, coolest, sexiest, funnest (is that a word?) movie ever. Drops TOMORROW!#ROCKxSIRI #DominateYourDay✊🏾 pic.twitter.com/STwlCPsVUh
In the short clip, titled The Rock x Siri Dominate the Day, Johnson defies time and flies to Rome to help touch up the Sistine Chapel, jets off to space to take a selfie and even makes it back to set in time to film an action scene -- all thanks to Siri’s help.
One of the funniest parts of the clip? Johnson’s iPhone wallpaper is his viral 1994 photo in which he sports a fanny pack, black turtleneck and gold chain.
“Teamed w/ @Apple to make the biggest, coolest, sexiest, funnest (is that a word?) movie ever,” The Rock tweeted on Sunday. “Drops TOMORROW!#ROCKxSIRI #DominateYourDay✊🏾.”

You name it, he’s tried it. From roasted rabbit to fresh raccoon, Travel Channel’s Bizarre Foods host Andrew Zimmern has eaten just about everything under the sun. He stopped by Us Weekly’s New York City headquarters to give us a sneak peak of this season, but we couldn’t let him get away without trying some bizarre food trends! Us Weekly Video host Christina Garibaldi challenges Zimmern to try some store-bought bizarre foods such as black truffle potato chips and aloe water. To see how he rates these snacks and more, watch the video above!
The new season of Bizarre Foods premieres Tuesday, July 25th and follows Zimmern as he explores the Cowboy Trail, starting in San Antonio, Texas. He celebrates America’s oldest cuisine as he travels back in time to rediscover foods of the earliest settlers. When searching for new foods to try this season, Zimmern explained to Us, “We recreate journeys as the season goes on in search of both bizarre food but also that little piece of American history that most people don’t know about. If you get off the road and you go to the one less traveled, you discover a piece of America that some people think has died, but in fact hasn’t.” 
For travelers who want to experiment with new foods, Zimmern advises, “Ask questions. Don’t ask the concierge, ask the guy who parks the car. Go on a couple of culinary sites. Find out who the four or five best food culinarians and food writers are in that town. Then hit their timeline, on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook, see where they’re eating. Write down the top five for each one, then cross pollinate, and you’ll probably have a really good idea.”
In the first episode of the new season, Zimmern goes all out and tries cow’s head, bacon-wrapped quail and a “Son of a Bitch Stew,” which includes calf heart, tongue, stomach, liver and marrow gut. How were they? You’ll have to tune in to find out.
For even more with Andrew Zimmern, check out the video below where he reveals the worst thing he’s ever eaten and what he craves when he gets back home. 
Bizarre Foods With Andrew Zimmern airs on Travel Channel Tuesdays at 9 P.M. ET.

Following fan backlash over the use of CGI in Phelps vs Shark: Great Gold vs Great White, Discovery Channel is standing behind its program. The network insisted that the Shark Week kickoff on Sunday, July 23, featuring Michael Phelps was about creating a fun program, and that it was clear the athlete would not be swimming alongside sharks in the competition.
"In Phelps vs Shark we enlisted world-class scientists to take up the challenge of making the world's greatest swimmer competitive with a Great White,” Discovery says in a statement to Us Weekly. "The show took smart science and technology to make the challenge more accessible and fun. All the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn't a side by side race.”
The network added: "During Michael’s pre-show promotion, as well as within the first two minutes of Phelps vs Shark, this message was clear and we are thrilled with the audience and the engagement around the world. “
After extensive promotion for the show, fans were disappointed to see Phelps swimming against a virtual version of a shark. The athlete beat a reef shark in a 50-meter match, but lost to the great white shark by two seconds.
My face when I realized they weren't going to put Michael Phelps in one lane and a shark in the other. #SharkWeek #PhelpsVsShark pic.twitter.com/ffFx32k1Nm
Turns out “Michael Phelps races a shark” was really just “Michael Phelps swims alone and then compares his time to a shark’s time.”
The Olympic athlete opened up about preparing for the experience on Good Morning America on July 20. "This has been something I've wanted to do my whole life,” he said at the time, admitting that he wasn’t in the water at the exact same time as the sharks. "This has been on my bucket list a long time and you know, being able to see these animals up close and personal in their own environment is something that was just such a treat.”
“They didn't look that big underwater,” Phelps added of the sharks. “I guess now seeing the video, they were pretty massive sharks. I had one, like I was saying, literally come right up to my nose, and it was crazy.”

Now that’s true love! In an exclusive clip from the Monday, July 24, episode of Counting On that TLC is sharing first with Us Weekly, things got hairy between Ben Seewald and Jessa Duggar.
Host Daphne Oz had the couples play a guessing game during the after show part II, in which the Duggar ladies write down the most selfless thing their husbands do for them and they try to match their spouses’ answers.
Jinger’s husband, Jeremy Vuolo, responded: “Put down the toilet seat.” The 23-year-old TLC star tied the knot with her husband in November 2016 in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. They met in 2015 through Jessa’s husband, Ben, who featured the soccer player in their YouTube videos.
Joy-Anna Duggar and Austin Forsyth recently got hitched on May 26 after six months of courting, making them the newest couple of the three by far. Her husband guessed “open car door.” 
Jessa, who married Seewald in November 2014, wrote “Back massages” … but her husband revealed he shows his selflessness by “cleaning hair out of drains.” He even added a grossed-out emoji face to his whiteboard.
“And you’ve got a lot of hair, girl!” the host quipped to Jessa. Tune in tonight to Counting On on TLC on Mondays at 9 p.m. to see which married couple came out on top.

Ready to get the crew back together! Jennie Garth revealed to Us Weekly that she would be open to reprising her role as Kelly Taylor in a Beverly Hills, 90210 reboot. 
“We’ve talked about it and played with some ideas,” she told Us. “I don’t know where the project is now. I don’t know if it’s going to move forward, but I would be a part of it. I would be a part of it if it came up.”
She also told the Today show on Monday, July 24, that “there is always a chance” of a reunion. “Everybody wants to see that now,” she said. “I love reunions, so I wouldn’t be opposed to that."
Garth revealed to Us that she hopes to team up with her close friend and former costar Tori Spelling for a scripted sitcom. "She and I talk about teaming back up and doing something else because we really love working together,” she said. "We really want to do a comedy about ourselves, not autobiographical or anything but definitely our individual sensibilities. When we get together, we're just silly and funny.”
TheSiriusXM radio host also predicted where her 90210 character would be today. “She probably has, like, eight kids, lives in a trailer park. Let’s go with that,” she joked. Garth added that Kelly’s love interest Dylan (played by Luke Perry) "has a big, fat belly and he’s bald. I don’t know why, I just have a real strong vision of that.”
Spelling’s character, Donna Martin, would have a successful fashion career on the East Coast. Garth said, “Donna is like Diane von Furstenberg in New York with her own fashion line.” Meanwhile, Brenda Walsh (Shannen Doherty) is saving the planet. “Brenda is definitely saving the dolphins in China right now,” Garth said.

The moment we've all been waiting for! Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen finally come face-to-face after all these years in a teaser for the Sunday, July 30, episode of Game of Thrones, titled "The Queen's Justice."
Though the former Lord Commander of the Night's Watch (Kit Harington) and the Mother of Dragons (Emilia Clarke) are arguably two of the most popular characters, they have not crossed paths in the seven seasons that the HBO fantasy drama has been on the air. That is, until now.
The jaw-dropping moment is only teased for a split second in the trailer, yet it still managed to send viewers into a frenzy on social media. "I think the Jon Snow/Daenerys Targaryen meet up could possibly be the most anticipated TV moment in history. Lol," one Twitter user wrote. Another added, "Jon Snow meets Daenerys next week and I'm just trying to figure out wtf I'm going to do for 6 days."
Season 7 of Game of Thrones has already brought together several characters. On the Sunday, July 23, episode "Stormborn," Daenerys and Melisandre (Carice van Houten) came together for the first time.
Liam Cunningham, who plays Davos Seaworth on the series, previously teased Jon and Daenerys' meeting during an interview ahead of the season premiere. "I will say specifically the fire and ice thing with Jon and Dany and all of that business ... people have seen the lady arriving with all of her entourage. She's hitting Westeros. Jon is in Westeros," he told The Hollywood Reporter. "There's an inevitability about this that nobody's fighting. People are coming together."
Game of Thrones airs on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Ready for another round. Brie and Nikki Bella struggle to balance their personal and professional lives in Total Bellas season 2, which will premiere on Wednesday, September 6, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal. 
In an exclusive sneak peek, the sisters tackle different aspects of their lives. “It’s all about being a superstar,” Nikki, 33, says of being a Bella in a voiceover, as footage plays of her walking through the ring holding a championship belt, a stark contrast to the montage of Brie, which shows her preparing her baby’s nursery and getting a sonogram as her voiceover explains: “It’s all about being a mom."
The preview clip also shows the men in their lives adapting to both work and family. Although no context is given, John Cena says to a solemn-looking Daniel Bryan, "You may miss the birth of your child.”
The E! series’ new season debuts with an inside look at Nikki and John’s return to WWE and their road to Wrestlemania, where, as seen in the clip above, Cena shocked his love of nearly five years with a marriage proposal in the ring. As the couple is thriving professionally, Brie and Daniel look for extra support as they prepare for the birth of their daughter, Birdie.
Through the pregnancy and proposal, the sisters also struggle through new personal challenges as Cena and Bryan’s careers skyrocket to new heights.
The newly engaged couple opened up to Us Weekly exclusively in May about taking time to enjoy engagement before they began wedding planning. “[It’s] slow. I don’t really know anything yet,” Nikki admitted. “I have a wedding planner. That’s about it. That’s my first step.”
Cena added: “The first step is the toughest one. Trust me. The first step is the toughest one.”
Later this fall, the sisters will return to Total Divas for season 7 alongside WWE Superstars Carmella, Nia Jax and Alexa Bliss. Current cast members Natalya (Nattie), Maryse, Lana and Naomi (Trinity) will also be returning. 
Watch the exclusive preview in the clip above.
Total Bellas' second season premieres on E! Wednesday, September 6, at 9 p.m. ET.

Bye, bye, Mr. Big? Chris Noth recently opened up about his famous Sex and the City character — and hinted that there’s no need to reprise the role anytime soon.
"I feel like we told that story," Noth, 62, exclusively told Us Weekly at the premiere of Manhunt: Unabomber in NYC on Monday, July 17. “I don’t think there’s anything left for me to say about that. I want to tell other stories.”
Noth played Carrie Bradshaw’s (Sarah Jessica Parker) love interest on the HBO hit, which ran for six seasons from 1998 to 2004. Fans are still obsessed with Big (real name: John Preston!), but Noth doesn’t mind.
“I accept it. I may not understand it but I accept it. I think they just love the fashion,” the Good Wife alum added to Us. “The thing that I don’t understand is the idea of Mr. Big because – he wasn’t the guy that got away. They were always dance partners. Sometimes they went away for a little while and she had a bunch of other guys and he got married.”
Despite their ups and downs, Mr. Big and Carrie eventually tied the knot. (Following a flower bouquet showdown outside the New York Public Library, of course.)
Through the years, Noth had one request for his character. “Humor, man! Don’t make me into this suave guy! Don’t make me into a Trumpesque millionaire,” he joked. “Humor!”

Take two! The cast of This Is Us is officially back on set, which means more tears are on the way. Milo Ventimiglia opened up about playing Jack Pearson — and filming the character’s death — ahead of the new episodes.
“I’ve known about how Jack’s passing happens and when and why and all of that,” the Heroes alum, 40, exclusively tells Us Weekly.
“For me, there is no preparation other than learning the lines and being open to the experience that you’ve going to have when you get on set,” he adds.  “Thankfully, [creator] Dan Fogelman and all of our writers are all so crazy talented that it really is as easy as just learning the lines. The words kind of speak for themselves.”
Earlier this month, Ventimiglia scored his first-ever Emmy nomination in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series category for his work on This Is Us. He may be best known for playing bad boy Jess Mariano on Gilmore Girls, but the California native says he relates most to the Pearson patriarch.
Totally stole @sterlingkb1's pic because we're BACK in business, guys. Day 1 of Season 2. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 💗 this crew! #thisisus
A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Jul 11, 2017 at 2:46pm PDT
“People closest to to me tells me that that character may be the closest to who I am and I don’t think that’s untrue. Jack tries to be a good man, I try to be a good man. Jack tries to inspire, I try to inspire. Jack is fiercely protective, I’m fiercely protective. The line between character and person, the line between Jack and Milo is blurry,” he says. “It’s not a good line, but at the same time he’s a character, he’s imaginary, so it’s just my job to bring him to life. He’s a very fun man to play, I enjoy it. I like that he does good, he tries to do good. I try to do the same thing!”
Indeed, Ventimiglia takes time to give back offscreen, too. The actor recently teamed with Allergan for #EyePic, a new social media campaign to fight against preventable vision loss in the U.S. “A lot of us don’t really think about that and we take it for granted a lot of the time,” he tells Us. “For me, I wanted to make sure that I was promoting something that was good. I was doing something that was giving back. You have to get your eyes checked. There are some pretty serious things that we can’t diagnosis ourselves so just reminding people that this is a good thing to do and partnering with Allergan on it was the right thing to do.”
For more with Ventimiglia, read the rest of his Q&A below:
US: Did you audition with Mandy Moore?
MV: Mandy and I did test together and it was undeniable how great she was and I think how real the characters of Jack and Rebecca were to the two of us. The process was just like any other audition. You go in, you have a meeting and then you have a reading and then you get the job. I know that sounds simple, but that’s the job of Hollywood. It’s a little more stressful I think to the majority of people, but after doing this for 22 years I’ve accepted the fact that I’m not going to get everything I want. Especially jobs and characters that I want to play.
You go in optimistic but you also have to go in a bit realistic and know that there is a possibility that they might not pick you. And at that point they don’t pick you, you have to be OK with it.
US: Is there a storyline you want for Jack?
MV: We’ve only known these characters for 18 hours. We haven’t known them for very long. We’ve seen Jack and Rebecca in several decades of existence but beyond that there is still so much to learn about this entire family and its extensions. Randall [Sterling K. Brown] married Beth [Susan Kelechi Watson] and Toby [Chris Sullivan] is with Kate [Chrissy Metz]. There are so many things to learn and discover about these families still.
US: What was your reaction when the series got an impressive two-season pickup?
MV: To be really honest, I was excited for the audience. I’ve done shows where people tell me, ‘Aw man, what happened to that show?’ And I’ll tell them, ‘Sorry, nobody wants it.’ And they’ll say, ‘But I want it and watched it.’ So for NBC to say that they are renewing This Is Us for two more seasons — I thought that was an amazing vote of confidence that audiences can invest themselves in the show. They can actually say, ‘You know what, these characters are going to be around for a while so I’m going to go ahead and really get into this show.’”
This Is Us’ season 2 premieres on Tuesday, September 26, on NBC at 9 p.m. ET.

Justice for Barb! Stranger Things favorite Shannon Purser opened up about her surprising Emmy nomination while attending San Diego Comic-Con on Saturday, July 22.
“I mean it's totally unimaginable,” Purser, 20, exclusively told Us Weekly at the star-studded weekend event. “I think about 12-year-old me who wanted to be an actress and then being nominated for an Emmy — I never would have dreamed of it. It's amazing.” (The series scored 18 nominations in total, including Outstanding Drama Series.)
When asked when she feels the most confident, she added: “Probably when I finish a take and the director says it was great.”
Purser’s nod in the Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series category came as a shock to many. However, Barb’s Upside Down unresolved storyline made her a standout with fans wanting more.
So much so, that Barb (with those retro glasses and mom jeans!) became a Halloween costume go-to and a shrine for her was built at Comic-Con — with her real baby pictures.
Even more, the Riverdale actress got a massive applause when she made a surprise appearance at the cast’s panel on Saturday, just before the season 2 trailer dropped.
“Is Barb going to be in season two?” she asked creators Matt and Ross Duffer from the crowd. The answer was no, but it was confirmed that Barb would finally get justice in the upcoming episodes.
Stranger Things’ season 2 debuts on Netflix on October 27. Watch the sneak peek in the video above!

After teasing fans with an impending, violent clash between Euron and Yara Greyjoy in its season premiere, Game of Thrones didn't waste any time getting around to the bloodshed. Instead, HBO's fantasy drama delivered the goods in the very next installment, as Euron crashed Yara's pleasure cruise in the final minutes of "Stormborn." Here's everything that happened in the Sunday, July 23, episode.
Daenerys Makes Some Friends
On a dark and stormy night at Dragonstone, Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) received a surprise visit from a new friend: Melisandre (Carice van Houten). We always knew that Dany and Mel would team up eventually — after all, they both love to play with fire and prefer to work in the nude — but Melisandre's real purpose was to suggest that Daenerys form a useful alliance with Jon Snow (Kit Harington). Luckily, Jon and Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) had a friendly relationship for starters — but for finishers, Jon received the message this week that Dragonstone sits on a giant mine full of dragonglass, making it a no-brainer to pay Dany a visit at her new home. When we last saw Jon, he had just departed Winterfell, leaving Sansa (Sophie Turner) in charge … and being surreptitiously ogled by Littlefinger, but what else is new. 
Jorah's Going Grey
Meanwhile, Maester Marwyn (Jim Broadbent) gave Jorah (Iain Glen) some bad news followed by some worse news: Jorah had just six months before his raging case of greyscale drives him mad, and just one day until they expel him from the Citadel. But Sam (John Bradley-West), who uncovered a dangerous experimental treatment for greyscale amid his research into dragonglass, wasn't ready to give up Jorah for dead just yet … that is, if Jorah could kindly keep from screaming while Sam basically flayed him alive. Fun fact: folks afflicted with dragonscale develop a sort of oozy cream filling underneath the infection. Other fun fact: We are never, ever eating again.
... And So's Missandei
After several seasons' worth of intense (and problematic, considering certain anatomical back stories) sexual tension between Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson) and Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel), the two finally consummated their relationship on the eve of Grey Worm's departure to attack Casterly Rock. That's great news for them, but for those who were hoping this scene would provide a visual answer to that "the pillar or the stones?" question from several seasons ago, alas, you'll have to continue to use your imagination. 
A Blast From the Past
Game of Thrones never misses a chance to bring back fan-favorite Hot Pie (Ben Hawkey); cue his appearance in this episode, where he gave Arya (Maisie Williams) the news that Jon Snow had defeated the Boltons and retaken Winterfell. And if there was one thing that could tempt Arya to abandon her assassin's trip to King's Landing, it was the possibility of a family reunion. On the road to Winterfell, she encountered a second face from her past: Nymeria, the direwolf she sent away back in season 1. Nymeria declined to accompany Arya home to Winterfell — she's got a good gig going now as the leader of her own wolfpack — but unlike most of her siblings, at least she's still alive. 
A Battle on the Narrow Sea
Finally, Daenerys' first move in the direction of King's Landing ended up being extremely un-smooth sailing from the get-go, as Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asbæk) intercepted Yara (Gemma Whelan) en route to collect the Dornish army for a siege on King's Landing — and by "intercepted," we mean "rained down hell on Yara's ship like the love child of Captain Jack Sparrow and Hannibal Lecter." Ellaria Sand (Indira Varma) and Tyene (Rosabelle Laurenti Sellers) were taken hostage amid the bloody battle, while Obara (Keisha Castle-Hughes) and Nymeria Sand (Jessica Henwick) were murdered by Euron with their own weapons. 
And Yara? We last saw her with her uncle's knife at her throat, both of them watching as Theon (Alfie Allen) took a cowardly leap overboard rather than stay and fight. All told, Daenerys' clever strategy to take the throne without bloodshed appeared to be over before it began — and Olenna Tyrell's (Donna Rigg) advice that Dany embrace her violent lineage and "be a dragon" is probably sounding pretty good right now.
Game of Thrones airs on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Hot diggity dog! We’re in the dog days of summer and what better way to celebrate than with Us Weekly’s top 10 best dog movies ever! Whether you’re in the mood for Lady and the Tramp, an animated tale of two dogs who fall helplessly in love over a plate of spaghetti, or you want tearjerker Marly & Me, which will make you head straight to the animal shelter to adopt, Us has you covered. 
Watch the trailers below!
Lady and the Tramp (1955)
This may be the oldest film on our list, but it’s by far the most classic of all the animated dog flicks. The trailer explains, “It’s his [Walt Disney’s] happiest motion picture. It’s a story about dogs …To anyone who’s ever owned a dog, loved a dog, or just wanted a dog, this picture is yours — heart and soul.” With stars in their eyes, viewers see Lady meet Tramp, and then follow them on their journey through love.
Turner & Hooch (1989)
Tom Hanks plays Det. Scott Turner, who adopts a dog named Hooch from a murderer he is investigating. According to IMDB, the dog playing Hooch was so strong, that Hanks had to do several takes when walking him, since he would often lose the dog’s leash.
Beethoven (1992) 
“Roll over, Beethoven!” He may knock over entire dinner tables of food, jump in the family pool and cause destruction wherever he goes, but how could anyone not love this 185-pound St. Bernard? This film was so loved it went on to spawn a multitude of  spin-offs.
Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)
Get out the tissue box for this heartwarming journey of two talking dogs and a cat who set out to find their family. They find themselves in all sorts of adventures — from  getting past waterfalls to hiking over mountains.
Lassie (1994) 
Lassie follows the journey of a dog as she overcomes great obstacles — including riding on the top of a wagon and swimming through treacherous waters to get back to the ones she loves the most. The movie is an updated version of the 1954 classic TV series. As the trailer says, this heartwarming family film is “one of the greatest stories of loyalty and love ever told.” 
101 Dalmatians (1996)  
One of our favorite Disney animations came to life in this live-action motion movie starring Glenn Close as villain Cruella De Vil. According to Mirror, 230 dalmatian puppies and 20 adult dalmatians all played a part at some point during the film.
Air Bud (1997)
A golden retriever who plays basketball. Need we say more? Spoiler alert: The dog helps his best friend win the high school's championship and becomes the town hero. Fun fact: The dog who plays Buddy also played Comet on Full House.
Best in Show (2000) 
It’s a dog-eat-dog world out there when it comes to competition dog shows. This mockumentary comedy parodies an elite dog show and follows dog owners’ hilarious interactions with their pets and other handlers. Fun fact: The majority of the film was improvised, and was only based off a 16-page-outline, according to TCM Film Festival.
My Dog Skip (2000) 
“One boy’s champion and everyone’s hero,” says the trailer of this family film starring Frankie Muniz, Diane Lane, Kevin Bacon and Luke Wilson. Based on a true story, the movie follows a young boy who finds friendship, courage and love through his best friend, a terrier named Skip.
Marley & Me (2008)
According to Animal Radio, 22 dogs played the four-legged star of the film. O Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson play a married couple who adopt a puppy to see if they’re ready to be parents in this dreamed.

To become someone in Hollywood, you often have to lose yourself first. It’s a truth Matt Bomer uncovered playing The Last Tycoon’s Monroe Stahr, a wunderkind studio executive who ditches his past (and his name) as he strives for power.
“One of my favorite scenes is when he calls his mother and we get a glimpse of who he left behind,” the actor, 39, tells Us Weekly of the Amazon drama. “She asks if his girlfriend calls him Milton and he says, ’No, she calls me Monroe like everyone else.’ You just feel the distance and pain.”
Emotions aside, Monroe suffers physically, too. Diagnosed with a heart condition, “he has a ticking clock on his life,” Bomer adds. “He feels he has to put his stamp on the world and achieve immortality in the limited time he has. Those kind of stakes are always interesting to me as an actor.”
Though the series — based on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s unfinished manuscript of the same name — is set in the 1930s, Bomer insists it still resonates today. “Hollywood really hasn’t changed,” says the dad of three (with husband Simon Halls, 53). “This not only tells an interesting story, it comments on a lot going on now.”’
The Last Tycoon, also starring Lily Collins and Kelsey Grammer, begins streaming on Amazon Friday, July 28.

A check on the bucket list. Michael Phelps opened up about racing one of the world’s top predators — a great white shark — in an interview with Good Morning America on Thursday, July 20.
Phelps, who retired from competitive swimming following the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, partnered with the Discovery Channel for the 100-meter race, which took place in Cape Town, South Africa, in June and is set to air on Sunday as part of the network’s annual Shark Week.
"This has been something I've wanted to do my whole life," the 23-time Olympic Gold Medalist explained to GMA. "This has been on my bucket list a long time and you know, being able to see these animals up close and personal in their own environment is something that was just such a treat."
Phelps admitted that he was not in the water at the exact time as the shark for the race, but the athlete did dive down to see his competition. 
“They didn't look that big underwater,” Phelps said of the sharks, which can swim 25 miles per hour. “I guess now seeing the video, they were pretty massive sharks. I had one, like I was saying, literally come right up to my nose, and it was crazy.”
Phelps went on to say of the race’s safety precautions: “I was safe. I had 12 to 14 divers underneath me when we were doing the race. When you have an animal this size, you want to be able to see how fast they swim. It’s tough to go into their territory and be able to swim as fast as they do, right?”
The Olympian was equipped with a tail-like attachment called a monofin, which allowed Phelps to move through the water like a shark.
The athlete went on to reveal what he called his biggest challenge — the cold open water. Phelps described the ocean as being “very different” than swimming in a pool as the water temperature was recorded at approximately 53 degrees. 
"For me, it was an experience I'll never forget. Being able to be on the bottom, basically, of the ocean floor and surrounded by a number of different species of sharks was one of the coolest things that I've probably ever done,” Phelps gushed of his experience. 
The outcome of the race will be revealed when Phelps vs. Shark: The Battle for Ocean Supremacy airs on Sunday, July 23, at 8 p.m. ET on The Discovery Channel.

Our three favorite witches aren’t getting back together. Holly Marie Combs crushed any hope that the Charmed cast will be participating in a reboot.
The 43-year-old actress, who played Piper Halliwell on the hit series for eight seasons from 1998 to 2006, took to Instagram to set the record straight about a revival, and shared a photo of her on-screen sisters Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan, who played Phoebe Halliwell and Paige Matthews respectively.  Shannen Doherty was one of the original witches, but her character, Prue Halliwell, was killed off in the season 3 finale.
“I’m sorry to say that all the reboot rumors are just that…. Rumors. But here’s #tbt to our wood nymph days,” she captioned the Thursday, July 20, post. "In our defense it was really hot so we wanted to wear the least amount of clothes possible. Really hot. That’s my story and still sticking to it. Still. #charmed.”
I'm sorry to say that all the reboot rumors are just that.... rumors. But here's #tbt to our wood nymph days. In our defense it was really hot so we wanted to wear the least amount of clothes possible. Really hot. That's my story and still sticking to it. Still. #charmed
A post shared by Holly Combs (@thehmc) on Jul 20, 2017 at 2:33pm PDT
The Pretty Little Liars actress also shared a 2013 pic of her with Charmed costar Brian Krause (Leo Wyatt) at Wizard World Comic Con in Philadelphia. “When they ask you about the Charmed reboot and the convo takes a super serious turn,” she wrote. "Look at BK thinking real hard and me buying him time for the perfectly phrased reply. Team work right thur I tell you. But we still wish them well. Cackle. Cackle. Cackle. #wizardworld.”
However, The CW confirmed in January that a Charmed reboot was in the works. The new series was supposed to be set in 1976, unlike the original witchy drama, which was set in the present. It’s unclear if the reboot is no longer happening or if Combs just isn’t a part of the updated show.
Combs told Us Weekly in April 2016 that she would love to participate in a reboot. “People keep talking about it,” she said. “I know all the girls would like to do it."

Another No. 1! LeAnn Rimes’ new single "LovE Is LovE Is LovE” from her Remnants album reached the top of the Billboard Dance Chart this week. This is her third No. 1 dance single, following up “Long Live Love."
The Grammy winner, 34, recently performed the equality anthem during her shows at New York City, Denver and Houston Pride Month events, and will add it to her setlist during her fall tour. “A Pride celebration is a living thing. It is breathing authenticity. It’s a space we hold for one another, a place to come into what our souls move us to be, it’s a place in love and only love,” Rimes told Just Jared in June. “That’s why the LGBTQ community continues to inspire me and enliven my spirit every time I perform for them."
Besides pumping up the crowd at her gigs, the hit is also featured in the film Logan Lucky, which stars Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig and opens nationwide on August 18. Rimes makes a cameo in the film, too!
Rimes recently appeared in Us Weekly’s Best Bodies issues, and opened up about how she stays fit while touring. “I do like my butt,” she told Us. “I did something on Instagram called Tight Tush Tuesday and everybody kind of freaked out about it, so it’s become a thing. I work pretty hard on my butt.” 
She also revealed that she works out with husband Eddie Cibrian on occasion, and they take SoulCycle classes, hike and go on walks. “He likes to be a boy when he works out and make noises and grunt and stuff. I’m like, ‘I can’t even deal with you right now,’” she joked. 
Rimes added that she’s been a good influence on the 44-year-old actor’s health and fitness regimen. “When I first met him, he was not the healthiest eater at all,” she said. “But I think I’ve gotten him over on my team."

Is Briana DeJesus giving her baby up for adoption? In an exclusive sneak peek of the upcoming episode of Teen Mom 2 that MTV is sharing first with Us Weekly, the reality personality breaks up with her boyfriend and baby daddy, Luis, after she finds out he’s cheated on her.
“You had sex with someone else,” DeJesus tells Luis in the emotional clip.
“I definitely f--ked up. I was stupid. It was childish. I can’t go back. If I could, I would. I want us to be together and to go on with the plans we’ve had,” Luis tells her. 
“Those plans we had went to s--t,” DeJesus tells her now ex. “I can’t be with you … I know what I want and this is not it … I don’t want to feel obligated to be with you because of this baby … I don’t want to be with you … that means we have to coparent and I don’t want to do that,” DeJesus firmly tells him before asking, “How do you feel about adoption?”
DeJesus welcomed her second child, a daughter named Stella Star, on July 2. The former Teen Mom 3 star, who joined Teem Mom 2 this season, is also the mom of daughter Nova, 5, who she welcomed during the fourth season of 16 and Pregnant. Nova’s father is DeJesus’ ex Devoin Austin.
The reality personality previously told Us that she was trying to work on things with Luis, whom she kept mum about until season 8 premiered.
“He’s still around and we’re figuring it out,” she told Us earlier this month.
Watch the emotional clip above and catch Teen Mom 2 on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

Fionn Whitehead had to step away. Following an hours-long shoot of the World War II film Dunkirk, in which he plays fresh-faced private Tommy, “I had to go have food with friends and have a laugh,” says the Brit. “I had to shake off the day. Otherwise, I would have been dragged down.” 
After all, the Christopher Nolan thriller retells the horrific 1940 battle in Dunkirk, France, where 400,000 Allied soldiers were trapped between the English Channel and the German army. “It was a very intense atmosphere,” he adds. “We shot in Dunkirk. The destruction was sobering."
The 20-year-old, who went through three months of auditions before landing the role, gets into action for Us.
Us Weekly: While training, was there ever a moment where you thought you couldn’t pull off a stunt?
Fionn Whitehead: You make yourself do the physical aspects for a Christopher Nolan film! There was no excuse not to get into shape. I was surrounded by five burly stunt guys constantly telling me I could do it and forcing me through these exercises. I was extremely scrawny when I auditioned. I jogged on the beach, I swam in the sea in battle gear, which weighs about eight pounds, and I carried stretchers with a 60-pound dummy on top. I thought it was amazing. 
Us: Did filming ever feel too real?
FW: There was not a lot of imagination needed because of the world Chris built and the incredible sets constructed. They did as much as possible to get as close to the real thing. But to say I’ve been through the same thing as those guys would be disrespectful. There was a food truck on set! 
Us: Why is it important for audiences to see this episode in history?
FW: This is an event that we should always look back on as a point of reference. It definitely shaped the war. The spirit of Dunkirk is something everyone grew up learning about. After Dunkirk, everyone came together and it set the tone in the U.K.
Dunkirk, which also stars Harry Styles, Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy is in theaters now.

Standing their ground. Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss responded to backlash over their next project, Confederate, after an uproar from social media.
HBO announced on Wednesday, July 19, that the series would envision an alternate world where the southern U.S. States succeeded and allowed slavery to continue into modern day. Benioff and Weiss are collaborating with longtime friends Malcolm Spellman and Nichelle Tramble Spellman, two acclaimed black producers, to create and write the show. Many critics felt it's insensitive to fantasize about slavery being legal again.
The four producers defended Confederate’s concept in an interview with Variety, which was published on Thursday, June 20. "It goes without saying slavery is the worst thing that ever happened in American history,” Weiss said. "It’s our original sin as a nation. And history doesn’t disappear. That sin is still with us in many ways. Confederate, in all of our minds, will be an alternative history show. It’s a science-fiction show. One of the strengths of science fiction is that it can show us how this history is still with us in a way no strictly realistic drama ever could, whether it were a historical drama or a contemporary drama."
Malcom added that Weiss and Benioff “knew they needed black voices” on the series. "For me and Nichelle, it’s deeply personal because we are the offspring of this history. We deal with it directly, and have for our entire lives. We deal with it in Hollywood, we deal with it in the real world when we’re dealing with friends and family members,” he told Variety. "And I think Nichelle and I both felt a sense of urgency in trying to find a way to support a discussion that is percolating but isn’t happening enough.”
Benioff emphasized that they haven’t even started writing the show yet. "We don’t have an outline yet. We don’t even have character names. So everything is brand new and nothing’s been written,” he said. "I guess that’s what was a little bit surprising about some of the outrage. It’s just a little premature. You know, we might f--k it up. But we haven’t yet."
Nichelle agreed that people should wait and see what happens before making a snap judgment. "I do understand their concern,” she shared. "I wish their concern had been reserved to the night of the premiere, on HBO, on a Sunday night, when they watched and then they made a decision after they watched an hour of television as to whether or not we succeeded in what we set out to do."
Benioff also explained more about the group’s vision for the show, which is set after the third Civil War. “The idea that we’ve talked about for a while is that if the first Civil War happened at the same time as the Civil War in our time happened, it just seemed unlikely to us that these two countries, these two hostile countries that share a massive border, would not have fought again in the time between the 1860s and the present day,” he explained. "So in our mind, there was also 20th-century civil war.”
Malcom insisted that they are all sensitive to concerns about disturbing imagery. "This is not a world in which the entire country is enslaved. Slavery is in one half of the country. And the North is the North. As Nichelle was saying, the imagery should be no whips and no plantations,” he said. "I think people have got to stop pretending that slavery was something that happened and went away. The s--t is affecting people in the present day. And it’s easy for folks to hide from it, because sometimes you’re not able to map it out, especially with how insidious racism has become."
For now, Weiss and Benioff are still focusing on GoT. The HBO hit just kicked off its penultimate season 7. The final season will be just six episodes and will likely air next year.

With one week until decision day, the Married at First Sight couples were all trying to figure out if their marriages would last for the long haul. While some seemed to be sailing toward staying together, others were really struggling. No one said marriage was going to be easy, but when you marry someone you don’t know, it’s that much harder …  apparently.
Anthony and Ashley Settle Into Married Life
Ashley was getting frustrated that Anthony was dragging his feet about filling out the application for their new apartment (that happened to be in Ashley’s sister’s building, just FYI). “You weren’t going to do it and then you got mad at me for asking you to do it,” she argued. “Just do it!” she added to the camera.
They apologized for snapping at each other and ordered dinner. Still, Anthony was concerned about their general communication style. “That scares me the most because we have to make our final decision in a week,” he said.
They headed on a getaway to a cabin. Anthony set up a romantic evening in a tent out back with wine and chocolate, which Ashley clearly appreciated. It had not escaped her, however, that Anthony had yet to say “I love you.”
There was definitely still tension between them, however, about their upcoming move to Ashley’s sister’s building. When Ashley mentioned that her sister was looking forward to dropping in and borrowing clothes, Anthony visibly bristled. Over what was supposed to be a romantic dinner, Anthony reasoned that the main reason they were only moving into that building was because they were running out of time to make a decision. Before the fight got too big, though, Anthony decided just to drop it  -- in other words, he’s mastering the art of marriage.
Nate and Sheila Might Be Done for Real
Things with Nate and Sheila picked up where they had left off, with Sheila completely freaking out on Nate. “I am done!” she shouted. “Be done with me because I am done with you! I don’t want to be with someone like you, period! Now I am going to end the marriage.”
To the camera, Sheila said their marriage was “a complete and utter failure.” For his part, Nate just looked exhausted as he confessed that he thought it was “the end” of his marriage.
In an attempt to right their course, Pastor Calvin Roberson led them through a discussion about what had happened between them. Sheila insisted that Nate had irreparably betrayed her trust, but the pastor said that wasn’t true. “You don’t believe that,” he said, urging her to reconsider her position. She responded by walking out.
Nate and Sheila Kiss and Make Up – Again
Later, Nate called   Sheila and convinced her to return. He apologized (again) and gave her a   peace offering of a plant that represented their love. “If you’ll have   me, I want to be with you forever,” she said. Nate then told her, “I   love you” and she asked him to kiss her already.
They were both   determined not to fall back into old habits as decision day approached.   Nate then apologized to his younger brother for creating so much  tension  in the house and reaffirmed his commitment to being a good  example for  the young man.
Later, talking about how they could  improve their  marriage, Nate suggested that Sheila learn how to control  herself during  arguments. She didn’t like that so much. Instead, she  suggested that he  learn how to give her some space.
Cody and Danielle Still Haven’t Had Sex
“Our  sex life definitely needs to progress if we do want to stay married and  both of us will be happy,” Cody said. He insisted he was ready for  marriage, but admitted that both he and Danielle had things they needed  to work on if they were going to stay together.
In an effort to  turn up the romance, they headed on a romantic trip to Milwaukee. Cody  was optimistic this would get them out of their “rut,” but Danielle was  still worried Cody was going to try to push for more physical contact  than she was comfortable with (which, to be clear, was almost none). She  did seem mildly turned on watching him play pool – so that was  something.
They went to a brewery and bonded over booze. “We’ve  had mostly good times,” Danielle said. 
“Ninety percent of this has been good,” Cody  added. 
They tasted beers and even held hands! Later, during a walk,  they discussed their future. Then Cody brought up the fact that they  hadn’t had sex yet. Danielle was openly irritated. 
“It’s frustrating,”  she pointed out. 
“It’s tough,” Cody replied. “I don’t know how much  more I can really stand or how much I want to stand,” he added to the  camera. “With decision day right around the corner, maybe it’s just time  to call it quits.”
Tell Us: Should Cody and Danielle end their marriage?

This week is so sweet! In a preview for the Friday, July 21, episode of The Great British Baking Show, the six remaining bakers whip up their best desserts for the judges.
For the signature challenge, Tom, Selasi, Andrew, Jane, Benjamina and Candice are tasked with making roulade (a French sponge cake with filling that’s rolled into a spiral). “To have a nice spiral, that needs skill,” judge Mary Berry says. Judge Paul Hollywood reminds them, “It should melt in the mouth.”
The bakers also attempt to make marjolaine, a French layered cake, for the technical competition, and throw together 24 mini mousse cakes with two different flavors for the showstopper round.
It seems Tom is having some sort of a meltdown over his less-than-perfect dessert. “Breathe, breathe,” a woman can be heard saying while patting his back. 
For the most part, the judges appear to be impressed this week. “The actual filling is absolutely scrumptious,” Berry tells one contestant. Hollywood tells another baker, “You feel the bubbles burst in your mouth.” It’s hard to tell who they’re praising, but Benjamina and Jane are both seen smiling. 
There’s just a few episodes left until one baker wins the coveted cake stand and fans say goodbye to Berry and cohosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc. They decided to leave when the series moved from the BBC to Channel 4 in the U.K., and have been replaced by Prue Leith, Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding. 
The Great British Baking Show airs on PBS Fridays at 9 p.m. ET.

Time to move on. The Originals, which began as a spinoff of The Vampire Diaries, is ending after its fifth season, executive producer Julie Plec announced on Thursday, July 20.
The showrunner tweeted the news ahead of the series’ San Diego Comic-Con panel. “I’m packing my bags for Comic-Con, realizing it’s been a year since we announced the end of Vampire Diaries,” she wrote in a statement. "It feels only fitting to use this anniversary to make a second farewell announcement: This year, we invite you to help us say goodbye to The Originals, which begins shooting its fifth and final season on Monday.”
She continued that it’s both a “gift” and a “burden” to be in charge of ending of the beloved series, which follows Klaus Mikaelson (played by Joseph Morgan) and his family in New Orleans. "Many shows are not lucky enough to have a hand in deciding when the end has come. Being able to celebrate the completion of The Vampire Diaries was a joyful and deeply emotional ride, a luxury gifted by Mark Pedowitz at The CW and Peter Roth at WBTV, who, as TV fans themselves, know what it means when a fan is able to say a true goodbye,” she shared. "Ending a show is always bittersweet, but for me, it’s a true blessing to be a part of making that choice.”
Plec wants everyone who worked on The Originals to say a proper goodbye. "I want each actor to play their last scene as their character and to put their character to bed with grace and care. For each craftsman to take a final walk on the sets they built, the lights they’ve hung,” she wrote. "To choose the final song or score the final scene. To turn out the lights at the end of the day knowing that they can take a moment to be proud of all that they’ve created, and to say goodbye before they walk out the door for the last time. And I want the fans to be able to go along on that ride with us.”
She also hinted that it may not truly be the end for the vampires, and gave fans a glimmer of hope for another spinoff. “So please, join us at Comic-Con and as we move ahead with our final season of The Originals. Celebrate with us, cry with us, visit with us, watch us next spring when we air,” she concluded. “And know that in a show about an immortal family who believes in ‘Always and Forever,’ it’s never really the end of the story…”
The final season should be an exciting one! As previously reported, Candice King will be reprising her Vampire Diaries role as Caroline Forbes in the season 5 premiere of The Originals.

Joel is still a dreamboat. Parenthood costars Sam Jaeger and Erika Christensen went back to their Braverman roots this week thanks to his quick thinking.
The American Sniper actor, 40, decided to visit their characters' fictional home on the soundstage in L.A. on Tuesday, July 18. He took a video of himself walking through the living room and kitchen and sent it to his former TV wife.
Jaeger and the Ten Days in the Valley actress, 34, played Joel and Julia Graham, respectively, on the NBC series, which ran for six seasons from 2010 to 2015.

A post shared by Erika Christensen (@erikachristensen) on Jul 18, 2017 at 3:47pm PDT
“What?!” Jaeger exclaims in the clip. “It’s empty. But you know what? I can feel the love. I hope you’re doing well. Just tooling around Universal [Studios] today and I thought I’d come up to the old house! I love you.”
Christensen later shared the video on Instagram. “What, you didn't want to cry today? Sorry,” she wrote. “Just got this text from @samjaeger ... #parenthood #joelia."

Seacrest …back in! Ryan Seacrest announced on Thursday, July 20, that he will join ABC’s American Idol reboot as the show’s host. Check out everything you need to know about the revival of Idol in our video above!
Seacrest’s Live With Kelly and Ryan cohost, Kelly Ripa, helped him reveal the news on their Thursday morning show. “Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of American Idol!” Ripa, 46, said, to which Seacrest added: “I am so excited. It’s gonna be the best time.”
ABC announced in May that they are bringing back the beloved singing competition, which was originally on Fox. So far, the only confirmed celebrity to appear on the show is Katy Perry, who will serve as a judge. A source previously told Us that Idol alum Chris Daughtry will also join the judging panel.
Seacrest, who hosted the original Fox series from 2002 to 2016, recently addressed speculation that he would be returning to the hit talent competition and explained it would be difficult to host Live on the East Coast while also hosting Idol on the West Coast. “We haven’t gotten that far,” he said on Live in May. "This was news to me last week. I had said at the end of the series, 'Goodbye for now,’ hoping somewhere it would come back."
Although there has been some rumored contention between networks over the show’s reboot, Seacrest is excited to bring the series to his new network. "I believe ABC is the perfect home for Idol, and I’ve every confidence the show’s legions of fans will love it,” he said in a statement on Thursday. “Especially Idol's best traditions of showcasing heartwarming stories, remarkable talent discovery, and, best of all, making dreams come true.”
